1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,770
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,400
She cut his LVAD wire.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,200
Denny Duquette died at 7:42 this evening.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,610
I had a baby and I went soft.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,500
Your hand is fine,
and Shepherd will clear you for surgery.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,510
- Our marriage is over.
- Yeah, I guess it is.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,860
Who am I to you, George?

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,010
Am I your girlfriend?

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,490
Am I somebody you mess around with?

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,540
Can I buy you a drink, Callie?

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,680
Only if you have it delivered to
my hotel room, because I'm off to bed.

12
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,630
You are a great guy.

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,600
So it's Derek.

14
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,810
He's gonna hurt you again.

15
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,950
I'm walkin' away.

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,950
It's for you.
It's from Denny.

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,400
First, do no harm.

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,750
As doctors, we pledge to live by this oath.

19
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,390
But harm happens...

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,180
and then guilt happens.

21
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,950
And there's no oath for how to deal with that.

22
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:49,950
Morning.

23
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,480
I thought we were done
with the whole muffin thing.

24
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,970
This isn't muffins.

25
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,980
This is breakfast.

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,810
Mer needs a good, solid breakfast.

27
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,900
First day back after the big surgery.

28
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,760
Are you okay?

29
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,570
Of course I'm okay.

30
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,600
I'm a millionaire.

31
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,510
Fruit?

32
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,590
What do you guys think about B&Bs?

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,050
I'm thinking about opening a B&B in Vermont
where the foliage is, you know?

34
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,430
- Maybe you should go back to bed.
- Can't.

35
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,460
I'm going to the hospital.

36
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,540
- Are you gonna go talk to the chief?
- Nope.

37
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,450
Going to clean out my locker.

38
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,680
I could buy a hotel.

39
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,290
How much do you think a hotel costs?

40
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,660
- Ooh.
- Ooh. Izzie!

41
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,820
Is that...

42
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,770
That is $8 million.

43
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,500
$8 million does not like
to have juice spilled on it.

44
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,110
You have to take that to the bank today.

45
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,740
It's making me nervous in the house.

46
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,410
I will, as soon as I clean out my locker.

47
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,960
I am fine.

48
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,430
Really, I am fine.

49
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,970
Denny loved me.

50
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,380
He wanted me to have this money.

51
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,060
He wants me to be happy.

52
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,610
So I'm happy.

53
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,400
Juice?

54
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,840
She's losing it.

55
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,030
She almost battered and deep-fried
an $8½-million check this morning.

56
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,430
That kind of money, I'd buy my own hospital
and stock it full of sick people.

57
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,520
Valvuloplasties and ruptured aneurysms...

58
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,690
You're a psycho. You know that, right?

59
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,060
I'm not the one with an $8½-million
check I won't cash.

60
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,790
Stop talking about me.

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,340
I'm fine.

62
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,930
I am cleaning out my locker
and I am going home.

63
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,500
Mer is the one with the problems.

64
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,950
What's wrong with me?

65
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,280
Well, now you haven't told McDreamy
that you dumped McVet.

66
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,490
Oh, you haven't done that yet?

67
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,520
- Dude, tell him already.
- She's scared.

68
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,070
I am not scared.

69
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,390
Derek walked away.
He walked away.

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,740
And maybe that's a good thing.

71
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,150
I mean, maybe he's happier.

72
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,190
Maybe he's moved on.

73
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,070
He's got Addison here.
He's got Mark here.

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,960
He's got a lot to deal with.

75
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,760
And I'm not gonna make him feel guilty.

76
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,940
I mean, I am being an adult here.

77
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,180
And I am not going to drag him into our whole...

78
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,110
Izzie is the one with the big check.

79
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,620
I'm fine.

80
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,120
Guilt never goes anywhere on its own.

81
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,640
It brings its friends doubt and insecurity.

82
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,060
Is that your boyfriend again?

83
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,410
I do not have a boyfriend.

84
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,940
Then why the guilty face?

85
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,760
You were sexier when you weren't talking.

86
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,270
Am I keeping you, O'Malley?

87
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,700
M&M in 15 minutes, people.

88
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,850
Wait, wait, wait.

89
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,730
We get to go to M&M?

90
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,680
- Even if we haven't finished our rounds?
- Even if.

91
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,730
- I want all of you at the M&M today.
- Yes!

92
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,510
People die in this hospital on our watch.

93
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,390
Once a month, we meet to discuss how our actions
as physicians contributed to the deaths.

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,010
This is a serious exercise.

95
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,530
Dr. Bailey.

96
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,620
George, Alex, you guys get good seats.

97
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,050
- Mer and I will get snacks.
- Yeah.

98
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,490
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Niles.

99
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,350
We kinda got turned around
on our way to admitting.

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Oh, oh, not a problem.
Dr. Karev,

101
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,120
uh, Mrs. Niles is scheduled
for a mastectomy tomorrow.

102
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,610
Uh, why don't you show her
and her husband up to the fifth floor?

103
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,500
Is this the little man?

104
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,320
He is adorable.

105
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,560
He's not so adorable at 4:00 in the morning
when he's screaming and won't take a bottle.

106
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,410
Can we just get to the room?

107
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,050
It's been kind of a rough week.

108
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,030
She had to stop nursing.

109
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,370
- Gus here just won't eat.
- Here.

110
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,050
Why don't I take you up?

111
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,120
- There you go.
- Yeah.

112
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:14,410
You know, you can try a little sugar water
on the bottle, just until he gets used to it.

113
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,260
Does that woman have breast cancer?

114
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,600
What is she, 30 years old?

115
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,900
It's a new baby.

116
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,470
Probably thought the lump was a milk duct.

117
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,750
Hmm?

118
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,340
You learn things on the vagina squad.

119
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,780
Okay, yeah, focus, people.

120
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,730
M&M.

121
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,190
Insults flying, residents covering their asses,
our bosses getting kicked in the teeth instead of us.

122
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,220
- Seats. Snacks.
- Yeah.

123
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,880
Hey.

124
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,660
I didn't know you were coming to the M&M.

125
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,120
You brought snacks?

126
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,040
Well... yeah?

127
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,490
- You okay?
- Fine.

128
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,220
Hey, no surgeries today, right?

129
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,420
- I mean, I'm ready if you need me.
- No.

130
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,780
No surgeries.

131
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,260
Callie.

132
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,690
Hey.

133
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,080
Hi.

134
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,260
Did you get my message...

135
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,290
my messages?

136
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,590
Yeah. I gotta get a seat.

137
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,710
Alex is saving us a bunch
if you want to sit with us.

138
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,540
No.

139
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,850
She's trying to make me feel guilty
about the other night, about the Izzie thing.

140
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,800
- I thought you said you apologized already?
- I did.

141
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,370
I have.

142
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,170
I'm done.

143
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,180
I am not apologizing anymore.

144
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,330
I'm enjoying life.

145
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,670
I'm loving the M&M.

146
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,290
Okay, people, let's begin.

147
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:43,180
Patient 34986 died last month from
complications following a heart transplant.

148
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,160
Dr. Burke will present.

149
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,470
Guys...

150
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,920
- Isn't patient 34986...
- Denny.

151
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,760
$8 million...

152
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,970
$8 million could get us on a plane
to somewhere far, far away.

153
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,880
Cause of death at autopsy was an embolus that
dislodged from the suture line of the transplant

154
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,010
and caused a CVA with brain stem herniation.

155
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,880
So the company line is that he died of a CVA?

156
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,310
There's no company line.
That's what he died of.

157
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,710
Uh, yes, let's get back to this, uh,
patient's need for an emergent transplant.

158
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,020
You're saying that his left ventricle
had been weakened by the LVAD malfunction?

159
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,260
His left ventricle was weakened by the fact
that he suffered from congestive heart failure.

160
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,710
Oh, come on, Dr. Burke.

161
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,190
We all know the LVAD was cut by an intern.

162
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,930
Oh, I'm going to my happy place.

163
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,750
The exact chain of events remain unclear.

164
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,560
It remains unclear to you because
you were in the ER with a gunshot wound.

165
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,950
Why aren't we hearing from Dr. Bailey?

166
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,680
She was the senior physician on the case.

167
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,400
I am the attending on record.

168
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,280
Yes,

169
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,650
I was the resident in charge.

170
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,770
Dr. Burke has summarized
the medical facts of this case.

171
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,930
Are there any questions for me?

172
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:41,031
3x05:
Oh, The Guilt

173
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,850
You recently had a baby, Dr. Bailey?

174
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,700
I don't see what that has to do with...

175
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,430
- Sleep deprivation coupled with
wild swings in hormone levels

176
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,470
are factors that could cloud
anyone's judgment.

177
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,580
I sleep just fine, Dr. Savoy.

178
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,510
Really?

179
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,540
'Cause if a patient died
due to my poor decision making,

180
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,440
I'd probably lose
at least a little sleep over it.

181
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,370
Let me remind everyone that our
purpose here is not to place blame.

182
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,640
This is a forum to discuss mistakes
in patient care and learn from them.

183
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,520
Well, so far, I haven't heard
Dr. Bailey admit to a mistake.

184
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,300
Why don't they just put a bullet
in the back of her head?

185
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,850
It would be more humane.

186
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,320
So, for a period of several hours,
your interns were running amok in the hospital,

187
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,590
totally unsupervised.

188
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,930
I'm waiting for a question.

189
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,450
The question is, where were you?

190
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,670
There was the shooting,
and the ER was chaotic.

191
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,930
ER is always chaotic.

192
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,690
Did you page them during this time?

193
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,830
Yes, I paged them multiple times.

194
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,470
Well, apparently, they thought
it was okay to ignore your pages.

195
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,620
Doctor, why do you think your interns
have such contempt for your authority?

196
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,840
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

197
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,720
Dr. Karev, sit down.

198
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,180
Izzie.

199
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,330
Next question.

200
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,800
Derek says that neither of you brought
any assets into the marriage.

201
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,710
Well, I had my trust fund
and a sparkling personality.

202
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,590
And the futon couch.

203
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,560
Yes, Addison had a very ugly,
very heavy futon couch.

204
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,100
What ever happened to that couch?

205
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,530
I gave it to Mark.

206
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,400
- She can have him.
- I don't want him.

207
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,960
Okay, well, that's settled.
What else?

208
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,560
So, aside from Addison's trust fund,
which remains in her name,

209
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,060
you'll split everything, stocks,
bonds, 401Ks, down the middle.

210
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,840
The only that gets a little
complicated is the real estate.

211
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,880
Let me make this, uh, simple.

212
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,530
I'd like to keep my trailer
and the land in Seattle.

213
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,130
Addison can have the rest.

214
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,110
Hold on.

215
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,230
That's the house in the Hamptons and
the brownstone overlooking Central Park?

216
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,650
- That's very generous, Dr. Shepherd.
- Thank you.

217
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,760
Hold on.

218
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,600
- He's up to something.
- No, I'm not.

219
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,120
I came here to fight over CDs and books,
go to war over a crystal vase.

220
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,080
What are you up to, Derek?

221
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,210
The divorce is my fault.

222
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,440
Let me take responsibility.

223
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,570
We both had affairs.

224
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,240
You had a one-night stand with Mark.

225
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,650
Derek, actually...

226
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,120
- Well, it was...
- Okay, it was two nights.

227
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,570
You made a mistake.

228
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,550
Meredith and I, we had a relationship.

229
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,450
Make these changes, and I'll sign it today.

230
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,330
You weren't supposed to be in here, Izzie.

231
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,120
You shouldn't have had to see that.

232
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,160
No, it's fine.

233
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm fine.

234
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,390
Clearly the doctor thing
was not working for me.

235
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,670
So go about your business.

236
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,740
Run labs, cure cancer.
I'm fine.

237
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,450
You're not going home.

238
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,370
Either you hang out with us
or we'll call your mother.

239
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,040
She's just a few hours away, and I'm sure she
wouldn't mind coming and staying with you all day.

240
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,370
You wouldn't.

241
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,890
- Dialing.
- Whoa, hey, hey! Okay.

242
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,620
I'll just...

243
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,800
go hang out in the locker room.

244
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,160
What is she doing here?

245
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,770
She has no business in this room.

246
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,790
What are you looking at me for?

247
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,000
I didn't have anything to do with this.

248
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,330
I didn't have anything to do
with any of this.

249
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,610
I'll stay with her today, if that's okay.

250
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,410
I'll update charts and I'll run labs
and just keep an eye on her, if that's okay.

251
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,510
She shouldn't be alone.

252
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,550
Fine.

253
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,040
Dr. Bailey...

254
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,820
We just wanna say,
we're really sorry about the M&M.

255
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,940
No, you do not get
to apologize to me for this.

256
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,690
You do not get to feel better.

257
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,590
Neither do I.

258
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,670
Get to work.

259
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,400
O'Malley, just keep an eye on her.

260
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,370
Yes, Dr. Bailey.

261
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,140
Dr. Bailey, you understand,
it's nothing personal.

262
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,910
People talking about your hormone levels
starts feeling pretty personal.

263
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,490
Hey, Dr. Bailey.

264
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,100
Look, you're the baby whisperer.
Gus here drank the whole bottle.

265
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,530
Here, you want to hold him?

266
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,940
Uh, actually now isn't a good time.

267
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,140
I'm about to go and get your wife's labs.

268
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,010
Oh, yeah.

269
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,610
Do you, uh, think you could talk to her?

270
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,450
She's kind of freaking out.

271
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,050
She's not too sure about the mastectomy.

272
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,190
She's thinking maybe a lumpectomy.

273
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,980
I know she likes you.

274
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,820
- Maybe you could talk her into...
- Oh, no, no.

275
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,170
It's not my job to talk her into anything.

276
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,760
Maybe if she knew more about
her reconstructive options...

277
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,820
Um, I'll send our plastic surgeon up.

278
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,630
Hey, chief.

279
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,340
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

280
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,170
- Quite a morning, huh?
- It was.

281
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,170
It's always good to be reminded how
important it is to be at the top of your game.

282
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,580
That's actually what I wanted
to talk to you about.

283
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,020
I am so glad you are back in this building.

284
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,230
I need your help focusing the staff.

285
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,560
They respond to you as an authority figure.

286
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,240
I mean, you're an example
of what they should be:

287
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,710
a leader.

288
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,010
I'm glad to have you back, Preston.

289
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,760
Thank you, chief.

290
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,700
You're back.

291
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,650
I am.

292
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,720
You look, uh, good without an appendix.
It suits you.

293
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,320
How are you?

294
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,430
Fine.

295
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,220
How are you?

296
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,640
I'm great.

297
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,710
Feeling well? No pain?

298
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,180
No pain.

299
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,190
That's your wife.

300
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,420
I'm on her service.

301
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,630
Oh. Okay, then.

302
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,760
I won't stand in your way.

303
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,520
Okay.

304
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,260
Hi. I was paged by Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.

305
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,880
Dr. Grey.

306
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,450
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

307
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,820
And, uh, it's just Montgomery now.

308
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,050
- What?
- My name.

309
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,970
The divorce was finalized this morning.

310
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,030
So...

311
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,570
Montgomery.

312
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,180
To add to our fun,
we've been asked to consult on a case

313
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,020
where a woman has a foreign object
stuck inside of her.

314
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,500
It hurts whenever you move.

315
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,730
Well, then keep your weight off my bad knee.

316
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,740
I'm sorry.

317
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,640
I thought it was on the left side.

318
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,150
19 years of marriage,
you'd think you'd have that one down.

319
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,170
It appears that her husband is the foreign object.

320
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,670
- Ex-husband.
- Ex-husband.

321
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,920
You had to go and get a piercing.

322
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,580
- Sonja.
- What?

323
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,420
It's not like they're not going to find out.

324
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,410
This is so embarrassing.

325
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:53,280
No. Embarrassing is meeting your husband
for lunch with your ex-husband still attached.

326
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,740
How long is this gonna take?

327
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,030
Because I really don't want
my husband finding out.

328
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,980
Please, could you work out
some small miracle?

329
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,070
Well, first of all, we have to figure out
what the piercing is caught on.

330
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:04,940
Okay.

331
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,630
Do you have any piercings?

332
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,960
Me? No!

333
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,550
I'm sorry.

334
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,210
I sell real estate.

335
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,730
What is that supposed to mean?

336
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,730
I sell real estate, too.

337
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,940
We've been divorced for five years.

338
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:24,030
But we keep running into each other.
You know, work stuff.

339
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,810
We get together sometimes.

340
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,250
It's stupid and weak,
and it is never happening again.

341
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,920
Okay, well, Dr. Grey is going to
check on the X-rays, and then...

342
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,820
then we'll take it from there, okay?

343
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,040
But, um, you...

344
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,890
you might want to cancel your lunch plans.

345
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,540
Hey.

346
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,760
- That M&M was...
- Yeah.

347
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,610
I went to tell the chief...

348
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,890
about my hand.

349
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,760
Burke, how...

350
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,980
But I couldn't.

351
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,790
I...

352
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,480
I don't know what I'm going to do.

353
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,650
Well, I-I can be there
if you need me in surgery.

354
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,240
I'm not going to do any surgeries.

355
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,380
I'm gonna catch up on paperwork.

356
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,850
Wait, so...
so what does that mean?

357
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,220
I don't know.

358
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,360
I don't know what I'm going to do.

359
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,920
I need time to think.

360
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,710
I have...

361
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,990
paperwork.

362
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,840
I need to do paperwork.

363
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,500
I know how the rumor mill
works around here, George, okay?

364
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,810
I'm the crazy intern, and now I'm the crazy
intern whose friends have to babysit her.

365
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,680
You know, what we should talk about is
what you're gonna do with all

366
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,810
that money once you deposit the check
after we don't let you destroy it.

367
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,490
Don't move, Adam.

368
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,740
I'm not moving.

369
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,620
- Are those people having sex?
- Just lay still.

370
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,680
They were having sex.
Now they're just fighting.

371
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,580
Good to have you back, Stevens.

372
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,190
I'm not back.

373
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,960
I'm fine, just not back.

374
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,110
Hey, you're Addison Forbes
Montgomery-Shepherd.

375
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,280
That's a lot of names,
a lot of rich sounding names.

376
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,450
You're rich, right?

377
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,240
Oh, that's rude.
That's a rude question. I'm sorry.

378
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,240
It's just that I'm rich now, too.

379
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,970
You're not rich until you deposit the check.

380
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,230
- Do you ever feel guilty?
- I'm sorry?

381
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,300
Being rich.

382
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,050
'Cause I have all this money now,

383
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,530
and I don't really feel like
I did anything to deserve it,

384
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,920
and I can't really talk to my friends
about it 'cause they're all so poor.

385
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,680
Standing right here, Izzie.

386
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,540
Deposit the check, Stevens.

387
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,350
Just start there, okay?

388
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,080
And, um, the guilt will work itself out.

389
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,480
Hey.

390
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,810
You're everywhere.

391
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,850
Well, I'm sorry.

392
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,350
For once, it was actually not on purpose.

393
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:52,130
Do these look blurry to you?

394
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,460
What exactly am I looking at?

395
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,840
A divorced couple
who got stuck together during...

396
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,090
Oh, wow.
That's gotta be pretty awkward.

397
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,670
Yeah. Divorced five years,
and still going at it like teens at the prom.

398
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,040
So to speak.

399
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,380
Speaking of divorce...

400
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,110
I heard because I'm working with your wife.

401
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Ex-wife.

402
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,710
It was time.

403
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,220
Good.

404
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,360
How's Finn?

405
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,550
Finn is...

406
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,190
fine.

407
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,190
Good.

408
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,700
You're right. They're blurry.

409
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,930
You should get some new ones.

410
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,030
If you go ahead with the mastectomy,
there are several reconstructive options.

411
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:46,180
Saline implants are used most often,
but silicone has a more natural look and feel.

412
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,280
I can't deal with this right now.

413
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,610
Diana, come on.

414
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,580
It'll take two seconds, huh?

415
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,150
You're the one who has to feel them,
so you decide.

416
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,180
I don't care.

417
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,670
- Dude, believe me, you care.
- Dr. Karev.

418
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,170
Dude, he's right.

419
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,060
You care.

420
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,840
Dr. Bailey?

421
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,880
What's wrong with my wife?

422
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,940
I'm... sorry.

423
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,110
Uh, as you know,
she has stage IIb breast cancer.

424
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,610
I know that.

425
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,360
Will you please tell me what's wrong with her?

426
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,210
- Mr. Niles...
- 'Cause she won't.

427
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,060
She won't talk to me.

428
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,270
I've tried, and I'm trying.

429
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,530
And I know this sucks,
and it's scary, but we can do this.

430
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,020
We can fight this.
But she won't.

431
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,550
She won't even look at Gus.

432
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,290
She won't hold him,
and all he wants is his mom.

433
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,300
It's just...

434
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,760
She's such a good mom.

435
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,410
I know it doesn't seem like that,
but she is.

436
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,280
Okay, I can schedule a psych consult.

437
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,330
I don't want a psych consult.

438
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,290
I just want my wife back.

439
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,530
Please.

440
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,900
Now she's talking crazy, how she might
not have the surgery at all.

441
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,930
Mr. Niles...

442
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,550
Can you please tell her
that she has to have the surgery?

443
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,870
Please.

444
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,500
Somebody has to tell her.

445
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,860
I did this for you, you know?

446
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,100
You know, you have got to stop
doing things for me.

447
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,790
I'm with Tom now.

448
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,160
I love Tom.

449
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,090
I still can't believe you left me for that guy.

450
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,480
Wh-what does Tom have that I don't?

451
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,070
- Well, he doesn't have a pierced...
- You two need to stay completely still

452
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,350
so that we can get a clear picture.

453
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,650
We fought through 19 years of marriage.

454
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,080
The only time we didn't fight
was when we were having sex.

455
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,960
That's not true.

456
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,920
- I still love you.
- Okay, I-I'm in hell.

457
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,340
Mom?

458
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,320
Dad?!

459
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,820
Scratch that.
Now I'm in hell.

460
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,190
Jennifer, maybe you want to go wait in the...

461
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,560
You guys are so paying for
my therapy and my rent...

462
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,670
and a new car.

463
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,620
- Of course, sweetie.
- Oh, go ahead.

464
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,800
Coddle her.

465
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,590
You are old enough to know that your parents

466
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,030
are sexual beings
and that they make mistakes.

467
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,500
Oh, is that what you call this, mom,
a mistake?

468
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,360
Because I call this
you, once again, being a slut.

469
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,220
Hey!
You don't talk to me like that.

470
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,300
I am your mother!

471
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,400
Yeah, and what a great role model
you've turned out to be.

472
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,200
Look at you...

473
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,870
cheating on your husband
with your ex-husband. God!

474
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,860
And, daddy, what are you doing?
I thought...

475
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,210
I thought you had finally moved on.

476
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,310
You said you were gonna start dating.

477
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,180
It's complicated, honey.

478
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,890
Well, it seems that your IUD

479
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,510
has dislodged from your uterus, hooked on

480
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,720
to your husband's piercing and
is embedded in your vaginal wall.

481
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,120
Did she say "piercing"?

482
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,910
Daughter.

483
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,440
Perfect.

484
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,310
- Hey.
- Hey.

485
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,550
- So, who got the brownstone?
- You heard?

486
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,670
People talk around here.
I listen.

487
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,440
- Who got the brownstone?
- It's none of your business.

488
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,040
I left my bike in the basement.

489
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,960
I just want to know
who to talk to to get it back.

490
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,450
Buy a new bike.

491
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,740
You know, this angry divorcée thing
really turns me on.

492
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,180
I got the brownstone.

493
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,410
And you'll get your bike back when you

494
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,780
come to your senses and go back home.

495
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,860
Derek took the Hamptons?

496
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,990
Derek hates the Hamptons.

497
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,180
Derek gave you the Hamptons, too?

498
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,690
He still doesn't know
the whole story, does he?

499
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,520
No.

500
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,460
And as long as you don't tell him,
you get to be the good guy,

501
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,910
and I'm just the chump who seduced
his wife for the hell of it.

502
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,230
Real fair.

503
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,310
I think I'm gonna buy something
for Bailey and for Burke.

504
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,550
What do you think Burke would want?

505
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,710
- Nothing you can get with money.
- He likes jazz.

506
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,140
I'm not buying him a CD, George.
I'm a multimillionaire.

507
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,280
I need to buy him something...

508
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,730
big.

509
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,010
A house...

510
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,110
in the Bahamas.

511
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,370
I'd buy the Bahamas, or at least a Bahama.

512
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,330
An island.

513
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,210
You know, for $8 million, I'd buy an island.

514
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,330
Oh, you're an intern.

515
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,800
When would you have time
to go to your Bahama?

516
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,860
- I'd quit.
- Oh, no, you wouldn't.

517
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,410
You're a surgeon. You operate.
That's what you do.

518
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,920
Sorry.

519
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,870
What?

520
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,440
It's fine.

521
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm fine.

522
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,810
I am not a surgeon.

523
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,750
My patient? 30 year old
with advanced breast cancer.

524
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:29,010
I say live your life
while you can in the Bahamas.

525
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,290
Have you told Derek yet
that you broke up with Finn?

526
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,570
- I'm giving him time.
- That's stupid.

527
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:36,490
You know, what's stupid
is carrying around a check for $8 million.

528
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,100
I'm fine.

529
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,300
The check is fine.

530
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,620
We're all fine, okay?

531
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,840
I slept with another guy.

532
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,170
Do I tell George?

533
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,320
I, um...

534
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,910
broke up with Finn.

535
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,220
Do I tell Derek?

536
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,660
I can't tell Derek.

537
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,890
I have to tell George.

538
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,430
Honey, please, at least hold Gus.

539
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,410
- No, don't...
- Stop it.

540
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,040
- Will you at least talk to me?
- I want you to leave me alone.

541
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,090
You took a lot of hits today at that M&M.

542
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,480
Some of 'em justified, some of 'em not.

543
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,360
Compassion and empathy
are a big part of the job.

544
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,750
Look, I don't care what Savoy said,

545
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,790
and I know I haven't always been supportive,

546
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:58,120
but being a parent makes you a better doctor.

547
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,610
Hi.

548
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,150
I just...

549
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,090
wanted to say hi.

550
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,240
Denny left me $8 million.
$8.7 million to be exact.

551
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,010
Did you know that he had money?
'Cause I didn't know.

552
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,990
No, I didn't know.

553
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,780
I'm thinking about using it to travel,

554
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,780
maybe go to Italy.
I've never been there before.

555
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,600
- I hear Venice is amazing.
- Izzie...

556
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,970
I'm fine.

557
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,400
Really, I am. I'm fine.

558
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,150
Everyone thinks I'm not.
Everyone thinks I'm...

559
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,230
But I'm fine.

560
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,610
You're fine.

561
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,690
I'm fine.

562
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,050
Everything's fine.

563
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,840
- So...
- I got shot.

564
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,280
I got shot because I was coming back to the

565
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,810
hospital to check on Denny.
Because you told me to.

566
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,080
I'm not fine.

567
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,790
Denny asked you to marry him,
and now he is dead.

568
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,760
You're not fine.

569
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,700
Don't come in here and...

570
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,430
Just...

571
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,740
We're not fine.

572
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,040
I'm sorry.

573
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,130
We were friends.

574
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,460
You were my boss, but...

575
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,820
I think we were friends, too.

576
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,270
And-and I never meant...

577
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,810
for anyone to get hurt.

578
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,360
And I know there is nothing
I can do to take it back.

579
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,320
No.

580
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,800
Preston, please...

581
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,430
You quit.

582
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,850
You quit being a surgeon.

583
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,050
You have two good hands...

584
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,680
and you aren't using them.

585
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,790
Feel guilty about that.

586
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,750
Sonja, quit grabbing my leg.

587
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,360
I am not grabbing you anywhere.
She is.

588
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,970
Mr. Morris, we need to position you
correctly in order to get a clear image.

589
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,120
Dr. Yang, move him a little to the left.

590
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,110
Hey, what are you doing here?

591
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,290
Oh, I heard about it.

592
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,030
I had to see it.

593
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,130
And I've seen enough.

594
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,230
Dr. Yang, I need you to lift him
a little as you pull him.

595
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,680
Trying.

596
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,880
Now lift his right leg 20 degrees.

597
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,690
Oww! Pain!

598
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,100
Freeze!
Hold that position.

599
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,570
Okay, now, Dr. Grey, can you kind of slowly

600
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,870
swirl Mrs. Kellman in a
counterclockwise direction?

601
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,950
Swirl?

602
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,830
- Swirl?
- Swirl.

603
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,180
Swirl.

604
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,440
Oh, my God, Sonja.

605
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,310
Oh, God, Adam.
Not now!

606
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,670
Careful. Careful!

607
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,250
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

608
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,010
Grey, Yang, on the count of three,

609
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,750
I want you to slowly,
gently pull them apart.

610
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,880
One, two, three.

611
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,970
- Oh, okay, he's having a...
- Sonja!

612
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,110
- Heart attack!
- He's having a heart attack!

613
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,310
Oh, thank God.
I mean, code blue!

614
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,670
He's tearing through his aorta.

615
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,960
We need to get him to an OR now.
He's going to die.

616
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:32,561
- Who's the cardiothoracic surgeon on call?
- Dr. Harrison, but he's in the middle of surgery.

617
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,360
- Where's Burke?

618
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:36,361
He's in the conference room,
but he's not on the board yet.

619
00:28:36,462 --> 00:28:37,562
Well, he is now.

620
00:28:37,563 --> 00:28:39,563
Notify the OR.
Let's move, people.

621
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:40,664
Come on, go, go, go!

622
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,170
How do we do this?

623
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,400
- You stand on my right side.
- On your right side.

624
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,960
- And if at any time during the procedure...
- If you tremor...

625
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,110
I'll look at you.

626
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,650
You'll know to slide in to do
the sutures we've practiced.

627
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,710
What if one of the scrub nurses notices?

628
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,640
What if they say something?

629
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,840
Cristina, I can't walk away
from this surgery.

630
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,730
If I do, that man in there will die.

631
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,830
So tremor or no tremor, I have to try.

632
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,830
- But you...
- I'm your intern.

633
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,530
I will be there on your right side.

634
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,300
10 blade.

635
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,760
As soon as we hear something
about your ex-husband,

636
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,750
we'll let you know.

637
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,730
Since I removed your IUD,

638
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,800
you may want to use a backup method.

639
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:00,570
Oh, I doubt I'll be having sex
anytime soon once I tell Tom.

640
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,350
You're...

641
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,850
you're gonna tell your husband?

642
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,740
You know, the first time it happened,

643
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,250
I felt so guilty, and I wasn't gonna tell Tom

644
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,820
because it was never gonna happen again.

645
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,530
And then it happened again...
and again.

646
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:24,220
And then somewhere along the way,
I just stopped feeling guilty.

647
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,450
Yeah...

648
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,630
I'm gonna tell my husband.

649
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,010
I think the truth just has
to come out, you know?

650
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,700
Dr. Burke, I know it's a lot to ask,

651
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:05,000
but I would really appreciate if you'd
let me try my running whip stitch.

652
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,000
All right, take a good bite.

653
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,770
You want to make sure it holds.

654
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:17,910
Good.

655
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,810
Don't put too much pressure.

656
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,800
There.

657
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,120
Keep going.

658
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,270
Oh, my God.

659
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,910
Cristina's doing a running whip stitch on a heart.

660
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,910
I guess sleeping with your boss has its perks.

661
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,060
This sucks.

662
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,490
Cristina gets sex and perks.

663
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,310
Maybe you should just apologize again, George.

664
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,900
Yeah, 'cause you're in a great position
to give relationship advice.

665
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,420
Cristina's doing a running whip stitch on a heart.

666
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,440
I don't feel like talking.

667
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,310
When I'm driving home at night
after a long day at work,

668
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,230
all I can think about is getting to my baby.

669
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,400
If this is where you tell me
to fight the cancer

670
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,320
so I don't miss out
on the joys of motherhood...

671
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,410
- Then I get home,...

672
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,010
the baby's crying,...

673
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,960
the exhaustion hits,
and I resent that tiny baby's

674
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:34,060
presence in my house,
my previously very quiet house.

675
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,810
Why are you telling me this?

676
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,960
So you know what I do?

677
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,060
First, I pick a fight
with my husband, you know,

678
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,310
blame him for not settling the baby down,

679
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,800
then I bitch about
the neighbors' loud music.

680
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:54,660
And if I'm really tired and pissed off...

681
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,940
I blame the baby.

682
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,480
I mean, if you hadn't been breast-feeding,

683
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:07,500
you never would've thought
the lump was a clogged milk duct.

684
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,110
You would've gone to the doctor
as soon as you felt it,

685
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,350
the cancer wouldn't have gotten this far,

686
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,710
and you wouldn't be here
making this decision.

687
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,140
Am I close?

688
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,160
What kind of mother
blames her own baby for her cancer?

689
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,650
A mother who's human.

690
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,550
A mother who's overwhelmed.

691
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,370
But if this is gonna kill me eventually,

692
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,240
wouldn't it be easier
if it happened when Gus was little?

693
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,290
Wouldn't it be easier for him
if I just never existed?

694
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,390
Okay. Shh.

695
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:53,090
Now this is the part
when I tell you to fight the cancer

696
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,430
so that you don't miss out
on the joys of motherhood.

697
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,070
- Derek.
- Yeah.

698
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,140
Hey, you know what I like?

699
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,820
I like that we're civilized.

700
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,150
We're these adult, grown-up people
who can be divorced and friendly.

701
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,750
We deserve a medal.

702
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,790
- It wasn't a one-night stand.
- What?

703
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,700
Mark and I...

704
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,730
it wasn't a one-night stand.
I was in love with him.

705
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,710
Or...
at least, I thought I was.

706
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,610
After you left,
we lived together for two months.

707
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,740
I wanted to believe
that we could make it work,

708
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,050
that I hadn't thrown my marriage away,

709
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,900
that I hadn't thrown
my life away on a fling.

710
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,080
But he's Mark, and, well...

711
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,320
I caught him with someone else, and...

712
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,680
and then Richard called...

713
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,510
We both had relationships with other people.

714
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,850
We're both equally liable for everything,

715
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,930
so please take the brownstone.

716
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,710
All I want is Seattle.

717
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:55,560
I want Seattle,
and I want never to see you again.

718
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,990
You're here.

719
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:23,430
You're everywhere, and I can't not tell you.

720
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,900
You know, I've been...

721
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,290
not telling you all day
because I thought it was kind,

722
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,770
and I thought I was giving you space.

723
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,010
But I can't not tell you

724
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,400
because you're here and you're you and...

725
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,190
I broke up with Finn.

726
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,550
Okay.

727
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,870
Okay...

728
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,920
then.

729
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,270
Okay.

730
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,510
I told you.

731
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,290
Yeah.

732
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,090
The operation was successful.

733
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,520
- The next 24 to 48 hours are really critical, but...
- We expect your father to make a full recovery.

734
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,410
Thank you so much, Dr. Burke.

735
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,420
First, do no harm.

736
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,370
Easier said than done.

737
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:33,330
We can take all the oaths in the world,
but the fact is...

738
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,670
most of us do harm all the time.

739
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,570
I have $8 million.

740
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,870
So I've heard.

741
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,690
I can...

742
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:51,090
- do anything I want.
- Just about.

743
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:56,820
And all I really want to do
is a running whip stitch.

744
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:03,240
My first year as an intern,
I had a stable cardiac patient

745
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,660
who blew out his lung
while I was transporting him to CT.

746
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,080
I called in the code.

747
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:11,020
By the time everyone got there, he was dead.

748
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,700
If I had put a chest tube in right away...

749
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,530
You made a mistake.

750
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,350
But I stayed.

751
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,030
I worked.

752
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,080
I learned.

753
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,860
I never made that mistake again.

754
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:34,410
If I had quit,
all I would have had was that life...

755
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,940
that I lost.

756
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:42,150
Instead, I get to save lives.

757
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:46,670
Every day, I get to save lives.

758
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,880
Sometimes even when we're trying to help...

759
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,200
we do more harm than good.

760
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,970
She told you.

761
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,190
I've known you my whole life.

762
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,410
I grew up with you,
so I know what you're thinking.

763
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,050
That there is a year of your life wasted,...

764
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,210
trying to make it work with Addison
when you could've been with Meredith,

765
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,090
that you could be happy right now,
that all this...

766
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,180
everything...

767
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,620
That you and Meredith could've had a real chance.

768
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,720
Still...

769
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,160
I thought you should know the truth.

770
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,510
I thought I owed you that...

771
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,030
as a friend.

772
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,290
You're not my friend.

773
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,500
And then the guilt rears its ugly head.

774
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,500
What you do with that guilt is up to you.

775
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,760
Babysitting, Dr. Bailey?

776
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,140
That's right.

777
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,870
I'm babysitting.

778
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,380
I'm being all unprofessional
and emotionally involved while

779
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,210
my patient and her husband
are having a moment together.

780
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,560
Oh, you might want to leave now.

781
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,210
I'm feeling a rush of hormones coming on.

782
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,560
There's no telling what I might do.

783
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,800
How's it going in there?

784
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,280
I think they're leaning
towards a mastectomy.

785
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,810
Well, that's good.

786
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,620
Uh, about Izzie...

787
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,460
- I didn't do anything.
- I know, Karev.

788
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,650
You didn't do anything.
You weren't even here.

789
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,750
No, listen...

790
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,710
I knew.

791
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,740
Izzie told me what she was gonna do,
but I didn't want to get involved.

792
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,120
I didn't do anything.

793
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,430
I didn't do anything to stop her.

794
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,220
You weren't the only one.

795
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,790
Alex.

796
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,190
Thank you.

797
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,760
We're left with a choice.

798
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,500
I got fried chicken, extra crispy,...

799
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:23,240
coleslaw, peach cobbler,
"Beetle Jump", and...

800
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,410
"Samurai Ambush."

801
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,450
The other night, when I told you
I was done trying to compete?

802
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,760
That was me breaking up with you.

803
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,340
No.

804
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,560
No, I think I would've noticed that.

805
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,320
Except you didn't.

806
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,580
Which is why I broke up with you.

807
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,320
At least now you don't have
to feel guilty anymore.

808
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,230
Shut up.

809
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,380
Either let the guilt throw you back
into the behavior

810
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,190
that got you into trouble in the first place...

811
00:41:02,591 --> 00:41:03,391
...or...

812
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:10,340
...learn from the guilt
and do your best to move on.

813
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,200
Are you seriously not going to deposit that check?

814
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,980
Some good needs to come from this money.

815
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:25,180
And until I know what that good is,
no, I'm not depositing the check.
