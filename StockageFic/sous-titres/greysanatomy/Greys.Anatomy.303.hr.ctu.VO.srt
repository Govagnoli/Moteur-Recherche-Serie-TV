1
00:00:00,235 --> 00:00:01,973
Previously on
"Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,984 --> 00:00:02,599
You're shot?

3
00:00:03,032 --> 00:00:03,557
Christina?

4
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:04,408
You're throwing me out?

5
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:05,336
Got no choice.

6
00:00:05,488 --> 00:00:06,738
What's with the suitcase?

7
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:09,621
Yes. My answer is yes.

8
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:10,467
An hour ago,

9
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:11,748
he was proposing.

10
00:00:11,797 --> 00:00:12,753
I thought l was a surgeon,

11
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,641
but l am not.

12
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:16,128
I stopped teaching when you
needed a teacher the most.

13
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:17,272
Our marriage is over.

14
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:20,780
There's this thing that allows
for the considering of options.

15
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:21,481
In the olden days,

16
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:22,433
they called it dating.

17
00:00:22,465 --> 00:00:23,210
You bowing out?

18
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:25,391
No. You?

19
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:28,151
I don't think so.

20
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:34,221
Surgeons usually fantasize about
wild and improbable surgeries--

21
00:00:34,856 --> 00:00:36,651
<I>someone collapses
in a restaurant,

22
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:38,921
we slice them open
with a butter knife,

23
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,902
replace a valve with a
hollowed-out stick of carrot.

24
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:45,670
<I>But every now and then,

25
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:48,492
some other kind of
fantasy slips in.

26
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:52,893
Good morning.

27
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:54,352
Good morning.

28
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,333
Good morning.

29
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:04,600
It is a good morning.

30
00:01:06,186 --> 00:01:06,432
Hi.

31
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,831
Hi.

32
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:15,443
Did you get any
sleep last night?

33
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:17,123
Not really.

34
00:01:17,796 --> 00:01:19,040
You want to get some now?

35
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:22,090
Not really.

36
00:01:30,616 --> 00:01:30,942
Ow !

37
00:01:32,948 --> 00:01:35,791
Most of our fantasies
dissolve when we wake,

38
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:37,932
banished to the
back of our mind.

39
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:40,703
But sometimes,
we're sure...

40
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:43,643
if we try hard enough...

41
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:46,111
<I>we can live the dream.

42
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:52,703
Damn it! Stupid -- ow!

43
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:55,052
I was having a
really good dream,

44
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:55,832
and you ruined it.

45
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,712
Sorry. It's, uh, the, uh,

46
00:01:57,937 --> 00:01:58,731
these boxes.

47
00:01:58,756 --> 00:01:59,613
All these boxes.

48
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:01,382
Callie said she was
bringing her stuff over,

49
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:04,443
and, uh... it's all here.

50
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:05,542
It's okay, George.

51
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:06,181
I don't mind.

52
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:07,583
I don't mind either. No.

53
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:08,662
Don't mind a bit.

54
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:09,532
Kick her out.

55
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:11,351
What? I can't kick her out.

56
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:13,121
You were the one who told
her she could move in.

57
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:14,383
I said she could stay
for a couple of days--

58
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:15,260
a couple of days.

59
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:16,513
It's been over a week.

60
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:17,393
Now there are boxes,

61
00:02:17,426 --> 00:02:18,582
and she's using my computer.

62
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:19,501
And she's here all the time.

63
00:02:19,537 --> 00:02:20,171
Would you kick her out?

64
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,252
And kick her out now.

65
00:02:21,337 --> 00:02:22,771
Hey, you guys might want
to wait a little while.

66
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:24,101
There's no more hot water.

67
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:25,672
Do it.

68
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:26,532
Why do you hate me?

69
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:27,112
Just do it.

70
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:28,240
Hey.

71
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:30,882
Can l get a ride with
you guys to the hospital?

72
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:32,540
You're going to the hospital?

73
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:33,671
Yeah, l'm--l'm gonna go in,

74
00:02:33,706 --> 00:02:34,600
talk to the chief,

75
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:35,722
see about coming back.

76
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:39,993
Anyway, just let me know
when you're leaving.

77
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:42,510
that's great.

78
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:43,530
Izzie is coming back.

79
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:45,632
That's... great, right?

80
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:46,200
Mm-hmm.

81
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:48,253
That's my towel.

82
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:50,020
Oh.

83
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:51,260
Sorry.

84
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:03,430
Boy, he is really
moody in the mornings.

85
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:04,273
Yeah.

86
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:06,362
He's, uh... yeah.

87
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:07,182
Yeah.

88
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:13,721
You know l don't
have to leave today.

89
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:15,382
I could change my flight.

90
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:17,010
No. No, you can't.

91
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:19,033
Because l'm... sober now,

92
00:03:19,187 --> 00:03:19,962
and, uh,

93
00:03:20,108 --> 00:03:24,591
there's work to get to and--and planes
to be caught and real lives to be led.

94
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:26,522
Thank you, truly, Mark,

95
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:28,063
for all of the...

96
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:28,980
sex.

97
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:31,312
I-l really, l feel much better now.
I do.

98
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:32,112
And l'm--l'm--

99
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:33,940
well, now l have to go,

100
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,762
and so do you.

101
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,531
So,  uh, do you, uh,

102
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:38,632
want me to call you...

103
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:40,220
a cab to the airport?

104
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:43,071
Oh!

105
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:55,181
Why don't you try
your bad hand?

106
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:56,571
That's what the
ball's for, right,

107
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:57,793
fixing your bad hand?

108
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,092
Works.

109
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:06,531
There's  coffee on the floor.

110
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:11,351
Fine. I'll--you know what?

111
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,491
I'll clean it up.

112
00:04:12,828 --> 00:04:13,971
Whatever. Leave it.

113
00:04:16,018 --> 00:04:16,961
It doesn't matter.

114
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:25,011
So l was thinking,

115
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:26,491
since your shift
ends after mine,

116
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:28,191
and l don't want to
have to wait around,

117
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,752
maybe l should get a
copy of the house key.

118
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:32,212
No. I like leaving together.

119
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:33,261
You don't need a key.

120
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:42,680
Izzie?

121
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:44,343
I'll see you guys in there.

122
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:45,982
Everything's gonna be fine.

123
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:47,940
Bailey is on your side.

124
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:51,343
And the chief is...
he is gonna put on his angry face,

125
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:52,763
but he's on your side, too.

126
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:54,550
Everybody wants you
back in that building.

127
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:56,203
I know. I know.

128
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,482
You guys go ahead.

129
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:58,322
I'll be fine.

130
00:04:58,505 --> 00:04:59,243
I'm just gonna take a minute,

131
00:04:59,278 --> 00:05:00,300
practice my speech.

132
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:03,260
Okay.

133
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,223
I didn't ask you to
convince her to come in.

134
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:11,940
But l did.

135
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:13,232
I did convince her.

136
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:17,232
There is a whole series of disciplinary
and rehabilitative steps that Izzie

137
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,351
Stevens will have to take before we can--
- You can explain them to her.

138
00:05:19,388 --> 00:05:20,370
I never agreed to that.

139
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,053
She didn't commit a crime.

140
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:22,990
She's an intern--

141
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:24,511
my intern.

142
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:26,742
You--you want to blame someone,
blame me.

143
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:28,662
Look, but that girl is
coming in hertoday,

144
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,881
and--and--and you are
going to talk to her.

145
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:35,288
And you're gonna remember all the
other surgeons you've known who've ever

146
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:40,652
had a lapse in judgment that led to
someone dying or someone's arm
falling off.

147
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,102
Most importantly,

148
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:44,582
you're gonna remember all the mistakes
that you made when you were young

149
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:45,262
and stupid.

150
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:48,873
And you're gonna be filled
with patience and compassion.

151
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:51,250
That's what l'm gonna do?

152
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:52,062
Yes!

153
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:57,091
Because l'm the boss.

154
00:05:57,127 --> 00:05:57,541
I'm...

155
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:04,541
Look, l didn't mean
any disrespect, sir.

156
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:05,600
I apologize.

157
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:07,871
This is really important
to you personally.

158
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:09,902
Very personally, sir, yes.

159
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:17,491
Being the boss isn't as
gratifying as it used to be.

160
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:19,211
No, sir.

161
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:20,921
Get outta here.

162
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:24,231
I'm on my knees in
a puddle of coffee,

163
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:26,322
and he's lying on the
couch playing with himself.

164
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:27,643
You know,
and not in a good way.

165
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,120
He's recovering from surgery,

166
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:32,321
and you've read the studies on recovery
and depression in surgical patients.

167
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:33,333
Well, he's not a patient.

168
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:34,373
He's Preston Burke.

169
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:35,760
He's just milking it.

170
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:40,710
You know, he's got me fetching his food
and the paper and his slippers like l'm
a dog.

171
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:41,793
Hey.

172
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:42,462
Hi.

173
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:44,362
I had a dream about
you last night.

174
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:44,912
You did?

175
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:45,301
Mm-hmm.

176
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:45,823
What was l doing,

177
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:46,851
bringing you coffee?

178
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:49,551
You were definitely
not bringing me coffee.

179
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:50,802
But coffee's good.

180
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:54,063
I'm told dating starts with a casual
invitation over a cup of coffee.

181
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:54,513
Does it?

182
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:55,111
So,  meredith,

183
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,860
would you like to go out
to dinner with me tonight?

184
00:06:56,897 --> 00:06:57,312
How was that?

185
00:06:57,348 --> 00:06:57,943
Was that casual enough?

186
00:06:57,978 --> 00:06:58,832
That was good, right?

187
00:06:58,867 --> 00:06:59,303
Mm.

188
00:06:59,305 --> 00:06:59,963
No? Mm.

189
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:00,763
So we're dating.

190
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:01,441
We're dating.

191
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:02,530
Pick you up at 8:00.

192
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:10,513
Hey.

193
00:07:10,518 --> 00:07:11,512
I was in the neighborhood.

194
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:12,492
Actually, l wasn't.

195
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,922
But l decided you
were worth a detour.

196
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:17,340
I had a dream about
you last night.

197
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:18,893
Was it a good dream?

198
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:19,871
It was.

199
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:21,122
And what was l doing?

200
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:21,460
Yes, Mer,

201
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:22,390
what was he doing?

202
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:24,612
What's that?

203
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:25,860
It's for you.
It's coffee cake--

204
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:26,862
best in the northwest.

205
00:07:26,898 --> 00:07:29,140
Figure l better soften you up so that
when l ask you to dinner tonight,

206
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:30,393
you have to say yes.

207
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:31,303
Uh, dinner tonight?

208
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:31,993
How about that?

209
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:33,102
Are you free tonight,

210
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:33,972
Meredith?

211
00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:35,250
Actually, uh,

212
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:37,162
I'm not free tonight.

213
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,042
Well, how about lunch?

214
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:38,670
I could come here.

215
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:40,290
You're volunteering
to eat hospital food?

216
00:07:40,328 --> 00:07:42,622
I love crappy food.

217
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:43,843
1:00?

218
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:44,491
I'll  be here.

219
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:45,303
Okay.

220
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:50,092
You had a dream about
the both of them?

221
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:51,800
A threesome?

222
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:53,341
Nice.

223
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:56,050
Just when l think you're boring,
you rise.

224
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:57,793
I'm dating.

225
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:01,113
And... it comes with snacks.

226
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:04,501
Hey, Iz.

227
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,402
Hey. I'm going in
to see the chief.

228
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:07,591
Excellent. Back in the game,

229
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:08,873
stepping up to the plate.

230
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:10,043
Look, l'm--l'm running late.

231
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:10,981
Um, l'll catch you later?

232
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:11,702
Yeah, later.

233
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:17,683
Izzie's back. That's good.

234
00:08:17,715 --> 00:08:18,593
Ooh, coffee cake.

235
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:19,582
I'm dating.

236
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:20,271
Touch that piece,

237
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:21,082
Iose a hand.

238
00:08:21,296 --> 00:08:22,090
Morning, people.

239
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,043
Grey, we're clearing the decks.

240
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:26,012
I need you writing
discharge forms.

241
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:27,391
Yang, you're with Dr. Shepherd.

242
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:30,540
Karev, as usual, you're with Dr.
Montgomery-Shepherd in O.B.-G.Y.N.

243
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:34,051
O'Malley, Dr.
Torres has requested you today in ortho.

244
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:36,792
Was she smiling?

245
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:37,633
Izzie's back.

246
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:43,513
"Dr. Torres has requested you."
- Just tell her, George.

247
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:45,913
Tell her you're not ready
to move in together.

248
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:47,083
And then try dating.

249
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:48,471
Dating is fun.

250
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:50,620
Karev, we ready?

251
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:52,691
Isn't this getting old for you?

252
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:54,280
nope. Makes my whole day,

253
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:54,872
actually.

254
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:57,222
Hello. Hello.

255
00:08:58,165 --> 00:08:58,810
Are you okay?

256
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:00,923
No. Uh, ye--

257
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:02,592
n-no, l can'T.

258
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:03,393
I gotta--

259
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:04,601
five minutes.

260
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:08,021
Go find something
to do in the pit.

261
00:09:08,055 --> 00:09:09,113
Personal problem?

262
00:09:10,138 --> 00:09:10,952
Go.

263
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:20,631
Fourth visit in three months.

264
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:25,913
I'm Dr. Karev.

265
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:27,491
And you are...

266
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,512
Megan Clover.
And it's not as bad as it looks.

267
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:31,060
She fell on the playground,

268
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:32,343
and there was a lot of blood,

269
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:33,440
and it looked deep.

270
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,473
We know how this looks.

271
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:35,612
Just so you know,

272
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:36,692
we know how this looks,

273
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,172
and it's not that.

274
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:40,403
She just... plays rough.

275
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:41,200
You know?

276
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:43,862
This is her file, allright?

277
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:46,060
And it goes back since
way before we got her.

278
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:47,072
Before you got her?

279
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:49,661
We're her foster parents.

280
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,173
She's such a great kid,

281
00:09:51,177 --> 00:09:52,553
but she plays really--

282
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,600
she plays rough.

283
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:54,221
Yeah. Yeah.

284
00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:58,223
Right. Uh...

285
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:01,421
Why don't you guys go up to the nurses'
station and let them make a copy of

286
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,610
her file for you?

287
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:05,143
And, uh,
l'll take a look at Megan's leg.

288
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:07,791
Okay.  We'll be
right back, honey.

289
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:08,571
You all right?

290
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:09,791
- Yeah.
- OK.

291
00:10:14,885 --> 00:10:17,330
You got some mean looking bruises,
you know that?

292
00:10:17,978 --> 00:10:19,162
What, did you hurt
your arm, too?

293
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:20,792
Nothing big.
I fell off my bike.

294
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,461
Are those staples?

295
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:26,123
What the hell?

296
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:28,251
Did they do this to you?

297
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:29,790
No! No!

298
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,742
Who did this to you?

299
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:33,451
I did.
I didn't want to go to the doctor again,

300
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:34,721
so l just stapled it.

301
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:35,661
It's no biggie.

302
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:36,953
You stapled your own arm?

303
00:10:36,957 --> 00:10:39,480
Can you please just stitch up my
leg so we can get out of here?

304
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:41,140
You're not going anywhere
with those people, Megan.

305
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:42,640
They're never gonna lay
a hand on you again.

306
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,072
They didn't do anything.

307
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:46,212
Please. They're my best
parents l've ever had.

308
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:46,780
Megan.

309
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:47,610
They don't hurt me.

310
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,970
I can't be hurt.

311
00:10:49,577 --> 00:10:50,620
You don't believe me?

312
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:52,391
Punch  me in the
stomach right now.

313
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:53,822
The staples are in
there pretty deep.

314
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:55,432
I'm gonna have to give you
a shot to numb the pain.

315
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:56,320
I don't need a shot.

316
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:56,932
Trust me.

317
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:57,773
You want a shot.

318
00:10:57,775 --> 00:10:59,720
It's swollen.
It's gonna hurt like a...

319
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:09,360
there. Can l go now?

320
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:10,901
That didn't even hurt?

321
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:19,201
I have superpowers, okay?

322
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:30,871
Mr. Tresselt's having
a corpus callosotomy.

323
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:31,901
What's that gonna look like?

324
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:35,112
We'll be severing some of the fibers
that connect the right and left

325
00:11:35,148 --> 00:11:36,440
hemisphere of his brain...

326
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:39,273
To prevent the spread of
seizure activity from one half

327
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:40,080
of his brain to the other.

328
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:40,871
Good. Right.

329
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:45,262
Daddy's letting them chop his brain
in half because daddy's a big dummy.

330
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:46,170
Yes, he is.

331
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:48,140
They're not chopping my
brain in half, Leanne.

332
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:50,342
Chop! Right down the middle.

333
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:53,402
Taylor should function much
like he does right now.

334
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:55,763
- Really?
- I'm having five seizures a day, Leanne.

335
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:56,400
I know that.

336
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,862
You don't leave me in a
room alone with the baby.

337
00:11:57,895 --> 00:11:59,143
You think l don't notice?

338
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:01,671
You ask your mother to come by every
time you need to take a shower.

339
00:12:01,706 --> 00:12:02,551
That's not the reason.

340
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:04,983
It's because you think
l'm a danger to the baby.

341
00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:06,293
And l am.

342
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,752
Look, if you're not sure,

343
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:11,690
for any reason,

344
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:13,563
we can wait.

345
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:16,863
I want to be able to
take care of our baby.

346
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:17,931
Please, Leanne,

347
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:18,892
we already agreed.

348
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:20,870
Please.

349
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:30,193
I got this kid in the pit.

350
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:33,532
She's psycho and her foster parents
are beating the crap out of her.

351
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,790
She tell you that or you
figure it out yourself?

352
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:37,120
Well, she's covered in bruises.

353
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,462
She's got a 10-centimeter lace on
her arm with three staples in it,

354
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:42,023
Iike from a staple
gun in your garage.

355
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:42,952
Her parents did that?

356
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:44,533
Well, she says she
did it herself.

357
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:47,751
She's got this whole bit about being a
superhero and how she can take the pain.

358
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:48,952
You call social services?

359
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:49,691
They're on their way down.

360
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:50,162
Okay,

361
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:53,882
well have them speak to the parents
while you run a cold pressure test on
the girl.

362
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:54,642
A what?

363
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:55,792
Ice water.

364
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:57,143
Test her response to pain.

365
00:12:57,158 --> 00:12:57,860
At the very least,

366
00:12:57,895 --> 00:13:00,840
it'll keep her distracted while
the parents are questioned.

367
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:02,091
You requested me?

368
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:04,393
Yeah, l did.

369
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:05,613
You were weird this morning.

370
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:06,490
I wasn't weird...

371
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:08,812
any more than l normally
am in the morning.

372
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:11,773
It's a weird time of
day for a lot of people.

373
00:13:11,805 --> 00:13:14,662
It's bright...
and crowded at our house in the morning.

374
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:16,872
There's just a lot of
people running around.

375
00:13:16,905 --> 00:13:18,772
Good. We have a
radical case today.

376
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,571
You're gonna be glad
you're with me.

377
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:22,620
Thanks.

378
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:24,951
Mr. Jasper Hobie.

379
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,351
- Dr. T.
- Hey!

380
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:27,412
You missed me.

381
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:28,821
More than words can say.

382
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:30,301
This is Dr. O'malley.

383
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:31,360
He's gonna be helping out.

384
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:31,662
Hi.

385
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,241
How you doin'?

386
00:13:32,276 --> 00:13:33,431
June 12th, baby.

387
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,012
Mm-hmm.

388
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:35,720
2.4-mile swim,

389
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:38,333
112 miles on the bike
and then a marathon.

390
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:39,701
Mm. That is rockin'.

391
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:40,602
Am l gonna be ready?

392
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:42,350
You bet your sculpted
ass you are.

393
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:43,531
l love this woman.

394
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:48,013
You had three
surgeries last year.

395
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:50,103
Yeah, two rotator
cuffs and an A.C.L.

396
00:13:50,136 --> 00:13:51,483
All with dr. T.

397
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:53,033
And now you're having
an ankle replacement?

398
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:54,820
We waited over a
year for a match.

399
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:59,222
We're gonna replace his ankle with
an ankle joint from a cadaver.

400
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:00,053
Who's my guy?

401
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:00,931
Your donor?

402
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:02,421
Well, he hasn't been
dead long, right?

403
00:14:02,456 --> 00:14:04,112
Um, about a week.

404
00:14:04,115 --> 00:14:05,041
And he's downstairs.

405
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:05,920
No way.

406
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:06,820
Can l meet him,

407
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:07,722
pay my respects?

408
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:11,243
I don't think you two are
gonna have much to talk about.

409
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:13,172
Dr. O'malley's gonna
handle your labs.

410
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:18,662
have you met my guy?

411
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:24,071
Hey, superkid.

412
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:26,273
Where are my parents?

413
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:28,832
They're talking to
some grown-ups.

414
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:29,953
I'm not a moron.

415
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,110
They're talking to
a social worker.

416
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:34,290
Megan...

417
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:35,671
these bruises,

418
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:36,943
these cuts all over you,

419
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:38,052
this isn't normal.

420
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:39,560
I get in fights a lot, okay?

421
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:41,650
Because l'm stronger than
some of the other kids,

422
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:45,011
so l end up defending the ones who
are wimpy or small or whatever.

423
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:46,213
You know you're scrawny, right?

424
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:47,443
I mean,
you're not one of the big kids.

425
00:14:47,477 --> 00:14:49,323
Yeah, but l can take
them in a fight.

426
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:50,970
All right.

427
00:14:51,218 --> 00:14:52,202
Put your hands in here.

428
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:53,070
Why?

429
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:56,033
Because... we're gonna
test your superpowers.

430
00:14:56,037 --> 00:14:58,882
You don't believe me?
Punch me in the stomach right here.

431
00:14:58,887 --> 00:14:59,370
Come on.

432
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:00,102
Punch me in the stomach.

433
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:01,142
Let's just stick to the water.

434
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:02,522
Just put your hand in here.

435
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:04,162
And l'll--l'll race you.

436
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,011
You can race me. What? Come on.

437
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:08,223
What are you afraid of, uh,

438
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:09,291
you afraid of a little ice?

439
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,571
You afraid l'm gonna beat you?

440
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:12,613
Come on. On the count of three.

441
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:16,110
One, two, three.

442
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:19,590
Pull your hand out when it
starts to hurt, please.

443
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:20,842
What are you, deaf?

444
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,813
It won't start to hurt.

445
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:24,531
Just think about it, okay?

446
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:28,272
Superheroes are all kids
with dead parents, like me.

447
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:31,801
And they all figured out when they were
around my age they could do things

448
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:33,783
that nobody else could,
like me.

449
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:41,860
You missed your plane?

450
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:43,380
- Grounded on account
of bad weather.

451
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:45,803
It's a cloudless sky.
That happens like,

452
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:46,843
twice a year in Seattle.

453
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:48,872
Yeah, but there's a
typhoon in New York.

454
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:50,660
Sit down.

455
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:51,481
Have a drink with me.

456
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,390
No, l'm not having a drink with you.
I am working.

457
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:55,543
At work, not here.

458
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:56,971
So coffee, right?

459
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,341
Mark--

460
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:00,142
Joe, can we get the
doctor a coffee?

461
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:03,802
And they think it's weird that
they can do all this stuff,

462
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:07,721
but they don't tell anybody because
people would freak out like you did.

463
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,162
What's wrong with you?

464
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,763
Son of a--ow!

465
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:17,861
Ah! Ah!

466
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:20,381
Take your hand outta
there before it falls off.

467
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:22,263
You need to relax.

468
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:23,902
You didn't feel anything?

469
00:16:23,945 --> 00:16:24,451
Nothing?

470
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:26,522
No. Nobody ever believes me.

471
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:28,242
Like yesterday in school,

472
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:29,792
this kid said l was full of it.

473
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:33,622
I had to letim punch me in the stomach
25 times before he believed me,

474
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:35,272
and once with a baseball bat.

475
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:37,621
What?

476
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:39,380
We'll have cardiology
check this,

477
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,910
and then you'll be good to go.

478
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:43,932
All done. There's my guy.

479
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:48,740
Jake... we're almost all
done with this whole thing.

480
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:49,821
We're not almost done.

481
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:53,522
You still have brain surgery and God
knows how many weeks of recovery is
ahead of you.

482
00:16:53,556 --> 00:16:54,342
She's right.

483
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:57,293
It's good to know what you're
getting yourself into.

484
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:57,992
Thank you.

485
00:16:58,927 --> 00:16:59,951
I appreciate that.

486
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:01,942
Yeah. Recovery's
hell on the spouse.

487
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:04,022
It's gonna be harder
for you than on him.

488
00:17:04,378 --> 00:17:06,361
My mom's staying
with us for a week.

489
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:07,593
Maybe she should stay longer.

490
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,501
You know,
it's--it's brutal being the caretaker.

491
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:10,482
You'll be fetching the paper,

492
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:11,690
- and then cleaning the carpet...
- Honey.

493
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:13,573
And oh--oh,
he wants ice in a cup, not a mug.

494
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:15,470
It's like--it never stops.

495
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:19,332
It's the caretakers that
are the silent victims.

496
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:21,043
You know,
and when do you ever hear about them?

497
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:21,761
Honey, take the baby.

498
00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:23,302
Never. I never hear
anything about them.

499
00:17:23,337 --> 00:17:24,241
It's always, you know,

500
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,190
"the patient this,

501
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:27,782
the patient that."
Silent victims.

502
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:29,443
Honey, take the baby.

503
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:30,831
Oh!

504
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:31,490
Oh!

505
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:32,080
Taylor!

506
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:33,672
Can someone help here,

507
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:34,400
please?!

508
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:35,843
Taylor, please.

509
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:36,912
Annette, come on!

510
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:40,230
His seizure lasted
about a minute,

511
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,813
and he was post-ictal for five.

512
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,091
Is the baby okay?

513
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:44,040
He's fine.

514
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,341
It shouldn't interfere
with his surgery,

515
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:48,121
assuming we're
still going forward.

516
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:50,101
Honey?

517
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:54,133
Yeah. I guess we don't
have any other choice.

518
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:54,921
All right, Leanne,

519
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,682
I'm gonna do everything
l can, okay?

520
00:17:56,716 --> 00:17:57,852
It's not gonna be
a walk in the park,

521
00:17:57,888 --> 00:17:59,322
but l'm gonna take care of him.

522
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:00,251
Okay.

523
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:03,100
Hey, Izzie.

524
00:18:03,857 --> 00:18:04,991
You done with the chief?

525
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:05,702
Not yet.

526
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:08,451
Are you okay?

527
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:09,013
I'm fine.

528
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:10,610
What are you guys doing?

529
00:18:10,648 --> 00:18:12,151
Uh, she's dating
everyone with a pulse,

530
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:14,731
and, uh, l'm trying to get
Burke out of the beljar.

531
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:16,630
Crap. I'm late for Finn.

532
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:17,503
Gotta go.

533
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:19,290
You're sure you're okay?

534
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:19,943
Yeah.

535
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,113
She's playing the field,

536
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:24,243
and l've got a wife.

537
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:25,612
Point to the justice.

538
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:35,110
Uh... okay.

539
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:38,571
Here's the thing--

540
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:41,751
we've both really
enjoyed each other,

541
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,142
b-before and now again,

542
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:47,742
and--and l think that's
a healthy release.

543
00:18:47,746 --> 00:18:50,320
I mean,
l-l think it's--it's healthy,

544
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:52,052
for everybody involved.

545
00:18:52,568 --> 00:18:53,532
And, um,

546
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,253
but l do think that
just because l made

547
00:18:56,258 --> 00:18:59,531
what can only be considered
a transcontinental...

548
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:00,813
booty call...

549
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:02,401
doesn't mean that we should be

550
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,471
trying to make
something out of this.

551
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:07,281
Stop doing that!

552
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:09,882
Why?

553
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:11,212
Because l can't think.

554
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:11,971
We're good together.

555
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:12,862
We aren't.

556
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:13,991
You have to go home.

557
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:14,820
Come back with me.

558
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:15,662
You're insane.

559
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,943
I'm not going back--

560
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:19,251
I'm not going back to New York.

561
00:19:19,878 --> 00:19:21,703
'Cause it was just about sex?

562
00:19:30,927 --> 00:19:31,761
Ooh!

563
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:32,302
Oh.

564
00:19:42,835 --> 00:19:44,262
Okay. Uh, well...

565
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:46,813
good-bye.

566
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:48,121
Good-bye.

567
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:02,020
Stevens was supposed to
be in my office at 9:30.

568
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:02,823
Didn't show.

569
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,183
Did you two change your minds?

570
00:20:04,215 --> 00:20:05,760
No, she said she was coming in.

571
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:07,531
I'm sure she'll track you down.

572
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:12,730
We need to run a C.T.

573
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:13,861
On this kid's abdomen.

574
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:15,720
This superhero stuff's
way out of hand.

575
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:18,022
It's all right if she
thinks she's a superhero.

576
00:20:18,057 --> 00:20:20,173
I believed in Santa
Claus till l was 11.

577
00:20:20,405 --> 00:20:21,213
Really?

578
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:23,873
Did Santa ever hit you in
the gut with a basebalbat?

579
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:29,470
Hey, lab's good?

580
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:31,082
Yeah, they're all clear.

581
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:35,230
So why does a guy have four
ortho surgeries in one year?

582
00:20:35,677 --> 00:20:36,883
Because he's a serious athlete.

583
00:20:36,918 --> 00:20:38,161
His body takes a beating.

584
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,250
Maybe his body can't handle it.

585
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:42,182
Do you know how many
triathlons the guy's done?

586
00:20:42,217 --> 00:20:43,373
Right, he's 55.

587
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:46,070
Do you think an ankle replacement and
26 miles a day is still a good idea?

588
00:20:46,105 --> 00:20:48,800
Um, what, do you think we
should fit him for a walker?

589
00:20:49,768 --> 00:20:50,960
He's pounding the crap
out of his joints,

590
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:52,743
and he's asking
you to clean it up.

591
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:55,380
Do you know how many hips l replace
because people can't be bothered to

592
00:20:55,415 --> 00:20:57,162
walk around the
block once a month?

593
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,660
Sometimes, we can make
dreams come true.

594
00:20:58,698 --> 00:20:59,841
It's not all the often.

595
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:00,801
When we can, we should.

596
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:01,630
Don't you think?

597
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:02,802
Yeah, yeah.

598
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:03,202
George,

599
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:04,262
don't worry about it.

600
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:06,250
Hey, l was gonna
go home for lunch.

601
00:21:06,877 --> 00:21:07,623
You wanna come?

602
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,753
Callie just called my house
"home." Where does she get that?

603
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:15,281
Shh.

604
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:16,240
It is not her home.

605
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:20,611
What are you doing?

606
00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:22,191
Meredith and Finn.

607
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:25,523
50 dn on whether Shepherd shows
up to challenge Finn to a duel.

608
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,331
Oh, can l be, uh,

609
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:28,291
with 5?

610
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:28,802
That's not a bet.

611
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:29,853
That's milk money, dude.

612
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:33,481
Oh and she's laughing because he made
a joke which probably wasn't funny.

613
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:38,151
- "Oh, you funny vet."
- l left the rest of my cash at home,

614
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,363
which l can call it
because l live there.

615
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:41,511
I'm not a visitor.

616
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:43,633
Hey, you're a loser.

617
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:45,591
You like comic books, right?

618
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:48,170
- No.
- l got this kid, this patient.

619
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:50,111
She thinks she's a superhero.

620
00:21:50,115 --> 00:21:51,111
What's up with that?

621
00:21:51,456 --> 00:21:52,262
Superhero?

622
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:54,840
Well, superheroes look like anyone,
like you or me.

623
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:58,191
Maybe they're not someone that people
necessarily notice as extraordinary,

624
00:21:58,225 --> 00:21:59,391
maybe in their daily life,

625
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:00,100
they get walked on,

626
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:01,853
but then there's a moment--

627
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:05,223
they get hit by a cosmic ray or
bitten by a radioactive spider,

628
00:22:05,226 --> 00:22:06,280
and then suddenly,

629
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:08,661
something that has been
inside them all this time,

630
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:09,473
Iying dormant,

631
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:10,402
comes raging out--

632
00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:11,622
Dude, forget l asked.

633
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:12,632
Oh, here we go.

634
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,780
Here we go. Okay. Ahem.

635
00:22:22,118 --> 00:22:23,871
Come on, come on, come on.

636
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:30,523
takes it like a man...

637
00:22:30,535 --> 00:22:32,832
and walks away.

638
00:22:33,448 --> 00:22:34,513
Thank you. 43...

639
00:22:34,518 --> 00:22:35,361
He's comin' back.

640
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:37,431
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes, he is.

641
00:22:37,436 --> 00:22:37,881
Mnh-mnh.

642
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:38,900
Give me my money, Mary Jane.

643
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:39,943
Let it go.

644
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:41,962
Oh, god.

645
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:43,843
I'm so sorry about this.

646
00:22:43,848 --> 00:22:44,562
What?

647
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:45,621
Hi.

648
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:47,703
You're having lunch?

649
00:22:47,736 --> 00:22:48,632
In fact, we are.

650
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:49,220
Oh, it looks good.

651
00:22:49,255 --> 00:22:50,140
You know,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

652
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:51,790
but l'm doing a
corpus callosotomy.

653
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:53,060
Thought you might
like to scrub in.

654
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:55,190
Are you serious? When?

655
00:22:55,197 --> 00:22:56,110
Mm-hmm.I'm gonna guess now.

656
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:56,732
Look, if you're busy,

657
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:57,880
don't bother, but, you know,

658
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:01,860
it's not something that happens every day.
- He's cutting a man's brain in half.

659
00:23:02,606 --> 00:23:03,320
I'm sorry.

660
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:04,920
I'm an intern and...

661
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:06,183
I have a lot to learn.

662
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:07,901
Apparent so do l.

663
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,253
It's okay.

664
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:12,870
Oh, shoot.

665
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:14,513
I'll call you tonight.

666
00:23:14,546 --> 00:23:15,381
Oh, you're busy tonight.

667
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:16,162
She has a date.

668
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm sorry, Finn.

669
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,871
It's okay. Go.

670
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:24,963
Take care.

671
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:29,970
- l think l owe you another 50.
- Yeah, l think you do.

672
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:40,791
Coming or going?

673
00:23:42,365 --> 00:23:43,180
I don't know.

674
00:23:45,285 --> 00:23:47,121
Me neither.

675
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:00,311
That was brilliant, really.

676
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:01,602
I thought so, yes.

677
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:03,961
It wasn't because now l
owe Finn another date.

678
00:24:03,996 --> 00:24:05,850
That's okay.
He needs all the help he can get.

679
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,490
This isn't gonna
be easy for him.

680
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:09,432
Oh, you think he
can't take the heat?

681
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:11,192
I think he's out of his league.

682
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:14,163
But you gotta hand it
to the guy for trying.

683
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:15,663
This is Mr. Tresselt.

684
00:24:16,717 --> 00:24:17,581
Prep him.

685
00:24:18,596 --> 00:24:19,940
I thought you said
we were operating.

686
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:20,921
We orate at 4:00.

687
00:24:21,035 --> 00:24:22,911
I'm not just gon slide
you into the O.R.

688
00:24:22,948 --> 00:24:25,092
You gotta work a little,
too, right?

689
00:24:35,478 --> 00:24:37,420
How much is this
gonna cost my parents?

690
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:40,562
That's not something you
need to be worrying about.

691
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,511
But this is so stupid.

692
00:24:42,518 --> 00:24:43,542
I'm fine.

693
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:45,341
Hey, punch me in the stomach,

694
00:24:45,347 --> 00:24:46,061
right here.

695
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:48,490
Stop telling people to
punch you in the stomach.

696
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:50,320
You need to lie
down and not move.

697
00:24:50,325 --> 00:24:52,450
Which of the superfriends
can do that?

698
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:54,842
Hi, Miranda.

699
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:56,042
You needed a consult?

700
00:24:56,055 --> 00:24:58,870
Yeah. Just waiting
for a picture.

701
00:25:01,148 --> 00:25:04,280
Haven't seen you since you were
sucking down martinis at Joe's.

702
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,851
Oh, yeah. That was just--

703
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:08,312
well, l'm--l'm over that.

704
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:08,853
Good.

705
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:10,182
We talked about, uh--

706
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:11,340
a lot of things.

707
00:25:11,518 --> 00:25:13,460
And l remember--none of them.

708
00:25:13,788 --> 00:25:14,832
Is that for the best?

709
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:15,930
I think so.

710
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:19,313
She came in for sutures,

711
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:23,383
but she's a walking accident and has
got an off-the-charts pain threshold.

712
00:25:23,645 --> 00:25:24,061
I'm thinking--

713
00:25:24,097 --> 00:25:26,183
chronic insensitivity
to pain, yeah.

714
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:27,691
I've seen it in babies.

715
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:29,333
It's usually diagnosed young.

716
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:32,943
But... if she's been bounced
around in the foster care system--

717
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:35,071
Dr. Bailey,
what the hell is that?

718
00:25:46,557 --> 00:25:47,303
Dr. Burke.

719
00:25:47,665 --> 00:25:48,833
Oh, o'malley, how are you?

720
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:50,042
Good. How's your arm?

721
00:25:50,176 --> 00:25:52,001
Good, good. Slow.

722
00:25:52,236 --> 00:25:54,191
P.T., You know.

723
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:54,962
Yeah.

724
00:25:54,966 --> 00:25:57,172
Well, uh,
we all miss you around here.

725
00:25:57,646 --> 00:25:58,581
You're missed.

726
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:01,971
Hey, o'malley.

727
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,442
Stevens is standing
outside the hospital.

728
00:26:12,116 --> 00:26:14,353
I am retracting the
right hemisphere.

729
00:26:14,357 --> 00:26:15,683
What do we want to avoid?

730
00:26:15,685 --> 00:26:16,511
Grey?

731
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:20,051
We want to avoid retractors
on the sagittal sinus.

732
00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:21,261
That's right. Why?

733
00:26:21,268 --> 00:26:22,762
To prevent sinus thrombosis.

734
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,191
Excellent.

735
00:26:24,557 --> 00:26:25,711
Saw Dr. Burke today.

736
00:26:25,937 --> 00:26:26,501
He looked good.

737
00:26:26,538 --> 00:26:27,581
Yeah, he looks great.

738
00:26:27,957 --> 00:26:29,450
He was meeting with the chief.

739
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:30,991
Working out the leave?

740
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:31,740
The what?

741
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:34,182
His leave of absence.

742
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:37,102
His what?

743
00:26:45,317 --> 00:26:46,962
You've been standing
out here for a while.

744
00:26:46,998 --> 00:26:48,543
For a while, I stood over there

745
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:49,652
Maybe you should sit down.

746
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:50,312
I don't want to sit down.

747
00:26:50,346 --> 00:26:51,371
Maybe you should
sit down anyway.

748
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:52,663
Go inside, George.

749
00:26:54,286 --> 00:26:55,740
Izzie, seriously this is--

750
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:56,892
I hate the bride thing.

751
00:26:57,357 --> 00:27:00,082
I hate the pictures in the magazines
of the girl with the veil and the

752
00:27:00,116 --> 00:27:04,353
flowers that she's sniffing like it
never occurred to her to stick her nose

753
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,752
in there until there was
a camera pointed at her.

754
00:27:07,547 --> 00:27:11,422
I hate the idea of
bridesmaids and the colors

755
00:27:11,428 --> 00:27:13,753
and "does the bustle make my
ass look bigger or smaller?"

756
00:27:13,787 --> 00:27:16,592
l hate the whole thing,
and i never wanted to be that girl.

757
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,143
That girl is stupid
and shallow.

758
00:27:21,497 --> 00:27:24,543
Why the hell is that girl's
thoughts running through my head?

759
00:27:25,755 --> 00:27:26,320
Izzie...

760
00:27:30,748 --> 00:27:32,290
I'm going to do it, George

761
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:34,083
I'm going to walk
through those doors.

762
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:37,251
I just need to make sure that when l'm
standing in front of the chief
of surgery

763
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,723
I am not thinking
about my wedding dress.

764
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:43,101
And that's gonna
take another minute.

765
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:52,961
And with surgeof this kind,

766
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:55,482
there's always risk of an infection
if the bone is compromised--

767
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:56,421
blah, blah, blah,

768
00:27:56,436 --> 00:27:57,680
I could die on the table.

769
00:27:58,438 --> 00:27:59,360
Where do l sign?

770
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,681
I think we should talk through the
rest of this consent form first.

771
00:28:01,715 --> 00:28:02,971
Fourth surgery in a year--

772
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:04,080
I know the routine.

773
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:05,490
When l come back in for my hip,

774
00:28:05,526 --> 00:28:07,370
you can give me the
speech in french.

775
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:08,612
You're having hip surgery?

776
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,352
In the fall,

777
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:10,733
after Patagonia.

778
00:28:16,165 --> 00:28:17,912
Do you still want
to meet your guy?

779
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:22,473
Megan's bleeding internally.

780
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:23,733
What?

781
00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:26,631
It appears there's some
severe trauma to her abdomen.

782
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:28,240
If you're trying to
ask us if we hit her,

783
00:28:28,277 --> 00:28:30,351
we've said ten times and
in ten different ways--

784
00:28:30,386 --> 00:28:31,623
Social services cleared you,

785
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:34,982
and l'm sorry that we suggested
you were mistreating her.

786
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:36,232
But she's hurt pretty badly,

787
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:38,282
so we're gonna need to operate.

788
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,022
Oh, my god.

789
00:28:40,076 --> 00:28:43,293
Megan may have a chromosomal
condition that causes her to not

790
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,993
feel any pain when
she's injured.

791
00:28:45,008 --> 00:28:47,440
It would explain why
she gets hurt so often.

792
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:50,221
We need to do some genetic
testing before we can be sure,

793
00:28:50,255 --> 00:28:54,480
but let's assume she'll need to be
monitored very closely from now on.

794
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:55,991
We got O.R. Three.

795
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,323
So surgery is the only option?

796
00:28:58,328 --> 00:28:59,441
I think it is.

797
00:28:59,628 --> 00:29:02,913
I-l know you've been put through
the wringer already today,

798
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:06,291
but l need to ask you to
trust me on this one.

799
00:29:06,568 --> 00:29:07,380
Where is she?

800
00:29:09,388 --> 00:29:10,300
Where's Megan?

801
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:11,792
She's over...

802
00:29:16,225 --> 00:29:18,193
Hey, a leave of absence?

803
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:19,852
Yeah, l'm on my way home.

804
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:23,963
I was just making some notes for the
chief so he careassign my open cases.

805
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,040
Because you're taking
a leave of absence?

806
00:29:26,797 --> 00:29:27,541
Okay, that's, like,

807
00:29:27,578 --> 00:29:28,433
what, a week?

808
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:29,993
As long as it takes.

809
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:31,460
Well, it's not gonna
take that long.

810
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:33,513
You're already three weeks into P.T.
already, so--

811
00:29:33,545 --> 00:29:37,622
Come on, recovery from brachial plexus
surgery is measured in
months, Christina,

812
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:39,382
years, not weeks.

813
00:29:39,388 --> 00:29:42,760
The surgery's considered a success
when the patient can flex the elbow.

814
00:29:42,797 --> 00:29:45,091
Some patients never move
their shoulder again.

815
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:46,760
Some don't recover sensation,

816
00:29:46,766 --> 00:29:48,712
they don't recover dexterity,

817
00:29:48,717 --> 00:29:50,250
they simply don't recover.

818
00:29:50,818 --> 00:29:52,261
Yes, but you are
not one of those.

819
00:29:52,298 --> 00:29:53,142
Really?

820
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:55,572
Says who?

821
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:10,462
Thanks, Carl.

822
00:30:15,158 --> 00:30:16,130
That's my guy?

823
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:17,241
No, that's not him.

824
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:19,170
That's someone else
we lost last night.

825
00:30:19,206 --> 00:30:20,670
He came in for lipo.

826
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:22,802
He died on the table.

827
00:30:23,097 --> 00:30:24,560
Complications.

828
00:30:25,368 --> 00:30:27,400
Didn't know they did
liposuction on men.

829
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,161
People do a lot of
stuff they don't need.

830
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:33,071
And, uh, the older you get,

831
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:35,622
Here he is.

832
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:40,762
That's your guy.

833
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:45,630
That can't be my guy.

834
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:46,970
He's really old.

835
00:30:47,886 --> 00:30:49,433
His bones are probably brittle.

836
00:30:49,738 --> 00:30:52,700
What are they doing using
a guy that old as my donor?

837
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:56,082
He's two years
younger than you are.

838
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:03,063
What the hell happened
to my ankle allograft?

839
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:04,203
I had O.R. 2 at 3:00.

840
00:31:04,717 --> 00:31:06,110
Anybody wanna tell
me where it went?

841
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:06,952
It was canceled.

842
00:31:06,957 --> 00:31:07,853
The guy went home.

843
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:09,581
Why the hell would he do that?

844
00:31:11,647 --> 00:31:12,191
Hey!

845
00:31:12,197 --> 00:31:12,931
O'malley!

846
00:31:13,227 --> 00:31:14,292
We've lost supergirl,

847
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:15,522
and she's bleeding
into her abdomen.

848
00:31:15,556 --> 00:31:16,943
Start looking in corners.

849
00:31:18,257 --> 00:31:21,121
Do you think you cut enough of the
fibers out or are you gonna have to go
back in?

850
00:31:21,157 --> 00:31:22,893
We'll see if the seizures
are under control.

851
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:24,403
If not,
we'll go back in for the last third.

852
00:31:24,435 --> 00:31:26,023
Well, do l get to
scrub in on that, too,

853
00:31:26,057 --> 00:31:27,953
or only if l'm in the middle
of a date with somebody else?

854
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:29,941
I wouldn't consider a meal
in the cafeteria a date.

855
00:31:29,977 --> 00:31:31,803
Don't denigrate
the competition.

856
00:31:31,816 --> 00:31:34,090
I have nothing but
respect for Dr. Dandridge.

857
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:36,870
It shows courage to woo a
woman with a tuna salad.

858
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:37,922
Keep an eye on Taylor.

859
00:31:37,956 --> 00:31:39,110
If there's a problem, page me.

860
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:40,800
I'll see you in
the lobby at 8:00.

861
00:31:40,836 --> 00:31:43,083
Hey, grey, l lost a kid.

862
00:31:43,238 --> 00:31:45,323
Help me look for her before she
bleeds out in one of our bathrooms.

863
00:31:45,358 --> 00:31:46,062
What's her name?

864
00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:46,723
Megan!

865
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:49,122
It's not easy.
If you think you're a superhero,

866
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,671
you're not gonna let someone
come at you with a knife.

867
00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:53,122
There's no way to tell what
it can do to your powers.

868
00:31:53,156 --> 00:31:55,553
I mean,
if you take away Green Lantern's ring,

869
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:57,120
Hal Jordan is still a hero,

870
00:31:57,128 --> 00:31:59,780
but it creates a crisis
of confidence...

871
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:00,663
- Come on, Megan.

872
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,110
- When you've worked hard
to hone your strength.

873
00:32:02,148 --> 00:32:03,202
Hey, just look at,

874
00:32:03,206 --> 00:32:03,941
uh, Batman.

875
00:32:03,946 --> 00:32:06,791
Robin just marches
into the batcave,

876
00:32:06,797 --> 00:32:08,022
and he says, you know,

877
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:08,500
"Here l am.

878
00:32:08,537 --> 00:32:09,880
I'm gonna live here, too.

879
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:10,700
Give me some tights,

880
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:12,082
and l'm taking your towel."

881
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:16,102
I mean, Batman,
he fought for his powers, you know?

882
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:17,603
He honed his strength !
- Dude,

883
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:19,070
if you don't stop this,

884
00:32:19,078 --> 00:32:20,402
I'm gonna punch
you in the face.

885
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,253
O'Malley.

886
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,603
Good luck with that.

887
00:32:24,328 --> 00:32:26,300
I arrange for you to see an
incredibly cool surgery,

888
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:28,091
and you talk my patient out of it?
- No, l didn't--

889
00:32:28,127 --> 00:32:29,142
You asked me what l thought,

890
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:30,182
you didn't like what l said,

891
00:32:30,217 --> 00:32:31,352
so you went behind my back.

892
00:32:31,388 --> 00:32:32,010
Jasper's gone.

893
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:34,343
He canceled the surgery.
- I expressed an opinion.

894
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,570
I suggested that, you know,

895
00:32:35,608 --> 00:32:37,423
not everything has
to go at warp speed.

896
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,851
It is all warp speed with you.

897
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:41,941
It is all, "oh, your ankle hurts? Let's cut if off."
- You intimidated my patient.

898
00:32:41,977 --> 00:32:43,281
You got a problem,
you bring it to me.

899
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:45,363
I'm not ready for us
to move in together.

900
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:48,811
And if you weren't toddler,

901
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:49,703
if you could use your words,

902
00:32:49,738 --> 00:32:52,361
then maybe you could've said that
the first four times l asked you.

903
00:32:52,397 --> 00:32:53,321
And then l would've said,

904
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:54,192
"oh, that's funny, me neither.

905
00:32:54,227 --> 00:32:55,900
I'm looking for a place.
I'll be out in a week."

906
00:32:55,937 --> 00:32:57,393
Really? Because remember, you--

907
00:32:57,428 --> 00:32:58,720
George, save it. I'll be--

908
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:00,102
I'll be out in an hour.

909
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:05,653
Megan.

910
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:09,443
Megan.

911
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:14,812
Megan. Oh.

912
00:33:15,017 --> 00:33:15,720
Hi.

913
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,940
Weren't you just up on three?

914
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:20,143
I was. We lost a patient,

915
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:21,643
a little girl, and l was just--

916
00:33:21,678 --> 00:33:23,673
Look, why don't you pick
a floor and stay on it,

917
00:33:23,707 --> 00:33:25,952
and l'll pick a floor
on stay on that?

918
00:33:26,098 --> 00:33:28,872
Because l really need a
moment or two without you.

919
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:31,130
Your face shs up in my head,

920
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,940
your... panties show up
in my husband's pocket--

921
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,090
really, you're everywhere--

922
00:33:36,128 --> 00:33:38,373
and l need a moment
or two without you.

923
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:39,923
I get that.

924
00:33:40,315 --> 00:33:41,363
Thanks.

925
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:47,242
megan.

926
00:33:48,187 --> 00:33:49,393
Come on. Enough already.

927
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:57,653
We got half the hospital
looking for you.

928
00:33:57,688 --> 00:34:01,351
Your powers of invisibility
are well intact. Get up.

929
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:03,333
You're a hosebag,
you know that?

930
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:04,052
And you have a potty mouth.

931
00:34:04,087 --> 00:34:05,353
Nobody's cutting me open.

932
00:34:05,745 --> 00:34:06,531
Hey, it's surgery.

933
00:34:06,565 --> 00:34:07,722
We do it all the time.

934
00:34:07,728 --> 00:34:09,111
In fact, it's all we do.

935
00:34:09,707 --> 00:34:12,752
You can't keep telling my
foster parents l'm defective.

936
00:34:12,908 --> 00:34:14,100
They can't afford surgery.

937
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,021
It's too expensive.

938
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:16,061
They can handle it.

939
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:17,900
They'll send me back.

940
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:23,872
Dude, that's stupid.

941
00:34:24,257 --> 00:34:26,150
They got their own
personal superhero.

942
00:34:26,308 --> 00:34:27,890
Nobody sends back a superhero.

943
00:34:28,257 --> 00:34:30,501
I thought you said l
didn't have superpowers?

944
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:32,660
Yeah, well, you don't.

945
00:34:32,897 --> 00:34:34,721
But take away Green
Lantern's ring,

946
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:36,383
the guy's still a hero, right?

947
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,933
Okay. Close your eyes.

948
00:34:43,626 --> 00:34:44,522
Squeeze 'em tight.

949
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:45,540
Good. Okay.

950
00:34:45,547 --> 00:34:46,891
Can you squeeze my fingers?

951
00:34:47,347 --> 00:34:47,933
Fantastic.

952
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:50,082
Let's wiggle your
toes for me, please.

953
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:52,252
Very good, vy good.

954
00:34:53,237 --> 00:34:54,151
Flying colors.

955
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:55,661
He's always tested well.

956
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,623
I kicked ass on the, uh...

957
00:34:58,568 --> 00:34:59,851
what--what's it called?

958
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,403
The S.A.T.S.

959
00:35:01,455 --> 00:35:03,171
Now can you tell me,
what is this?

960
00:35:13,258 --> 00:35:14,070
Honey?

961
00:35:15,737 --> 00:35:16,743
Take your time.

962
00:35:17,677 --> 00:35:20,321
Honey, what's that called?
It's right in front of you.

963
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:24,881
Can you see this here?

964
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:25,671
I can see it.

965
00:35:25,676 --> 00:35:28,110
I-l just can't think of the...

966
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:29,823
That's all right.
t's okay. Take your time.

967
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:32,231
See, sometimes the names
of things are tough.

968
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:33,733
So try again.

969
00:35:39,098 --> 00:35:40,402
What's my name?

970
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:43,951
I can't...

971
00:35:45,257 --> 00:35:46,882
Wh-what's his name?

972
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,822
I-l know what it is.

973
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:51,151
I-l-l just...

974
00:35:51,686 --> 00:35:52,752
what's his name?

975
00:35:52,757 --> 00:35:54,601
Leanne, let's just
give him a moment.

976
00:35:57,217 --> 00:35:58,271
It...

977
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:01,930
what's his name?

978
00:36:01,947 --> 00:36:02,703
I...

979
00:36:09,288 --> 00:36:10,752
He named the baby.

980
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:12,970
He named him after his father.

981
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:16,522
How do you not know the
name of your own baby?

982
00:36:16,525 --> 00:36:18,070
Well, he knows who the baby is.

983
00:36:18,505 --> 00:36:21,832
See, the right side of the brain senses
emotional connection to the baby.

984
00:36:21,865 --> 00:36:25,671
It just can't communicate with the
left brain where the words are formed.

985
00:36:25,678 --> 00:36:27,932
The pathway to the two
sides has been compromised.

986
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:29,460
He needs to make new pathways.

987
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,083
How long is that gonna take?

988
00:36:31,128 --> 00:36:32,221
Well, he'll get there.

989
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:33,572
Recovery is hardork.

990
00:36:34,407 --> 00:36:35,603
It's a learning process.

991
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:37,550
You need to be patient.

992
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:38,832
You need to help him.

993
00:36:39,426 --> 00:36:41,321
He can't do this
without your support.

994
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:45,442
Man, she wasn't kidding
about the baseball bat.

995
00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:47,221
I need more lap pads.

996
00:36:47,337 --> 00:36:48,122
Just keep 'em coming.

997
00:36:48,158 --> 00:36:49,600
Are you gonna resect the liver?

998
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:52,023
I need to try and
do a debridement.

999
00:36:52,596 --> 00:36:53,502
Look at this.

1000
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:57,040
Everybody wants a
life without pain,

1001
00:36:57,058 --> 00:36:58,361
And what does it get you?

1002
00:36:58,525 --> 00:37:00,973
She needs to be on
a poster somewhere,

1003
00:37:00,977 --> 00:37:04,081
to remind people pain's
there for a reason.

1004
00:37:23,256 --> 00:37:24,202
Megan's stable.

1005
00:37:24,418 --> 00:37:26,283
I ordered a repeat
h&h in two hours.

1006
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:27,772
She been outhere all day?

1007
00:37:36,136 --> 00:37:37,362
Dinner was good.

1008
00:37:37,598 --> 00:37:39,100
Dinner was excellent.

1009
00:37:40,448 --> 00:37:41,471
Are you coming in?

1010
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:43,433
I don't know. Am l?

1011
00:37:43,658 --> 00:37:46,960
Well, you could come in
for a drink or a-a coffee.

1012
00:37:46,987 --> 00:37:48,863
I owe you one from
this morning.

1013
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:49,743
Yeah, you do.

1014
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:50,950
- Hi.

1015
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:52,640
Finn.

1016
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,141
I didn't think you
guys would be here.

1017
00:37:54,176 --> 00:37:55,680
I just wantedto drop this off.

1018
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,001
It's strawberry ice cream.

1019
00:37:57,428 --> 00:37:58,512
A patient made it for me.

1020
00:37:58,546 --> 00:37:59,432
Patient's owner.

1021
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:01,192
It's made from scratch.
Real strawberries.

1022
00:38:01,226 --> 00:38:02,890
I love strawberry ice cream.

1023
00:38:02,896 --> 00:38:03,592
And he remembered.

1024
00:38:03,628 --> 00:38:04,302
I did.

1025
00:38:04,486 --> 00:38:05,871
I just thought l'd
leave it by the door.

1026
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,842
Oh, you didn't
think it would melt?

1027
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:07,951
No, you take your chances.

1028
00:38:07,987 --> 00:38:09,063
Worked out for you.

1029
00:38:09,065 --> 00:38:10,411
What exactly is going on here?

1030
00:38:10,446 --> 00:38:11,330
He's crashing our date.

1031
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:12,320
Where do you think
l got that idea?

1032
00:38:12,355 --> 00:38:13,063
I didn't crash your date.

1033
00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:13,782
It was professional.

1034
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:14,942
You can't operate without her?

1035
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:16,472
I certainly operate
well with her.

1036
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:17,443
Enough.

1037
00:38:17,447 --> 00:38:19,011
This is not dating.

1038
00:38:19,025 --> 00:38:23,712
I want moonlight and flowers and
candy and people trying to feel me up.

1039
00:38:24,007 --> 00:38:25,593
Nobody is trying to feel me up.

1040
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:28,690
Nobody is even looking at me.
l'm an intern.

1041
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:32,690
Do the two of you have any idea how
much effort it takes to do all this?

1042
00:38:32,928 --> 00:38:34,042
I'm waxed and plucked,

1043
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:35,302
and l have a clean top on.

1044
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:37,632
And the two of you are looking at each other.
- Meredith, it's--

1045
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:41,150
No! My fantasy is not two men looking at each other.
- We didn't--

1046
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:44,450
No talking until one of you
figures out how to put on a date.

1047
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,413
I want heat, l want romance.

1048
00:38:46,418 --> 00:38:48,692
Damn it,
l wanna feel like a freakin' lady!

1049
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:54,511
The fantasy is simple...

1050
00:38:58,955 --> 00:38:59,980
Pleasure is good...

1051
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:03,322
Ahem. I'm in
room 22-something--2214.

1052
00:39:03,328 --> 00:39:04,312
If anyone calls,

1053
00:39:04,317 --> 00:39:05,082
I'm not here.

1054
00:39:05,087 --> 00:39:05,653
Yes, ma'am.

1055
00:39:06,468 --> 00:39:08,760
And twice as much
pleasure is better...

1056
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:11,271
Hi. Checking in, please.

1057
00:39:11,357 --> 00:39:12,990
Certainly. Room for...

1058
00:39:12,995 --> 00:39:13,853
one.

1059
00:39:14,387 --> 00:39:15,533
<I>That pain is bad...</I>

1060
00:39:15,568 --> 00:39:18,040
Room 1817. Any messages?

1061
00:39:18,046 --> 00:39:19,662
And no pain is better.

1062
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:21,560
Checking in, please.
Room for one.

1063
00:39:22,077 --> 00:39:24,320
Something on the 22nd
floor if you've got it.

1064
00:39:24,536 --> 00:39:25,513
I'll take a look.

1065
00:39:27,427 --> 00:39:28,271
Dr. Sloan?

1066
00:39:29,488 --> 00:39:30,612
Dr. Webber.

1067
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:32,480
What are you doing in seattle?

1068
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:34,630
I don't know.

1069
00:39:36,525 --> 00:39:38,641
I have a thing for ferry boats.

1070
00:39:39,268 --> 00:39:41,060
But the reality
is different.

1071
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:51,531
Are you cooking for me?

1072
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:52,902
I am not.

1073
00:39:53,305 --> 00:39:55,550
You can take a leave of
absence if you want to,

1074
00:39:55,587 --> 00:39:57,353
but you're not gonna
sit on your ass all day.

1075
00:39:57,385 --> 00:39:59,650
You're gonna work hard
and you're gonna get

1076
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:01,702
every bit of your strength
and dexterity back.

1077
00:40:01,737 --> 00:40:04,830
Really? How?

1078
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:19,421
Put it back together.

1079
00:40:20,496 --> 00:40:23,913
The reality is that pain is
there to tell us something.

1080
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:28,571
Iz.

1081
00:40:28,577 --> 00:40:29,430
I'll do it.

1082
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:30,752
Izzie.

1083
00:40:30,757 --> 00:40:31,730
I can do it, Alex.

1084
00:40:31,998 --> 00:40:33,141
I know l can.

1085
00:40:35,116 --> 00:40:36,600
Does it hurt?

1086
00:40:38,385 --> 00:40:39,893
Yeah.

1087
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:43,483
Where does it hurt?

1088
00:40:48,867 --> 00:40:49,861
Everywhere.

1089
00:40:52,526 --> 00:40:54,110
Maybe it hurts for a reason.

1090
00:40:57,806 --> 00:40:58,980
Come on.

1091
00:40:59,496 --> 00:41:00,410
Let's go.

1092
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:12,831
And there's only so much pleasure we
can take without getting
a stomachache.

1093
00:41:13,928 --> 00:41:15,373
And maybe that's okay.

1094
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:16,442
Hey.

1095
00:41:18,585 --> 00:41:19,693
I didn't go in today.

1096
00:41:20,415 --> 00:41:21,632
Maybe tomorrow.

1097
00:41:31,878 --> 00:41:33,002
Hey, George.

1098
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:36,642
Callie moved out,

1099
00:41:36,986 --> 00:41:37,983
which is a relief.

1100
00:41:39,316 --> 00:41:41,820
Oh, l am so relieved.

1101
00:41:44,987 --> 00:41:46,293
Strawberry.

1102
00:41:54,335 --> 00:41:55,153
This is good.

1103
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:56,830
You left spare(?)
on this spoon.

1104
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:57,773
No l didn't

1105
00:41:57,836 --> 00:41:58,782
You did a little...

1106
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:03,863
<I>Maybe some fantasies
are only supposed

1107
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:05,913
to live in our dreams.
