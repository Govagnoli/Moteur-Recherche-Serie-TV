00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,200
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on "grey's anatomy"...</i>

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,000
who's mark?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,300
Derek found us
in bed together.

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,800
How come you can
forgive her but not me?

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,800
I didn't forgive her.

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,700
Denny, this is dr. Stevens.

7
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,600
She'll be tending to you
prior to surgery.

8
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,400
That guy alex,
you with him?

9
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,800
No.

10
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,000
Good. Means i don't
have to fight him for you.

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,600
Where is my husband?

12
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
Got into a car accident trying to get 
to the hospitalbefore the birth.

13
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,700
This is our son.

14
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,000
He's beautiful.

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,700
He broke up with me
for this girl

16
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,100
who doesn't even know
he's alive.

17
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,700
Listen to me, george,
you, meredith grey...

18
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,600
never gonna happen.

19
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,800
You look sad.

20
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,400
I just saw my father for
the first time in 20 years.

21
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,300
Is there anything
that you need?

22
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,000
I don't need anything
from you.

23
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
you could just try
telling her how you feel.

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,800
I will never
stop loving you.

25
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,800
Okay, so, sometimes,

26
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,000
even the best of us make rash decisions...

27
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,300
bad decisions,

28
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,000
decisions we pretty much know
we're going to regret

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,900
the moment...
the minute...

30
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,800
especially the morning after.

31
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,000
I mean,
maybe not "regret" regret

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
because at least,

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,900
you know,
we put ourselves out there.

34
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,900
But still...

35
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,000
Something inside us
decides to do a crazy thing,

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
a thing we know

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,500
will probably turn around
and bite us in the ass...

38
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,500
Yet we do it anyway.

39
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,400
Oh, i'm coming.

40
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,600
I'm coming, doc.
Just hang on.

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,200
Just hold it
until i get there, please.

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,200
I'll walk him.

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,000
No, it's my turn.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,900
No, that's okay.
I'll go walk doc.

45
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,100
You just sleep.

46
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,000
It'll be good...
the fresh outdoors,

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,300
spring morning.

48
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,100
You just sleep.
Okay.

49
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,500
Unless you want to talk.

50
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, god. Here it comes.

51
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,200
I'm not saying that
we have to talk.

52
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm just saying if you <i>want</i>
to talk, we could.

53
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,900
You know, i can start,
you know?

54
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,800
And... and then you can talk
about anything... at all

55
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,400
you want to talk about.

56
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,700
It's just too early
for me

57
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,000
to interpret "girl flip out"
into normal conversation.

58
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,500
It's just that usually...
you start yelling, you know,

59
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,200
when you get mad.

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
Then mark showed up yesterday
and you haven't yelled yet.

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
I'm trying
to give you a chance.

62
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,300
So just go, yell.

63
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,200
I don't want to yell.

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
You don't want to yell? You?

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,500
I just want to sleep.

66
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,900
And doc, he wants to pee,

67
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,700
preferably not inside
this trailer.

68
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,800
okay.

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,600
you could yell
if you want to.

70
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,400
Addison...
i can take it.I'm ready.

71
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,900
All right, i'm going.

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
Come on. Come on.

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,300
What i'm saying is...

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
we reap what we sow.

75
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,300
What comes around
goes around.

76
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:53,800
Morning.

77
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,300
Morning.

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,400
What?
So i slept with him again.

79
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,600
So i'm a big whore...

80
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,500
a big, horny whore
who can't get enough.

81
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,200
Can we get over
the shocked silence already?

82
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,200
It's karma,

83
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,200
and anyway you slice it...

84
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,300
what's going on?

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Karma sucks.

86
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,200
50 bucks says o'malley
caught her doing mark sloan.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,800
There's something going on.
I mean, look at them.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,100
All right, he walked in
on her doing mcdreamy.

89
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,300
Did i just call
that dude "mcdreamy"?

90
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,300
Oh, you know you did.

91
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,600
Awesome.
You are ruining my life.

92
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,200
Get a room.

93
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,300
Guys...

94
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,100
excuse me.
Oh, sorry.

95
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,800
What's, uh,
what's going on?

96
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Nothing.

97
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,700
Oh, you know
we're gonna find out anyway.

98
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,500
If you tell us,
maybe we can help.

99
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,200
There's nothing to tell.

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Oh, that means
there's something to tell.

101
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,500
Come on.

102
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,900
There's nothing to tell.

103
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,500
Well, how about gardenias?

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,600
Like masses and mountains
of gardenias.

105
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,200
Are we worried about bees?

106
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,800
Okay, that's why
i love him.

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,300
No gardenias.

108
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,600
Who would like to present?

109
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,700
Keith paulus, admitted
last night with chest pains.

110
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,900
Status post acute m.i.

111
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,700
No family or personal history
of heart disease,

112
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,300
no cardiac risk factors.

113
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,400
He's healthy as a horse.

114
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,100
A horse who's in bed after
just having a heart attack.

115
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,300
See, any minute, i think
you're gonna tell us

116
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,200
that this was a false alarm

117
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,700
and it just seemed
that he had a heart attack.

118
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,400
She talks
when she gets nervous.

119
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,900
I understand.

120
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,200
Mr. Paulus, unfortunately,

121
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,800
the scan shows what looks like
a mass around your heart,

122
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,500
a very, very large mass.

123
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,900
Mass.

124
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,700
Okay.

125
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,000
Is that code for tumor?

126
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay, that's absurd.

127
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
He doesn't have a tumor.

128
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,500
He's incredibly healthy.

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We won't know
without further exploration,

130
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,200
which is why i'd like
to do an angiogram today.

131
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,900
Okay, good.

132
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Did meredith say anything
to anyone about anything?

133
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,000
No. Are you gonna dish?

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,700
No.

135
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,100
No.

136
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,200
Then leave me alone.
I'm working.

137
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Well, good. Because i don't
want to talk about it, ever.

138
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Fine, then don't.

139
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,100
I'm just sayin'...

140
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,500
are you...
that's weird.

141
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,900
Do you need
to throw up again?

142
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,400
No.

143
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Because there is no shame
i needing to throw up.

144
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
dad, i don't need
to throw up.

145
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,000
Shawn begleiter, 11 years old,
in for intractable vomiting

146
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,200
after a minor head injury.

147
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, i wouldn't exactly
say "minor."

148
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,700
He was hit in the head
with a baseball.

149
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, playing first,
and this little dolt

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,700
harry doelhammer
hit this line drive

151
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,000
out of nowhere
when shawn wasn't looking.

152
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,500
You know what?
This is my fault.

153
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,100
I knew i shouldn't have
let him play little league.

154
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,500
It is clearly
a dangerous sport.

155
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,700
Rick, let's
let the doctor's talk.

156
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,100
They want to know
what happened, michael.

157
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,200
I'm telling them
what happened.

158
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,600
Shawn's gonna be okay.

159
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,000
Right?

160
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,500
Yeah, we have to keep
a close eye on him.

161
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Any recommendations?

162
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,900
Traumatic brain injury
could indicate anything

163
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,500
from a concussion
to intercranial hemorrhaging.

164
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,900
I'd start with an h&p,
do a thorough neuro exam

165
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,400
and get a c.t.

166
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,800
Good.

167
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,900
Are you sure you don't nee
to throw up?

168
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,800
Dad...

169
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,400
tucker.

170
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,200
Dr. Shepherd.

171
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,000
How, um...
how are you feeling?

172
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
I'm feelin' great.
I get to go home.

173
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,500
That's fantastic.
Is miranda gonna meet you there?

174
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,000
No, i'm driving him there.

175
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,800
Oh, thank god. Ahem.

176
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,600
You okay?

177
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,200
I need a consult.

178
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,500
I'm not working.

179
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,200
Ahem. Miranda...
i need a consult.

180
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Oh, no.

181
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,900
Oh, please don't say that.

182
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,700
Addison,
i'm so, so sorry.

183
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,300
You have poison oak

184
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,900
where nobody wants to have
poison oak.

185
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,700
Like i was saying...

186
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,000
oh, god.

187
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,700
Payback's a bitch.

188
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,500
It's official, my friend.

189
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,600
You get to go home.

190
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,400
I can't thank you enough.

191
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,800
I thank you,
my wife thanks you

192
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,600
my son thanks you.

193
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,900
Hey, where is your wife?

194
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,600
You can't drive
for another six weeks.

195
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,000
Dr. Shepherd's a stickler

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
when it comes to
his patients' recovery.

197
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,800
I should know.

198
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Hey, richard.

199
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,000
I wanted to stop in
before bailey took you home.

200
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,500
Well, she's here somewhere.

201
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,600
Uh, your wife came in earlier,
said she needed a consult.

202
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,400
Consult?

203
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,300
Well, bailey's on
maternity leave.

204
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,400
Seemed like some kind
of personal consult.

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,400
It's okay.
I don't mind waiting.

206
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,900
All right, i'm back.

207
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,400
You didn't make up a chart
did you?

208
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,100
Please tell me you did not
make up a chart.

209
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,000
I did not make up a chart,
which means

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,200
we are officially stealing
this calamine lotion

211
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,400
and these gloves.

212
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,500
You take it up
with the chief.

213
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,000
The chief?

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,400
No, no. I cannot
take this up with the chief.

215
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,300
I'm just kidding.

216
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay, did i make jokes
with you

217
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
when you were in
the stirrups?

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,600
No, you did not,
and i'm apologizing.

219
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,100
Oh, my.

220
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,800
What?

221
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,000
These blisters are growing
awfully fast.

222
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,000
I gotta give you
a shot of steroids.

223
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Steroids?

224
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,800
I have never seen a case
of poison oak this bad.

225
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,700
Oh!

226
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,000
Ew! Girl, what did you...

227
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,900
oh, for the love of god,
miranda, the calamine!

228
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,400
Oh, right, sorry.

229
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh.

230
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,400
What happened
with you and o'malley?

231
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,100
Nothing.

232
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,100
Well, whatever it is,
i've done worse.

233
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,300
How do you know
i did something?

234
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,100
How do you know
george didn't do something?

235
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,600
Because bambi looks pissed
and you look guilty.

236
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,200
Here we are.
Come on, buddy.

237
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,600
Let me help you up here.

238
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,000
There you go.

239
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,500
Fine. I did something...

240
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,300
a terrible,
terrible something.

241
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,900
One time, i put a raw egg
in my sock drawer for a month,

242
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,400
and then i smashed it
in my teacher's grade book.

243
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
My dads were really mad.

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,400
Well, what i did
was worse than that.

245
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,200
Cool.

246
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Stop pouting.

247
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,600
I'm not pouting.

248
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,400
Oh, please. I don't even
have to look at you.

249
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,600
I can feel you pouting.

250
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,500
Whatever meredith did,
it wasn't on purpose

251
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,600
so get over it already.

252
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm not being inappropriate.

253
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,900
He's acting like
she skinned his puppy.

254
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
 yang,
that's not nice.

255
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,700
Well, i'm not a nice person.

256
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,600
If you knew what she did,
you would understand.

257
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,300
No, i don't understand.
I don't want to know.

258
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,400
What i want is to analyze
this angiogram,

259
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,100
book this sucker into surgery

260
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,200
and excise
his cardiothoracic mass.

261
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,900
That doesn't look like
a mass to me.

262
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,500
That's because it's not.

263
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,100
What we thought was a mass
is actually

264
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,800
a coronary artery aneurysm

265
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,900
with a fistula into
one of your heart chambers.

266
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,600
Is it, uh, easy to fix?

267
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,500
Before you answer
that question,

268
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,800
i just wanted to let you know
that we're getting married.

269
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,600
We're... we're in love
and we're getting married,

270
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
and we're not so young,

271
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
so we've been waiting
a long time for this.

272
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,400
I have my dress
and everyone's coming

273
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,400
and it's supposed to be
the happiest day of our lives,

274
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,500
and now the only reason
that i'm telling you this

275
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,100
is because you have
this look on your face...

276
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,000
this dark, ominous look...

277
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,500
and we're silver lining
kind of people.

278
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,000
oh, honey.

279
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So i just thought it might
help if you knew that.

280
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 dr. Yang,
would you close the door?

281
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,600
Ahem. We can, uh,

282
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,800
we can operate
on the aneurysm,

283
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,300
try to repair it.

284
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,400
But this type of lesion
is extremely delicate.

285
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,500
The chances of it rupturing
in surgery are high.

286
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,600
What keeps it from rupturing

287
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,200
if i'm just walking down
the street?

288
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,500
Nothing.

289
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,900
The risks are high
either way.

290
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,000
This isn't happening.
This...

291
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,400
this can't be happening.

292
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,700
It's okay, amy.

293
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,800
No, it's not.

294
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,500
I know it's a lot
to process,

295
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,900
but if we're going to operate,

296
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
we need to do it
as soon as possible.

297
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,000
We're getting married.

298
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,900
Honey.

299
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,800
We're getting...
we're getting married.

300
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

301
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,900
They seem like
a really nice couple.

302
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,500
They do.

303
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,800
They don't seem like
they deserve this.

304
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,600
They never do.

305
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,000
Really?

306
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,800
 I guess i'm...
i just think...

307
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,700
i believe in karma.

308
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,300
You know, good people
deserve good things.

309
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,900
At least, i always thought
that that's the way

310
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,100
the universe worked.

311
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,000
How can you think that
and practice medicine?

312
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,800
Why?

313
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,500
 I'm not saying that
everybody who gets sick

314
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,000
or everybody who dies
is bad.

315
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
I'm just...
i'm just sayin' that

316
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,100
i think that
there's a balance.

317
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,200
Or that there should be
a bal... i just...

318
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,000
there should be some sort
of balance. That's...

319
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,300
good god, o'malley.

320
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,800
What the hell
did grey do to you?

321
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,500
What exactly do you mean when
you say blood in the ventricle?

322
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,300
Oh, my god,

323
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,300
h-his brain is bleeding?

324
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
 well,
there's no need to panic.

325
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,700
It's a small amount of blood.

326
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,200
And these injuries
often resolve themselves.

327
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Yeah, but what if it doesn't?

328
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,600
Will he lose i.q. Points?

329
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,100
Because he is very smart,
and that'important to him.

330
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,200
He likes to be smart.

331
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Do you think we should sue that
little brute that hit the ball?

332
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,300
Or the coach...
should we sue the coach?

333
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,000
Shawn loves the coach.

334
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,800
Shawn's brain is bleeding.

335
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,900
Rick...

336
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,700
dad, i'm fine. Jeez.

337
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,600
Yeah, he's awake, alert,
minimal pain.

338
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,800
These are all good signs.

339
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,200
I just want to monitor him over
the next 48 hours.

340
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,300
Okay. Good. You hear that,
shawn? Good signs.

341
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,300
That means, honey,
you shouldn't be scared.

342
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
I'm not.
I am.

343
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,600
We know.
We know.

344
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, they paged you, too?
Must be something big.

345
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,900
Nobody paged me.

346
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
They didn't?
Can you tie this?

347
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,800
Nobody paged you either.

348
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,400
Yes, they did.
I just got a page.

349
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,600
Did you page me?

350
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,000
Alex... oh!

351
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,300
You free tonight?

352
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,100
I might be.

353
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,900
Hey, are you still working
with meredith?

354
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,700
I'm trying to kiss you.

355
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Yeah, but did she mention
anything about what happened

356
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,000
between her and george
because i'm starting to get

357
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
really worried about...

358
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,800
35 year old male,

359
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
shortness of breath,
had a syncopal episode.

360
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,300
Pulse is rapid
and irregular.

361
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,200
Oh, my god. It's denny.

362
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,200
What?

363
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,500
It's denny.

364
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,400
what did he get
in the field?

365
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,800
Hey, this is my patient
until i sign him over ot you.

366
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,500
I know this guy.

367
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,300
He's on the top of
the donor list for a new heart.

368
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,100
That makes him surgical.

369
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,400
I've already paged dr. Burke

370
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,500
and he's on his way,
so you better start signing now.

371
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,600
What did he get in the field?

372
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,000
We gave him 40 of furosemide.

373
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Rhythm didn't change
after 6 of adenosine.

374
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,400
What do we got?

375
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,800
It's denny.

376
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,000
Denny?
Transplant candidate.

377
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,300
Acute dysrhytmia and c.h.f.
Vitals all over the place.

378
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,500
His heart rhythm is a mess.

379
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,400
He's in heart failure.

380
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,700
Bisoprolol can reduce
the chance of mortality.

381
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,300
Can we try that?

382
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,800
What about ace inhibitors?

383
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,600
And digoxin...
somebody load him with dig.

384
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,800
Stevens, slow down.
He's holding on.

385
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,700
Barely, but he's holding on.

386
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,000
Isn't there mething more
we can do?

387
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
There has to be something
more we can do.

388
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,200
The best we can do

389
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,400
 And wait and see if his heart will stabilize.

390
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,000
Izzie, we should...
we should go.

391
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
No, you go. I'm...
i'm gonna stay.

392
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,100
No. L... yes, yes.

393
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,100
I see you.

394
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,100
No, you don't.

395
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Your husband was discharged
over an hour ago.

396
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm not here.

397
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,700
Go home.

398
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,100
You're not working today.

399
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,400
You're on maternity leave.

400
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,500
Exactly.

401
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Have you made your decision?

402
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,400
Wh... oh.
Uh, about the surgery.

403
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,500
no, we're still, uh,
we're still talking about it.

404
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,600
Uh, we were thinking
maybe we should

405
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,200
wait until after the wedding.
Um...

406
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,100
so... so how is he?

407
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,500
Uh, he's pretty much
the same.

408
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,700
Well, that's good, right?

409
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,800
Uh, no. Not really.
It...

410
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,300
see, with your condition,

411
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
you're gonna be okay
until you're not.

412
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,200
And if you opt against
the surgery

413
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,400
and if you leave now,
it's just a matter of time.

414
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
You might make it to
your wedding, but you might not,

415
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,300
and you won't know.

416
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,500
You're just gonna be okay
until you die.

417
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,100
 you're trying
to comfort me?

418
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,700
No. I'm trying to convince you
to let dr. Burke operate.

419
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,900
So that he can die today?

420
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,100
He might die today anyway,

421
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
but dr. Burke
is the very best,

422
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,300
and he's
your very best chance.

423
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,800
Stevens,
everything all right?

424
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,200
Oh, it's just...

425
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,300
it's just not fair.

426
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,500
You know,
it's really not fair.

427
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,300
We treat... jerks
all the time.

428
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,700
Patch 'em up,
send 'em off,

429
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,000
whether they deserve it
or not.

430
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,100
No big deal.

431
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,700
But... denny...

432
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
he's a good guy,
dr. Burke.

433
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,300
He's a... really good guy
with a bad heart

434
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,800
and all we can do for him
is wait.

435
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,100
Well, believe me. I know.

436
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,600
I've been treating denny
a long time.

437
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,200
He doesn't deserve this.

438
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,300
No, what he deserves is
the best cardiac care,

439
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,100
and we're giving him that.

440
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,200
You really like him,
don't you?

441
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,200
He just...

442
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,300
he just...
doesn't deserve this.

443
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,300
Okay.

444
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Aah.

445
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
All right, how's that?

446
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,600
Is that ice pack helping?

447
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,700
I don't know.
I don't think so.

448
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,100
 Mind if i ask how exactly
this happened?

449
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,600
I slept with mark!

450
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,800
Oh! And he had
poison oak on...

451
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,900
no! I slept with mark
a year ago,

452
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,300
and apparently,
this is what i get.

453
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,100
Yeah.

454
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,400
But how did you...

455
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,400
i live in a trailer.
I have meredith grey's dog.

456
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,600
And i went outside
to throw a stick,

457
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,900
and i had to pee,
so i squatted.

458
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,000
Because i didn't want
to go inside

459
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and wake up my husband

460
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,200
because of the way he's been
looking at me since yesterday.

461
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,600
Just wanted a few minutes
of peace,

462
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,400
and this is what i get.
No, no, no, no.

463
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
No, no, no, don't cry.
This is what i get!

464
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,700
Don't cry. Please don't cry.
<i>Please</i> don't cry.

465
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,300
Stop. You're gonna make me...

466
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,600
Oh, lactate.

467
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,000
Can you
give some gauze?
I'm sorry.

468
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Oh, mirand i'm sorry.
Quick, give me some gauze.

469
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,200
I'm sorry.

470
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,300
Stop. Shh.

471
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400
Can i help you, chief?

472
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,500
Dr. Bailey...

473
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,500
i don't know
what you're doin' in there,

474
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,700
but whatever it is...

475
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,600
oh.

476
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Oh. Oh, no.

477
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,500
Dr. Bailey, uh, i'm...

478
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,900
sorry.

479
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,100
Uh... carry on.

480
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,800
Okay, fill me in.

481
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,000
I was doing
his routine neuro check.

482
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,500
I noticed he was altered.

483
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,600
Most likely a clot.

484
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,100
Acute hydrocephalus.

485
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,400
Oh, damn. We need to remove
the pressure right now.

486
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,700
Cranial access kit's ready.

487
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,200
"Cranial access"?
Access to shawn's brain?

488
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,300
Debbie, get them out of here.

489
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,000
Gentlemen.

490
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,800
Rick.

491
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,900
We're not going anywhere.

492
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,000
Look, i am about to drill a hole
into your son's skull.

493
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,700
You don't want to watch this.

494
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,400
He's our son.
We're not leaving.

495
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,100
Rick...
we are not leaving his side.

496
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
15 blade, please. 

497
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,700
I want the theter ready to drain
as soon as i penetrate the dura.

498
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,600
Do not panic.

499
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,900
The drill.

500
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,600
catheter, quickly.

501
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,400
pupils reactive.
Pressure's stabilizing.

502
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,100
Is he okay?

503
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,300
I want neuro checks every hour
And increase the supervision.

504
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,000
We're in the clear for now.

505
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,900
We're in the clear?

506
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,100
You guys did well.

507
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,500
Oh, i have a headache.

508
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,600
Welcome back, little man.

509
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,600
"9-1-1."

510
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,100
Dad, you look white.
Are you okay?

511
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,600
Oh, great.

512
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes.

513
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,800
You got here quick.

514
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,800
We gotta get his heart rate
under control.

515
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,600
Push 300 of amiodarone, now.

516
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,500
Status?

517
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,400
Atrial fibrillatn.

518
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,500
His heart's beating too fast.

519
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,000
If we can't get it
to slow down, then...

520
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,800
it'll give out.

521
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,500
All right, let's try
synchronized cardioversion.

522
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,600
Push 5 of morphine.

523
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Izzie.

524
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,900
You're awake.

525
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,700
Hey. I was hoping
i might get to see you.

526
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,700
You've been working us
pretty hard around here.

527
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,000
The things i have to do
to get a girl's attention.

528
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,300
Denny, we're about to send
a series

529
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,600
of electric currents
through your body.

530
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,000
Hopefully the shocks
will be enough

531
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,500
to slow your heart rate
back to normal.

532
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,000
I'll be here at whole time

533
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,400
This gonna hurt?

534
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,400
 it won't be fun.

535
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,800
I guess maybe you oughta
hold my hand then, huh?

536
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,200
You mind if i handle
the paddles?

537
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,900
Be my guest.

538
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,100
Ready?

539
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Yeah, hit me.

540
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,700
Clear.

541
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,500
No change.

542
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Try it at 100.

543
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Clear.

544
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,000
 holy smoke.

545
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,800
Denny, you are a lucky man.

546
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,900
Oh. Oh, doc, i oughta
kick your ass

547
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,000
for making me yell like a baby

548
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,100
in front of the girl
i'm tryin' to impress, man.

549
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,300
Oh, jeez.

550
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,600
oh.

551
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,500
Take care, man.

552
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,400
Dr. Bailey.

553
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,900
Dr. Bailey!
Didn't you hear me?

554
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,100
Uh, i'm a little distracted
right now.

555
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,400
Oh, yes.
I've been paging you.

556
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,900
I'm not on call.
I'm on maternity leave.

557
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,200
I've been paging my wife
as well,

558
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,500
but she hasn't been
answering either.

559
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,600
You know where she is.

560
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,900
Just because i know
doesn't mean you should.

561
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,400
Some things you just
don't get to know, not from me.

562
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,100
And, really, you don't
wanna know.

563
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,300
You have to tell me
where she is.

564
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,400
I saved your husband's life.

565
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,100
She saved my baby.

566
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,500
So baby trumps husband?

567
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,200
Mm.

568
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,900
Baby trumps husband?

569
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,800
Hey, amy.

570
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,800
The web site said that
you should save your receipts.

571
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,500
I'm sorry?

572
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,200
Well, just in case
something happens,

573
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,100
you know, to have them.

574
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,800
I have all of ours
right here.

575
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,600
I've got, you know,
i've got my dress

576
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
and the band, and i've got
the ballroom deposit

577
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,700
and the honeymoon.

578
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,400
You know, my mom said i
shouldn't, you know, keep them.

579
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,900
Said it was bad luck.
It was... it was...

580
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,700
it was tempting fate.

581
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,200
This isn't your fault.

582
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,800
Y-you have a life.

583
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,200
You... you fall in love,
you make plans,

584
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,300
you have fantasies...

585
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,200
and none of them involve
all of them ending

586
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,400
in a blink of the eye.

587
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,300
What are you doing?

588
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,000
Hiding.

589
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,700
All right,
so you slept with o'malley.

590
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Get over it already.

591
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
He told you?

592
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,500
Uh... no.

593
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I was just kidding.

594
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,900
Uh, i mean, it's not like
i should be surprised.

595
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,800
Why not?

596
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,200
Because when your life
is sucking,

597
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,400
you get drunk and sleep with
inappropriate men.

598
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,200
It's your thing. 

599
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,900
Whatever.
I find it charming.

600
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
You sleep with
inappropriate women

601
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,400
when you're sober.

602
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
One inappropriate woman,
and izzie forgave me for that.

603
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
O'malley... he's not gonna
get over this.

604
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,400
Ize hasn't forgiven you.

605
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,200
Yes, she has.
We're together.

606
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,600
No, you're not.
Izzie may be sleeping with you,

607
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,100
but she'll never see you
the way she saw you

608
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,600
before you slept with olivia.

609
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,300
Why are you trying
to piss me off?

610
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,000
You're trying to suggest
that it's forgivable

611
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
for you to sleep with olivia

612
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,100
but not forgivable
for me to sleep with george.

613
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,200
You told him?

614
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,400
I ca...

615
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
george.

616
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,300
Wow, when i'm wrong about someone...
no, l...

617
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,700
i am <i>really</i> wrong.
No, george!

618
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,800
It's not...
it's not what you think.

619
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,700
Dude, chill.

620
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,000
You chill! You chill!

621
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,300
I'm not...
i'm not gonna chill.

622
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,200
George, l...

623
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,700
what's going on?

624
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,000
Fetus is freaking out.

625
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,200
I can see that.
Why are you freaking out?

626
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,400
You think that someone is...
your friend, you know.

627
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,700
At theery least,
that she'd respect your privacy.

628
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,000
What's going on?

629
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,300
Baby boy is freaking out.

630
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
She can see that.

631
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,800
I can see that.

632
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,200
Why is he freaking out?

633
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,700
George,
can we at least talk?

634
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,400
I don't want to talk!

635
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,700
Not to you!

636
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,500
I wanted to keep
my mouth shut,

637
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,400
and if you hadn't been
running away from me

638
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,100
every time you see me,
you would know that.

639
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,300
Okay, you're right.
But can we just talk now?

640
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
You want to talk now
because you told everyone

641
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
that we had sex!

642
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,100
Shh.

643
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,400
You had sex?
You had sex with george?

644
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,400
You didn't tell them?

645
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,500
No.

646
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,700
Damn it!

647
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,800
george!

648
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,700
george!

649
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,100
go away.

650
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,300
he's gonna be okay, right?

651
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,500
He dislocated his shoulder.
He's gonna be fine.

652
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,700
That's not exactly
what i meant.

653
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Meredith...
if you can't make this right,

654
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,400
if you can't fix this
with george,

655
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,400
just so you know,
if it comes to choosing sides,

656
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,500
i'm on his.

657
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,000
he's the weaker kid.

658
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,900
I mean, even i don't beat up
on weaker kids.

659
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,900
It's cheap.

660
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,800
I did a terrible thing.

661
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,900
I didn't...

662
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,300
i did a terrible thing.

663
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,900
He's been in love with you
since day one.

664
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,200
There's no way
you didn't know that.

665
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,500
We all do terrible things.

666
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,200
Thank you.

667
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,100
You're welcome.

668
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,900
"george o'malley"?

669
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Uh, hi.

670
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,100
Dr. George o'malley.

671
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,500
You're the heart-
in-the-elevator guy.

672
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,400
Yeah, that me.

673
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,600
That was amazing.
Uh, thanks.

674
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,000
I, uh, dislocated
my shoulder.

675
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,300
Yeah.
Oh!

676
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,400
I can see that.

677
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,500
It's really not so bad.

678
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Yes, it is.
Pick your poison.

679
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,200
Uh... no painkillers,thanks.

680
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,000
Bold choice.

681
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,600
No, l... officially,
i'm on duty.

682
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,800
And planning to stay?

683
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Mm-hmm.

684
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Bolder choice.

685
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,700
all i need is help, uh,
popping it back in.

686
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,900
You got into a fight?

687
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,500
Um, l-i fell down
some stairs.

688
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Where, at your girlfriend's?

689
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,700
What? No, i'm single.

690
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,700
Single, huh?

691
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,200
Hurts less if you don't
see it coming.

692
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,100
all set?

693
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,500
All set.

694
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,000
Okay. Thanks.

695
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,700
You're welcome.

696
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,800
Bye.

697
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,200
don't.

698
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,600
Don't?

699
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,800
Don't be nice to me.

700
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,000
I did a terrible thing.

701
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
We all do terrible things.

702
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
No, l-i...

703
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,200
i did a thing that i can't
even believe i did,

704
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,300
and... i was sad and...

705
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,600
oh.

706
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,700
I'm pretty sure i'm gonna lose
all of my friends.

707
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You won't lose me.

708
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,500
You're not my friend.

709
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,000
Yes, i am.

710
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,800
Well, l-i could be.

711
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,100
I'm a very good friend.

712
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,800
No, we can't be friends.

713
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,200
We could be friends.

714
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,500
You'd be lucky to have me.

715
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,900
How?

716
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,900
How can we be friends?

717
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,300
We could, uh...

718
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,000
hang out.

719
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,700
Mm-hmm. I walk doc
every other morning,

720
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,700
tiger mountain trail.

721
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,700
We could meet, have coffee,
watch doc play and...

722
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,800
discuss the complex nature
of our existence.

723
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,500
Right.

724
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,900
We could. Might be fun.

725
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,800
I could be your friend,
meredith.

726
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,700
No.

727
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,300
We can't be friends.

728
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm just adding nitro.

729
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,700
Your blood pressure's
stable now,

730
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,000
your c.h.f. Has improved

731
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,900
and the atrial fibrillation
resolved.

732
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,300
I like the way you say
"fibrillation."

733
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,700
Fibrillation.

734
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,800
Tease.

735
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,000
How are you feeling?

736
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,100
You, um...
do you believe in karma?

737
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,300
Um... actually, i do.

738
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,800
I think
you might be mine.

739
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,500
well, you must have been
very, very good to deserve me.

740
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I must have.

741
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,600
 okay.

742
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,900
i wouldn't do that
if i were you.

743
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,500
Well, dr. Bailey...

744
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,800
if she wants her privacy,

745
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,000
then we will give her
her privacy, understood?

746
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,100
But dr. Bailey paged me.

747
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,400
She did? yeah

748
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
I did.

749
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,200
And i'm still not here.

750
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,500
I'm still on maternity leave.

751
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,100
And i still need
some privacy, chief.

752
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
come In here.

753
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
no moving, no peeking,
no pulling the curtain.

754
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,400
Just stand there and let
her talk. Do you understand?

755
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,500
Is this really necessary?

756
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,300
I said,
"do you understand?"

757
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,800
I'm not mentally challenged.

758
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm not so sure
about that.

759
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,300
let her talk.

760
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,200
Addison, this is ridiculous.

761
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,800
Stay where you are.
Promise.

762
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,200
Okay, i promise.

763
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,300
I'm gonna show you something,
and... when i do,

764
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,900
you do not get to laugh,
and you do not get to gloat.

765
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,900
Why would i gloat?

766
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,800
I have poison oak.

767
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,100
What?

768
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,900
hmm. You do, indeed,
have poison oak.

769
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,200
So are we even yet?
I mean, is this bad enough?

770
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,800
Haven't i repaid my debt
to society, derek?

771
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,700
 all right,
let's take a look.

772
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,800
Ahh. Come on, tuck.
Let's take your daddy home.

773
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,800
She really didn't
tell you about it?

774
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,800
No. God,
is that a bad thing?

775
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,900
Well, she tells you
everything.

776
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,800
So it didn't matter enough
to her to even talk about.

777
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,500
Okay, george, the pity thing?

778
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,600
Not good.

779
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,100
If you want crappy things
to stop happening to you,

780
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,300
then stop accepting crap
and demand something more.

781
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,800
Hey, amy.

782
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, could you tell,
uh, dr. Burke

783
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,700
that, um, keith is
gonna have the surgery?

784
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,300
Oh, that's great.
Where are you going?

785
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,900
Um, i... i'm... i'm...

786
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,400
i'm not strong enough
for this.

787
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,300
Hold it, amy.
I know it's hard,

788
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,400
but your fianc\
is going into surgery.

789
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,000
You're gonna want to be here
when he wakes up.

790
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,900
No, i won't. Um...

791
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,900
he's not
my fianc\ anymore.

792
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,600
You're leaving him?

793
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm not strong enough
for this.

794
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,300
So the "in sickness
and in health" part

795
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,700
of your vows, you're just
planning to leave those out?

796
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,400
Please try to understand.

797
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,900
I don't like that
i'm t strong enough.

798
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,300
I just know that i'm not.

799
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,800
George, he's crashing.
What?

800
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,000
his aneurysm
may have blown.

801
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,700
Page dr. Burke!

802
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,900
he's gonna live?

803
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,900
Burke's a miracle worker.

804
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,900
Did you know
this guy's fianc\e left him?

805
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,700
Sounds like he dodged
a bullet.

806
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
I don't think he's gonna
see it that way.

807
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,700
If she can't love him back
the way he loves her...

808
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,800
then she doesn't deserve him.

809
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,700
You heard about me
and meredith?

810
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,700
Well, everyone heard,
george.

811
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,500
You were yelling about it
in the hallway.

812
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,300
It must've sucked.
I'm sorry.

813
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm sorry.

814
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,000
Um, if... if i made you feel

815
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,700
anythingike i'm feeling
right now...

816
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,000
i'm sorry.

817
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,200
that's nice to hear.

818
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,200
 how was that?

819
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,700
It was good. Really good.

820
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,400
'cause i...

821
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,700
i could do it again.

822
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,100
I like to do it.

823
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,600
Yeah.

824
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
I could do it until you...

825
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
i'm fine.
Yeah?

826
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,100
Ow.
Oh, i'm sorry.

827
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,700
Okay. You're on my hair.

828
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,800
Yeah.
Okay.

829
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:05,900
Meredith.

830
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,600
Oh, george. 

831
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,000
Meredith.

832
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,200
What's wrong?

833
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh, nothing.
Nothing's wrong.

834
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,800
Why would you think
anything's wrong?

835
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,000
You're crying.

836
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,000
Oh, it'll stop.
Just ignore me.

837
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,900
No, i can't...
i can't ignore you.

838
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,700
Yeah. It's... it's fine.
It's fine.

839
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,600
Just... it's okay. Just...
you're almost done, right?

840
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,900
no.

841
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,100
George.
Meredith.

842
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,500
Meredith...

843
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,900
George, please.

844
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,600
sleeping with me,

845
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,100
is it really
this awful for you?

846
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,500
No, george, it's not that.

847
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,500
It's not you.

848
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,600
George...

849
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,600
there's a suitcase
in the hall.

850
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,200
I was just getting
my shirt.

851
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,700
There's a suitcase...

852
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,900
yeah, uh, i don't
live here anymore.

853
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,500
Excuse me.

854
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,800
Why?

855
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,600
I just want to know
why you...

856
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,800
if you didn't want to...

857
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,300
i didn't know
i didn't want to.

858
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,100
You were there,

859
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,600
and you were saying
all these perfect things,

860
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
and i was sad.

861
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,400
And so i thought, maybe.

862
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,400
Maybe i've just been
overlooking

863
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,800
what's been in front of me.

864
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,700
and if i just give it
a chance

865
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,300
because you're george
and you're so great...

866
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,600
i didn't know
i didn't want to

867
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,500
until i knew
i didn't want to.

868
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,600
Yeah.

869
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,900
Okay.

870
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,700
Can we please just go back
to everything the way it was?

871
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,200
I don't know how
to go back.

872
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,000
No.

873
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,700
I'm done.

874
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,300
We're done.

875
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,800
one way or another,
our karma...

876
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,500
Will leave us to face ourselves.

877
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,500
We can look our karma
in the eye

878
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,700
or we can wait for it
to sneak up on us from behind.

879
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,700
You ready?

880
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,500
What?

881
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,700
Aren't we, uh...

882
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,000
i thought we had plans
for tonight.

883
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,300
Oh... i forgot.
I'm sorry.

884
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,500
Rain check?

885
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Sure.

886
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,900
amy?

887
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,100
She's not, um...

888
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,900
here.

889
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,900
Um... but you are.

890
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,900
That's what's important.

891
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,300
She left?

892
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,600
She really left?

893
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,900
Who does that?

894
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,300
What kind of person
does that?

895
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
One way or another,

896
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,300
our karma will always find us.

897
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,700
Hey.

898
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,200
Hey, yourself.

899
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Wow.

900
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,700
i gotta say, not exactly
how i envisioned

901
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,300
our perfect first date.

902
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,500
Are you kidding?

903
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Do you know how hard
i've had to work

904
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,100
to get a cute boy
in bed before?

905
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,500
You think i'm cute.

906
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,200
 okay.

907
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,200
Shut up
and drink your juice.

908
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,200
And the truth is,
as surgeons...

909
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,400
we have more chances than most

910
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,200
to set the balance in our favor.

911
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,300
George.

912
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,900
Dr. Torres.

913
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,500
Callie.

914
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,400
you going a trip?

915
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,000
Uh, sorta.

916
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Well, in that case...

917
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,100
give me a call
when you get back in town.

918
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,400
no matter how hard we try...

919
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,500
we can't escape our karma.

920
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,100
It follows us home.

921
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,000
he's your friend,
and he needed our help.

922
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,800
Are his problems surgical?

923
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,200
Mm. No.

924
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,100
Then technically,
he doesn't need our help.

925
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,800
you're a good person.

926
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,900
I am not.

927
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,600
Good night.

928
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,500
Oh, good night.

929
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
good night.

930
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,100
i guess we can't really
complain about karma.

931
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,200
It's not unfair.
It's not unexpected.

932
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,100
It just...

933
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,400
evens the score.

934
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,800
Hey, boy. Good boy.

935
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,100
And even when we're about
to do something we know

936
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,500
will tempt karma
to bite us in the ass,

937
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,300
well, it goes without saying...

938
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,800
so...

939
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,100
so...

940
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,000
just friends.

941
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,200
Just friends.

942
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,400
We do it anyway.
