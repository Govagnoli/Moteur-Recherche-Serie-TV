1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:03,626
Previously
on Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:05,830
- We had sex, once.
- Go out with me.

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,305
You know you're my boss,
it's against the rules.

4
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,935
Do you like lzzie?
Is that what this is about?

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,876
She's not the one
I'm attracted to.

6
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,038
So there's a one.

7
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,639
Ever been attracted
to someone you couldn't have?

8
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,775
Meredith.

9
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,911
- Just coffee.
- Good.

10
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:22,352
- OK.
- OK.

11
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:26,483
[Woman] Your mother's Alzheimer's
is advancing. While she's lucid enough,

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,289
- she needs to sign everything to you.
- Me?

13
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,891
Thanks for the coffee.

14
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,702
[Derek] So you blew me off
for a bottle of tequila.

15
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,137
That's not nearly
as much fun to wake up to.

16
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,902
- [Knocking]
- Mind moving this tail wagon?

17
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,375
You're blocking me in.

18
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,706
[Sighing]

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,448
[Meredith] A couple
hundred years ago,

20
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,541
Benjamin Franklin
shared with the world

21
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,882
the secret of his success.

22
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,183
"Never leave that
till tomorrow, " he said,

23
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,746
"which you can do today."

24
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,520
- [Jem: Save Me]
- [Thunder rumbling]

25
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,685
[Alarm buzzing]

26
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,492
This is the man
who discovered electricity.

27
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,400
You'd think more of us would
listen to what he had to say.

28
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,475
I don't know why
we put things off,

29
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,536
but if I had to guess,

30
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,411
I'd say it has
a lot to do with fear.

31
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,351
Fear of failure, fear of pain,
fear of rejection.

32
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,359
Wouldn't it be easier
to just ask her out?

33
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,660
[Thunder rumbling]

34
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,964
[Alarm buzzing]

35
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,906
- She's gonna be late.
- Maybe not.

36
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,242
- [Lzzie gasping]
- We should wait for her.

37
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,875
Definitely not.

38
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,443
I'm not her mother,
and you are not her boyfriend.

39
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,852
Not yet, anyway.

40
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,288
Stop, OK? I told you
I'm not interested.

41
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,655
Life is short, George.

42
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:09,559
Do you really want to die
before you ever ask her out?

43
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,120
I do not want to ask her out.

44
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,063
Do you really want
to die a liar?

45
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,126
I'm not...
I'm not dying.

46
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,330
[Meredith] Sometimes, the fear
is just of making a decision.

47
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,342
Because, what if you're wrong?

48
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,880
What if you're making
a mistake you can't undo?

49
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,143
Crap.

50
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,411
Crap?

51
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,043
Hi. I'm late.

52
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,451
You're avoiding me.

53
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,114
Yes, but also late.

54
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,953
Oh, are we going to talk
about this?

55
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,049
No.

56
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,991
About us and Bailey
and what she saw?

57
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,528
I don't need to
talk about it.

58
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,655
I experienced it, naked.

59
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,222
This is getting complicated.

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,528
Complicated for me.

61
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,796
I'm the intern sleeping
with the attending.

62
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,770
Bailey isn't speaking
to me anymore.

63
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,864
Not that
that's a bad thing.

64
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,909
If I was a better guy,
I'd walk away.

65
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,841
Yes, you would.

66
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,304
Do you want me
to be a better guy?

67
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,815
Yes.

68
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,749
No.

69
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,717
Crap.

70
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,620
I'm late.

71
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,215
Take your time.

72
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,593
Think about it.

73
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:16,651
[Psapp: Chapter]

74
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,196
[Elevator bell dinging]

75
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,694
That was definitely
worth being late.

76
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,396
[Sighs]

77
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,869
Thanks.

78
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,040
Is this a...?

79
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,634
Should we talk about this?

80
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,339
Yeah, definitely.

81
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,619
- [Meredith] You're late.
- So are you.

82
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,291
I know, and I can't afford
to piss off Bailey any more.

83
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,799
Do you think
she told anyone?

84
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,494
- About you and McDreamy?
- Yeah.

85
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,934
No, he's her boss too.

86
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:01,030
If they find out, what can they...?
Can they kick me out, or...?

87
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,008
No...
Not officially.

88
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,012
You'll just get edged out,

89
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,675
blacklisted, banned
from his surgeries,

90
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,684
passed over
for chief resident.

91
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,983
[Sighing] lt'll be humiliating,
but you'll live.

92
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,920
I have to end it.

93
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,051
I definitely have to end it.

94
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:24,255
- I have to end it, right?
- Meredith, shut up.

95
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,729
What?

96
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,994
[Meredith] Did you seriously
just tell me to shut up?

97
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,057
Oh, please.

98
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,162
You got a hot doctor who likes
to make you open up, and say "ahh."

99
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,571
It's the American dream,
stop whining about it.

100
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,076
No. No good can come from
sleeping with your boss.

101
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,271
- Cristina, you're late.
- So is Meredith.

102
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,473
[Meredith] Whatever
it is we're afraid of,

103
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,209
one thing holds true.

104
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,650
That, by the time the pain
of not doing a thing

105
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,653
gets worse than
the fear of doing it,

106
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,349
it can feel like we're
carrying around a giant tumor.

107
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,325
When we walk in this door,
you will maintain decorum.

108
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,954
You will not laugh,
vomit, or drop your jaw.

109
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,793
Are we understood?
[Door opening]

110
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,890
- Why would we laugh?
- Oh, just you wait.

111
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,798
Good morning,
Miss Connors.

112
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,598
[Miss Connors]
Good morning.

113
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,272
What is it?

114
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,971
Tumor.

115
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,411
[Meredith] And you thought
I was speaking metaphorically.

116
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,609
[Psapp: Nobody Knows]

117
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,907
Good morning, Annie.
How are you?

118
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,504
This is Dr. Bailey, and
these are my fellow interns.

119
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,880
Dr. Karev, we refer to
patients as "mister"...

120
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,942
I told him
to call me "Annie."

121
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,511
"Miss Connors" makes me
feel old and fat,

122
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:00,286
which I am,
but why feel that way?

123
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,055
[Burke] Good morning.

124
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,359
Annie, this is Dr. Burke.
[Whispering] Awesome surgeon.

125
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,797
Dr. Karev.

126
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:12,031
Annie Connors is a 43-year-old
woman who presented last night

127
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,404
with progressive shortness of
breath the past three months.

128
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,273
Found to have
a very large tumor

129
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,938
of unknown origin pressed
against her diaphragm.

130
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,173
Stable vital signs.

131
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,113
Scheduled for CT
this morning, sir.

132
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,981
Thank you, Dr. Karev.
Are you at all claustrophobic?

133
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,385
[Annie] I've been housebound
for the last year.

134
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,082
How claustrophobic
could I be?

135
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,351
[Burke] All right. Dr. Stevens
is going to take you up for a CT.

136
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,396
It'll give us a better look
at the tumor,

137
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,557
- and we'll know how to proceed.
- Could someone tell my mom?

138
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,931
She'll worry if she gets back,
and I'm not here.

139
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,095
Yeah, of course.
Of course.

140
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,937
And would it be possible
for Alex to take me instead?

141
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,533
I mean, he...

142
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,442
He's just so fun to look at.

143
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,606
[Chuckling] Annie.

144
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,081
[Burke] Sure.
Sure, Ms. Connors.

145
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,675
Excuse me.

146
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,745
[Lzzie] How much do you
think it weighs?

147
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:04,847
[George] 60 pounds.

148
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,051
More. She's carrying
a whole extra person.

149
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,458
This one's going in the books.
I've got to get in.

150
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,861
I almost did. Have you ever
seen Alex like that?

151
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,364
He actually seemed sincere.

152
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,230
"Seemed" being
the operative word.

153
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,768
He was on call
when she came in.

154
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,633
I am never leaving
this place again.

155
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,137
Let's move, people.

156
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,936
Ms. Connor's surgery,
should we choose to proceed,

157
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,807
will take most, if not all,
of the surgeons off the floor,

158
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,175
which means you people

159
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,646
will have to work extra hard
not to kill anyone,

160
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,115
'cause we won't be there
to fix your mistakes.

161
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,777
[Man] Dr. Burke.

162
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,016
[Woman over PA] Trauma team
to OR one. Trauma team to OR one.

163
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,420
I really want in on this.

164
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,288
I thought we weren't talking.

165
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,554
I'm not talking.
I'm just saying.

166
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,220
[Sighing]

167
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,288
Find her mother,
get a family history,

168
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,560
and I'll tell Bailey.

169
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,065
[Lzzie] Mr. Harper had
a coronary bypass yesterday.

170
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,369
His blood pressure,
currently 100l65.

171
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,308
It was running low
overnight down to 70l30,

172
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,174
but responded to medication.

173
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,613
Postoperative labs show a crit
of 30 and normal coagulation.

174
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,345
Chest-tube output has halted
over the last two hours.

175
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,909
[Bailey] What's your plan?

176
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,820
Chest x-ray and check the tube
for possible occlusion.

177
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,653
Good. He's doing fine.

178
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,125
[Exhaling] Thank you.

179
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,233
I know you think I like Meredith,
but I don't like Meredith.

180
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,295
What?

181
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,808
No. I like Meredith.
Obviously, I like Meredith.

182
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,936
I just... I just don't have
a thing for her.

183
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,001
OK.

184
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,411
It's just
this morning...

185
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,381
I know you were
probably just teasing,

186
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,577
But I don't want you
to say anything to her.

187
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,711
We live together,
and that'd be awkward.

188
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,914
- George, stop talking.
- OK, then.

190
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,958
'Morning.

191
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,162
Mr. Levangie,
this is Dr. Bailey

192
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,700
and her fine staff
of surgical interns.

193
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,208
Welcome to hell, kids.

00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,909
Who's presenting?

196
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,379
Edward Levangie is
a 63-year-old man admitted

197
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,348
for pain management
for Dyskinesia.

He's been stable
since last night,

to the bolus injections.

- [Burke] lzzie, treatments?
- [Lzzie] For Parkinson's disease?

201
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,652
Deep brain stimulation has...

202
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,887
Not for Parkinson's,
for spinal pain.

203
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,527
Oh, um...

204
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,093
Intraspinal catheter.

205
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,602
That way, he can have
constant pain medication.

206
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,605
Excellent.
This is Dr. Grey.

207
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,403
She's gonna prep you
for the procedure and assist.

00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,739
Excuse me.

210
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,047
You make yourselves busy,
I'll catch up with you.

211
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,430
[Woman] I'll see you over there.

Miranda.

213
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,967
Excuse me?

214
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,565
Well, that's your name, right?
It's on your jacket.

215
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,736
All right, I'll just
call you Bailey then.

216
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,576
You think you're charming
in that talented, neurotic,

217
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,139
overly moussed hair
sort of way, good for you.

218
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,151
But if you think
I'm going to stand back

219
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,811
and watch
while you favor her...

220
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,253
- I don't favor her. She's good.
- I'm sure she is.

221
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,883
Can I point out that,
technically, I'm your boss?

222
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,551
You don't scare me.

223
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,323
Look, I'm not
going to advertise

224
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,921
your extracurricular activities
with my intern.

225
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,366
However, the next time I see you
favoring Meredith Grey in any way,

226
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:40,428
I'll make sure she doesn't see
the inside of an OR for a month.

227
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,599
Just for the sake of balance.

- We're all set, doc.
- OK.

There's going to be
a microphone in there for you

231
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,942
in case you get scared

232
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,748
or you want to get out,
but try not to do that,

233
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,812
because then we're going
to have to start all over again.

234
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,482
I'm fine. I'll be fine.

235
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,492
I know you're going to be fine,

236
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,621
because I'm going to be right
over there, waiting for you.

- All right?
- OK.

00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,832
You ready?

239
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,529
Are you really ready?
Let's do this.

- [Machine buzzing]
- See ya.

Oh, hey, man,
you got an extra battery?

242
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,349
Unbelievable.

00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,513
- Oh, I know, right?
- I've never seen anything like this.

244
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:30,714
God.

245
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,690
Well, what I don't understand...

246
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,556
[over speaker]... is how
a person lets it get like that.

247
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,324
I mean, man,
that is a whole lot of nasty.

248
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,127
[Man] Maybe she's afraid
of doctors. Poor thing.

249
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,565
[Alex] Poor thing? Please.

250
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,830
If you're afraid of doctors,
you take a pill.

00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,067
She's just sick,
like, warped, you know?

252
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,667
Seriously, I don't know
how she lives with herself.

00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,076
[Laughing] Ugh.

254
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,444
Well, at first, we thought
she was just putting on weight.

255
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,487
When we realized
what was happening,

256
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,716
I tried to get her
to go to the doctor,

257
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,417
but she was scared.

258
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:10,087
And, the bigger it got,
the less she wanted to go.

259
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,689
And she never really felt
all that sick until last night.

260
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,197
She couldn't breathe.

261
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,361
Because the tumor
was crushing her lungs.

262
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,428
Yes, well, I called 911.

263
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,303
It just seemed like
the right thing to do.

264
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,310
You know, the right thing to do
would have been to call a year ago.

Is that rude? I'm sorry.
I'm so tired.

Is there something...?

00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,740
I was wondering
if you would talk to him.

278
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,908
About?

279

Brain surgery.

280
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,579
The doctor mentioned it,
and I've read about it online.

281
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,986
If it worked,
it could help

282
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,320
with most of his symptoms,
not just his pain.

283
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,424
Is he a candidate?

284
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,121
He is, but he's afraid of it.

285
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:20,359
Surgery on his back, he can
understand, but his brain...

286
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,423
And there are risks.

287
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,334
- But his quality of life...
- There isn't any.

288
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,628
And, it keeps getting worse.

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,117
I want him with me.
Maybe that's selfish, but...

293
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,179
You don't know what it's like
having a parent...

I do know what it's like.

297
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,031
I'll see what I can do.

is so high

that it's completely
displacing her lung tissue.

303
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,806
It's infiltrated her
spinal canal in three places.

304
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,144
We should start there.

305
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,084
It's going to take 3 or 4 hours
to get around those nerves.

306
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,621
I'd prefer to start in front,
and then flip her.

You never know
what vessels are involved.

308

on her lungs, she'll be dead.

wants to live?

She's been housebound.

313

She's been living
under this thing,

00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,303
just watching it grow for how long?
She doesn't seem stupid.

315

Doesn't even seem
all that scared.

316
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,183
Why would anyone wait this long,
unless they wanted to die?

317
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,084
People do things every day that
they know could kill them.

318

Doesn't mean
they want to die.

What are her chances
of surviving the surgery?

320
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,082
Slightly better
than if we do nothing.

321
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,617
So is it worth it?
Hey, come on.

322
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:01,154
You were already thinking it,
I'm just saying.

Mr. Levangie,
the Parkinson's patient,

00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,184
a good candidate for DBS?

331
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,522
Yes, but he's not interested.

332
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,559
OK, but I think it's worth
talking to him again, pushing him.

333
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,060
We're talking
about a brain surgery

334
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,792
that is performed while the patient
is awake, a risk of paralysis, death.

335
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,267
The patient doesn't want it. It is not
my job to push him into anything,

336
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,236
and it's definitely not yours.

337
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,397
OK...

338
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,908
You're uncomfortable with my decision.
It's best you don't scrub in.

339
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,911
- But...
- It's minor. You won't be missed.

they call you the Nazi.

long and difficult,

00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,098
but we have an extremely capable
surgical team, and I can...

346
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,399
Am I going to die?

347
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:19,366
There's always that risk,
but if we don't do the surgery...

348
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,377
I'll definitely die.

349
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,642
Yes.

350
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:24,910
Soon?

351
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,849
Yes.

352
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,414
- Mom, the room's clean.
- OK, honey, OK.

353
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,516
- Mom!
- She'll have the surgery.

354
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:38,461
- Mom!
- No. No, Annie.

355
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,054
She will have the surgery.

356
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,297
I guess I'll have the surgery.

357
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,341
I think that is
a very wise decision.

358
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,740
On one condition.
I don't want him there.

359
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,312
I'm sorry, Annie.
Did I upset you in some way?

360
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,477
If he's in the surgery,
I'm not having it.

361
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,785
That's how I live with myself.

362
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,820
[Burke] OK, Miss Connors.

363
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,618
Dr. Karev.

364
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,106
- What the hell did you do?
- Nothing. I-I don't know.

365
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,166
Man. The mike
must have been on.

366
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,041
If anything goes wrong, anything,

367
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:31,014
you are 60 percent more likely to be
sued if you've offended the patient.

368
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,573
I never would have
said that.

369
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,278
The mike shouldn't
have been on.

370
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,082
I didn't realize
she could hear me.

371
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,419
Now you won't realize
your chance to scrub in.

372
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,357
You're banned from the OR.
Mine or anyone else's. All week.

373
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,917
I got the history on the tumor.

374
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,895
It's been growing
for a year and a half.

375
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,454
It's the first time
she's even had it looked at.

376
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,524
It's like she's fatally lazy.

377
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,303
[Sighing]

378
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,363
Why doesn't she get banned?

379
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,205
Go prep Annie Connors
for surgery.

380
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,074
You're scrubbing in
with Cristina.

381
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:03,376
Really?
I mean, thank you. OK.

382
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,781
We just need to recheck
your labs and get an EKG,

383
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,445
so I just need
to take a little blood.

384
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,114
Dr. Burke is great,
and Dr. Bailey.

385
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,784
- I know you're probably scared.
- That's OK, kitten.

386
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,486
You can just do your job.

387
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,359
You don't have to talk to
the fat, nasty tumor lady.

388
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,558
I mean, I let it get this bad.
How much sympathy do I deserve?

389
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,628
Why did you let it
get this bad?

390
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,304
You're the first person since
I got here to ask me that.

391
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,242
Well, I guess it's just like
the elephant in the room.

392
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,246
- Elephant?
- I mean...

393
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,147
It's more like a giant sow,
don't you think?

394
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,391
Every time I went to
the hospital, someone died.

395
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,495
All four of my grandparents,
then my dad.

396
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,293
My best friend's mom,

397
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,425
my baby sister.

398
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,767
They all went in,
never came out.

399
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,632
So I put it off.

400
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,835
You know, you're not the
only one to put things off.

401
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,404
I never do anything till
the last possible minute.

402
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,972
Like what?

403
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,142
Well...

404
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,654
I've had this thing for my
roommate since, like, day one,

405
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:22,285
and I just...
I can't tell her.

406
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,159
She probably wouldn't
go out with me, anyway, but...

407
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,425
How do I know that
for sure,

408
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,764
if I don't ever ask?

409
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,202
Seriously?

410
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,867
You're equating your pathetic love life
with my record-breaking tumor?

411
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,178
Seriously?

412
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,645
[The Ditty Bops:
Walk or Ride]

413
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:46,172
It's just that he blatantly
favors me in front of her

414
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,980
and then blatantly dismisses me.

415
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,681
How do you know
he was favoring you?

416
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,725
Look, you've got a brain.
You got into this program.

417
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,453
Shepherd munching your cookies

418
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,223
doesn't mean you didn't deserve
what you worked for.

419
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,424
But he's making me look bad.

420
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,864
I have to end it.

421
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,232
- Right.
- It's over.

422
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,536
Is it true you get
to scrub in on that tumor?

423
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,870
- Don't sit here.
- You get to scrub in?

424
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,409
How psyched are you?

425
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,912
On a scale of one
to ecstatic, ecstatic.

426
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,448
I think Burke wants to get
into your scrubs.

427
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,847
Why are you sitting here?

428
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:22,080
He kicked me off that surgery
for the same crap you pull every day.

429
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,646
If I stuck this fork into his thigh,
would I get in trouble?

430
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,749
Not if you make it
look like an accident.

431
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,316
- Hey.
- Hi!

432
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,062
Thank God, man.
I'm drowning in estrogen here.

433
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,567
You look... Is everything OK?

434
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,097
Shepherd's a jackass.

435
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,071
Really? I think
he's kind of great.

436
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,266
He reamed her out
in front of Bailey.

437
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,572
- [Lzzie] Why?
- 'Cause he's a jackass.

438
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,578
- Oh.
- [Tray clattering]

439
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,240
Well, bad days are... bad.

440
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,114
[George] Maybe tonight,
uh, if, you know,

441
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,086
if you drink alcohol,
I mean, we could

442
00:20:56,154 --> 00:21:01,251
all of us, I mean,
go out and drink alcohol...

443
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,556
Because of the bad day.

444
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,062
[Pager beeping]

445
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,701
I got to go.

446
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,969
Dude.

447
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,734
Shut up.

448
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,735
[Laughs]

449
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,749
How's your back?

450
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,618
- Still good.
- Good. How are you?

451
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,488
Can you lean forward for me?
I want to check something.

452
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,117
- Does that feel OK?
- Yeah.

453
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,719
- Right here?
- Did you page?

454
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,463
Mr. Levangie, have you given
any more thought

455
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:45,594
about the other surgical options
we discussed this morning?

456
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,729
What?

457
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,802
Why would I?
I already told you no.

458
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,241
I'm letting you cut
into my back,

459
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,304
But that's not enough
for you.

460
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,406
All you guys ever want
to do is cut.

461
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,314
Dad, just listen
to what he has to say.

462
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,784
I already listened.

463
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,681
Sir, there's a very small
window of opportunity here.

464
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,555
Once the Parkinson's progresses
to a point of dementia,

465
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,822
you're no longer
a candidate for DBS.

466
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:14,024
And when I'm no longer
a candidate,

467
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:19,264
is that when you people
will leave me the hell alone!

468
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,430
What?

469
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,770
Do I have to start drooling,
and forget my name

470
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,537
to get a little
peace and quiet?

471
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,213
All right.
I'll check back with you later.

472
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,771
Try to get some rest.

473
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,544
Dad, you're being unreasonable.

474
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,644
The doctors are only
trying to help you.

475
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,384
It's my damn life,
and it's my damn brain.

476
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,619
You want me to let them
cut up my brain

477
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,025
while I'm lying here awake,
for what?

478
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:47,327
- Dad!
- I'll be at your wedding.

479
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,661
I will sit in the back.

480
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,066
Your uncle will walk you
down the aisle.

481
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,334
I know it's not perfect,
but it's life.

482
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,374
Life is messy sometimes.

483
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,241
I know that.

484
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,304
[Sighs]

485
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,007
If she knows,

486
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,646
then what the hell are we
still talking for, huh?

487
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,849
Why in hell can't she drop it?

488
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,390
It is your life.
But it's her life too.

489
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,298
And you have a chance
to get better here.

490
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,735
And all she's asking
you to do is try.

491
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,581
If they pull this off,
I'm totally calling Oprah.

492
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,781
You two been working out?

493
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,717
Sometimes I jog,

494
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,189
and I try to take
the stairs whenever possible.

495
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,452
[Cristina] Why?

496
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,255
See that large pile of tumor?

497
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:52,160
You're going to be retracting it
for the next 14 hours,

498
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,222
so I'm just saying I hope
you have strong backs.

499
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,394
Dr. Shepherd.

500
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,367
Yes?

501
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,931
Mr. Levangie has agreed
to DBS.

502
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,773
If we do it today.

503
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,336
If he leaves,
he won't come back.

504
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,248
Don't worry,
Dr. Shepherd.

505
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,084
It'll take hours before we
get around to the spine.

506
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,717
- I'll page you.
- All right, then.

507
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,553
Let's do it.

508
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,102
Dr. Bailey.

509
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,501
I didn't know...

510
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,171
...that he was my boss,
when I met him. I didn't know.

511
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,646
- I don't care.
- Really?

512
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:47,082
Oh, well, you sort of seemed
to not be talking to me, so I...

513
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,484
You see this,
what's happening right here?

514
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,853
This is the problem with
you sleeping with my boss.

515
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,915
Not whether or not
you knew him before,

516
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,257
but how it affects my day.

517
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,388
And me standing here
talking to you

518
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,932
about your sex life
affects my day.

519
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,094
And the longer this
little fling goes on,

520
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,764
the more favors you get
over the others,

521
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,137
who are fighting tooth
and nail just to make it

522
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,540
through this program
without any assistance.

523
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,546
When those people start
finding out what's going on

524
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,673
and they don't want
to work with you

525
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,115
and talk to you
or look at you,

526
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,518
and they start
bitching and moaning at me,

527
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,148
the more it affects my day.

528
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,748
So, no, Dr. Grey,

529
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,023
I don't care what you knew,
or when you knew it.

530
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,030
Are we understood?

531
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,365
- Yes.
- Good.

532
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,206
[Alex] This sucks.

533
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,112
I'm not a real
fan of yours, either.

534
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,673
Not you. This. Everyone
is scrubbed in somewhere.

535
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,743
Bright side, we have
the run of the floor.

536
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,310
Want to do it
in the stairwell?

537
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,789
I'm just saying you
never know what could happen.

538
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:00,847
[Vomiting]

539
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,917
I'm changing.

540
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,462
I'll page you
if I need you.

541
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,054
You do that.

542
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,492
You are so my
favorite person today.

543
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,198
- [Machine beeping]
- [Doctors chattering]

544
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,500
Begin more suction.

545
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,673
We need to hang
another bag of O-neg.

546
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:23,202
Cauterizing the small bleeders
to keep my visual field clean.

547
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,976
God, is your back
killing you?

548
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,042
George, shut up.
We're in here.

549
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,519
[Man] Hold it right there.

550
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,155
Mrs. Harper, let me show you
these chest films.

551
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,996
We were able to relieve the
obstruction of his chest tube,

552
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:44,035
so the buildup of fluid you see
should resolve itself soon.

553
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,699
Which translates as
he should be home in no time.

554
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,572
He was making waffles.

555
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,837
I'm sorry?

556
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,173
He was making waffles.

557
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,906
He was mixing the batter,
and...

558
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,074
and then,
he was on the floor.

559
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,117
Izzie, we need
a central line run in 204.

560
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,551
- Page Dr. Karev, will you?
- He's not answering.

561
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,419
[Sighs] I'm so sorry.
I'll be back.

562
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,123
[Pager beeping]

563
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,959
Like what you see, right?

564
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,035
[Woman] Neuro sponge.

565
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,004
How you doing,
Mr. Levangie?

566
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,070
All right.

567
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,548
Drill bit's charged.

568
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:33,879
Where's blondie?

569
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,352
I'm right here.
Can't you see me?

570
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,412
I'm shaky.
I'm not blind.

571
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,481
Anything goes wrong here,
I'm blaming you.

572
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:45,120
OK, in that case,
I'll stay where you can see me.

573
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,426
[Woman] We have to drill
a hole and try to find

574
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,229
the spot that controls
the motor function.

575
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,201
You can't see my brain
from there.

576
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,602
Aren't you supposed
to be learning something?

577
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,800
I'm good, right here.

578
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,739
- [Woman] EEG waves look good.
- OK, Mr. Levangie.

579
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,439
Just take a couple
deep breaths.

580
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,005
- Focus on the pretty girl.
- [Whirring]

581
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,109
[Derek] This is going to sound
really scary, but try and relax.

582
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,619
You shouldn't feel a thing.

583
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,047
- Any pain here? Here?
- No.

584
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,558
- OK.
- [Pager beeping]

585
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,357
Dr. Stevens, I need you
to check the x-ray in 2103.

586
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,830
2118 needs post-op notes,
and Jane's wondering

587
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,764
if you want her to
start feeding 2112.

588
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,233
I'm going on break.

589
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,701
OK, yeah, before you do that,

590
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,294
could you page Dr. Karev again?

591
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,033
- I already paged him.
- Again?

592
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,871
- [Man] Irrigation.
- [Woman] Little more pressure.

593
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,571
Excuse me.
How is it?

594
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,376
[Man] Long and slow.
I don't envy those two.

595
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,247
They've been holding
that thing for eight hours.

596
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:43,378
Their arms have to be ready
to fall off.

597
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,254
[Burke] Look at the size
of this artery.

598
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,587
My God.

599
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,651
It's as thick as a thumb.

600
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,255
You ever seen a vessel this size?

601
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,391
No.

602
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,199
This thing's just feeding
on all her blood.

603
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,364
We need more O-negative.

604
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,408
[Woman] I'll call the blood bank.

605
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,602
[Clinking]

606
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,613
[Burke] Damn it, O'Malley.
You want me to kill this patient?

607
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,171
No, I... Sorry.

608
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,877
I mean, is the art of retracting
just too much for you?

609
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,544
No, I was, uh...

610
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,212
Um...

611
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,316
I had an itch.

612
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,159
Way to go, George.
Nicely done.

613
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,225
Just keep trying, Mr. Levangie.
Mimic my motions.

614
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,362
You can do it.

615
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,702
You're doing great, Mr. Levangie.
Just a little longer.

616
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,332
Oh, damn it!

617
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,735
Take a breath and try again.

618
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,247
One more time,
Mr. Levangie.

619
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,215
The probe is almost in.

620
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,082
You'll know it
when we find the right spot.

621
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,927
[Woman] Well, how about that?

622
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,797
[Derek]
There it is.

623
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:07,065
I'll be a son of a bitch.

624
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,641
[Derek] Bailey was on the warpath.
I was trying to protect you.

625
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:22,083
You trying to protect me
is why she's on the warpath.

626
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,747
You can't ask me to scrub in,
when I haven't earned it.

627
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,812
OK, OK.

628
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,950
You can't treat me like crap
when I haven't earned that.

629
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,426
I can take care of myself.

630
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,861
I got myself into this mess, and I...

631
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,489
And you'll get yourself out?

632
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:37,262
I don't... know that yet.

633
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,893
[Pager beeping]

634
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,530
Don't let me keep you.

635
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,599
You did great work here today.

636
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,678
Dr. Shepherd.

637
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,112
Yeah?

638
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,480
Sorry I called you a jackass.

639
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,745
You didn't.

640
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,913
I did. Twice.

641
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,457
Tell you what, blondie.

642
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,051
If you don't marry him, I will.

643
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,992

644
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,165
[Pager beeping]

645
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:23,141
No, no, no, Jimmy!
No, no, Jimmy, no!

646
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,409
- What we got?
- Pressure plummeted to 64l22,

647
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,849
and he has runs of V-tach
that aren't perfusing.

648
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,250
CVP is sky-high.

649
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,652
- Give him dopamine, ten mikes.
- He's maxed out.

650
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,214
The resident was here an hour ago.
I can't reach him.

651
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,159
- Of course you can't.
- Do something! What's the matter?

652
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,219
- Get her out of here!
- No, no!

653
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,527
Mrs. Harper,
you have to get out of here.

654
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,432
Does he have
a myocardial ischemia?

655
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,833
No, it's a clot. Big one.

656
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,771
- Page someone.
- He'll be dead before they get here.

657
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,866
You have to open him up,
right here, right now.

658
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,876
- You said he was OK!
- Get out of here now!

659
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,106
You have to cut.

660
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,472
I can't. I've never seen it done.
I could kill him.

661
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,347
Do nothing,
you'll kill him faster.

662
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,579
- Your glove size?
- Six.

663
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,645
Oh, God. Oh, God.

664
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,383
Take a breath, Dr. Stevens.

665
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,153
She has to move over there.
Walter, move out of the way.

666
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,462
Cut the stitches
and then the staples.

667
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,831
Don't let them fall
into the chest cavity.

668
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,598
Wait. I've never cracked
a chest before.

669
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,004
Oh, God. Oh, God.

670
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,037
No pulse. Wide complex rhythm.

671
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,106
I can't get this clot out.
I need more suction. I need more.

672
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,982
He's bradying down.
You have to get the clot out.

673
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,055
I can't get it.

674
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,121
Screw it. I'm using my hand.

675
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,489
[Woman] Oh, God, look
at the size of that clot.

676
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:49,722
Anything?

677
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,029
No.

678
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,536
You have to massage
the heart, doctor.

679
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,871
Come on. Come on.

680
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,541
Come on, please.

681
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,743
Come on, Mr. Harper.

682
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,109
We have a pulse.

683
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,088
[Lzzie panting]

684
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,154
OK, follow with suction.

685
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,893
[Shepherd]
How's it going?

686
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,561
It's more intertwined
than the studies made it look.

687
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,036
[Bailey] I need another bag.
Call the blood bank.

688
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,199
We need more O-negative.

689
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,300
I'm down 10 units of blood,
and I haven't even flipped her yet.

690
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,436
Oh, wow.

691
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,241
Hmm.

692
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,474
Hold it steady.

693
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,140
Look at that.

694
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,616
Sponge.

695
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,520
How am I supposed to get
around that artery?

696
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,523
Let me call down
and see...

697
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,458
OK.

698
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,462
All right, then. Forceps.

699
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,523
Here you go.

700
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,334
Excuse me.

701
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,098
God, it's unbelievable.

702
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,331
Right.

703
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,432
How did she live like that?

704
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,205
Watch what you say.
You never know who's listening.

705
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,472
[Laughing]

706
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,979
Look at George.

707
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,539
He looks like
he's about to fall in.

708
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:17,083
Are you really as shallow
and callous as you seem?

709
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,953
Oh, you want to go out
for a drink later

710
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,254
and hear about my secret pain?

711
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,191
Does that line ever work for you?

712
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,524
Sometimes.

713
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,393
Oh.

714
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,592
Must be because you look like that.

715
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:30,964
Like what?

716
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,736
[Chuckling] So is that a yes?

717
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,198
No.

718
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,675
I can't. I'm seeing someone.

719
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,770
Look, if you don't want
to go out with me, just say so.

720
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,405
No need to lie.

721
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,210
Oh, OK.

722
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,719
Well, I don't want
to go out with you.

723
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:53,086
But I think I really
might be seeing someone.

724
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,182
[Woman] Yeah.
No, it's up here.

725
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,056
It's up here.
It's up here.

726
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,358
We're still in the
middle of surgery.

727
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,365
Mr. Harper, the post-op
heart patient in 2114.

728
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,765
I had to open
his sternotomy bedside.

729
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,868
- You what?
- [All] What?

730
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,303
What?

731
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,636
He had cardiac tamponade.

732
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,575
His chest films were clean
this morning. It happened fast.

733
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,305
He was in PEA.
There was no time.

734
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,643
Go ahead. I got it.

735
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,412
We're OK here.
Yeah, I need some retraction.

736
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,387
- Pull back on the retractor.
- I got it.

737
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,122
You opened a heart bedside,
and you couldn't even page me?

738
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,319
Needed all the glory
for yourself, right?

739
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,259
I paged you 50 times.

740
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,231
Do you have any idea
what I have been through?

741
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,757
Oh, man. The battery.
I forgot to change it.

742
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,202
You forgot? You forgot?!

743
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,830
You are hateful!

744
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,738
You are a hateful, hateful, lazy,

745
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,006
arrogant, hateful man!

746
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,307
Hateful!

747
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,712
Never a dull moment
here at Seattle Grace.

748
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,682
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

749
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,013
Get right in there.

750
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,350
She can't afford
to lose this much blood.

751
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,855
Get me some suction.
I can't see what I'm doing.

752
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,824
Clamp, clamp, clamp, please.

753
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,161
Is there any blood
in the rapid infuser?

754
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:09,631
We're waiting on two units.

755
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,065
What do you mean, waiting?

756
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:13,000
We didn't anticipate
this blood loss.

757
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,901
We prepped double.
We've used it all.

758
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,497
- What did you cut?
- [Bailey] Nothing. It just blew.

759
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,873
She came in
with too much damage.

760
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,469
The artery walls are too weak.

761
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,105
Annie, come on.

762
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,548
- Ten units of O-negative.
- I cannot see.

763
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:30,678
Give me your hand. Push down here.
Pull it towards you. Suction!

764
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,279
The pressure's dropping.

765
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,880
Where the hell is the blood?!

766
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,389
Somebody grab that.
Push it back, George. Come on.

767
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,227
[All panting]

768
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,634
Oh, God. Just squeeze it off
right there.

769
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,638
Here we go.

770
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,306
Is that O-negative for OR 1?

771
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,403
Uh-huh, OR 1.

772
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,880
OR 1, right? I got it! I got it!

773
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,717
Some suction, please,
in here, now.

774
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,983
- [Flatlining]
- We're losing her now.

775
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,992
Look at this. Come on.

776
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,051
[Flatlining continues]

777
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,072
Oh, come on! Come on!

778
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,135
[Grunting]

779
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,883
Come on!

780
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,945
[Panting]

781
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,855
[Monitor switches off]

782
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,670
Time of death is 11:42.

783
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,656
I got it!

784
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:31,370
[Butterfly Boucher: Never
Leave Your Heart Alone]

785
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,947
[Meredith] The early bird
catches the worm.

786
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,012
A stitch in time saves nine.

787
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:48,685
Messy.

788
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,090
I'm sorry.

789
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,652
Don't be. You saved his life.

790
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,338
[Meredith] He who hesitates is lost.

791
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,046
We can't pretend
we haven't been told.

792
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,556
We've all heard
the proverbs,

793
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,787
heard the philosophers,

794
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:29,265
heard our grandparents
warning us about wasted time,

795
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,734
heard the damn poets
urging us to seize the day.

796
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:39,173
Still, sometimes,
we have to see for ourselves.

797
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,882
I'm not doing you
any more favors.

798
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,324
This was it.

799
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,862
I've been holding up
50 pounds of tumor

800
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,487
for the past 12 hours.

801
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,259
My back's
going to need traction,

802
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,324
and the patient
died anyways.

803
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,962
And you think
you did me a favor?

804
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,062
Look, I'm just...

805
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,272
What is this...

806
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,505
...that we're doing here?

807
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,410
What is it?

808
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,582
You need a definition?

809
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,281
You really want to be
that guy?

810
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,090
[Meredith] We have to make
our own mistakes.

811
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,522
Lock the door.

812
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:41,031
We have to learn
our own lessons.

813
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,800
Have you seen Meredith?

814
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:45,740
Save yourself the misery, man.
She's off the market.

815
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,745
What? No, that's not...
We're just friends.

816
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:49,802
Whatever.

817
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,371
But she's not. I mean,
if she was seeing someone,

818
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,441
I live with her, I would know it.

819
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,661
[Meredith] We have to sweep
today's possibility

820
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,063
under tomorrow's rug
until we can't anymore,

821
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,126
until we finally understand
for ourselves

822
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,604
what Benjamin Franklin meant.

823
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,469
That knowing is better
than wondering.

824
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,111
That waking is
better than sleeping.

825
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,954
I, um, know this place

826
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,154
where there's an amazing view

827
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,290
of sunrise over the ferryboats.

828
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,930
I have a thing for ferryboats.

829
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,931
I remember.

830
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,910
And that even the biggest failure,

831
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,389
even the worst,
most intractable mistake

832
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,517
beats the hell
out of never trying.
