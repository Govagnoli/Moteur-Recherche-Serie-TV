1
00:00:00,404 --> 00:00:01,841
Previously on Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:03,944
I had sex last night,
with the wrong person.

3
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:06,451
But the thing is,
it didn't fell wrong.

4
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:07,934
This is our secret, okay?

5
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:09,146
We heard about your mother.

6
00:00:09,165 --> 00:00:10,686
We're here to make sure
you're okay.

7
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:13,065
What if my husband shows up
tomorrow with a picture of

8
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:15,300
what I'm supposed
to look like, but it's too late,

9
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:17,369
I'm stuck with the wrong
face for rest of my life?

10
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:20,165
Cristina and I were together
for three years.

11
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:21,666
- Are you gonna invite me?
- Where?

12
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,140
- To the wedding.
- Please leave.

13
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:26,287
<i>A patient history,</i>

14
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:28,597
<i>is as important
as their symptoms.</i>

15
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:32,407
<i>It's what helps us decide
if heartburn's a heart attack,</i>

16
00:00:33,524 --> 00:00:34,972
<i>if a headache's a tumor.</i>

17
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:41,036
<i>Sometimes patients will try
to rewrite their own histories.</i>

18
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:42,429
<i>They'll claim they don't smoke</i>

19
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:44,963
<i>or forget to mention
certain drugs,</i>

20
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,230
<i>which, in surgery,</i>

21
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,216
<i>can be the kiss of death.</i>

22
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:55,816
<i>We can ignore it all we want...</i>

23
00:00:57,786 --> 00:00:59,016
<i>But our history...</i>

24
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,688
<i>eventually always comes back
to haunt us.</i>

25
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:09,541
Meredith, she'll accept
a certain amount of help,

26
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:11,226
and then she start
to feel suffocated.

27
00:01:12,146 --> 00:01:15,160
Oh. Is this...
Am I suffocating?

28
00:01:15,262 --> 00:01:16,857
No. The groceries are just right.

29
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:19,590
It's... It's me.
I sometimes overdo it.

30
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,336
Well, who could blame you
with everything?

31
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:22,752
After Ellis died,

32
00:01:22,796 --> 00:01:25,006
I gave her some time,
but I want to be here.

33
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:27,648
- I want to help make things easier.
- Good. Yeah. That's great.

34
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,723
I just try to keep it light.
You know, be helpful.

35
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:32,017
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

36
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:33,792
- Want some coffee?
- Yes.

37
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:36,309
This all you?

38
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,534
I just picked up some things
to restock your fridge.

39
00:01:38,553 --> 00:01:40,112
Well, you bought groceries last week.

40
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:42,375
Yeah, you have to get it
every week if you want more.

41
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:45,672
Well, thank you.

42
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:48,677
It's unexpected, and you
didn't need to do all this.

43
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,806
- Is this for everybody?
- Absolutely.

44
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:53,198
I gotta run.
I'm gonna go talk to Richard

45
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:54,925
before things get too busy
in the hospital.

46
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,179
- See ya.
- Are you gonna talk to him about the...

47
00:01:57,235 --> 00:01:58,944
Yeah. Wish me luck.
You don't need it.

48
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:00,550
Just make him listen to you.

49
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:02,062
You deserve to be chief.

50
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:10,827
Nice sweater.

51
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:14,395
Uh... my wife.

52
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:16,647
- What?
- My wife,

53
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:17,898
she gave it to me.

54
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:19,231
The sweater.

55
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:22,033
Actually, it's my ex-wife.

56
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:25,735
- It's amicable.
- I'm sorry?

57
00:02:25,894 --> 00:02:27,622
The divorce, it's... it's amicable,

58
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:28,918
very friendly.

59
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,514
I'm a friendly guy.

60
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:41,900
- "I'm a friendly guy"?
- Sloan.

61
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:44,087
She pressed five
and got off at three.

62
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,980
She'd rather walk up two flights
of stairs than flirt with you.

63
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,290
Hell, she'd rather climb up
the outside of the building.

64
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,450
- I wasn't flirting.
- You're telling me.

65
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:57,331
There's no need
to be embarrassed.

66
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:58,833
Time for you
to shake off the rust

67
00:02:58,852 --> 00:02:59,988
and get back in the game.

68
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:03,617
- You need a wingman.
- I have patients to see.

69
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:06,489
We'd make a great team.

70
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,821
Nothing like a quick
ventricular reconstruction

71
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,154
to jumpstart your morning, eh?

72
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:13,287
Okay, you're officially
becoming creepy,

73
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:15,291
creepy and... stalking.

74
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:17,718
Burke and I have set our date.
We're getting married next month.

75
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:20,254
We both know that
you are not the marrying kind.

76
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:22,260
You don't know that.
You don't know me anymore.

77
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:23,628
Well, just to be sure you're...

78
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,633
fully aware of
what you're passing up.

79
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:26,847
I'd like you to assist me

80
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:29,373
on my heterotopic
heart transplant today.

81
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:32,668
What, a piggyback transplant?
Seriously?

82
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:35,381
Burke will want to scrub in,
too, I imagine,

83
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,523
see how it's done.

84
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:42,312
Heterotopic transplant.
He is upping his game.

85
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:43,855
I need a gambit.

86
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,876
I need to force him
into the defensive.

87
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:46,972
Take his queen.

88
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:50,428
- You've never played chess?
- I'm not a geek.

89
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,785
I've gotta crush him.

90
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:53,353
I've gotta annihilate him
at his own game.

91
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:54,367
So it's weird, right,

92
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:56,132
that susan keeps stopping by
like this?

93
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,711
I mean, we just became friends
or semi-related

94
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:00,768
or whatever you call
your estranged father's wife.

95
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:03,002
You may be confused since you
were basically raised by wolves,

96
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:04,323
but this is what mother's do.

97
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:06,248
They stop by,
they stock the fridge.

98
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,124
Dude, you think
she might do our laundry?

99
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,833
Hey, get your own fake mom.

100
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:11,857
Hey.

101
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:14,502
- Bad night on call?
- Oh, god.

102
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:16,890
Yeah, when my patient's
gooey abscess

103
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,543
exploded all over me
at 4:00 A.M.,

104
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:21,023
- that was a highlight.
- Holy mary, mother of god...

105
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:23,946
Pray for us sinners now and at the...

106
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,381
Iz, you look nice.

107
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,230
Did you just come from
confession in a church?

108
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:29,420
Shut up.

109
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:33,352
Izzie Stevens does penance.
You did something bad.

110
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:36,948
Oh. I feel like poo.

111
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:39,016
I hope I can make it through
the day without falling asleep.

112
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:40,743
Do you want to make a coffee date?

113
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:42,865
3:00 P.M.
You could use a little pick-me-up.

114
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,786
Yeah. That sounds nice,
really nice.

115
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:47,354
- Good
- Okay.

116
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:54,597
Smile.

117
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,432
Oh, come on, man.
That's not a smile.

118
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,502
Can I see?

119
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:01,511
That's me?

120
00:05:02,147 --> 00:05:03,152
Oh, my god.

121
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,344
I know this is gonna sound terrible,

122
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:07,534
but I'm not bad-looking.

123
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:09,881
I think beautiful
is the word you're looking for.

124
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:11,541
I was gonna say hot.

125
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:13,409
I was too
but I would've gotten in trouble.

126
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:15,362
- You would've.
- Still a little swelling.

127
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,455
In a day or two,
I'll raise that hot to smokin'.

128
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,726
Then shouldn't we wait
to take the "after" pictures?

129
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:21,465
We could,
but the sooner we take them,

130
00:05:21,474 --> 00:05:22,592
the sooner we get them
out there.

131
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,260
Your picture's gonna be everywhere.
The police, the news, the internet.

132
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:27,160
But my face looks
completely different,

133
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,963
then what good
would pictures do?

134
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,094
I was able to maintain
aspects of your bone structure,

135
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:33,702
so your face bears some
similarities to your old face,

136
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:36,053
plus, your... your hair
and your eyes are the same.

137
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:39,469
You think... Do you really think
someone might recognize me?

138
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:40,878
I think you should smile.

139
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:45,122
I'm telling you,
this confession thing,

140
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:46,746
it... it really works.

141
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:49,784
It's like we have a do over.
Our sin is gone.

142
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:51,484
So you don't have to keep avoiding me.

143
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:53,390
Yeah, I do.
Until this thing blows over, I do.

144
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,090
Javier Ruggero?

145
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:59,045
Javier, uh, Ruggero?

146
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:00,751
Blows over?

147
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,460
What does that even mean?

148
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:03,594
When Meredith and I, uh...

149
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:05,981
eventually, you know,
it blew over. It passed.

150
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:07,380
You mean the sad sex?

151
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,257
The sad, tragic,
depression-inducing sex

152
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:10,934
you had with Meredith is the same

153
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:11,951
- as what...
- I can't.

154
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:15,875
Okay? Back off.
Just for now, back off.

155
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,112
Javier... Ruggero?

156
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:21,896
You're Dr. Isobel Stevens?

157
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,360
Yes.

158
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,946
Uh, if you're Mr. Ruggero, though,
you're with Dr. O'Malley.

159
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:27,112
Uh, Dr. Stevens...

160
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:28,286
We, uh...

161
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,074
Our d... Our daughter has leukemia

162
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:33,187
and needs a bone marrow transplant.

163
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:35,172
You, uh,
you're looking for hematology.

164
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,227
It's third floor west.
Through these double doors,

165
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:38,975
second set of elevators on the...

166
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:41,071
on the right.

167
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:44,858
I'm so sorry
about your daughter.

168
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:46,473
But Seattle Grace
has one of the best

169
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:48,670
bone marrow transplant centers
in the country.

170
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:50,416
If you'd like, I can
take you up there myself.

171
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:51,553
No, no, it's just that...

172
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:55,299
You look so much like
our daughter.

173
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:58,110
We're Dustin and Caroline Klein.

174
00:06:58,755 --> 00:06:59,948
We're Hannah's parents.

175
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:02,381
We're her...

176
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:05,152
We're your daughter's parents.

177
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:07,418
You're Hannah's birth mother.

178
00:07:14,663 --> 00:07:16,109
Hannah was diagnosed
a few months ago

179
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,535
with acute
myeloid leukemia.

180
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,437
We, uh, we looked you up,

181
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:20,829
and we know that
that's wrong, but...

182
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:24,019
She needs the transplant.
We... We were set to go.

183
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:26,162
- We had a donor.
- Yeah, her donor died.

184
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:28,277
The registry called
Hannah's oncologist last night.

185
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,601
'Cause apparently
Hannah hasn't had enough bad luck.

186
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:31,816
And we'd never ask.

187
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,581
We had no intention
of bothering you, ever.

188
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,337
But last night,
everything changed.

189
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:37,240
No. Of course.

190
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:40,752
Of course I'd donate. It's just...

191
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:45,585
A biological parent
isn't usually a good donor.

192
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:46,872
I'm only a half match.

193
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:48,312
Hannah would probably do better

194
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:50,195
getting back on the donor list
and waiting.

195
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:54,210
I know...

196
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:56,608
When you gave her up,

197
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:59,502
we promised
to take care of her,

198
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:00,751
to keep her safe,

199
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,009
but I-I can't protect her
from this.

200
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:05,860
It's genetic.

201
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,095
You have to take care of her.

202
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:10,301
Every day we wait,
she gets sicker.

203
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:11,898
And... And if we're lucky,

204
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,077
you... you could be better
than a half match.

205
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:19,229
Is she...

206
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:21,841
She's here?

207
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:26,483
God, she must be scared.

208
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:28,511
She's upstairs
with my mother.

209
00:08:30,072 --> 00:08:31,077
Can I...

210
00:08:35,217 --> 00:08:37,010
I'd... I'd like to meet her.

211
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:39,330
We... We'd have to check with Hannah.

212
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:41,363
But if she agrees,

213
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:43,569
of course we'd be okay with it.

214
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:48,504
Isobel...

215
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,886
Our daughter could die.

216
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,759
Charles...
This is Dr. Burke.

217
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:00,921
I've invited him to assist
on the surgery.

218
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:03,738
- How do you do, Dr. Burke?
- Oh, you're playing yourself?

219
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:06,487
It distracts me from the fact
that you're going to have

220
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:08,534
your hands in my chest
in a few hours.

221
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:11,477
And this, Charles, is
a former student of mine...

222
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:14,260
A formidable chess player
herself... Dr. Cristina Yang.

223
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,035
Soon to be Dr. Cristina Burke.

224
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:18,553
we're getting married next month.

225
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:20,290
Congratulations.

226
00:09:20,402 --> 00:09:21,417
Thank you, sir.

227
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:23,325
Perhaps you'd like to explain...

228
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:25,926
The procedure, Dr. Yang.

229
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:26,977
Absolutely.

230
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:28,623
Mr. Redford,

231
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:31,655
instead of replacing
your current heart,

232
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:33,570
we're going to attach it
to the new heart,

233
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:34,923
essentially piggybacking it.

234
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:37,760
The two hearts pump together,
share the workload.

235
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:38,792
It's, uh...

236
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:40,330
It's a perfect team.

237
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:42,302
More accurately,

238
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,308
the new heart will circulate
blood to the body,

239
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,287
while the native heart
will pump blood to the lungs.

240
00:09:47,307 --> 00:09:49,381
More of a divide-and-conquer
approach.

241
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,639
Wouldn't you say, Dr. Yang?

242
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:52,708
Sounds risky?

243
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:54,830
All surgeries carry
a degree of risk,

244
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,836
but Dr. Marlowe pioneered
the procedure.

245
00:09:56,855 --> 00:09:59,947
And Dr. Burke is one of the foremost
cardiothoracic surgeons

246
00:09:59,957 --> 00:10:02,436
- in the country.
- I'll be the one on point, of course.

247
00:10:02,454 --> 00:10:04,069
So you've nothing to worry about.

248
00:10:04,107 --> 00:10:07,093
You've picked the best man
for the job.

249
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:10,354
What was that?

250
00:10:10,452 --> 00:10:12,430
That was my smug,
passive-aggressive,

251
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,543
limey ex-boyfriend
trying to show me

252
00:10:14,562 --> 00:10:15,896
I picked the wrong guy.

253
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:17,646
I-I know,
and I'm fine with it

254
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:19,242
as long as I'm learning something.

255
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,960
I was actually talking about you.

256
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,660
What was that?

257
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:24,521
You're gonna have to put up
with me

258
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:26,436
being nice and sweet
for a little while.

259
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:28,748
That'll be a nice change of pace.

260
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:30,394
Shut up.

261
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:31,737
That's more like it.

262
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:34,514
Hey, I saw Ava.

263
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:35,923
She looks terrific.

264
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:38,467
Yeah, yeah, she does.
Sloan kicked it out.

265
00:10:38,652 --> 00:10:40,755
Yeah, well, you had something
to do with that, too.

266
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:41,985
Just doing my job.

267
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:45,092
Jeez.
You cannot take a compliment.

268
00:10:45,403 --> 00:10:48,106
Well, I just don't want
people thinking...

269
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,079
What, you're trying to build
the perfect woman?

270
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:52,085
Dr. Montgomery,
the police just called.

271
00:10:52,104 --> 00:10:54,855
They're on their way over.
They think they found Jane Doe's family.

272
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:58,364
I'm sure you felt that you need to be
even-handed when you announced

273
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,443
you were looking for someone
to take over as chief.

274
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:02,270
Give everybody a shot
at the brass ring.

275
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:03,735
I did.

276
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:06,027
- Can we drop that ruse soon?
- It's not a ruse.

277
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:07,488
You promised me the job
when I came here.

278
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:08,716
- It's why I came here.
- No you came

279
00:11:08,726 --> 00:11:10,989
'cause your marriage fell apart,
you'd to get the hell outta dodge.

280
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:12,645
We had an understanding,
now you're having me

281
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:14,650
jump through hoops with
other attending in this hospital.

282
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:16,457
And I hear you're giving
Marlowe special privileges

283
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:17,530
to do a piggyback surgery.

284
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:19,192
This is a teaching hospital, Derek.

285
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:25,505
My interview didn't go
as well as I had hoped.

286
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,070
I would like your support
with the board.

287
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:28,610
You know my credentials.
You know I'm ready.

288
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:30,501
- I only have one vote.
- It's a strong vote.

289
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,975
I'm not feeling well.

290
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:39,839
What's wrong
with that girl?

291
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,177
Look, I can't talk to you
when you're making all that noise,

292
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:55,345
so pull it together
and get out here.

293
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:57,551
Now.

294
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:13,469
I have an 11-year-old daughter.

295
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:18,159
She needs
a bone marrow transplant.

296
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,009
I'm potentially a good match.

297
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:25,799
Please don't tell anybody.
Please.

298
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:27,668
This isn't a chapter
of my history that...

299
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:28,723
I understand.

300
00:12:34,818 --> 00:12:36,077
She's here...

301
00:12:37,316 --> 00:12:38,330
My kid...

302
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,501
And I'm supposed to go
up to pediatrics

303
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,501
and meet her right now,
and...

304
00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:49,485
I mean, I've thought
about this moment...

305
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,363
what I would look like...

306
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,309
What I would say.

307
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:00,621
But I thought I would be older,

308
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,837
more together, more mature.

309
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:04,921
I thought she would be older.

310
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:07,335
And I never thought
that she would be sick.

311
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:13,107
Oh, god.
I don't know what to do.

312
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,525
I don't know what to do.
What do I do?

313
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:21,934
We love our Shannon,

314
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:25,061
but we never got along
wither husband.

315
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:27,743
- So she has a husband?
- Had.

316
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:30,767
One day while she was at work,
he packed up and disappeared.

317
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:33,703
He didn't want a baby.
But she went after him,

318
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,142
even pregnant like that.

319
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:36,598
We hadn't heard from her
in months,

320
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,334
and then today
we saw her picture on TV.

321
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:41,693
Mr. and Mrs. Waring, uh,
the woman we found,

322
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:43,410
- if she is your daughter...
- Well,

323
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,566
her nose is different,
and her chin, but they said that

324
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:49,506
they said that her face had been,
you know, changed.

325
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:51,591
Do you happen to know
your daughter's blood type?

326
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:53,441
She's B-positive.

327
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:56,503
Any medical conditions,
surgeries we should know about?

328
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:59,320
Um, she had her tonsils out
when she was 12.

329
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:02,090
It's her, isn't it?

330
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,664
It's Shannon.

331
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,671
Susan.

332
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:13,239
Meredith, hi.
I'm so glad I found you.

333
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:15,176
- Twice in one day.
- Is this a bad time?

334
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:16,482
I know you're always busy, but...

335
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:17,665
Yeah, no, I'm busy.
I'm at work.

336
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:19,345
Okay, I was, um...

337
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:21,846
You know I'd really
just love to talk with you.

338
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:24,060
I would love to find a time
for you and me to sit down...

339
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,276
I'm sorry. This is too much.

340
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:28,534
Way too much.
You keep showing up.

341
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,844
I cannot be your daughter
or your charity case

342
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,597
or the thing that you need to fix.

343
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:34,639
- I'm not trying to...
- No, no.

344
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:36,254
Stop talking, okay?

345
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:37,521
Stop mothering.

346
00:14:37,963 --> 00:14:38,967
Just stop.

347
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,414
<i>She is mid-30s,
brunette and 8 months pregnant.</i>

348
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:46,404
<i>If you recognize her, please...</i>

349
00:14:47,796 --> 00:14:49,355
My glamour shot's
been on the news

350
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:50,715
at least a dozen times already.

351
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:51,858
Admit it...
You're gonna miss me

352
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:53,776
when my fancy family
shows up to take me away.

353
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:55,679
You don't know they're fancy.
Open up.

354
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:57,640
Why, what's wrong
with my throat?

355
00:14:57,659 --> 00:14:59,377
How would I know?
I haven't even seen it yet.

356
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:01,311
- Now open up.
- No, not till you tell me...

357
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:03,869
Wait.

358
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:06,977
Someone has recognized me,
haven't they?

359
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:11,252
Alex... Alex, you have
to tell me who it is please.

360
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:13,358
Their daughter's blood type
is B-positive.

361
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,003
She's your age.
She's pregnant.

362
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:16,552
Your height, your hair color,

363
00:15:16,843 --> 00:15:18,270
and she has no tonsils.

364
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:20,237
So now are you gonna open up?

365
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:22,019
Yes. Please tell me
I have no tonsils.

366
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:23,221
- Say ah.
- Ah.

367
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:26,908
No tonsils.

368
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:28,904
Shannon?

369
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:31,707
Mr. and Mrs. Waring,
I asked you to wait.

370
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:33,501
- I have tests to complete...
- Alex...

371
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:35,464
It's okay.

372
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:37,268
Your name...

373
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,903
Is Shannon Marie.

374
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:43,436
Marie was my mother's name...

375
00:15:44,355 --> 00:15:45,566
Your grandmother.

376
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,078
Shannon Marie.

377
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:57,224
Okay, discharge
beds one and three.

378
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:58,492
Two needs a social worker.

379
00:15:58,511 --> 00:15:59,919
Hold this down for me,
O'Malley.

380
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:01,759
- I'm gonna be out for a while.
- Why?

381
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:04,902
- What's going on with Iz?
- What's going on with Stevens

382
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:06,245
is none of your concern.

383
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:08,168
What is your concern?
Sick people...

384
00:16:08,187 --> 00:16:10,741
All these sick people...
until I get back. Understand?

385
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:14,626
Dr. Bailey, just did
a consult in trauma one.

386
00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:15,958
The guy has a perf.
Can I scrub in?

387
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:17,469
No, you cannot scrub in.

388
00:16:17,554 --> 00:16:19,272
Uh, you're here
with O'Malley for now.

389
00:16:23,672 --> 00:16:24,986
Hey, what's wrong with Izzie?

390
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:28,964
Beds 7 through 13.
Start with number 8.

391
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:30,542
He doesn't have
much bladder control.

392
00:16:31,195 --> 00:16:32,200
First, Mr. Redford,

393
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:34,397
while Dr. Marlowe is
preparing the surgical area,

394
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:36,115
I will be examing
the donor heart.

395
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:37,375
Actually, I'm sorry.

396
00:16:37,432 --> 00:16:38,812
I'll examine the donor heart.

397
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:41,882
I want to be sure
the I.V.C. Orifice is oversewn.

398
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:46,462
Well, carry on.

399
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,020
Then I'llopen your chest
and put you on bypass,

400
00:16:50,227 --> 00:16:52,594
at which point we will
connect the left atrium

401
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:55,073
- then the right atrium...
- Superior vena cava.

402
00:16:55,252 --> 00:16:57,721
It simplifies the subsequent
cardiac biopsies.

403
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,509
You didn't read my article
in the...

404
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:01,744
"cardiothoracic monthly" last year.

405
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:03,370
Did you? Huh?

406
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,295
Well, I think Cristina
has a copy of it.

407
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:07,276
- Cristina, may i?
- Oh, of course.

408
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:14,081
Oh, what on earth is that?

409
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:16,363
Oh, testing colors.

410
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:18,045
For the big day, I assume?

411
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:19,476
I'm thinking, um...

412
00:17:20,228 --> 00:17:21,317
coral.

413
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:24,465
Chief, come here.
I want to show you something.

414
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,667
I'm busy, Sloan.

415
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:27,935
I need an update on my patient
in room 3129.

416
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:29,203
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

417
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:30,997
Okay. I have that right here.

418
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:35,853
I like those sneakers.
You a runner?

419
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,325
Yeah.

420
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:38,470
Me, too.

421
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:40,029
Maybe we should
go running some time.

422
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:42,724
Sure.

423
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:46,266
Anything else I can
help you with, Dr. Sloan?

424
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,228
No. All good.

425
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:52,643
Wingman.

426
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:55,197
Wingman.

427
00:17:56,978 --> 00:17:58,285
Hannah is in there right now?

428
00:17:58,417 --> 00:17:59,421
She is.

429
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:09,544
You see her,
you'll know what to do.

430
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:12,922
Must be nice to know
she has parents like this,

431
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:14,030
who fight for her,

432
00:18:14,263 --> 00:18:16,507
think about what she wants,

433
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:18,511
try to make her happy
like you would've.

434
00:18:21,822 --> 00:18:24,123
Doesn't mean you don't want
that girl to want you.

435
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:38,268
I'm...

436
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:41,201
She's so, so tired.

437
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:43,968
We left it up to Hannah,
and, uh, she's just not ready.

438
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:45,771
- I'm sorry.
- We don't want to force it.

439
00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:48,582
Maybe another time?
When she's feeling better.

440
00:18:48,591 --> 00:18:49,595
No, of course.

441
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:51,111
I understand.

442
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:55,195
I'm sorry,
but... the transplant?

443
00:18:58,813 --> 00:18:59,818
Stevens.

444
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:03,811
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

445
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,854
Your girl...

446
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:08,145
You can want her
to want you all day long,

447
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:09,319
but she has to be here

448
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:11,103
if she's ever gonna have
that chance again.

449
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:16,578
I'm sorry.

450
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:19,103
Of course. Yeah.
I'm ready. Let's get started.

451
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:24,851
Hey, guess what.
I'm a teacher.

452
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,922
I teach second grade
at north bend elementary.

453
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:30,556
- Oh
- Or at least I did until...

454
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:32,596
You can get your job back
whenever you want.

455
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,310
They love you there. When will
we be able to take her home?

456
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:37,415
You want to take her
back to...

457
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,518
North bend.
We've got a room all setup for her.

458
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:42,642
Your mom's got all of your books
and your letters and diaries.

459
00:19:42,652 --> 00:19:45,386
- I kept diaries?
- About 800 of them.

460
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:47,572
So even if you don't
remember everything now,

461
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:48,989
you will.

462
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:51,889
Hear that?

463
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:53,775
I can go, right?

464
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,626
Well, you're still getting
I.V. antibiotics,

465
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:57,839
and we're monitoring the baby
very closely right now.

466
00:19:57,852 --> 00:19:59,762
Yeah, but you can
make it happen, right?

467
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:04,327
Come on, Alex. Don't doctor me.
Help me get outta here.

468
00:20:04,345 --> 00:20:07,021
Dr. Montgomery's got you
on strict bed rest until your delivery.

469
00:20:09,854 --> 00:20:12,089
But I'll ask. Maybe...
Maybe you can do it from home.

470
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,361
Home. Wouah.

471
00:20:18,003 --> 00:20:19,148
- Hey.
- Hey.

472
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,059
- You okay? You look...
- Horrible. I'm in a horrible mood.

473
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:23,106
I yelled at Susan.

474
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,548
I think I scared off
my fake mommy forever.

475
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:27,689
Mm. Need cheering up?

476
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:29,078
No.

477
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:32,276
Me either.
It's gonna be ok.

478
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:34,247
- You think?
- Yeah, Susan will be okay.

479
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:42,495
How'd it go with the chief?

480
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:44,053
Uh, about as well
as you and Susan.

481
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:45,434
Wow. We make a good team.

482
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:52,150
I've been waiting for you

483
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,079
in really-old-guy's room
for 20 minutes. What gives?

484
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:56,106
Sorry. We decided
to eat down here today.

485
00:20:56,115 --> 00:20:57,786
- Nobody told me.
- Anybody...

486
00:20:58,913 --> 00:20:59,918
Move.

487
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,740
Anybody know
what's going on with Izzie?

488
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,759
Something's going on.

489
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,630
Why don't you
just ask her yourself?

490
00:21:05,658 --> 00:21:07,550
Fine. I would if I knew
where she was.

491
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:08,869
I brought you lunch.

492
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:14,640
You've got stuff
on your hands.

493
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:16,644
I'm trying to scare away
cardio god.

494
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:17,864
With pretty, pretty fingers?

495
00:21:17,883 --> 00:21:19,677
He takes my rook,
I take his bishop.

496
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:21,061
Hey, pouty head.

497
00:21:21,137 --> 00:21:24,292
Oh, are you so sad 'cause no-face
girl's family is taking her home?

498
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,526
- Really? Someone claimed Ava?
- Yeah, her parents.

499
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,818
- She must be so relieved.
- Yeah, unless they suck.

500
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,457
Can you imagine, you can't remember
a family and they show up,

501
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:33,598
and it turns out
they're psycho killers?

502
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:34,775
Or over sharers.

503
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:36,184
Whatever. She's a patient.

504
00:21:36,203 --> 00:21:38,494
I don't give a crap who her
parents are, where she goes.

505
00:21:38,635 --> 00:21:39,649
Can we move on?

506
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,668
One second.

507
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,615
What's up with Izzie?

508
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:46,896
- I told you, it's none of your concern.
- No, it is my concern.

509
00:21:46,915 --> 00:21:47,948
I demand to know.

510
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,095
I hope I didn't just hear you
say youdemand.

511
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,639
Well, are you her father?
Are you her husband?

512
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:55,662
Then stay here and keep
your mind on your job.

513
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:56,698
You hear me?

514
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,630
Grey.

515
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:02,784
Uh, look, I need to be upstairs,
so...

516
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,582
do not let this
out of your sight.

517
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:08,694
Walk this to the lab,
watch the lab run the test,

518
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,615
bring the test results
directly to me, nobody else.

519
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:16,666
It's Izzie.
What's the matter?

520
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:19,680
You will be discreet and not ask
a bunch of questions.

521
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:23,642
Now this is a private matter.
She needs these results now.

522
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:25,248
Okay.

523
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:36,682
Wow.
That's a big needle.

524
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:38,606
It's standard.
You should start to feel

525
00:22:38,629 --> 00:22:41,587
numb about ten minutes after
I inject the lidocaine, okay?

526
00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:44,190
Yeah. No, I know.
I've given epidurals before.

527
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:45,655
I know that's the needle.

528
00:22:46,313 --> 00:22:48,548
It's just that somehow
it seems so much bigger

529
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,932
now that it's going into my spine.

530
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:51,695
- Little stick.
- Oh, my god.

531
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:54,042
You sure I can't call someone?
One of your friends?

532
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,921
You're gonna need somebody
to hold your hand.

533
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,964
No. Thank you.

534
00:22:59,443 --> 00:23:00,466
Look, you sure?

535
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:08,218
Yeah, well, I can take
a lot of pressure,

536
00:23:08,237 --> 00:23:10,547
just...
It's rough as sandpaper.

537
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,305
A little pressure.

538
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:21,131
Tell me where she is.

539
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,793
I can't. If she wanted you to know...

540
00:23:22,794 --> 00:23:23,901
She does. She just...

541
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:26,934
We're just having
one of our stupid fights.

542
00:23:28,193 --> 00:23:30,095
You know how wrong it is
if she's really in trouble

543
00:23:30,113 --> 00:23:31,973
and I'm not there
because we're being idiots?

544
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,809
Come on.

545
00:23:35,395 --> 00:23:36,485
Meredith, please.

546
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:41,290
She's upstairs in procedure room "A."

547
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,054
- That's all I know.
- Thank you.

548
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,365
So...

549
00:23:49,412 --> 00:23:51,562
Dr. Montgomery says
you can take your daughter home.

550
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:53,729
But she wants to talk to
her local O.B.-G.Y.N.

551
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:55,172
There are some things
she wants to go over

552
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,072
- before we release her.
- I can't.

553
00:23:58,012 --> 00:24:00,996
Okay. Well, I can go through
all this with your husband if...

554
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,695
No, you don't understand.

555
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:05,261
I can't take her home.

556
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:10,061
That girl is not my daughter.

557
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,852
She does look
an awful lot like shannon.

558
00:24:19,028 --> 00:24:21,498
Sometimes
she even sounds like her.

559
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:25,669
You know, with the surgery
and, uh, the loss of memories...

560
00:24:25,934 --> 00:24:28,469
A mother knows her own child,
Dr. Karev.

561
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,131
And that is not my child.

562
00:24:30,973 --> 00:24:32,588
- But your husband, he's...
- Look,

563
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:35,022
if that's not Shannon,
we still don't know

564
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:37,144
where our girl is.
Do you understand?

565
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:39,257
He needs it to be her.

566
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,979
How am I supposed to tell him?

567
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,481
How do I tell either of them?

568
00:24:45,223 --> 00:24:47,514
- Mrs. Waring...
- Dr. Karev...

569
00:24:49,495 --> 00:24:51,748
Would you ask my husband
to meet me in the lobby?

570
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,793
- You need to face her.
- Please...

571
00:24:54,178 --> 00:24:55,568
Tell her I'm sorry.

572
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,268
Things have changed.

573
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,109
No, no. Nothing has changed.

574
00:25:03,193 --> 00:25:04,479
I deserve your support, Richard.

575
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:06,461
Tell me I have it. That I didn't move
to Seattle for nothing.

576
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,464
You moved to seattle to start
a new life,

577
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:10,489
and you did.

578
00:25:11,312 --> 00:25:12,433
You have a fantastic woman

579
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:14,000
- who love you.
- It's not bout my personal life.

580
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:15,481
- But my career.
- You know what being chief

581
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,505
will do to your life?

582
00:25:16,523 --> 00:25:18,918
Why the hell do you think
I'm getting a divorce

583
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:21,152
or dyeing my hair?

584
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:24,420
You can't do it all,
not if you want to be chief.

585
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:26,016
- You couldn't do it all.
- Neither can you.

586
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,460
Don't put your mistake on me.

587
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,381
Don't. I am the best candidate
for this job.

588
00:25:29,405 --> 00:25:31,617
You know it and I know it
and that is the only factor

589
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:33,128
you need to take
into consideration.

590
00:25:33,138 --> 00:25:35,278
I don't need your protection,
Richard and I don't want it.

591
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:36,969
I'm not trying
to protect you, Derek.

592
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:38,330
I told Ellis...

593
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:45,468
I promised her that I would
look after her daughter.

594
00:25:55,324 --> 00:25:57,665
O'Malley,
did Stevens ask for you here?

595
00:25:57,684 --> 00:25:59,102
No! No, I did not.

596
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,400
- Then you need to turn yourself...
- You're giving bone marrow?

597
00:26:01,418 --> 00:26:03,371
- This is a private matter.
- I'm not leaving.

598
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,241
- George.
- No.

599
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,286
Make me.

600
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:10,957
Sorry, I'm starting now.

601
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,501
Just let me know when you're
gonna do stuff, okay?

602
00:26:15,638 --> 00:26:16,680
You're okay.

603
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,515
I got it here.

604
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:27,633
Fine. Stevens, I'm going.

605
00:26:27,745 --> 00:26:29,268
Unless you need me
to call security.

606
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,165
I'll manage.

607
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:35,011
Thank you.

608
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:43,347
You said back off.

609
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:46,130
You didn't tell me you were having
a hole drilled in your damn hip.

610
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,395
For who?

611
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:53,695
What's this private matter?

612
00:26:55,893 --> 00:26:58,062
Okay,
I'm going in when you're ready.

613
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:00,494
Yeah?

614
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,143
Hey, Callie.

615
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,082
So if you could
just take these two,

616
00:27:14,114 --> 00:27:15,691
- then that'll free me up...
- Oh, no.

617
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,155
I'm not here to work. I'm...

618
00:27:17,183 --> 00:27:18,815
I'm, uh, I'm... I'm sorry.

619
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,075
I haven't slept in like 2 days,

620
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:21,388
and,
I'm actually looking for George.

621
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:22,928
We're supposed to meet up
for coffee.

622
00:27:23,247 --> 00:27:26,647
- So...
- He's, uh, with Izzie, I think.

623
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:27,915
So if you're not here to work,

624
00:27:27,924 --> 00:27:29,755
I'm st gonna take these back.
Thanks.

625
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:35,799
15-blade.

626
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:38,711
Suction, please.

627
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,383
Dr. Burke, you're not using

628
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:45,435
the superior-transseptal approach
for the atriotomy, are you?

629
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:46,633
Is that a problem?

630
00:27:46,657 --> 00:27:49,469
Not at all unless your intention
is to kill the patient.

631
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:53,723
Dr. Marlowe, from what I've read--

632
00:27:53,724 --> 00:27:55,092
Reading about a procedure is one thing

633
00:27:55,095 --> 00:27:56,758
and performg it,
is quite another.

634
00:27:56,771 --> 00:27:57,775
It was my mistake.

635
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,593
I should never have allowed
you to scrub in.

636
00:27:59,823 --> 00:28:01,325
I think it best
from this point on

637
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,658
that you simply observe.

638
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:10,849
Suction, please.

639
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:14,670
Hurry up.

640
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:19,669
You should use the wheelchair.

641
00:28:20,063 --> 00:28:22,054
- You're gonna be sore.
- I'm aware.

642
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:24,495
I'm fine now. Thank you.

643
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,821
Uh, you mean pantless but fine?

644
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,361
Crap.

645
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:40,940
Stand.

646
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:02,180
- I got it.
- Okay. Okay.

647
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,214
Hannah...

648
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:18,477
An 11-year-old girl.

649
00:29:18,486 --> 00:29:20,289
That's the private matter.
She's mine.

650
00:29:22,523 --> 00:29:23,527
Don't...

651
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:25,959
Don't look at me.

652
00:29:31,318 --> 00:29:33,071
My mother wanted me
to keep her.

653
00:29:35,892 --> 00:29:37,864
But I knew... even at 16...

654
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:40,005
I knew that baby
deserved better

655
00:29:40,608 --> 00:29:43,613
than life...
at a Chehalis trailer park.

656
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:47,143
And now she's here and...

657
00:29:49,485 --> 00:29:51,780
And she might be dying and
she doesn't want to meet me.

658
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:58,249
Oh, crap.

659
00:30:02,597 --> 00:30:05,198
I didn't think I really cared
until she said no.

660
00:30:08,422 --> 00:30:09,438
How about that?

661
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,437
I can say hail marys until...

662
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:27,153
Until I turn into mary,
but I still miss you.

663
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:30,370
Not the...

664
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:34,082
the sex.

665
00:30:36,313 --> 00:30:38,193
It was not tragic,
George.

666
00:30:39,732 --> 00:30:40,981
But I'll live without it.

667
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:46,326
I won't make it
if you can't be my friend.

668
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:49,176
If we can't...

669
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,212
What you did today...

670
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,543
You should be proud.

671
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:08,110
I'll get an orderly
to take you downstairs.

672
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:09,641
But I have to go.

673
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:14,883
You understand?

674
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:48,454
Some surgery.

675
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:53,057
- And Colin was...
- Brillant.

676
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:55,631
He's a gifted surgeon.

677
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:02,339
Listen, I had a question.

678
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:05,653
When you moved the atrium
to the vena cava,

679
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:08,921
why did you switch
from 3-0 to 5-0 sutures?

680
00:32:09,742 --> 00:32:11,522
You want to use
the finest sutures you can

681
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:12,850
for vascular structures.

682
00:32:13,817 --> 00:32:16,719
A delicate tissue
demands a delicate touch.

683
00:32:18,273 --> 00:32:19,278
Right.

684
00:32:19,963 --> 00:32:21,015
That makes sense.

685
00:32:21,494 --> 00:32:22,499
Thank you.

686
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:24,198
Of course.

687
00:32:26,122 --> 00:32:27,408
- I'll see you at home?
- Yeah.

688
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:40,103
- How long have you been standing there?
- Long enough.

689
00:32:40,412 --> 00:32:42,394
We've been playing
our little game all day long.

690
00:32:43,358 --> 00:32:44,757
But what I just saw...

691
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:47,161
that was real.

692
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,030
The question you asked him
about the sutures,

693
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,208
that was from my paper
the paper you helped me write.

694
00:32:51,218 --> 00:32:52,641
You already knew the answer.

695
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,254
The Cristina Yang I knew...

696
00:32:57,295 --> 00:32:59,398
was concerned with excellence.

697
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:03,268
She would never play the part
of the helpless girl

698
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:05,221
trying to build up
a grown man's ego.

699
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,027
- What has become of you?
- I have learned that sometimes

700
00:33:08,273 --> 00:33:09,817
you have to think about
other people.

701
00:33:10,876 --> 00:33:12,021
You've compromised yourself.

702
00:33:12,096 --> 00:33:13,101
No.

703
00:33:14,611 --> 00:33:16,168
I'm going home.
You're right.

704
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:18,205
It's senseless,
coming here,

705
00:33:18,224 --> 00:33:19,851
chasing after a job
that was beneath me

706
00:33:19,952 --> 00:33:21,576
just so I could be near
a woman who...

707
00:33:23,786 --> 00:33:26,161
a woman who apparently
no longer exists.

708
00:33:31,354 --> 00:33:33,532
Best of luck...
With the wedding.

709
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:48,855
No, there they are.

710
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,544
- Come on.
- I can't. I-I can't.

711
00:33:53,662 --> 00:33:55,699
You look. Please.
You look for me.

712
00:33:55,858 --> 00:33:56,863
Okay.

713
00:34:01,258 --> 00:34:03,408
she's getting the infusion.
You did it.

714
00:34:04,188 --> 00:34:05,202
Is she, um...

715
00:34:06,475 --> 00:34:07,480
How does she look?

716
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:09,809
You can...
You can see for yourself.

717
00:34:10,072 --> 00:34:11,640
It's okay.
She can't see us from here.

718
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:20,919
She's got your eyes...

719
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,116
And your mouth.

720
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,705
That means she probably
talks a lot and eats a lot then.

721
00:34:34,722 --> 00:34:36,544
If she's in pain,
she's not letting on.

722
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,125
Man, she's tough.

723
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:03,349
That's her, George.
That's Hannah.

724
00:35:08,244 --> 00:35:09,653
She's beautiful, don't you think?

725
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:12,132
She's really... beautiful.

726
00:35:15,772 --> 00:35:17,209
Yeah, she's a heartbreaker.

727
00:35:27,204 --> 00:35:28,321
Need some help with that?

728
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:30,340
I know you didn't
just wander in here

729
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:31,824
to help me change
pillowcases.

730
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:34,924
You warned me
she could become a problem.

731
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:36,041
Who, Meredith?

732
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:40,345
You know, you love somebody,
you think you can handle it all.

733
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:42,007
You've done all right.
Both of you.

734
00:35:42,035 --> 00:35:43,603
I came out here to be chief,

735
00:35:44,801 --> 00:35:46,200
and Meredith complicates that.

736
00:35:47,524 --> 00:35:49,468
Well, if this turns
into an either/or,

737
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:51,365
you pick the person you love,

738
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:52,569
end of story.

739
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:56,636
Look, all of this means nothing
if you're alone.

740
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:09,438
Oh, crap!

741
00:36:10,106 --> 00:36:12,050
Our coffee.
I'm... I'm sorry.

742
00:36:12,428 --> 00:36:13,940
I've... I forgot.
I got...

743
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,975
- I got so busy...
- Oh, yeah? With what?

744
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,049
Oh, j... the clinic,

745
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:21,143
patients and...
Well, you know how it is.

746
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:25,622
Oh, man.

747
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:29,756
Yeah, I know how it is, so...

748
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,344
I'm really tired.
I'm really, really tired.

749
00:36:32,362 --> 00:36:33,996
So I'll just...
I'll see you at home.

750
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:42,492
Solitaire.

751
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:45,102
My dad taught me.
That sounds so weird.

752
00:36:45,645 --> 00:36:46,650
"My dad."

753
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:48,714
Good weird, though.

754
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,447
So you and the redhead
gonna let me go home?

755
00:36:51,504 --> 00:36:54,067
Or were you too busy making eyes
at each other to even ask?

756
00:36:56,427 --> 00:36:57,432
What?

757
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,539
- Ava...
- No.

758
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:01,182
It's Shannon.

759
00:37:02,327 --> 00:37:03,791
- Listen...
- My name is Shannon.

760
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,158
Shannon Marie.

761
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,521
I'm sorry.

762
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:16,389
Those are supposed to be
my people.

763
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:19,468
I belong with them, Alex.

764
00:37:19,722 --> 00:37:21,676
I'm supposed to go with them.

765
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:23,578
Your people, we... we don't
even know who they are yet.

766
00:37:23,587 --> 00:37:25,135
You don't want to find them.

767
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:26,967
You want to keep me
all to yourself.

768
00:37:26,986 --> 00:37:28,057
Well, here I am,

769
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:31,007
your pathetic
captive audience.

770
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,843
Isn't it sad that I'm
the best you can do?

771
00:37:34,438 --> 00:37:36,579
- Ava...
- My name is not Ava!

772
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,730
You made it up!
It's not me!

773
00:37:39,401 --> 00:37:40,499
Get out!

774
00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:41,842
Get out!

775
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:48,350
<i>Some people believe
that without history,</i>

776
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,708
<i>our lives amount to nothing.</i>

777
00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:54,776
Sloan, you brought me to a bar.

778
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:56,920
- You know I don't drink.
- Which is perfect.

779
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,991
Better to keep your mind sharp.
Let the ladies do the drinking.

780
00:38:02,051 --> 00:38:04,192
You think if you get me laid,

781
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,873
I might make you chief.

782
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,754
<i>At some point,
we all have to choose.</i>

783
00:38:10,232 --> 00:38:12,101
<i>Do we fall back on what we know?</i>

784
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:19,778
I hear Dr. Marlowe is going home.

785
00:38:20,585 --> 00:38:21,590
About time.

786
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,493
The fingernails,
the hand holding,

787
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:24,855
well played.

788
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,269
Now you can get back
to being Cristina.

789
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,618
<i>Or do we step forward
to something new?</i>

790
00:38:39,255 --> 00:38:41,728
<i>It's hard not to be haunted
by our past.</i>

791
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:02,657
<i>Our history is what shapes us,</i>

792
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:03,971
<i>what guides us.</i>

793
00:39:11,332 --> 00:39:12,337
Seriously?

794
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,062
Okay.
That stops right now.

795
00:39:15,202 --> 00:39:18,340
It's just, I'm... I'm waiting
for Derek, and I'm very tired.

796
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:19,967
I don't care. Let me in.

797
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,786
- Excuse me?
- It's freezing out here,

798
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:24,406
and I have been working
myself up to saying this,

799
00:39:24,825 --> 00:39:25,905
well, for a while now,

800
00:39:25,914 --> 00:39:28,083
so I need you
to let me in now, please.

801
00:39:37,183 --> 00:39:39,496
It's my fault your father
didn't fight harder for you.

802
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,961
I knew about you.

803
00:39:41,104 --> 00:39:43,079
I could've pushed him to be
a part of your life.

804
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:45,755
I should've pushed him.
You were a child.

805
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:47,323
We were the adults.

806
00:39:48,796 --> 00:39:51,143
But we were just married,
and it was new and...

807
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:53,152
That's what I cared about.

808
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,719
And I know the groceries
and everything

809
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:57,850
are a little much,
but that's just what I do.

810
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:01,175
I mean, quit looking at me
like I'm crazy 'cause that's not fair.

811
00:40:01,184 --> 00:40:03,344
I'm just trying to find a way
to be there for you

812
00:40:03,353 --> 00:40:04,921
the only way that I know how,

813
00:40:05,942 --> 00:40:07,970
and if you can't accept that,
fine.

814
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,581
But just stop being so rude.

815
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:12,177
And I...

816
00:40:14,232 --> 00:40:15,256
Okay.

817
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:17,932
I'm overstepping again,
aren't I?

818
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:20,047
As mothers go,

819
00:40:21,061 --> 00:40:23,052
I've only ever known
overbearing,

820
00:40:23,474 --> 00:40:24,789
never overprotective.

821
00:40:25,471 --> 00:40:26,587
This is all new.

822
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:30,912
- It's okay.
- It is?

823
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:32,271
Yes.

824
00:40:32,285 --> 00:40:36,544
<i>Our history resurfaces
time after time after time.</i>

825
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:39,902
Not just surgery,
but chief of surgery.

826
00:40:40,556 --> 00:40:41,626
Really?

827
00:40:41,682 --> 00:40:44,330
Oh, well, not for much longer,
really.

828
00:40:45,615 --> 00:40:46,714
I'm gonna go...

829
00:40:47,174 --> 00:40:50,009
Over there.
Hold down the fort, chief.

830
00:40:54,749 --> 00:40:57,500
So, um, you come here often?

831
00:40:57,612 --> 00:41:00,382
Oh, sometimes. It's on my way
home from bio class.

832
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,720
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

833
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:06,914
No.

834
00:41:07,772 --> 00:41:10,384
Um, it was, uh,
it was nice talking to you.

835
00:41:10,402 --> 00:41:11,449
You, too.

836
00:41:14,324 --> 00:41:16,385
The last time I tried
to pick up a woman,

837
00:41:16,394 --> 00:41:18,555
I had a harvey wallbanger
in one hand

838
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:20,310
and an afro pick in the other.

839
00:41:20,372 --> 00:41:21,915
Oh, Richard.

840
00:41:22,018 --> 00:41:24,300
Well, you think about it.
I mean, when you're married,

841
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:26,955
you'd like to think
you still have game.

842
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,218
Practice on me.

843
00:41:30,008 --> 00:41:31,013
I'm sorry?

844
00:41:31,443 --> 00:41:32,665
Mark's right. I mean,

845
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,215
he's wrong about
so many things,

846
00:41:34,233 --> 00:41:35,924
but he is right about this.

847
00:41:35,942 --> 00:41:37,867
You need to get back out there.
So...

848
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:39,801
practice.

849
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,850
Addison,
I wouldn't know where to start.

850
00:41:41,876 --> 00:41:42,951
Ask me to dance.

851
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:46,420
Well, there's...
There's no dance floor.

852
00:41:46,598 --> 00:41:48,542
So? Ask me anyway.

853
00:41:55,005 --> 00:41:56,522
<i>So we have to remember...</i>

854
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:00,430
<i>Sometimes the most important history</i>

855
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,295
<i>is the history
we're making today.</i>
