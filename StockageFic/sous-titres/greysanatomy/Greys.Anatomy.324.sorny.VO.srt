00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,615
<i>Previously  on "Grey's Anatomy"...</i>

2
00:00:01,817 --> 00:00:03,779
You're gonna transfer to Mercy West?

3
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:06,249
- I have to.
- Give me my husband back.

4
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:08,366
- Chief resident?
- The one 5th year resident

5
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:09,661
that rules all residents.

6
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,493
Your intern exams are in two weeks.

7
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:13,935
You need to spend every available
minute studying for them.

8
00:00:14,157 --> 00:00:15,932
What happened
to our small ceremony?

9
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:18,316
What happened to
you and me at city hall?

10
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:20,906
There's no guarantee the surgery's
gonna bring back your memory.

11
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:23,809
- Is there a man in my house?
- I'm so sorry, Richard.

12
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:26,396
And I'm finally ready to have a baby,
and I can't.

13
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:28,208
We're losing her pulse.
She's coding!

14
00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:30,682
We did everything we could.

15
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:42,702
<i>A surgeon's education never ends.</i>

16
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:46,644
<i>Every patient, every symptom,
every operation...</i>

17
00:00:47,602 --> 00:00:48,757
<i>is a test.</i>

18
00:00:49,263 --> 00:00:51,929
<i>A chance for us to demonstrate
how much we know...</i>

19
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,404
<i>And how much more
we have to learn.</i>

20
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,592
How do you treat pancreatic divisum?
Izzie?

21
00:00:57,714 --> 00:01:00,217
Oh, Cristina.
If you're not gonna let us sleep,

22
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:02,368
you at least have to let me
put coffee in my cup.

23
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:05,095
- Okay, so go. No one's stopping you.
- I'm too tired to go.

24
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:07,769
- Pancreatic divisum.
- Dorsal duct sphincterotomy.

25
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:10,393
Not your turn, but correct.
You do me.

26
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:11,839
Can't believe O'Malley's missing this.

27
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:13,761
- How's he gonna be ready?
- You're kidding, right?

28
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,345
- We have Callie's cards but George has-
- George has Callie.

29
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:20,993
What's the most frequent cause
of diarrhea in hospitalized patients?

30
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,720
Is she coming to
this bachelorette thing tonight?

31
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,709
Rotavirus. Yes.
No, no, no. Uh, salmonella.

32
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:27,493
Diarrhea in hospitalized patients.

33
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:31,932
The most frequent cause of diarrhea
in hospitalized patients is C. diff.

34
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,580
Which can lead to toxic megacolon,
perforation, sepsis and death.

35
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:38,895
That's what killed Susan.

36
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:45,625
- Is she okay?
- Oh, she's fine.

37
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:48,085
- Dude, she's messed up.
- Of course she's messed up.

38
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:50,010
Susan was basically
her surrogate mother.

39
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:52,254
Yeah, her fake mom
was better than her real mom.

40
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,955
Is she going to the hospital first
or the funeral?

41
00:01:54,974 --> 00:01:57,256
First to the hospital,
then to the funeral,

42
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,133
then to the test this afternoon.

43
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:01,345
- Has she even studied?
- Yeah, she studied. She's fine.

44
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:03,372
She just needs
to be left alone, okay? So...

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,439
what's inside the carotid sheath?
Izzie?

46
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,672
<i>The internal carotid artery,</i>

47
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:10,873
<i>the internal jugular vein
and the vagus nerve.</i>

48
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:13,465
Ah, that was too easy.
Let's find you a hard one.

49
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,745
Uh, what is this?

50
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:18,858
<i>Uh, what is what?</i>

51
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,677
Yeah.
That just came this morning.

52
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:26,263
You got a spot at Mercy West!
Why didn't you tell me?

53
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:28,498
Because it's pending the results
of the intern exam.

54
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,347
Oh, you know what this means,
don't you?

55
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:34,027
You, you got,
you got into Mercy West...

56
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:35,949
I haven't told the chief yet.

57
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,782
You'll tell him today.
He'll understand.

58
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,060
It's a smaller program,

59
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:43,717
fewer residents,
fewer distractions,

60
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,229
more surgeries.

61
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:49,080
And when I come home
and ask you how your day went,

62
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:52,553
you can actually tell me
because I won't already know.

63
00:03:13,713 --> 00:03:15,563
- Hi.
- Hi.

64
00:03:19,543 --> 00:03:20,689
Look, I...

65
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:24,961
I know this is a...
an impossible day for you.

66
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:26,249
So...

67
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,151
I'm just want to say one thing.

68
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:32,672
I brought a black suit, just in case.

69
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:35,008
Thank you.

70
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,475
But I think this is something
I need to do by myself.

71
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:47,363
If you need me, just...

72
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:50,415
let me know.

73
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:54,297
- Oh, Cristina.
- What is M.E.N. syndrome?

74
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:55,396
Don't answer that.

75
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:57,820
The minister needs to see a copy
of your vows before the wedding.

76
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,411
Multiple endocrine neoplasia. Yes.

77
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:03,127
Look, I know it's test day,
and I'm not supposed to be

78
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:04,966
talking about the wedding
on test day.

79
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:07,820
- But since tomorrow's our wedding day--
- You have five seconds. Go.

80
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:12,208
Bill Adams can't make it.
I have no best man.

81
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:14,317
Oh, no. Baby, I'm so sorry.

82
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:16,255
- And I need your vows by--
- Okay, time's up.

83
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,019
Test day.

84
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:21,749
What am I supposed
to tell the minister?

85
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,345
Test day.

86
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:27,725
They paged you guys, too?

87
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:30,425
- Well, I think they paged all of us.
- That can't be good.

88
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:33,547
Sure it can. He could be letting us
know I won the race for chief.

89
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:34,760
Not today, he isn't.

90
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,985
He's making his recommendation
to the board tomorrow

91
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:39,182
for chief of surgery
and chief resident.

92
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:40,232
Why were we all paged?

93
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,467
Oh, because search and rescue
found those lost

94
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:44,213
climbers who were up
on Mount Rainier.

95
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,726
- People, the climbers are on their way.
- Any specifics?

96
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:48,779
They found only 3 so far.
One's still missing.

97
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,830
They're reporting
severe dehydration

98
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:52,990
with traumatic head
and chest injuries.

99
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:55,584
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Torres,
you'll be my trauma team.

100
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,706
- Bad day not to have interns.
- What?

101
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,105
Today's the intern exam.

102
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:01,453
You'll all have to do your
own heavy lifting today.

103
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:03,042
And if you see an intern,
which you will,

104
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:04,652
because they can't help themselves,

105
00:05:04,727 --> 00:05:06,717
turn them away
until after the exam.

106
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:08,334
The ambulances
are 5 minutes away.

107
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:10,200
It's time to do what we do best,
people. Let's roll.

108
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:11,920
What is a gerota's fascia?

109
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:14,014
Uh, the fascia surrounding the kidney.

110
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:16,458
Which is longer, the left...

111
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:19,542
- or the right renal vein?
- That's right. The left one.

112
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,823
- Looks and smarts-- Not bad.
- You think?

113
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,833
She's got my dad's nose, though.

114
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,330
Girl's gotta have a big personality
to pull off that nose.

115
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:28,871
What?

116
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:30,627
You-- You remember your dad?

117
00:05:32,018 --> 00:05:33,764
No. I don't-- No.

118
00:05:34,036 --> 00:05:35,558
- You just said--
- I know, but I...

119
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:37,811
I have no idea
where that came from.

120
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,943
That was a memory.
That's what it's like sometimes.

121
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,672
It doesn't always come back all at once.
It can happen in bits and pieces.

122
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:45,209
- Don't-- Don't get all--
- Dude, your memory's coming back.

123
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:55,848
How you feelin', Preston?
You ready?

124
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:57,452
I'm always ready for surgery.

125
00:05:57,503 --> 00:05:58,865
I think he's talking
about the wedding.

126
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:00,348
Yeah, tomorrow's the big day.

127
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:03,078
And apart from the fact that
Cristina hasn't written her vows,

128
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:04,477
my best man just canceled,

129
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:06,345
- and it's still raining...
- He's not ready.

130
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:08,085
You're never ready.

131
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:09,466
I certainly wasn't.

132
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:13,814
But then... the minute I saw
Adele coming down that aisle...

133
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:19,612
Well... have you picked
your best man?

134
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:24,207
- Actually, chief, I--
- You can't be his best man.

135
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:25,995
- Why not?
- Because it's unethical.

136
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:28,111
It's a conflict of interest.
The man wants to be chief of surgery.

137
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,947
- Actually, Derek--
- Not that that's why you're asking.

138
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:35,042
- I was... going to ask you.
- Ask me what?

139
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,318
- Really?
- We have been through a lot this year.

140
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:43,940
And everybody else turned you down.

141
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:46,416
Oh, what do I have to do?

142
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:49,280
Well, traditionally the best man
plans the bachelor party.

143
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,625
- Drinks at Joe's after work?
- Yeah.

144
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:53,409
I knew you were
the man for the job.

145
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,011
Dale winick, 32.
B.P. 90 over 50, tachy to 110.

146
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:04,711
Severe frostbite,
but no obvious internal injuries.

147
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,769
Got it.

148
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,027
My god.

149
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,665
Yeah, those aren't gloves.

150

151
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,391
Please someone tell me
if they heard the others guys are okay.

152
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:24,187
They're right behind you.
We'll let you know.

153
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:26,337
Get him a tet-tox
and push a gram of cefazolin I.V.

154
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,237
And let's get some warm, circulating
water to start thawing his hands.

155
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:31,619
I'll get someone on it.
Callie.

156
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:34,005
We're supposed to be studying.
If Bailey finds out we're down--

157
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:35,999
We are studying.
How do you treat frostbite?

158
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,914
Rewarm, avoid early surgery unless

159
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,702
there's a deep infection
due to autoamputation.

160
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,045
See? Studying.

161
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:47,016
Okay, okay,
Mr. Meltzer, Mr. Meltzer,

162
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:49,016
I'm gonna need you
to save your breath, okay?

163
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:51,200
We're gonna give you
some pain meds.

164
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:52,504
You have several broken ribs,

165
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:54,904
which are compromising your breathing.
You understand?

166
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:57,054
- Did you see that?
- That is freaky.

167
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:59,697
I think that was a flail chest.
I've never seen one before.

168
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:00,983
Come on. Come on.

169
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,875
Why, oh, why does today
have to be test day?

170
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:05,115
Oh, I know.

171
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,369
Look... I bet you
if you talk to the chief,

172
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:12,101
he'll let you take the test later
with the funeral and everything.

173
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:14,364
I don't need to take the test later.

174
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,053
- Can I get a little help here?
- I can't feel my legs!

175
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:22,361
Sir, you have a spinal injury.

176
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,126
You need to stop fighting me
and stay calm, okay?

177
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:25,485
You're only making it worse.
Where we going?

178
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,788
- You guys are going to trauma 3.
- All right. Trauma 3.

179
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:31,393
- You okay?
- Yeah.

180
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,881
I got accepted at Mercy West.

181
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,796
Wow that's...
Are you gonna go?

182
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:41,655
Well, I kinda have to now, right?

183
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:45,174
What are you fools doing here?

184
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:48,368
In a few hours,
you people are taking a test

185
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:51,082
that will determine the course
of your entire medical careers

186
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:53,397
because the five interns
with the lowest test scores

187
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:54,714
will be cut from the program.

188
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,831
But are you studying for this test?
No, you're not.

189
00:08:57,953 --> 00:09:01,185
Are you helping out in the E.R.?
You are most certainly not!

190
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:03,917
Are you getting the hell out of here
before I throw you out?

191
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:05,532
I think you are.

192
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,161
- Whoa, Dr. Shepherd.
- Aren't you supposed to be studying?

193
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,239
- Yeah, I just have a quick question.
- Yeah.

194
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:14,069
Could the craniotomy you performed
on Ava-- On Jane Doe-- Could--

195
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:16,246
- Could that have affected her memory?
- Uh, it's doubtful.

196
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:17,963
I was mostly working
in the speech center of her brain.

197
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:20,236
- But you never know. Why?
- I think she remembered something.

198
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:22,255
Can we test her to see
if anything's changed?

199
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:23,889
Yeah, you can run another W.M.S.R.

200
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,762
But we're gonna have to wait,
see if she remembers anything else.

201
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:27,396
- It's a good sign, though.
- Thanks.

202
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,854
- Nice work, Dr. Montgomery.
- Oh, thanks.

203
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:32,211
- I was just directing traffic.
- I was being sarcastic.

204
00:09:32,226 --> 00:09:34,352
Oh, like brain surgery
is so impressive.

205
00:09:34,517 --> 00:09:36,122
- It is, actually.
- Addison.

206
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:39,348
Yes? Oh, Joe, Walter.

207
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:41,586
What are you guys doing here?
Everything okay?

208
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:43,943
Yeah, we came to see you, actually.

209
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:46,941
- We need a consult.
- Don't tell me you're pregnant.

210
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:49,645
- Uh, no, but--
- Our birth mom is.

211
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,167
The potential birth mom.

212
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,688
She hasn't actually picked us yet.

213
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:53,861
You're adopting?

214
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,903
Well, we filed an application,
but we never thought we'd get picked.

215
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:59,683
You know, bar-owning gays
don't get picked very often.

216
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:02,059
I guess having a baby
is easier than we thought.

217
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,479
Yes, I guess so.

218
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,254
So I was hoping
you could take a look at her?

219
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:09,896
You know, kicking the tires,
checking underneath the hood?

220
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:11,394
Car metaphors? No.

221
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,431
I'd be happy to.
Just, uh, give me a call

222
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,670
and we'll set up an appointment.

223
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,169
Well, see, that's the thing, uh...

224
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:17,662
She lives in Portland,

225
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:19,839
and she's only gonna be
in Seattle for one day, so...

226
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:21,872
She's kind of here now.

227
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:23,677
Now, as in...

228
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:27,864
now.

229
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,701
- George, wait. Wait a minute.
- Yeah?

230
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,165
You don't have to do this.

231
00:10:38,195 --> 00:10:39,829
You don't have to transfer
to Mercy West.

232
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:41,033
- Yeah, I do.
- No.

233
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,002
Just forget about you and me
for a second, OK?

234
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:44,368
What about Meredith?

235
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:45,748
What about Alex and Cristina?

236
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:47,754
Who's gonna hold us together
if you're not here?

237
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:50,822
You're the glue. You're George.

238
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:53,399
- I can't stay here. I can't...
- No one's making you go.

239
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:55,720
stay here
and see you every day...

240
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,641
and not...

241
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:02,584
I can't keep kissing you
in elevators.

242
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:04,359
I know. I know that.

243
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:07,574
I'm married.

244
00:11:08,747 --> 00:11:09,940
I'm a married man.

245
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,768
- You busy?
- Cute. What are you doing here?

246
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:18,297
- Isn't the exam in like--
- I know, I know.

247
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:20,560
I just want to run
a quick neuro-psych test on you.

248
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:23,318
No. No! Go take your test.

249
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:25,074
I-I have a baby to feed.

250
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,212
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

251
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,715
You've been sitting in this bed
for weeks wishing

252
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:30,461
you could remember who you were
now suddenly you can.

253
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,447
I can't. It was something I said.

254
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:34,057
Well, you remember
your father's face.

255
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,841
Why are you acting like
it's no big deal,

256
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:37,928
- like it happens all the time?
- Alex, come on. I-I--

257
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:39,224
It-- That's not...

258
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,366
Unless it does happen all the time.

259
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:46,957
Tell me the truth.
Do you remember?

260
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:48,864
Do you know who you are?

261
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:56,130
- What is biloma?
- Cristina, I really don't have time.

262
00:11:57,084 --> 00:12:00,760
A biloma is an intraperitoneal
bile fluid collection.

263
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,551
- Excellent.
- Okay? I'll be fine.

264
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,959
- George, I gotta go.
- Your dad.

265
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:10,292
Hey.
I was just on my way to--

266
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:13,231
No, I-I came here to tell you,
you're not wanted.

267
00:12:13,827 --> 00:12:15,569
I don't want you at any funeral,
Meredith.

268
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:17,713
- Thatcher, why don't you come--
- She trusted you!

269
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:20,392
She came to you for help,
and you killed her.

270
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:23,951
You did. You killed my wife.
You took her from me.

271
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:25,087
Dad!

272
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:27,308
So I don't--
I don't want to see you.

273
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:28,923
I don't want to hear from you,

274
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:31,798
and I do not want you
anywhere near her funeral.

275
00:12:32,524 --> 00:12:34,712
- Do you understand me?
- Dad, dad, come on.

276
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:37,388
This-- Lexie's waiting in the car.
We have to go, dad.

277
00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:40,061
She was everything to me,
all I had.

278
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:48,748
She was all I had.

279
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:51,875
She was all I had.

280
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:07,229
I can sit here all day.

281
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:09,473
I'll miss my test,
but I will sit here all day.

282
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:14,164
I don't-- I...

283
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:18,587
It happened a few days ago,
and I-I just...

284
00:13:19,587 --> 00:13:20,840
I just woke up, and...

285
00:13:21,113 --> 00:13:23,277
- it was all there again.
- And you didn't tell me?

286
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:27,384
Becau-- Because there's...

287
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:31,107
There's nothing to tell.

288
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,573
Why don't I believe that?

289
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,062
I was a pregnant woman,

290
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:38,290
in a lousy marriage,

291
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:40,934
to the nicest guy
anyone's ever met.

292
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:42,259
End of story.

293
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:45,123
Who-- who is he?
What does he do?

294
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:46,888
Wh-where--
Where did you meet him?

295
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:53,251
College.

296
00:13:53,795 --> 00:13:55,654
We got married the year
after we graduated.

297
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:56,758
He...

298
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,758
I wanted--
I wanted to move to New York,

299
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,582
and he wanted to live
on the side of a mountain

300
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:01,819
and take over his dad's shop.

301
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:04,172
And he's a woodworker.
He makes beautiful furniture.

302
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:05,590
It's-- It's-- It's...

303
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:08,096
quiet, and he's quiet and...

304
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:11,121
- I was going out of my mind.
- So you just...

305
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:13,269
- took off?
- No, I...

306
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:15,750
No, I need-- I need-- I need--

307
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:18,315
I needed to think
and to be around other people.

308
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,722
So I came to Seattle, and I...

309
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:23,004
Thought I'd see the sights,
ride the ferry.

310
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:24,347
- Have you even called him?
- No.

311
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:26,019
- Why not?
- I left him, Alex.

312
00:14:26,038 --> 00:14:27,784
So? He's your husband.

313
00:14:28,113 --> 00:14:30,018
You should call him.
You want me to call him?

314
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:32,765
I mean, what's his name?
What's your name?

315
00:14:34,586 --> 00:14:35,844
I'm not telling you that.

316
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:41,771
- We've got everything taken care of.
- You don't have to worry about a thing.

317
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,892
I've got number 2 pencils
and bottled water.

318
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:45,804
Oh, and-- And powerbars.

319
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:47,296
And you know the material.

320
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,000
You're gonna get a high score--
Not as high as mine--

321
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:51,475
But everything's gonna be fine.

322
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:53,748
What are you guys
all standing around for?

323
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:55,400
Don't we have a test to--

324
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:57,297
What happened?

325
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,851
You people need to head upstairs.

326
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,391
Dr. Grey will join you in a minute.

327
00:15:07,503 --> 00:15:10,179
You're not to blame for Susan Grey's
death, and you know it,

328
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,840
and your father knows it, too.

329
00:15:12,396 --> 00:15:13,532
He's just...

330
00:15:15,063 --> 00:15:17,176
Well, he's never been
the best communicator,

331
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,600
and he just lost his wife.

332
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:22,912
Stop acting
like my surrogate father.

333
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:26,351
- Meredith, I've...
- Just Because you slept with my mother,

334
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,308
that does not make you my father.

335
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:34,533
Follow my finger. Up.

336
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,375
Okay. Good.

337
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,441
Let me know
if you can feel this, okay?

338
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,922
Yeah, I'm not enjoying that.

339
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:46,678
Good. That's a good sign.

340
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:48,589
It means I'm not paralyzed?

341
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:51,072
Well, the M.R.I. will show us
the full extent of the injuries.

342
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:52,193
But, uh...

343
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,536
can we ask you
what happened up there?

344
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:01,283
It was my fault.

345
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:03,042
- Dale--
- It wasn't your fault.

346
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:05,807
60 ways to get up Mount Rainier,
and I had to pick Liberty Ridge.

347
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:07,328
It wasn't the route.

348
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:08,713
It was the storm.

349
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:11,937
On a clear day,
you don't think about storms.

350
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,526
A minute later, the wind's pasting you
to the side of the mountain,

351
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,362
and you can't see your hand
in front of your face.

352
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:19,390
Is that why you fell,
because of the storm?

353
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:24,327
All I know is I felt the rope tug,
and...

354
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:26,975
- I was in midair.
- We all were.

355
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,282
We were tied together.

356
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,672
Must have been a 100-foot drop.

357
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,252
And when we came to,
Lonnie wasn't moving.

358
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,609
Lonnie?
He's your friend who's still missing?

359
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:38,641
Well, this Lonnie,
is that why he didn't make it back,

360
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,946
because he was hurt?

361
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,109
Because he was dead.

362
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,738
I'm sorry.

363
00:16:46,568 --> 00:16:47,920
We had to leave him.

364
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,794
We had to get to the other side of
the mountain, or we'd be dead, too.

365
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:54,102
We had no choice.

366
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,834
You always have a choice.

367
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:58,809
You never leave a man behind.

368
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:04,050
Please take your seats,
doctors,

369
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,820
and put all study materials away.

370
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:09,808
Okay, if you don't know the answer,
choose "B." It's always "B."

371
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:13,292
And write your name in the upper
right-hand corner of your answer sheets.

372
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:21,136
You may open your test booklets...

373
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,396
Now.

374
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:29,316
W-we don't have to be here
if you're uncomfortable.

375
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:32,699
Oh, no, it's fine.
Unless you're uncomfortable.

376
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,121
- Actually, uh, I-I--
- He's fine.

377
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:37,568
So, Rina, how are you feeling?
Any problems?

378
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,815
Just the fact that I'm huge,

379
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:42,998
and I have, like, the worst heartburn
I've ever had in my life.

380
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:44,791
I can prescribe an antacid for that.

381
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:46,955
The first thing we're gonna do
is take a look at the baby.

382
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:48,768
This might be a little cold.

383
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:53,300
This baby deserves parents
who are gonna make it

384
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,662
their whole world, you know?

385
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:57,054
You know we're gay, right?

386
00:17:57,646 --> 00:18:00,529
I figured, with you both
being boys and everything.

387
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:03,212
The other couple I'm considering,

388
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:05,569
they're, like, oh, 40.

389
00:18:06,397 --> 00:18:09,045
She's been trying
to get pregnant for ten years.

390
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,585
It's so sad.

391
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,575
There's the heartbeat.

392
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:17,083
Oh, my god.

393
00:18:17,515 --> 00:18:19,364
There's, like,
a person inside of me.

394
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:22,580
Actually... there are two people.

395
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,254
Twins.

396
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:26,470
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

397
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:28,484
Oh, my god.
I think I'm gonna pass out.

398
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:35,528
Doctors, we are halfway
through our allotted time.

399
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:39,670
You only have 60 minutes left
to complete the exam.

400
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:26,910
She didn't write anything on the test.

401
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:29,591
She didn't answer a single question.
She just sat there.

402
00:19:30,276 --> 00:19:31,574
Wait, George, just--

403
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,809
Just give her a second.

404
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:37,889
I've got an extensive
antero-lateral flail chest.

405
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:39,600
He'll need surgical stabilization.

406
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:41,372
Dr. Torres, if you're available--

407
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:43,325
She's not.
My guy has bone fragments

408
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,278
in his spinal cord,
internal fixation.

409
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:46,973
Dr. Torres is gonna scrub in
with me.

410
00:19:47,006 --> 00:19:49,653
Uh, we have more than one
orthopedic surgeon in this hospital.

411
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:52,129
And you'll need 'em,
because Dr. Torres and I are looking

412
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:53,519
at possible multiple amputations.

413
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:56,054
Guys, I can be there for all of you.
We just have to figure it out.

414
00:19:56,073 --> 00:19:57,209
Dr. Burke asked first.

415
00:19:58,045 --> 00:20:01,256
- Well, I mean, with all due respect--
- okay, you all want Torres. Fine.

416
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:02,813
Rock, paper, scissors.

417
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,643
One, two, three.

418
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:07,334
All rocks. Very typical.
Ready?

419
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:08,470
And...

420
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:11,390
Rock smashes scissors.

421
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:12,873
- See you in the O.R.
- Best two out of three.

422
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:13,981
Dr. Burke!

423
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,623
What?

424
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:21,623
I just wanted to know
how it feels...

425
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:24,188
to not have to spend
the next 24 hours

426
00:20:24,198 --> 00:20:26,667
wondering if Richard picked you
to be chief resident.

427
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,098
How's it feel to be the chosen one?

428
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:36,512
Feels just fine.

429
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:43,326
How'd it go?

430
00:20:44,335 --> 00:20:45,354
Meredith.

431
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:47,401
Don't worry. I've got it.

432
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:53,052
It's not like
she actually flunked.

433
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:54,956
She-- She just
didn't write anything.

434
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:57,026
It's kinda like
she actually flunked.

435
00:20:58,098 --> 00:20:59,328
One guy two years ago,

436
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,157
he was on call three nights
before his test.

437
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,918
He slept through the whole thing.
He had to repeat his intern year.

438
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,820
She can't repeat her intern year.

439
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:07,264
It's pathetic.
We have to do something.

440
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:08,351
Cristina.

441
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:11,395
What? Okay, I don't know.

442
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:13,827
Mredith and I don't fail things.
This is not in my book.

443
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:19,041
It's Bailey. We gotta go.
We gotta go.

444
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:21,482
- We can't just leave her here.
- You got a better idea?

445
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:35,229
Okay, it's showtime, people.

446
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:36,928
Yang,
you're scrubbing in with Dr. Burke.

447
00:21:36,938 --> 00:21:39,992
Karev, you're with Dr. Montgomery.
Stevens, find Dr. Sloan.

448
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:44,458
- You paged me, too.
- Mercy West.

449
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,794
Callie told you.

450
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,399
You're in the best surgical program
in the country,

451
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:52,665
the toughest, most competitive
most respected.

452
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,266
You want to leave
this for Mercy West?

453
00:21:55,435 --> 00:21:58,007
- Mercy west--
- Is not Seattle Grace.

454
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,415
Are you trying to...

455
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:01,275
After all the work
that we've put into you,

456
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:03,142
are you trying to throw
your career away?

457
00:22:03,462 --> 00:22:04,607
I'm trying to...

458
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:07,785
do what's best for me right now.
I've had some personal issues.

459
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:10,655
I-I don't know what your personal
problems are, and I don't care.

460
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:14,523
I do care about your career,
so let me make myself clear.

461
00:22:14,806 --> 00:22:16,524
This is a mistake.

462
00:22:44,036 --> 00:22:46,604
It's like we're on a train
that's going 200 miles an hour,

463
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:48,968
and it would just be
so nice to get off,

464
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,288
and just...

465
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,513
stand on the platform
just for a minute.

466
00:22:59,151 --> 00:23:00,860
Looks like I'm off the train.

467
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,668
Our parents died.

468
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:09,174
When a parent dies,
it doesn't make any sense.

469
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,195
So you make...

470
00:23:13,387 --> 00:23:15,377
a lot of really terrible decisions...

471
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:20,027
that you're gonna end up having
to live with for a long time.

472
00:23:25,123 --> 00:23:27,583
You should go.
You are still on the train.

473
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:40,918
It's okay.
You have to go.

474
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,652
Go.

475
00:23:45,873 --> 00:23:47,093
Go. Go, go.

476
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:01,322
Addison.

477
00:24:02,587 --> 00:24:03,667
Adele.

478
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,268
What are you doing here?
What happened?

479
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:08,258
A fender bender. I'm fine.

480
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:10,915
I told the E.R. resident I'm fine,
but...

481
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:13,518
All right, I'm gonna page Richard.
I'll let him know you're here.

482
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:15,566
Oh, you will do no such thing,
Addison.

483
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:17,303
Richard cannot know I'm here.

484
00:24:17,431 --> 00:24:18,492
We're separated.

485
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:21,134
My life is none of his business.

486
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,322
I'm serious.

487
00:24:27,455 --> 00:24:29,013
Uh, all right. Well...

488
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:30,650
let's get you checked out.

489
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:34,129
Do you have any, um,
any pain, any...

490
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,514
anything?

491
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,777
Well...

492
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,678
there's one thing
I should probably mention.

493
00:24:41,774 --> 00:24:43,007
I'm pregnant.

494
00:24:51,974 --> 00:24:55,796
The baby looks fine on the ultrasound
but you are spotting a little.

495
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:57,102
It's nothing severe,

496
00:24:57,712 --> 00:25:00,303
but I would like to hold you
overnight for observation.

497
00:25:00,404 --> 00:25:02,595
Overnight? Oh, no.
I'm sorry.

498
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:04,745
- But--
- For just a couple of hours at least.

499
00:25:04,763 --> 00:25:06,003
Look, it could be nothing.

500
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:08,866
But a pregnancy at your age is--

501
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,655
Terrifying? Embarrassing?

502
00:25:11,794 --> 00:25:13,680
I was going to say a miracle.

503
00:25:13,858 --> 00:25:16,778
I don't know. I resigned myself
to the fact a long time ago

504
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:18,387
that I would never have kids,
and...

505
00:25:19,187 --> 00:25:22,155
here I am, 52,
about to be divorced and...

506
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,680
pregnant.

507
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:27,723
May I ask who... the father is?

508
00:25:28,954 --> 00:25:30,090
You may ask.

509
00:25:30,147 --> 00:25:31,638
Look, all I'm saying...

510
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:34,933
is that if Richard finds out that
you're walking around this hospital

511
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:37,006
carrying another man's baby...

512
00:25:37,128 --> 00:25:39,062
Richard is not going to find out

513
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,574
because neither one of us
are going to tell him.

514
00:25:51,123 --> 00:25:52,756
- Chief.
- Addison.

515
00:25:52,978 --> 00:25:54,105
I just heard the news.

516
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:55,560
You-- You heard?

517
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,521
Who told you?
What-- What did you hear?

518
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:00,765
That Joe and Walter are adopting.

519
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,009
Is the birth mom here?
I'd love to put in a good word.

520
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:05,967
Chief, you don't want to go in there.

521
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:07,110
It's a young girl...

522
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:09,086
in the stirrups, you know,

523
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:11,231
her equipment exposed, right?

524
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,767
You don't want to see that.

525
00:26:13,712 --> 00:26:15,392
No, I-I don't want to see that.

526
00:26:26,822 --> 00:26:29,724
Are you going to give me
an inspirational speech, too?

527
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:40,987
I can't talk.
I have a patient to prep.

528
00:26:41,006 --> 00:26:42,675
This isn't about you and me.
This is about Meredith.

529
00:26:42,682 --> 00:26:44,712
- What are we gonna do?
- There's nothing to do.

530
00:26:44,752 --> 00:26:45,832
What?

531
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,326
I'm not even gonna be
here in a week, so...

532
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:50,683
So your transferring
to another hospital

533
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,445
means we're not gonna be
friends anymore?

534
00:26:53,985 --> 00:26:55,356
Why are you doing this, George?

535
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:58,049
Didn't you hear a word
of what Bailey said?

536
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,392
<i>What were we supposed to do,</i>

537
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,679
<i>carry him down the mountain?</i>

538
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,972
<i>He was our friend,
and we left him there.</i>

539
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:05,726
If we hadn't, we'd be dead, too.

540
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:07,368
You know that.

541
00:27:08,972 --> 00:27:10,071
Dale was right.

542
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,830
<i>You don't--
You don't do that.</i>

543
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:16,286
<i>You don't...</i>

544
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,586
<i>climb all the way up there together
just to leave a man behind.</i>

545
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:24,662
I am being stalked by pregnant women.

546
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:25,817
You're an obstetrician.

547
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:28,399
And barren.
You know, apparently as a healthy,

548
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:31,427
successful woman in her 30s,
I don't deserve to have a baby.

549
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:33,867
Maybe I'd have a fighting chance
if were gay,

550
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:37,384
or a teenager
or a member of the A.A.R.P.

551
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:39,900
Oh, that sucks.

552
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:41,750
It really...

553
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,552
No, no, not you, too.

554
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:50,674
Oh, no, no, I'm not. I'm just--
I'm thinking about it.

555
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:52,130
That's all.

556
00:27:54,262 --> 00:27:55,727
Oh, I don't know.

557
00:27:55,914 --> 00:27:58,712
I don't even know.
It's just that with George...

558
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:01,065
- going to Mercy West next year...
- He is?

559
00:28:01,255 --> 00:28:04,096
Yeah, they have a spot for him,
and we need a fresh start.

560
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,138
We need to get away
from all this crap.

561
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,321
It might be a good time.

562
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:10,816
It's a great time.

563
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:15,374
Don't let me and my fossilized eggs
discourage you.

564
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:17,876
Are we gonna be friends still
if I get pregnant?

565
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:19,162
Absolutely not.

566
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:30,450
- Hi, chief.
- O'Malley.

567
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,066
Finally coming to see me
about that letter from Mercy West?

568
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,018
No, sir.

569
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,003
I'm here about Meredith.

570
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,656
I have to say, I don't get it.

571
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:46,303
Why would anybody
waste their time freezing

572
00:28:46,472 --> 00:28:48,558
and climbing up
the side of a glacier?

573
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:52,737
It's a way to test yourself, you know,
your strength and endurance.

574
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:55,121
You put yourself through
a situation like that,

575
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,074
and you know exactly
who you are,

576
00:28:57,566 --> 00:28:58,627
what you made of.

577
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,434
Have you done it before,
Dr. Burke?

578
00:29:01,628 --> 00:29:02,703
No. You?

579
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,698
I used to, all the time,
in college.

580
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:06,060
- Really?
- Really?

581
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,086
Yeah, it's, intense.

582
00:29:09,104 --> 00:29:11,029
I mean, it's painful and hellish,

583
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:12,954
and you think your lungs
are shredding, but...

584
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:16,019
Man, when you get to the top,
there is nothing like it.

585
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:18,793
Makes the whole climb worth it.

586
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,712
How's it going?

587
00:29:32,768 --> 00:29:34,609
Worse than I thought.
There's nothing here.

588
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:36,067
We're gonna amputate both?

589
00:29:36,096 --> 00:29:37,542
You can't amputate
both of his hands.

590
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,025
I-Isn't the left hand less damaged?

591
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:41,144
I don't want to take
the man's hands, Dr. Stevens.

592
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,527
Once the infection gets that deep,

593
00:29:42,546 --> 00:29:44,585
the only way to save his life
is to make the cut.

594
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:51,013
The patient's laminotomy happens
at what level, Dr. O'malley?

595
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:54,153
The level of maximal neural
compressions between

596
00:29:54,163 --> 00:29:56,069
the pedicles
of the fractured vertebrae.

597
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,242
Very good.

598
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,073
You must have aced
your exam today.

599
00:29:59,954 --> 00:30:01,231
I don't know about aced.

600
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:02,888
How did Meredith do?

601
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,521
Yeah, she was kinda...

602
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,944
Don't worry, though.
I talked to the chief.

603
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,740
About what?

604
00:30:11,078 --> 00:30:12,092
She didn't tell you?

605
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:19,699
All right, here's the thing--

606
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:22,262
The Seattle police department's
been on this for weeks.

607
00:30:22,495 --> 00:30:25,237
They've been in contact with
missing persons from all 50 states...

608
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:26,781
Canada, the FBI--

609
00:30:27,302 --> 00:30:29,068
You know how many people
are trying to find you?

610
00:30:29,105 --> 00:30:30,720
- Yeah, yes.
- That's right. You do know.

611
00:30:30,776 --> 00:30:32,795
You know exactly
how many relatives you have.

612
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:34,373
You know if your parents
are dead or alive.

613
00:30:34,405 --> 00:30:36,923
You know if you've got a sister
somewhere who cries every day because

614
00:30:36,932 --> 00:30:38,520
- she has no idea what happened to you.
- Stop it!

615
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:39,883
What do you think
it's like for your husband?

616
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:41,369
He didn't come looking for me, okay?

617
00:30:43,454 --> 00:30:45,412
He obviously
doesn't want to find me.

618
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:48,056
- Besides,it's my life.
- No, not just yours.

619
00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:49,533
What about your daughter?

620
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:51,036
I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna lie for you.

621
00:30:51,064 --> 00:30:52,416
If you're not gonna tell anybody,
I will.

622
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:53,571
What are you gonna say?

623
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:55,733
You don't know my real name.

624
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,499
You don't know anything about me.

625
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,072
It'll be my word against yours.

626
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,860
You're right. I have absolutely
no idea who you are.

627
00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:15,926
- You paged me?
- Yeah.

628
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:17,663
I think I figured out
a way to help Meredith.

629
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,784
But I've got shepherd's post-op,
and...

630
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:21,719
I can't do it without your help.

631
00:31:22,144 --> 00:31:24,181
And I won't leave
the program without...

632
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,749
knowing that she's still in it.

633
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,680
You're not leaving the program.

634
00:31:32,497 --> 00:31:34,675
Listen... we made a mistake.

635
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,376
We had sex.

636
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:38,733
But that's all it was.

637
00:31:39,626 --> 00:31:42,246
I think we both wanted it
to mean something because...

638
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:45,774
you didn't want to have to feel like
that guy that cheats on his wife,

639
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:47,220
I didn't want to have
to feel like that girl

640
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,629
who put you in that position
in the first place.

641
00:31:48,648 --> 00:31:49,974
But the truth is...

642
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:52,800
It didn't mean anything.

643
00:31:54,844 --> 00:31:56,553
I know you think
I have feelings for you,

644
00:31:57,342 --> 00:31:58,525
but I don't.

645
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:01,553
So you can stay.

646
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,350
You're not leaving the program.

647
00:32:38,285 --> 00:32:41,355
Nice work today Torres...
Three surgeries at the same time.

648
00:32:41,374 --> 00:32:44,482
I performed four osteosyntheses,
amputated two hands

649
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,685
and stabilized
one spine in two hours.

650
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:48,869
Impressive.

651
00:32:49,376 --> 00:32:52,239
Looks like Bailey's not
a shoo-in for chief resident after all.

652
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:59,447
Uh, you're in the running
for chief resident, too?

653
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,682
Why wouldn't I be?

654
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:06,133
No. Uh, it makes sense.

655
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:08,621
I just... I hadn't thought about it.
That's all.

656
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:11,938
I'm good at what I do, Bailey.

657
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:14,672
I'm focused,
I'm disciplined, I'm--

658
00:33:15,483 --> 00:33:17,384
I'm more than qualified
to be chief resident.

659
00:33:19,562 --> 00:33:21,609
Look, we all know
that you're the chief's favorite,

660
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:24,283
but that doesn't mean
I can't take a shot.

661
00:33:28,357 --> 00:33:29,409
Here she is.

662
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:32,423
Thank you, Stevens.
You can go now.

663
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:34,025
We'll be waiting right outside.

664
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:35,780
- You don't have to.
- Shut up.

665
00:33:43,214 --> 00:33:44,763
If you called me here
to lecture me--

666
00:33:44,782 --> 00:33:47,430
There's a copy of
the intern's exam on the table,

667
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,139
some number 2 pencils,
a bottle of water

668
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:51,758
and a sandwich if you get hungry.

669
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:54,507
I'll send a proctor in,
and I'll come back

670
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:55,962
in a few hours and check on you.

671
00:33:59,499 --> 00:34:01,170
You are not my father.

672
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:05,172
I know that.

673
00:34:27,803 --> 00:34:28,977
I know.

674
00:34:52,855 --> 00:34:54,930
Well, at least test day
is almost over.

675
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,864
Speak for yourself.

676
00:34:57,526 --> 00:34:58,963
I'm getting married tomorrow.

677
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,686
This is what you invited me to?

678
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:18,532
This is your big bachelor party?

679
00:35:18,568 --> 00:35:20,512
It was last-minute.
I needed some warm bodies.

680
00:35:20,572 --> 00:35:22,450
Which would explain
why I'm here.

681
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,566
Why am I the only girl,
by the way?

682
00:35:24,613 --> 00:35:26,510
What am I, the entertainment?
I am not stripping.

683
00:35:26,538 --> 00:35:28,181
That's okay.
We've seen it already.

684
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:30,871
- True.
- I haven't.

685
00:35:30,956 --> 00:35:34,344
Yeah, well, why don't I buy you
a drink instead?

686
00:35:34,814 --> 00:35:35,912
First round's on me.

687
00:35:36,015 --> 00:35:37,612
I'll give you a hand with those.

688
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:41,841
Cristina write her vows?

689
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:43,833
I guess I'll find out tomorrow.

690
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:46,963
How's Meredith doing?

691
00:35:47,234 --> 00:35:48,483
I have no idea.

692
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:52,017
Shouldn't be this difficult,
should it?

693
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:54,308
Probably not.

694
00:35:55,584 --> 00:35:56,711
Then again...

695
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,837
when I see Cristina walking down
that aisle tomorrow...

696
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,152
It'll all be worth it?

697
00:36:15,446 --> 00:36:16,873
So how was L.A.?

698
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,666
L.A. was... different.

699
00:36:25,735 --> 00:36:27,566
Look, Mark...

700
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:32,336
Things don't have to be
awkward between us.

701
00:36:33,012 --> 00:36:34,017
We tried.

702
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:35,855
We tried, and we did our best

703
00:36:35,856 --> 00:36:38,728
and just because we failed
as a couple, it doesn't mean--

704
00:36:38,777 --> 00:36:39,894
I know.

705
00:36:41,894 --> 00:36:43,218
So we're still friends?

706
00:36:46,749 --> 00:36:47,810
With benefits?

707
00:36:49,914 --> 00:36:51,032
Don't push it.

708
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,616
Thanks, Joe.

709
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:58,222
So hey, how'd it go with Rina?

710
00:36:58,419 --> 00:37:01,640
Oh, well... Walter took her
to the bus station,

711
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:04,656
and I'm pretty sure he was wishing
it was me he was dropping off.

712
00:37:04,674 --> 00:37:06,064
That bad, huh?

713
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,914
If I can't even make it
through an ultrasound

714
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:09,548
without breathing
into a paper bag,

715
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,020
how am I gonna handle a kid?

716
00:37:11,255 --> 00:37:12,485
Forget about twins.

717
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:15,648
You two are gonna make
great parents, okay?

718
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,071
Whenever that happens.

719
00:37:17,606 --> 00:37:19,822
You... ever think
about having kids?

720
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,772
All the time.

721
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:32,131
Adele?

722
00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:41,313
Oh, come on.
I know you saw me.

723
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,373
Now this is just silly.

724
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,288
You don't have to hide.

725
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:49,575
I've moved on.

726
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,411
I'm dating now.

727
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:55,696
Okay, I'm not actually dating,

728
00:37:55,978 --> 00:37:57,424
but I intend to...

729
00:37:58,814 --> 00:37:59,931
at some point.

730
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:04,770
What the hell am I supposed to do
about the stupid vows?

731
00:38:04,771 --> 00:38:06,103
You still haven't written anything?

732
00:38:06,122 --> 00:38:08,019
- Well, it's stupid crap.
- No, it isn't.

733
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:09,329
Well, what am I supposed to say?

734
00:38:09,383 --> 00:38:12,268
I swear to love and cherish you every
moment of every day of my life?

735
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:14,838
I mean, that's not real.
That's not how it works, right?

736
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:16,706
It does, at first...

737
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:18,828
- but then it...
- It passes.

738
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:20,143
No, it doesn't.

739
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:22,991
You guys are just used to it.
That's all. You already have it.

740
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,311
You have that thing
everybody else wants.

741
00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:26,876
You can take it for granted.

742
00:38:26,947 --> 00:38:28,755
But let me tell you,
if you didn't, if you couldn't...

743
00:38:28,783 --> 00:38:29,985
be with the person
that you love,

744
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:31,313
I guarantee that...

745
00:38:31,698 --> 00:38:34,120
hearing him promise
to love you and...

746
00:38:34,383 --> 00:38:37,078
honor you and cherish you,

747
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:40,415
no matter what, it would be
pretty much all you could think about.

748
00:38:46,602 --> 00:38:48,996
Wait, can you say that again,
just slowly?

749
00:38:53,963 --> 00:38:55,521
You're talking about Denny,
right?

750
00:38:56,556 --> 00:38:57,618
Yeah.

751
00:39:19,718 --> 00:39:20,722
Hi.

752
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,112
Hi.

753
00:39:23,191 --> 00:39:24,374
Can I buy you a drink?

754
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:27,555
Wow, you're forward.

755
00:39:29,137 --> 00:39:30,226
Bad day.

756
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:31,775
I get to be forward today.

757
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:34,085
Yeah, I had a bad day, too.

758
00:39:37,116 --> 00:39:38,591
So what do you say, one drink?

759
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:44,436
I'm with some friends.
It's a bachelor party. So...

760
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:45,934
I'm gonna...

761
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:50,671
I'm gonna say no.

762
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,603
That's too bad.

763
00:40:01,287 --> 00:40:02,555
Maybe you're right.

764
00:40:31,184 --> 00:40:32,545
Rebecca Pope.

765
00:40:37,996 --> 00:40:39,217
That's my name.

766
00:40:51,344 --> 00:40:52,630
Adele, come on.

767
00:40:54,593 --> 00:40:56,424
Now you've got me
in this ladies' room.

768
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,703
The least you could do is an--

769
00:41:03,824 --> 00:41:05,571
Oh, my god. Adele.

770
00:41:07,513 --> 00:41:09,879
- What are you doing here?
- Sweetie, get Rina some water.

771
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:11,800
I thought you guys were
going to the bus station.

772
00:41:11,871 --> 00:41:13,880
- We were.
- It's this heartburn.

773
00:41:13,899 --> 00:41:16,198
It's like it's--
It's ripping through...

774
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,292
Call an ambulance.

775
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:25,518
Tucker, uh, since he's awake,
can you put him on?

776
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:29,758
Let me call you back.

777
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:31,337
Nicole, what have you got?

778
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:35,130
We got the fourth climber.
Pressure's 70s, last pulse 135.

779
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:37,955
Severely hypothermic.
Started two large-bore I.V.S.

780
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:40,161
Oh, and, uh, obvious head trauma.

781
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:44,519
Is that an ax in his head?

782
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:48,654
What the hell happened up
on that mountain?

783
00:41:48,783 --> 00:41:49,936
Let's go!

784
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:55,785
Somebody help me!
Please!

785
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:02,656
Somebody help!

786
00:42:04,778 --> 00:42:06,355
Please, somebody help me!
