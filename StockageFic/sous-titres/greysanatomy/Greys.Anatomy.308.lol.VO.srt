1
00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:02,000
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,520
- Is this place where Georgie lives ?
- Oh, George.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,070
O'malley!

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,310
Callie... she dumped me.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,400
Don't chase me anymore unless
you're ready to catch me.

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,560
You erased my name from Burke's
humpty dumpty surgery.

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,020
What I don't know is why.

8
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,610
- You okay ?
- Absolutely.

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,270
Stop worrying.
Nobody has to know.

10
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,870
I saw you there, at the nursing
home with my mother.

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,300
She lights up when you're around.

12
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,880
Meredith, I want to start over.

13
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,480
- You're not going to retire.
- I need more time.

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,310
I don't have any more time to give.

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,820
- It's about your dad, George.
- My dad ?

16
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:41,630
Many people don't know that the human eye
has a blind spot in its field of vision.

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,680
There's a part of the world
we are literally blind to.

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,840
- What did I say ?
- Seriously ?

19
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,290
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

20
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,710
Seriously.
We're taking it slow.

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,770
I can take it slow.

22
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,570
I can take it incredibly slow.

23
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,720
We're taking it slower than that.
We're starting fresh.

24
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,080
And starting fresh
means no sex because...

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,340
Because we started with sexlast time,
and it didn't go very well.

26
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,230
Plus, the waiting is fun.

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,450
And we need fun.

28
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,140
From now on I want to be bright and shiny.

29
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,910
Bright and shiny, huh ?

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,700
The problem is, sometimes our blind spots shield
us from things that really shouldn't be ignored.

31
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,380
Mom.

32
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,530
The nurses tell me
you haven't been eating.

33
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,270
No time.

34
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,070
I've been in the O.R.All morning,and I've got
back-to-back surgeriesthe rest of the day,so...

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,350
Ok, I'm sorry that I haven't been
visiting, it's just that I'v been

36
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,580
I don't have time
to coddle you right now.

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,970
I'm trying to save lives here.
Do you understand ? Do you ?

38
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,540
- Dr. Grey.
- Chief.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,530
Richard.

40
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,340
For me?
You shouldn't have.

41
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,120
The nurses said
she hasn't been eating.

42
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,750
Oh, you wonderful man.

43
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,890
I'm interrupting.
I'll...I'll go.

44
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,880
No, chief.
Uh...

45
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,280
You stay and I'll go.

46
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,930
Sometimes our blind spots
keep our lives bright and shiny.

47
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,810
Today is the day, people.

48
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,350
Today is the day when dark-and-twisty
Meredith disappears forever

49
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,120
And bright-and-shiny
Meredith takes her place.

50
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,930
You're probably not gonna
want to be friends with me anymore

51
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,820
because the sheer intensity of
my happiness is gonna make your teeth hurt.

52
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,200
But that's okay
because life is good.

53
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,420
Life is good.

54
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,930
What's going on ?

55
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,620
George's dad got admitted last night.

56
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,770
Oh, my god.
Is he okay ?

57
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,030
Oh, no, he's fine.

58
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,980
He, uh, passed out, hit the floor
and fractured his clavicle.

59
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,990
Yeah, but his clavicle's fine.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,620
Callie said it's gonna be fine.

61
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,660
Are those his A.M.Labs ?

62
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,420
Yeah, complaining of severe abdominal pain.

63
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,680
He doesn't have peritoneal signs.
That's good.

64
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,510
Has anybody seen...

65
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,710
I was just looking at it.

66
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,910
Don't you think me reading it
is more important than you reading it ?

67
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,280
Sure.
Fine.

68
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,680
He's gonna be fine.

69
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,490
You're on scut today.
You'll be distracted.

70
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,200
No, I won't.

71
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,240
Family members do not treat family members. Scut.

72
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,140
I'm scrubbing in on a surgery
with Dr. Burke this morning.

73
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,110
Of course you are.

74
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,370
Karev, Sloan. Grey, pit. 
Stevens, shadow Karev.

75
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,730
And let me remind you again
of the rules of your probation.

76
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,150
I think she knows the rules, Dr. Bailey.

77
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,820
No touching patients, no talking to patients,
no rolling your eyes at the patients or your superiors.

78
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,170
Hey.
Good morning, Addison.

79
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,390
What's that supposed to mean ?

80
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,450
It is a greeting...

81
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,940
used in civilized cultures
by their civilized inhabitants.

82
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,170
- You're smiling.
- Yeah. It's called happiness.

83
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,830
I understand why you wouldn't recognize it.

84
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,510
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

85
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,130
We're, uh, being mature about this?

86
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,010
Yes, we are going to peacefully
coexist in this hospital,

87
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,650
unless you've reconsidered
moving back to New York.

88
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,660
Okay, then.
We peacefully coexist.

89
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,220
- Interesting.
- Yes.

90
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,960
We're adults. We're educated.
I think we're capableof many, any things.

91
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,430
Come on.
Let's shake on it.

92
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,800
So I'm still wearing the rings.

93
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,910
- I think they're stuck.
- Have you tried soap ?

94
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,750
I hear it's good and slippery.

95
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,300
You are a very strange person, Derek.

96
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,410
I am just bright and shiny,
Addison, bright and shiny.

97
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,540
No, so then I just... I poed
his shoulder right back in.

98
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,220
He didn't even flinch.
Your brother is hard-core.

99
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,320
- George ?
- Callie, what are...

100
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,930
Looks like you've got
a full house, Mr. O'malley.

101
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,760
Just waiting on the wife.

102
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,280
She's in D.C.Uh,
chaperoning a field trip.

103
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,910
Yeah, she's coming in today.

104
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,580
His clavicle's still hurting,
so I added P.R.N. Morphine every four hours.

105
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,630
And I've scheduled your
endoscopy for this afternoon.

106
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,150
- An endo-what?
- Scope.

107
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,880
That's like...like a camera.

108
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,620
That sounds dangerous.
Is that dangerous?

109
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,580
- No, it's not dangerous.
- Okay, I di't ask you. I asked the doctor.

110
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,410
Yeah, let the doctor speak, Georgie.

111
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,760
White coat.
Let's look at the white coat.

112
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,870
What about an x-ray?

113
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,160
'Cause I had that once, and I feel like he

114
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,610
shut up, both of you.
Shut up.

115
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,630
- O'malley.
- what ?

116
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,800
Uh, n... since we're all...

117
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,650
well, she's not talking to you.

118
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,960
Ah, excellent.
My invaluable intern.

119
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,430
Is it "bring a hot blonde to work" day?
No one told me.

120
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,720
Sexual harassment.

121
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,250
Dr. Stevens is
shadowing me today, so...

122
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,660
which one of these cases
do you need us on?

123
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,780
It's a really tragic one.

124
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,750
I found out just this morning that I have over two weeks
worth of dry cleaning that needs to be picked up...

125
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,370
- Stat.
- Cool. That's it?

126
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,930
See ? We're like a well-oiled
machine, you and me.

127
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,490
I also need you two to get me a sandwich
from that pathetic excuse for a deli.

128
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,940
You know the one I like, Karev.

129
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,810
Oh, but go easy on the mayo this time.

130
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,500
I think you're trying to kill me.

131
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,070
I don't see why I can't at least
help with my dad's endoscopy.

132
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,640
What about "no working with family"
do you not understand ?

133
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,510
- I'm not asking to do the pro...
- Fine.

134
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,800
Pick an intern.

135
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,870
- What ?
- I'm being kind.

136
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,440
You want an intern assigned
to your dad's case ? Fine.

137
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,090
Who do you want ?

138
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,610
Right now.
Pick an intern.

139
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,990
Excellent.

140
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,950
Now we want to place a partial
occluding clampon the aorta.

141
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,380
Slowly.

142
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,770
Good.

143
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:53,430
Now make sureall the grafts are de-aired
before you remove the venous and aortic cannulas.

144
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,730
He's letting her decannulatethe heart by herself ?

145
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,460
Freakin' unbelievable, huh ?

146
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,090
What do we have ?

147
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,550
Mia Hanson...5 year old female, crush injury
to the abdomen, blunt trauma to the head.

148
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,670
B.P.90 over 60, pulse 110.

149
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,300
How was she injured ?
Backed over by her mom's S.U.V.

150
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,440
She's, um...her blood type is A-negative,
and she's allergic to penicillin and, um, wheat.

151
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,230
I am so sorry, Mia.
I am so sorry, baby.

152
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,480
Has she had anything to eat today ?

153
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,950
Uh, cereal this morning around 6:30.

154
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,250
Okay, Mrs. Hanson, we're going
to take care of your daughter.

155
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,420
I am Mrs. Hanson.
Mia is my child.

156
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,960
Anna is just the nanny
who ran over my daughter !

157
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,050
God.

161
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,140
I'm gonna examine your neck, okay ?

162
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,630
It's okay, Mia.
My name is Meredith.

163
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,140
And Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Bailey
are just trying to see where you're hurt, okay ?

164
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,080
What the hell happened?

165
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,590
- She ran over Mia in the driveway.
- She what ?

166
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,500
Mia wasn't supposed to
be in the driveway.

167
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,310
Mrs. Hanson told meto go get some milk,
and I...I didn't see her.

168
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,030
How do you not see a childs
tanding in the driveway ?

169
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,410
- And where were you ?
- What ?

170
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,300
What were you doing that you
couldn't watch Mia for five minutes ?

171
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,440
I was supposed to be in court.

172
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,020
Oh, you're on the phone...

173
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,030
I was letting them know
that I was going to be late.

174
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,280
Instead of watching Mia.

175
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,040
Oh, so now this is my fault ?

176
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,790
It's the car's fault, okay ?

177
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,180
S.U.V.S have blind spots the size of jupiter.

178
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,820
And yelling and fighting and
placing blame is not gonna help your child.

179
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,470
Is she gonna be okay ?

180
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,010
She has blood in her ear canal.

181
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,380
We need to get her upstairs for a C.T.

182
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,610
Okay, ready ?

183
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,190
It's gonna be okay, baby girl.

184
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,380
Get away from her.
Now.

185
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,670
- What ?
- Get out !

186
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,300
I can't believe you...you just
decannulated a heart all by yourself.

187
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,000
I didn't decannulate the heart by myself.

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,840
I assisted Dr. Burke, who decannulated a heart.

189
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,910
Why are you being modest ?
Modest looks weird on you.

190
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,360
It's no big deal, George.

191
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,940
How's your father, O'malley ?
Anything new ?

192
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,290
He needs an endoscopy, and, uh,
Bailey won't let me be the intern on this case,

193
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,470
but she said I could pick someone.

194
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,450
I was wondering if Cristina
could be the intern on this case.

195
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,780
- Why ?
- That shouldn't be a problem.

196
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,160
Uh, uh, yes it is.

197
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,770
We have a carotid
endarterectomy scheduled at noon.

198
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,370
I'll push it.

199
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,910
- O'malley's father deserves the best.
- Thank you, Dr. Burke.

200
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,930
Not a problem, O'malley.

201
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,910
Your dad better get something
interesting wrong with him real fast.

202
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,730
You're sick.
She's a sick, horrible person.

203
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,390
Tell me again why you
put up with this crap ?

204
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,240
Because one of these days,
he's gonna crack and let me in on a case.

205
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,390
You sure you want to do plastics that badly ?

206
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,280
There you are.

207
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,900
What, did you go all the way
to New York for my pastrami ?

208
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,930
Extra spicy, extra lettuce, 
light on the mayo.

209
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,370
Mark...
what are you doing?

210
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,030
Lunch.
Want my pickle ?

211
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,840
Seattle grace is a teaching hospital
and part of your job is to teach.

212
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,070
Your interns aren't your slaves.

213
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,010
Fine.
No pickle for you.

214
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,920
Did you see that ?

215
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,910
Sloan. He's using his interns
to pick up his dry cleaning and his lunch.

216
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,330
I've got to do an endoscopy.

217
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,330
What the hell is going on
with the men in this hospital?

218
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,390
How you doing, Mr. Jeffes ?

219
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,490
Oh, Frank's doing okay.

220
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,300
He'd be doing a lot better
if the twins were even.

221
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,790
- Uh, twins ?
- Frank's new pecs.

222
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,780
- Who is Frank ?
- You're looking at him.

223
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,850
Frank, these are interns.

224
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,930
I'm supposed to be teaching them.
Apparently, this is a teaching hospital.

225
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,220
- Karev ?
- Yeah, uh...

226
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,060
Frank Jeffries is post-op day three
for pectoral enhancement surgery.

227
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,170
There was a slight complication
when a seroma formed.

228
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,780
- What is a seroma ?
- Build up of blood and fluid under the skin.

229
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,970
Sorry.

230
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,090
And that concludes today's teaching.

231
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,070
A tube was inserted into Mr. Jeffries'
chest to drain the excess fluid.

232
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,970
I want you to monitor him, check the tube for
fluid output and change his dressings. Dr. Stevens...

233
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,930
I guess you can watch.

234
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,010
- Actually, Dr. Stevens is an excellent doctor.
- Yeah, that's what I hear.

235
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,850
You decannulated a heart this morning.

236
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,390
- Yeah, I didn't decan...
- Yes, you did.

237
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,760
And when Burke and I were fishing, I...

238
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,930
I noticed something weird with his hand
like it had a spasm or something.

239
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,580
I'm sorry. Why are you even
saying that ? That is not funny.

240
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,620
I didn't say it was funny.

241
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,880
I said it was weird.

242
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,950
And him letting you decannulate
a heart, that's weird.

243
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,440
You should sit with your father.

244
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,810
'Cause if you want something
to worry about, you should worry about im.

245
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,400
My father is fine.

246
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,890
He's good... I have a good...
don't... this is Burke.

247
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,760
Did you think that...

248
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,670
I want Anna.

249
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,200
It's okay, Mia.
Mommy and daddy are here.

250
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,250
and we are just going
to take some pictures. Okay ?

251
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,730
This is a big camera.
I don't like it.

252
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,060
Grey...
keep her still.

253
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,700
Mia, baby...
it's okay. Mommy's here.

254
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,420
Where's Anna ?

255
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:29,210
- You need to lie very still, okay ?
- I want Anna.

256
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,080
How about I sing you
the good night song ?

257
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:37,810
And you pretend it's bedtime
and stay super still, okay ? Okay.

258
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:44,970
Good night, Mia good night,
mommy good night,daddy 

259
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,130
- No, you're singing it wrong.
- I am ? I'm singing it wrong ?

260
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,330
I want Anna.

261
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,300
She's in the waiting room, honey.
I'll... I'll get her.

262
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,950
John !
Let's all sing it together, okay ?

263
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,580
No.
I want Anna.

264
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,770
so now... but you pick... you pick a car.

265
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,430
Okay.
Um...

266
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,100
1968 mustang gt390 fastback.

267
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,040
That's interesting.

268
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,960
No,that is hot.
That is very hot.

269
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,280
Car.
Uh huh.

270
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,230
- Hey, Georgie.
- How's dad?

271
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,060
They're not done yet,
but I'm sure he's fine.

272
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,810
Can I talk to you, Dr. Torres ?

273
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,300
- Sure.
- Excuse me.

274
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,520
What are you doing ?

275
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,590
- I'm talking to your brothers.
- You don't have to do that.

276
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,160
It's okay.
I don't mind.

277
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,600
I'm pretty sure Ronny and Jerry
both have a thing for me.

278
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,080
I was gonna go with jerry
until he went all 1957 b-air.

279
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,080
I was like, "really ?"

280
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,040
Thank you for trying to help out
with my family, but it's really not necessary.

281
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,990
George... I'm kidding
about your brothers. Come on.

282
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,480
Callie, I'm serious.

283
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,200
I can handle my family on my own.

284
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,340
You broke up with me, remember ?

285
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,120
We may have to do a partial nephrectomy.

286
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,910
Do you think you can save Mia's kidney ?

287
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,130
Only if we can control the bleeders.
Here, cauterize as I go.

288
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,740
Thank you.

289
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,840
You poor baby.

290
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,290
It's not gonna bean easy recovery.

291
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,740
Well, with parents like that,
she didn't have it easy to begin with.

292
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,220
People do the best they can, Dr. Grey.

293
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,370
They don't know their kid's blood type.

294
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,950
They don't know her favorite song.

295
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:00,460
People want high-powered careers, I get that,
but they should think twice before having kids.

296
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,510
Oh ! I... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

297
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,610
What, that I should be home with my baby

298
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,460
instead of here with this little girl

299
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,340
and a surgical intern
who can't cauterize the bleeders ?

300
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,190
Dr. Bailey...

301
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,810
If I were you, Dr. Grey, I would keep my eye
on the surgical area and my mouth shut.

302
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,410
O'malley.
How's it going with your dad ?

303
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,130
Good. The chief's doing an endoscopy
on him, so he's in good hands.

304
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,830
That was an amazing surgerythis morning,
the way you let Cristina decannulate that heart.

305
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,740
She shows tremendous promise
in cardiothoracic surgery.

306
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,820
She said she didn't do it.

307
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,820
Probably didn't want to rub it in.
Make anyone jealous.

308
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,840
We're talking about cristina.

309
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,350
Everything allright with you?

310
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,880
Sure.
It's fine.

311
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,190
'Cause if anything ever wasn't,
you know you could talk to me, right ?

312
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,080
You've been through a lot lately,
getting shot, all that... it can't be easy.

313
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,650
Yeah.

314
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,480
Has it not been easy ?

315
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,700
It's fine.
send my best to your dad.

316
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,180
Okay.

317
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,730
- Hey.
- Hey.

318
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,830
This civil and mature thing,
how far does it go ?

319
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,060
Meaning what ?

320
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,220
Meaning is it pleasantries in the hallway,
or do we actually interact?

321
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,030
Oh, I don't know.
That sounds drastic.

322
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,280
I'm worried about Richard.
He seems down to me.

323
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,390
Well, he's separated from his wife.

324
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,740
That usually doesn't make
a person giddy, except in my case.

325
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,950
I think he could use
somebody to talk to.

326
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,330
- So talk to him.
- No, I think we both should.

327
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,750
You know, so it's clear that
he has people to turn to.

328
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,990
Because he's a little depressed?

329
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,170
Well, because I don't think
he's spoken to Adele in weeks,

330
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,720
and he's our friend, and he has always
been there for us.

331
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,560
When you get divorced, doesn't that mean
your wife is supposed to stop nagging you?

332
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,520
Maybe if you took the
rings off it would help.

333
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,570
Are you gonna come with me
to see the chief or not?

334
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,020
Fine.
Yes.Okay.

335
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,960
- Thank you.
- Let's do it.

336
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,630
And I will try soap.
For the rings, I mean.

337
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,480
Okay.

338
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,150
Oh, yeah. That's what I'm talking about.
Oh, look at you.

339
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,250
Oh, d... do they stilllook lopsided?
I mean,from the seroma.

340
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,350
No, it looks like most of
the swelling has gone down.

341
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,240
Yeah ?
Oh, yeah.

342
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,150
Hey, uh, Dr. Stevens,
would you take a look at the twins ?

343
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,440
Frank would like a woman's perspective.

344
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,560
- You're just looking.
- Oh. Oh, nice.

345
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,500
Yeah,it looks pretty even
to me, very defined.

346
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,130
And the redness should go away
in a couple of days.

347
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,590
Good.
Good.

348
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,190
Frank got them for his girlfriend.

349
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,320
He doesn't want her to
see 'em 'till their perfect.

350
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,060
Your girlfriend asked you
to get pec implants?

351
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,200
Oh, no.
No, no.

352
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,510
Frank's girlfriend joined a gym,
got a trainer named lars.

353
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,360
What kind of name is that lars ?

354
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,340
So you got fake pecs 'cause
you're jealous of a guy with a fake name?

355
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,900
Well, uh, my last girlfriend Veena...

356
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,900
left me for a guy with hair
so I got plugs... too late.

357
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,260
This time around, Frank's not
taking any chances.

358
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:09,160
Frank sees the signs of discontent,
Frank's fighting back.

359
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,660
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't know.

360
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,830
I just don't get the whole
fake boob thing, no offense.

361
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,300
Oh, these are... these are top of the line.

362
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,950
I mean,they... they look real,
they feel natural.

363
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,340
No, really.
Feel 'em.

364
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,250
Really. Come on.

Feel them.

365
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,670
- Very solid.
- And real.

366
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,630
- I don't know about that.
- Well, compare them to his.

367
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,460
- I'm not involved with this.
- Come on.

368
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,170
- Don't be such a baby.
- Oh.

369
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:46,120
This...
this is why I don't work with interns.

370
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,910
- Mrs. Hanson.
- She all right ?

371
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,120
Yes, we were able to stop the bleeding.

372
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,330
Dr. Shepherd has ordered
an M.R.I. of her skull fracture.

373
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,960
Hopefully she won't need
any more surgery.

374
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,090
Oh, thank god.

375
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,500
Uh, she's in recovery.
Dr. Grey will take you up to her.

376
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,540
Thank you.
Uh, can we wait just a minute ?

377
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,630
My husband went downstairs to use a landline.
His battery died.

378
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,540
- Sure.
- So Mia she's okay ?

379
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:16,690
Oh, she is.
Yeah.She, um...

380
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,350
keeps asking, uh, for Anna.

381
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,080
We fired Anna.

382
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,770
She just seems very attached to her.

383
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,280
That's my fault, according to my husband,
because I'm a working mother.

384
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,460
He's a working dad, but apparently
that's not the issue.

385
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,690
I love my job.
I love Mia more.

386
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,400
She is my baby.
She's my...

387
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,500
I love my daughter and I love my job.

388
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,860
I'm not good at the mom stuff,
but I'm good at my job.

389
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,280
I mean, why bother having a kid if you're
only gonna see it on weekends and holidays ?

390
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,780
You might as well just get a cat.

391
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,480
I talked to Burke.
I think he's fine.

392
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,380
- You did what ?
- What's wrong with Burke ?

393
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,710
Nothing's wrong with anybody.

394
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,960
Do you know he let her decannulate
a heart this morning?

395
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,520
You decannulated a heart
this morning, by yourself?

396
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,320
- Bitch.
- No, not by myself.

397
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,510
Now she's lying about it.

398
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,800
Yang decannulated a heart.
Why is Alex not surprised?

399
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,470
Izzie isn't either.

400
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,160
Last week, Izzie was digging through crap.
This week, she's fondling man boobs.

401
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,220
No decannulating hearts for Izzie.

402
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,280
Why aren't you bragging about
decannulating a heart?

403
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,750
- I didn't decannulate the heart.
- Izzie and Alex do not believe you.

404
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
Okay, what are you two doing ?

405
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,890
Izzie and Alex have a patient
who speaks about himself in the third person.

406
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,090
They thought it was annoying at first,
but now they kind of like it.

407
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,360
Good.
Is it gonna stop soon ?

408
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,390
Wow, what happened ?

409
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,280
This morning you were all "bright and shiny"
and asking to be kicked in the face.

410
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,810
I am.
I'm bright. I'm shiny.

411
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,010
Yeah.

412
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,530
Izzie thinks this whole bright
and shiny thing is getting old.

413
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,430
Alex agrees.

414
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,930
We think you're depressed.

415
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,600
- Both of you?
- Yes.

416
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,240
Well, for the two of you to agree on something,
I must damn near be suicidal.

417
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,180
- We agree on things.
- We agree on this.

418
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,900
So...
start talking.

419
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,680
Adele and I...

420
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,100
she wants me to step down
as chief, retire.

421
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,610
You, retire ?That's crazy.
What would you do ?

422
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,830
Uh, spend a little more time
with his wife, perhaps ?

423
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,720
She's being unreasonable.

424
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,740
She wants to know that his
marriage is a priority to him.

425
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,210
She's using his work as an excuse.

426
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,970
Or he is.
Some men use work.

427
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,020
- Some men use other women.
- Some women use other men.

428
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,320
I've been visiting Ellis Grey.

429
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,740
I was lonely, and you had
checked out and I was lonely.

430
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,980
I work, I visit Ellis.
That's my day.

431
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,420
You gave up on us first.
I was there.

432
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,840
I make time for Ellis.
I don't make time for Adele.

433
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,950
There's something driving a wedge
between Richard and Adele.

434
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,230
Now maybe you don't see it,
but I do, and so does Adele.

435
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,080
Maybe he sees it and doesn't
want to do anything about it.

436
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,820
He's gotta do something about it.
That's what marriage is built on, change.

437
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,240
Change is what keeps marriage alive.

438
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,580
The man has a right to do
whatever he wants to do...

439
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,600
stop... helping me.

440
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,650
Look, I miss my wife.
I want her back.

441
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,890
I don't want my marriage to be over.

442
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,500
Richard...

443
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,320
your marriage isn't over
until you decide it is...

444
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:06,910
Right.

445
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,030
Until you decide that the...
well, that the sacrifice just isn't worth it.

446
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,730
Right.

447
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,360
come in. Oh, Yang.

What is it?

448
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,430
- O'malley.
- Yeah.

449
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,240
I have your father's test results.

450
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,000
You gotta ask for it.

451
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,700
Hey, we've been waiting here forever.
Where's the doctor?

452
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,080
Uh, Dr. Webber will be in
in a couple of minutes.

453
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,600
Won't tell you anything, huh,
not 'till you're a real doctor ?

454
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,150
I am a real doctor.
Ronny !

455
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,360
I just... I'm just not dad's doctor.

456
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,210
What is it, Georgie?
Let's just wait for Dr. Webber.

457
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,540
No,I think he's expecting
you to tell him.

458
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,010
But he's coming.
He said he's coming.

459
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,220
He's coming in later.

460
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,160
You should... I mean, you should
tell your dad...

461
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,200
What's with the whispering ?

462
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,000
The biopsy results were abnormal.

463
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,840
well, is abnormal bad or...

464
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,590
...just different ?

465
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,200
Georgie ?

466
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,870
Sir... you have cancer in your esophagus,
which has spread to your stomach.

467
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,680
We need to operate to remove it,

468
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,280
and you'll need to undergo
chemotherapy and radiation.

469
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,480
I'm sorry.

470
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,860
They're gonna try to operate soon.
This week, I think.

471
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:34,820
It's a stage 3 metastatic cancer.
So...

472
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,600
and my...my brothers...
are...

473
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,270
and, uh...
C... Callie slept with Sloan.

474
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,360
I just can't...

475
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,410
I...
I can't...

476
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,360
I can't deal with... with any of it.

477
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:59,150
I spent the entire day worrying about Burke,
like there was something wrong with him.

478
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,310
But there's nothing wrong with Burke and...

479
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,450
God, my dad has cancer,
I can't even look him in the face.

480
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,670
Cristina had to tell him
wh...what was wrong.

481
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,270
Cristina.

482
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,000
Nobody gets it right
with their own family.

483
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,250
I certainly don't.

484
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,930
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

485
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,220
Callie slept with Sloan?

486
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,020
I don't get you people.

487
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,760
Us with the boobs?

488
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,750
- We make a lot of decisions.
- Yeah.

489
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,250
Dude, I still can't believe
you went through all this for a chick.

490
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,470
What, you never did
anything crazy for love?

491
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,870
Not like this.

492
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,910
- You have a girlfriend ?
- No.

493
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,740
Dr. Stevens ?

494
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,450
Frank can sense the vibes.

495
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,380
I'm not talking about this with you.

496
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,780
What, she left you for another guy ?

497
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,090
Frank's hit a nerve.

498
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,100
It's more complicated than that.

499
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,620
Uncomplicate it then, man.

500
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,760
Grand gestures is what I'm talking about.

501
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,890
Be like Frank. Just figure out
what she wants and make it happen.

502
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,760
Just forget all about the other guy.

503
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:23,440
Trust Frank.
Frank knows.

504
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,680
Hey, what do we got ?

505
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,340
The second M.R.I. report shows
bleeding in Mia's brain.

506
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,510
Oh, damn it.

507
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,940
I need to go in,
try to relieve the pressure.

508
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,560
- Two surgeries in one day?
- But she's tough.

509
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,870
And right now we don't have any other options.

510
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,600
Here.

511
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,790
Not so bright and shiny.

512
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,390
I thought the cancer was in my gut.
What are we looking at my heart for?

513
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,700
Your E.K.G. showed some abnormalities,

514
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,920
so we just want to make sure your heart's
healthy enough to support you through the surgery.

515
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:14,130
You're a smart girl.
Yes.

516
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,210
George told me you were the best intern
I could have on my case.

517
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,020
He said that ?

518
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,610
He said you were the best intern in the hospital.

519
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,760
Said you keep everyone on their toes, even him.

520
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:31,090
Dr. Yang, you should take a look at this.

521
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,090
Okay.

522
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,930
You paged me ?

523
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,190
What is Burke doing in there?

524
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,550
I did a pre-op echo.
His aorta valve is leaking.

525
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,020
He won't make it through the cancer
surgery unless we replace it.

526
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,570
It's just a valve replacement, George.
It's gonna be fine.

527
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,620
Burke will do it.

528
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,720
Burke will do it, and you will clear his schedule.

529
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,620
If someone is gonna operate on my dad's heart,
I want it to be Burke.

530
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,680
- Yeah.
- Okay.

531
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,530
It's gonna be fine.
It's a valve replacement.

532
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,930
It's Preston Burke. If someone's gonna cut
your dad's heart apart, you want it to be him.

533
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,170
What ?

534
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,410
- What's wrong with Burke's hand ?
- Nothing.

535
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,050
- He's gonna operateon my father.
- George, Burke is fine.

536
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,130
- Your dad will be fine.
- You're lying.

537
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,070
Burke is hiding something,
and you're helping him.

538
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,020
Leave me alone.

539
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,830
You wanted to see me, chief ?

540
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,000
it's about your mother.

541
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,910
I...I know your relationship with her is, uh...

542
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,780
complicated.

543
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,350
And I know you knowthat she and I were...

544
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,290
chief, it's okay.

545
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:29,790
What really matters is
that you make her happy,

546
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,110
and my father couldn't
and I couldn't,so...

547
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,190
Meredith, I...

548
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,390
I can't see your mother anymore.

549
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,150
I need to make...

550
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:47,140
I need to try to make my marriage work.

551
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,790
And if I'm gonna do that...

552
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,760
I have to stop seeing your mother.

553
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,770
I see.

554
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,550
She...

555
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,810
she's an extraordinary woman.

556
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:10,020
She worked so hard, she sacrificed so much,
and to see it end like this, it...

557
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,280
take good care of her for me.

558
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,700
We got it from here.
Yo.

559
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,920
Okay, Frank.
Time to take the tube out.

560
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,030
- Izzie, put on some gloves.
- What's going on?

561
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,230
Alex, what are you doing ?

562
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,450
You ready to take out Frank's boob tube ?

563
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,330
What about the rules?
What if Sloan finds out?

564
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,510
- Screw sloan.
- She knows what she's doing, right ?

565
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,510
I promise you, Frank,
the twins are in excellent hands.

566
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,860
Grand gesture.
Frank gets it.

567
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,550
- What's he talking about ?
- Nothing.

568
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,740
- You sure about this ?
- Oh, yeah, he's sure.

569
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,590
looks like we can safely evacuate the clot.

570
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,280
Want to cook the pumper ?

571
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,020
Did you ever think about having kids ?

572
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,440
Derek and I talked about it,
but I wasn't ready.

573
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,300
I love kids.
I'd have a dozen.

574
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,840
Believe me, one's enough,
unless you plan to put away your scalpel.

575
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,570
That's why god invented nannies.

576
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,860
I wish it were that easy.

577
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,090
What do I do with these,
hock 'em, keep 'em ?

578
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,670
My mom says post-divorce
wedding rings are bad juju.

579
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,340
- Your mom says juju ?
- She does.

580
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,890
So wh... what would your mom do ?

581
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,440
Burn 'em, bury 'em.

582
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,890
You want 'em?

583
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,300
Oh...oh, I... I want some rings,
just not bad juju rings.

584
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,000
Then again, my mom's kind of insane.

585
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,630
Hey, don't talk smack about your mom.

586
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Miranda.

587
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:11,320
Yesterday, I left for work early,
and Tuck's favorite food was strained peas.

588
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,250
Nasty green gunk, but he loved them,
ate them for breakfast.

589
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:20,400
I got home after a 15 hour shift,
and he doesn't likes trained peas anymore.

590
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:23,180
He only wants carrots.

591
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,960
Life moves so fast.

592
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,660
- Everybody moves on.
- Yep.

593
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,480
- Where you going ?
- I'm not ready to move on.

594
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,000
Do you know why I picked you
to be my dad's intern ?

595
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,500
Because you are a robot.

596
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,230
You're a freakin' robot in a white coat
who never makes a mistake,

597
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,710
and most of the time,
I appreciate that.

598
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,530
Most of the time, I really feel like
I have something to learn from you.

599
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:06,250
but right now... right now,
need you to try, just for a minute,

600
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,650
I need you to try to be a human being.

601
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,110
Thank you, Alex.
I can't believe you let me help.

602
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:32,310
Alex is cool, you know that ?
Alex is the coolest.

603
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:35,550
Oh, Alex knows it.
Izzie isn't so bad herself.

604
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,160
No, Izzie is rocking.
Izzie is back in the game.

605
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:49,800
I can't. Alex, I'm sorry.

I can't.

606
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,770
Hey, Mia.

607
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,200
Can you say something for me ?

608
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,260
I need to hear how great you talk.

609
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,770
Can you say my name ?
Can you say Meredith ?

610
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,370
Wh... where's...
Anna ?

611
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,760
That was great.

612
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:22,150
Guess who's here.
Mom and dad.

613
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:27,050
Hey.
How's my baby girl, huh ?

614
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,050
I want Anna.
Anna.

615
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,070
Diane, wait.
Diane, where are you going ?

616
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,090
So we'll do the thing with the heart tomorrow ?

617
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,870
Maybe tomorrow.
Uh, maybe in a couple of days.

618
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,540
I don't... I don't know quite yet.

619
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:51,160
But, uh, Dr. Webber and Dr. Burke said
we should get to it quick.

620
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:54,040
And we will get to it
as quick as we can.

621
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,390
I just want to make sure
that we do it right.

622
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,310
I just don't understand why they're operating
on his heart when the cancer is in his gut.

623
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,510
Yeah, it's complicated.
Um...

624
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,990
You know what I was thinking?
Maybe the tests are wrong.

625
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,200
Okay ?
Maybe it's not cancer.

626
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,610
'Cause... 'cause ...'cause cancer
runs in the family, right ?

627
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,630
And no one else in the family has cancer.

628
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,700
It... it is cancer.
Okay ?

629
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:21,110
It's stage 3
metastatic esophageal cancer.

630
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,350
- Meta-whatic ?
- Metastatic.

631
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,010
It's, uh, when the cancer cells
have migrated from their point of origin...

632
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,090
Okay, you're talking doctor now, George.
Just talk english.

633
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,070
I am talking english,
you're just not listening !

634
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,170
No, you're just not saying
anything that we understand !

635
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,030
Boys.

636
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,770
Imagine your dad's like a...

637
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,410
- Like a vintage car, okay ?
- Callie...

638
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,450
and, uh, his... his blood's like
gas flowing through the fuel lines.

639
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,080
The cancer cells are like the gunk
that builds up in there.

640
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,770
- And fouls up... fouls up the plugs.
Exactly.

641
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,140
Once the gunk starts circulating,
it can do a lot of damage to the whole engine

642
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,320
the carburetor, everything.

643
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,060
It's... it's like the engine
had already blown a gasket

644
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:07,500
even before all the other damage started.

645
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:22,650
good night, hot fudge
it's time to say good night

646
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,350
good night, Mia...

647
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,190
When it comes to our blind spots...

648
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:35,320
maybe our brains aren't compensating.

649
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,100
Maybe they're protecting us.

650
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,530
I'm glad you came to visit.

651
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,310
But you can't stay.
I'm expecting someone.

652
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,320
Actually...
mom, he's not coming.

653
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,520
What ?

654
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,160
The chief.
Richard.

655
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,750
He's not coming tonight.

656
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,540
It's... in fact, it's just
gonna be me for a while.

657
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,230
- he's gone back to Adele.
- Yes.

658
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,800
Of course he has.

659
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,330
Mom...

660
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:25,770
he's afraid, afraid to be happy.

661
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,220
And I'm all alone.

662
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,840
Now I have to raise my daughter alone.

663
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,310
How am I expected to do that?

664
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,730
Mom...

665
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,360
You did the best you could.

666
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,450
You did the best you could.
That's all anybody can do.

667
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,990
How am I looking?

668
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,880
Good.
You're ready for surgery.

669
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,160
That's good, I guess.

670
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,590
I don't know how I'm gonna
tell my wife about all this.

671
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:23,620
40 years, we've been married, and now...
cancer and a heart condition ?

672
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:31,930
She was always telling me how I should
eat betterand take better care of myself.

673
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,230
I guess I should have listened.

674
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,510
George...
is the best.

675
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:51,620
- What ?
- He's the best...intern.

676
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,590
He's a good doctor and he's a good person,

677
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,810
and whatever happens, I just thought
you should know that...

678
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,900
...that you raised a good person.

679
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,100
Thank you, Dr. Yang.

680
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,800
I didn't know you still
felt that way about me.

681
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:34,070
Me neither.

682
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:39,980
I can't.
I'm sorry.

683
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,130
Alex gets it.

684
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,300
Alex is sorry he's such an idiot.

685
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,950
Can Izziebuy Alex a drink?

686
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,500
Alex would like that.
Izzie can.

687
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,170
I know what time it is.

688
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,650
I... I... I don't care if he's sleeping,
just wake him up.

689
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,150
He could sleep late...
no, wake him up.

690
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,410
Okay.

691
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:12,310
Now... no, uh, put the phone to his ear.

692
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,920
Hey.
Hey, Tuck.

693
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,820
It's mommy.
Hey.

694
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:23,760
*Them that's got shall get*

695
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,350
*Them that's not shall lose*

696
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,670
*So the bible says*

697
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,870
*And it's still is news*

698
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:41,910
*Mama may have papa may have*

699
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,600
*But god bless the child that's got his own*

700
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:55,040
*That'got his own*

701
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:59,920
*Oh, the strong get more*

702
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:04,090
*While the weak ones fade*

703
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,950
George knows.

704
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:14,150
*Empty pockets don't ever make the grade *

705
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,100
*Mama may have papa, he may have*

706
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:25,090
*But god bless the child...*

707
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:29,050
I may not be cut out for bright and shiny.

708
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,690
I'm not either.

709
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,210
We can be dull and lifeless together.

710
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,640
I am glad you're in my bathtub.

711
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,350
me too.
