00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,910
previously on "grey's anatomy"...

3
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,410
you're watching me sleep again?

4
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,950
It's just that you snore a little.

5
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,830
harold o'malley,63,scheduled for a transhiatal esophagectomy tomorrow morning at 9:00.

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,830
I want you to take the tumor out.

7
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,670
As things progress with my dad,it would help me if you were straight with me.

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,300
Okay.

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,210
So that's it? We're closing him back up?

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:18,910
No.

11
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,110
But I thought-- the patient asked us to proceed.

12
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,890
You want to watch the kidneys because if the kidneys fail,that's a sign that everything else is starting to go.

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,590
130 ccs of shiny,yellow urine!

14
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,350
That is fantastic!

15
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,370
heather douglas,17,past medical history of vater syndrome.

16
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,710
I think I could significantly help with the spinal curvature.

17
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,790
I get to scrub in.

18
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,880
Not till I say so.

19
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,340
I deposited the damn check.

20
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,600
Insurance bastards.

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,500
The surgery's too experimental.

22
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,620
Looks like there won't be a surgery to scrub in on.

23
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,690
Sorry,stevens.

24
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,780
You don't get the high horse this week,addison.

25
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,830
Not this week.

26
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,010
dr.Burke's hand-- has he had any tremors?

27
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,090
- talk to him. - no

28
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,090
'Cause then he wins.

29
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,240
(Meredith) my father's here.

30
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,230
The one I don't talk to and barely know?

31
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:57,860
He's here.

32
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,190
If you want to go back to plastics...

33
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,810
nah.

34
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,030
all right!Just shut it off,please!

35
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,600
Could you not snap at me?

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,750
(Alarm stops) I didn't sleep much.

37
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,140
Maybe that's because you were too busy shoving me every five minutes.

38
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,400
I wasn't shoving you. I was nudging you to stop the very loud sawing of wood.

39
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,330
I wore the nose strip.

40
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,340
Oh,it's cute,but it doesn't work.

41
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,700
What?

42
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,950
You need to shave.

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,420
Izzie,uh...

44
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,840
the--the--the-- the--the check.

45
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,220
The--it's not,uh,it's--it's not-- did you--did you-- did you drop it?Here.

46
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,290
Move,move,ve.

47
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,800
Did you-- not--it--it's not here.

48
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,560
Izzie,it's not here.

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,540
I deposited it,okay?

50
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,620
You didn't deposit it in the garbage disposal or something like that,did you?

51
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,220
It's at the bank,okay,george?

52
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,170
Now just shut up about it already.

53
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,190
It's at--it's at the bank?

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,420
It's-- it's earning interest?

55
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,060
Did I not just say,"shut up about it already"?

56
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,240
Izzie...

57
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,610
it's real now.

58
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,470
I--that money,it could-- the money could travel.

59
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,770
It could--it could buy things.

60
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,890
It could buy many,many things.

61
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,580
That's a-- that's a lot of money,izzie.

62
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,380
Shut up about it,george.

63
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,380
I'm just saying-- I'm just saying,life is short.

64
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:52,900
You know,it's like,cancer happens and surgery happens,and I-- you know,it's just-- it's just-- "gather ye rosebuds"...

65
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,310
you know,you have 8.7 million rosebuds,izzie.

66
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,550
You gotta spend some rosebuds.

67
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,940
That's what I'm saying.

68
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,260
You made me burn my french toast.

69
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,340
You can buy new french toast.

70
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,200
Hey.Uh,I was,uh--

71
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,760
- yeah,I was just,uh,just-- - the baby's doing--

72
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
good.. Yeah,she's good.

73
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,100
- Good.That's--that's good. - yeah

74
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,560
Doctors.

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,400
- Yes. - What?

76
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,830
I was wondering,the baby looks...

77
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,390
(addison and alex) good.Yeah,she's good.

78
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,070
Good.She looks good.

79
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,400
She is.She's,uh...

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,700
she's good? She'- she's out of the woods?

81
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,570
She is. She's,uh...

82
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,780
she's good.

83
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,270
She is out of the woods.Her vitals are strong.

84
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,710
Uh,she made it through the night,and she's,uh...

85
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,800
she's a fighter.

86
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,530
So I can tell my wife and my daughter?

87
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,630
You can.And you should.

88
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,690
Oh,thank you. Thank you both so much.

89
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,910
No,she's out of the woods.

90
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,690
How am I related to that man?

91
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,630
waht you  mean?

92
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,820
look at him.He's a mess.

93
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,670
Yeah?

94
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,300
I mean,he's a disaster...

95
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:50,130
He's a stammering,mumbling,clumsy disaster with whom I have absolutely nothing in common,not one thing.

96
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,120
(laughs) I hate to break this to you...

97
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,010
what?

98
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,800
Well,you know,you do your own share of stammering yourself.

99
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,400
Yeah,that nervous talking thing you do?

100
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,590
It's actually a lot like him.

101
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,140
(Thatcher) yeah,that's why I'm so happy.

102
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,760
No,it's not.

103
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,010
Plus that messy thing.

104
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,420
Oh,totally.

105
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,670
You're the messy one.

106
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:14,230
No,my apartment's messy,my locker's messy,but i am not messy.

107
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,650
(Laughs) sometimes you have,like,food and stuff in your hair.

108
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,960
Yeah,food.

109
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,310
Band-aids on your face.

110
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,620
I can still kinda see that indentation from the nose strip you were wearing last night.

111
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,220
You...

112
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,840
are in a relationship with no words.

113
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,070
And you are a millionaire in $20 shoes.

114
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,040
Whatever.

115
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,150
oh,my god...

116
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,280
she's just like him.

117
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,070
Right?

118
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,520
Dr Bailey,you paged me?

119
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,380
Yes,I did.

120
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,430
We're going to proceed with heather's surgery,as scheduled.

121
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,250
The insurance company changed their mind?

122
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,510
No. Better.

123
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,720
It seems an anonymous donor has offered to foot heather's entire bill.

124
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,300
That is incredible. You're a very lucky girl.

125
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,020
Hey,that's the first time anyone's ever said that sentence to me in my entire life.

126
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,830
I like it.

127
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,400
You spent 300 grand so you could scrub in on this surgery?

128
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,070
No.

129
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,810
No?

130
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,950
I-I spent the 3-- have you seen that girl?

131
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,400
Her life is miserable.

132
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,670
She's desperate.

133
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:40,050
She--she'll never have a date,she'll never wear high heels,she'll never feel normal.

134
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,390
I-I spent 300 grand because it-- it's a good thing.

135
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,830
I was hoping you would tell me you spent the money so you could scrub in.

136
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,350
But I--

137
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,130
you need to decide whether or not you're a surgeon.

138
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:07,770
Because this thing you did-- this is lovely and generous,and I'm not ying to take away from any of that,but...

139
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,570
you are,once again,overly involved.

140
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,960
Once again,you are personally involved,so...

141
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,400
no,I'm sorry.

142
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,060
You cannot scrub in.

143
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,260
Geoge kissed me Yesterday.

144
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,450
One minute he's holding a urine bag,the next minute,he's kissing me.

145
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,780
(Sighs) you think he's just freaking out about his dad?

146
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,350
Yeah,you're right,you're right.

147
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,680
He's probably just freaking out.I shouldn't hold him to it.

148
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,370
What?

149
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,110
Did you not just hear a word I said?

150
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,100
I'm pouring my heart out here.

151
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,510
Jeez.

152
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,530
It's all about you,isn't it?

153
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,000
It's all about a-- everything's about addison.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,960
I aborted mark's baby.

155
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,850
It is all about you.

156
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,500
Floor is all yours.

157
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,310
About eight months ago.

158
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,380
I...

159
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:36,190
peed on a stick,and I wasn't even,uh...

160
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,390
gonna tell him,but then I did...

161
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,570
tell him.

162
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,650
And,uh,he went out and he bought this...

163
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:52,840
insane yankees onesie and a calendar and marked the due date

164
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,050
,which,I should mention,was today.

165
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,660
You didn't want a baby?

166
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,940
I wanted derek.

167
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,870
I wanted to have a baby with derek.

168
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,550
I never thought I'd end up alone.

169
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,140
Hey,you have not "ended up" anywhere.

170
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,330
(Chuckles) yeah,you're right,I know.

171
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,460
It's just that,um...

172
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,650
sometimes it feels that way,you know?

173
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,770
This is one of those weeks it feels that way.

174
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,360
(Sighs) (derek) drill.

175
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,990
Another screw,please.

176
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,090
(Drill whirring) hey,how's your old man?

177
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,560
His urine output's holding steady.

178
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,040
Mostly it's steady today,which is good.

179
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,510
Have you seen burke today?

180
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,510
Even if I did like you,I still wouldn't tell you that.

181
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,750
How can you be okay with burke but not cristina?

182
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,700
Her career wasn't on the line when she lied to me.

183
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,860
Why don't you just ask burke about the hand yourself?

184
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,060
I am not talking to him.

185
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,920
He owes me.

186
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,570
What?

187
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,920
Oh,I don't know.

188
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,590
So you're together,but you don't talk to each other?

189
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,880
(Laughs) I wish I could find that in a woman.

190
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,440
Hey,how's it going with addison?

191
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,830
What?

192
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,440
Why--why--why would you...

193
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,740
what--what--what do you-- what do you mean by that?

194
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,700
Laura grey,tiny baby.

195
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,100
Laura.The baby.Right.

196
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,290
She's,uh,she's,um,doing fine.

197
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,630
She's doing well.

198
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,190
I gotta get out of gynie,though.

199
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,680
I gotta get back to sloan.

200
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,830
What are you plotting,and can I get in on it?

201
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,300
Shut up.

202
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,860
This is my surgery.

203
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,390
I should be down there.

204
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,370
(Pager beeps) (sighs) no.

205
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,730
Excuse me.

206
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,050
(Pager beeps) mr.O'malley.

207
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,870
(Izzie) 9-1-1?

208
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,440
Yeah.

209
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,650
- Sucks. - Yeah.

210
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,060
could you give me the retractor.

211
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,930
Um,dr.Shepherd,can you proceed without me?

212
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,280
Are you kidding me?

213
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,250
This is your surgery,torres,this is your find,and you want to leave?

214
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,760
I,um,I don't,but,uh,yes,I'm sorry.

215
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,700
But if it's all right,I need to leave.

216
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,080
Give me some sponges,lap sponges.

217
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:30,450
Okay,I called the family in because I need to perform a procedure,uh,on your father to help him breathe.

218
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,660
All right,so--so you're saying he can't breathe?

219
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,920
Uh,with the extensive surgery,uh,your father is not breathing on his own,

220
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,840
which is why we still have him intubated.

221
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,890
Intubated?

222
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,900
The tube in dad's mouth.It's breathing for him.

223
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,930
And right now that tube has a kink in it,which is straining his breathing.

224
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,500
How did it get a kink in it?

225
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,030
It just happens.We don't always know why.

226
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,860
But--but he's doing good today.

227
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,220
I mean,he made--he made plenty of pee,so...

228
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,680
still,we need to replace the tube.

229
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,880
So why don't you just do it?

230
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,660
I mean,what are we waiting for?

231
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:10,430
(Exhales) okay,with the damage to your father's esophagus and the e swelling in his throat from being intubated all this time--

232
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:16,850
you might not be able to get it in,the new tube?

233
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,410
Under these circumstances...

234
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,630
it can be a complicated procedure.

235
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,120
If I'm not successful...

236
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,510
I'm saying,uh,you need to prepare yourselves.

237
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,780
(Grunts) (louise) what is that?

238
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,830
It's jerry.

239
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,420
I'm sorry.I'm nervous.

240
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,850
Oh,god.

241
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,560
My god,stop it,jerry!

242
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,830
I'm nervous!

243
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,910
For god's sa,take some charcoal or something,son.

244
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,690
(All laughing) (george) that's disgusting.

245
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,150
Tyler.

246
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,730
Yeah.

247
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,210
Could you let dr.Burke know that

248
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:28,360
mr. O'malley is having some kind of medical crisis right now,and I thought he would like to know.

249
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,360
He's awake,you know?

250
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,160
Yeah,I know.

251
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,090
You want to handle this,chief?

252
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,670
Dr. Bailey,you have a lot more hands-on hours these days than I do.

253
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,120
I'll be standing by to help,but this is all yours.

254
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,180
All right,grey,let me have an 8.0 E.T.Tube.

255
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,980
Dr.Bailey...this is a patient,like any other patient.

256
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:59,470
There's no room for error,which means there's no room for nerves,so shake it off.

257
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,710
All right,let's do this.

258
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:09,970
(Monitor beeping rhythmically) (miranda) great.

259
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,450
8.  0

260
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,560
I can't,uh...

261
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,630
(monitor beeping erratically)  is it too tight?

262
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,570
I can't get past the vocal chords.

263
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,280
Damn it.

264
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,800
Pulse ox down 88.

265
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,350
Damn it.

266
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,730
86 Come on,let's go.

267
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,320
Come on,let's go.

268
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,730
Let me have a 7 1/2.

269
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,650
(Beeping continues) hurry.

270
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,690
Come on,come on,come on

271
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,630
Good.

272
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,340
(Beeping continues) let me get a-- okay,I got it.

273
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,960
(Monitor beeping rhythmically) beautil job.

274
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,580
Beautiful job.

275
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,700
Oh,can I go tell george?

276
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,830
Dr.Bailey,you all right?

277
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,490
My son...

278
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,770
is named after his son.

279
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,230
I just need a minute.

280
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,110
 There's a surgery,you know?

281
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,500
It's a minor laser thing.

282
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,390
Supposed to really help.We could look into it.

283
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,540
Sure,and while we're att,let's look at halitosis cures for you.

284
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:21,250
Not to mention stubble cures,because it's now become physically impossible for me to kiss your face.

285
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,520
I am too tired to shave!

286
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,840
Sloan!Dr.Sloan.

287
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,980
Bone dry cappuccino.

288
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,600
And I watched 'em make it this time so no mistakes.

289
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:39,920
Hey,I-I noticed you had a reconstructive rhinoplasty on the board today,and I'd--I'd really like to scrub in if at all possible.

290
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,580
You been working with addison this week?

291
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,180
Yes,sir,working.

292
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,690
Working...a lot.

293
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,770
Working hard.

294
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,000
Just...working

295
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,680
Is she miserable?

296
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,770
I'm sorry?

297
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,360
It's just...

298
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,530
I need to know if she'S...

299
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,030
at least miserable this week.

300
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,670
Did she seem...

301
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,520
is she miserable?

302
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,250
Oh,dude,she's awful.

303
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,630
She's torturing me.

304
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,390
I seriously have to get away from that woman.

305
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:20,280
I mean,she is completely and utterly,100% miserable.

306
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,530
Good.

307
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,430
So can I scrub in?

308
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,200
No.

309
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,470
(Sighs) are you sleeping?

310
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,360
I should be.

311
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,690
I haven't slept in days.

312
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,290
(Sighs) me neither.

313
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,450
I can't sleep alone anymore.

314
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,130
I used to sleep just fine,and then he...

315
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,670
(sighs) god,he gets me all strung out on him,and then he disappears?

316
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,680
He didn't disappear.

317
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,390
He's in the hospital.

318
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,400
I just want to know how he's doing.

319
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,600
You could just ask him.

320
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,400
Uh,he could just tell me.

321
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,330
(Laughs) george's dad is going into renal failure.

322
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,620
I heard.

323
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,620
My dad's here,everywhere,every day.

324
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,210
He's perfectly healthy,and I have nothing to say to him.

325
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,420
If george's dad dies...

326
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,870
I know.

327
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,250
If thatcher died,my life wouldn't be any different.

328
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,910
Is it weird that I'm a little jealous of george?

329
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,890
Yes.

330
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,880
Bailey re-intubated him,but,um...

331
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,650
he was without ox-oxygen for,I don't know,a few minutes.

332
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,170
O'malley...

333
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,930
there's no blame here.

334
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,050
Your father's body is diseased and has undergone tremendous trauma.

335
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:04,210
Now his organs are shutting down.

336
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,740
There's no blame here.

337
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,570
Do people come back from this?

338
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,000
His,uh,B.U.N.And creatinine are high.

339
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,040
I get that.

340
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:22,730
I was just wondering,in--in your experience,can people come back from this?

341
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,760
I don't have any statistics.

342
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,870
I don't have any more medicine for you.

343
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,880
(Exhales) now it's about faith.

344
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,170
We're men of science.

345
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:44,150
In my experience,science is not enough,o'malley.

346
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:49,190
But if you want me to hope with you...

347
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:56,600
if you'd like me to send up a prayer,that is a thing I'd be happy to do.

348
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,330
You have family here?

349
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,410
Yeah,a daughter.

350
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,860
She's 17.

351
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,660
(Louise) oh,I'm so sorry.

352
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,200
She had surgery on her spine.

353
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,820
And they said it went well.

354
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,960
But then she has trouble with her kidneys and...

355
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,530
well,she hasn't woken up.

356
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,010
My husband either.

357
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,820
It was a dangerous surgery.

358
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,380
They told us that.

359
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,410
My husband's,too.

360
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,820
He has...cancer,so...

361
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,290
I was surprised when they went through with it.

362
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:50,870
I thought I'd be taking him home.

363
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,550
(Izzie) excuse me,mrs.Douglas.

364
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,650
Heather is asking for you.

365
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,240
She woke up?

366
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,660
She did.

367
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,920
And she looks great.

368
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,040
(Louise) congratulations.

369
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,180
That's wonderful.

370
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:12,250
Good luck.I'll... good luck.

371
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,530
Thanks.

372
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,310
Why did you do it?

373
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,040
dr.O'malley.

374
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,690
Why did you do the surgery once you saw the cancer had spread?

375
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,630
George...

376
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:35,100
he asked you,right?

377
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,840
He asked you to do it no matter what?

378
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,290
We have to honor our patient's wishes.

379
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,280
You said you would be straight with me.

380
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,810
He--he could've lived for weeks...

381
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,230
or months.

382
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,980
We could've had months with him.

383
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,550
My mom--she could've had months with him!

384
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,080
(Richard) he wanted to fight the cancer,george.

385
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,000
- It was his choice. - He didn't know any better!

386
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,760
You knew better!

387
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,340
You shouldn't have done it.

388
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,610
You shouldn't have done it!

389
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,910
(Coughs) oh,my god.Look at you.

390
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,550
(Nasally voice) I'm miserable.

391
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,890
It's the rain...

392
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,700
the constant dampness in the air.

393
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,930
It takes the body a while to adjust.

394
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,200
I don't want to adjust.

395
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,880
Then go home.

396
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,070
If you'd had the baby,we'd be together in new york right now.

397
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:03,280
It wouldn't be raining,and even if it was,we wouldn't care because we'd be together.

398
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,780
We'd be together,and I'd have a family instead of walking pneumonia and an ex-best friend who hates me.

399
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,050
You didn't want to raise a child,mark.

400
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,590
You wanted to trump derek.

401
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,700
You wanted to win.

402
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,340
Don't make this my fault.

403
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,410
You didn't want a baby.

404
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:21,520
No,i did want a baby,mark.

405
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,260
That last woman you slept with before I left new york-- charlene,the peds nurse?

406
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,740
I--did you think that she was the only one I knew about?

407
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,270
You're rewriting history,mark.

408
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,010
We wouldn't still be together.

409
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,030
We weren't a great couple.

410
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,450
And you would've made...

411
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,990
a terrible father,mark.

412
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,590
I did want a baby.

413
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,020
I did.I just...

414
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,000
I just didn't want one with you.

415
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,150
(Woman) what?

416
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,090
Is that his lunch?

417
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,200
- I've been looking everywhere for that. - Oh,no.He can't have that.

418
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,050
What?

419
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,390
He's,uh,restricted from food.

420
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,910
- No,he's not. - No,I'm his doctor.

421
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,630
You are not.

422
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,520
I just want to know how he is.

423
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,920
And withholding food gets her that how?

424
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,400
Fine.

425
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,490
Feed him.

426
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,230
Whatever.

427
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,340
You want me to call security?

428
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,540
- Hey. - Hey.

429
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,390
Haven't seen you the last couple of days.

430
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:18,700
Yeah,I was covering the pit,and,uh,I got pulled into an emergency appy and a ruptured spleen.

431
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,540
It's been pretty chaotic.

432
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,110
Look,karev,I'm your attending.

433
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,800
I'm sorry about what happened.

434
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,890
It's been A...

435
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,550
a weird week for me.

436
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,770
so I normally...

437
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,010
anyway,I apologize.

438
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,610
The baby's,uh,bowels functioning yet?

439
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,450
Uh,yeah,actually,um...

440
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,600
she had her first diaper change today,so...

441
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,560
that's good.

442
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,710
Yeah,it is.

443
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,560
That neighbor kid,mike wilden?

444
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,710
I did hit him in the face with a stick.

445
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,460
And...when his dad came over and he was yelling and...

446
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,810
and--and you asked me if it was true...

447
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,040
I lied.

448
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:45,880
And you thought I never lied so you took my side.

449
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:55,580
And you and his dad got in that big fight,and then his kids egged our house and then ronnie and jerry went over and...

450
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,590
blew up his lawn mower.

451
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,460
Anyway...

452
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,890
I did it.

453
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,530
He was teasing me...

454
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,240
and he was bigger than me...

455
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,530
so I needed the stick to reach his face.

456
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,790
And I lied to you,dad.

457
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,720
So...

458
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,450
I'm saying I'm sorry.

459
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,140
Dad...

460
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,910
if you have any more fight in you...

461
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:49,210
if you could fight thithing just A...

462
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:54,580
just a little harder,that would be good.

463
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,970
That'd be good right now.

464
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,810
(Cck ticking) where's derek?

465
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:15,010
He slept at his place.

466
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,930
(Laughs) (sighs) do I really snore?

467
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:23,690
Well,I grew up next to a freeway,so it doesn't really bother me,but,yeah,you do.

468
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,070
(Sighs) did you get any sleep last night?

469
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,130
No.

470
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:35,610
No,I stayed up baking and cleaning the bathroom floor in case george wants to lay down on it.

471
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,240
It's weird.I have all this money.I...

472
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,260
I have all this money,and I would spend every penny of it to save george from what he's about to go through,but I...

473
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,460
can'T.

474
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,060
It's useless.

475
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,480
So I made cobbler.

476
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,700
Well,cobbler's good.

477
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,040
Yeah.

478
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,890
She told you.

479
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,380
yeah.

480
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,900
U think I'd be a terrible father?

481
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,580
Oh,I don't-- I don't-- are you...

482
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,020
okay,do you like kids?

483
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,190
I don't know.

484
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,780
Depends on how loud they are.

485
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,460
Okay.Do you like your family?

486
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,340
I mean,are you a family kind of guy?

487
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,340
I don't really have a family.

488
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,130
Derek...

489
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,870
was my family.

490
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,210
Okay.

491
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,160
Well,what about,uh,birthdays and anniversaries?

492
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,770
Do you remember those sorts of things?

493
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:03,480
No.I don't know.

494
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,040
Sometimes.

495
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,320
Isn't it the se with-- with all men?

496
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,610
No.

497
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,140
Some men just like kids.

498
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,770
To,uh,to some men,family is everything.

499
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,040
Right.

500
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,620
And you know these men?

501
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,700
I do.

502
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,990
(Laughs) I know one.

503
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:36,000
I would' made a terrible father.

504
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,170
(Louise) you're saying...

505
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,460
you're saying it's not getting better.

506
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,240
You're saying he's not gonna wake up.

507
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,770
Mrs.O'malley...

508
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:55,080
all of his organs are shutting down.

509
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:03,040
His liver and his kidneys are no longer supporting him,and he is entirely dependant upon his life support machines.

510
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,710
We're saying he's not going to wake up.

511
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:12,580
You can keep him on life support and wait for nature to take its course.

512
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,720
That could take days or weeks.

513
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,030
Or you can...

514
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,910
take him off life support.

515
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,560
Unplug him?

516
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,430
Yes,ma'am.

517
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,080
(Ronnie) georgie.

518
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,290
Yeah?

519
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:39,630
What do you think?

520
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,930
Dad's in pain.

521
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,790
His organs are shutting down.

522
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,900
He can't breathe on his own.

523
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,490
It's painful.

524
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,450
And he's on medication,but...

525
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,790
medication can only do so much.

526
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:03,110
You think...

527
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:07,970
you're saying you think it's time...

528
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:12,180
to let him go?

529
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:26,600
We can't tell you what to do here,george.

530
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:42,450
He's not dad like this.

531
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,350
And he's not gonna wake up,mom.

532
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:27,040
is there a drawer of unopened cards somewhere?

533
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,460
I'm sorry,what?

534
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,740
I just...

535
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,510
wanted to know.

536
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:37,550
I've only ever heard my mother's version of the story of why you left.

537
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:44,730
And I was just wondering if maybe you have a side that I haven't heard.

538
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,530
Your mother moved to boston,and,u.

539
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,140
I wanted to...

540
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,680
but she told me not...

541
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,670
to call or come around,and,uh...

542
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:07,920
she--she was,uh,um...

543
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,870
eventually,I remarried.

544
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:16,120
And I...

545
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,770
I'm s-'m sorry.

546
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,210
Do you snore?

547
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,110
What?

548
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,920
It appears that I snore.

549
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,530
My mother never did,so I was just...

550
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,510
forget it.

551
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:37,550
I snore.

552
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:41,250
I snore like a trucker.

553
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,790
You get that from me.

554
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:50,660
The wax earplugs work pretty good.

555
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,610
Thanks.

556
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,630
(Paper rustling) (knock on door) hey.

557
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,850
Derek.

558
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,240
I was waiting on an update on mr.O'malley.

559
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,260
I didn't want to intrude,but,uh...

560
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,480
do you have an update?

561
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,210
They're letting him go.

562
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:44,970
Haven't had any more tremors.

563
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:48,440
Not one all week.

564
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,950
How about that?

565
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:56,930
Yeah.How about that?

566
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,770
I'm both.

567
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,340
What?

568
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,090
I'm both.

569
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:15,810
I'm a surgeon,and I am a person who becomes emotionally involved.

570
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:19,960
And I will never again cross a line like I did with denny.

571
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,560
I have learned my lesson.

572
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,230
But I'm still both.

573
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,270
And I'm not gonna give up either part of me.

574
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:33,900
And I'm not gonna apologize for it.

575
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:07,860
(Sobs) there's a club-- the dead dad's club-- and you can be in it until you're in it.

576
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:14,230
You can try and understand,you can sympathize,but until you feel that loss...

577
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,890
my dad died when I was 9.

578
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,880
George...

579
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,950
I'm really sorry you had to join the club.

580
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:38,140
I...

581
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:45,660
I don't know how to exist in a world where my dad doesn'T.

582
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:53,050
Yeah,that never really changes.

583
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:17,100
Beer,joe,please.

584
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,790
George's dad?

585
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,140
Hey.

586
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,570
Hey.

587
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,410
You got a dad?

588
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,160
Not really.

589
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,960
Not anymore.
