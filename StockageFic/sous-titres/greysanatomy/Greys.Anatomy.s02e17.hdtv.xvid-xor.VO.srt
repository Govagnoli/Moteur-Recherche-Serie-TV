{2641}{2671}If you're gonna clog up|the toilet,

{3365}{3395}That'd be fun,right?
{3397}{3447}I don't care about surgeries.
{3470}{3516}You have a feeling?
{3665}{3683}Yes.
{3687}{3727}Okay,what kind of feeling?
{3745}{3779}Like I might die.
{3782}{3853}Today...tomorrow,|in 50 years?
{3856}{3886}'Cause we're all gonna|die eventually.
{3888}{3929}But now we're late.Let's go.

{4321}{4446}Okay,the man I love has a wife,|and then he chooses her over me,
{4447}{4504}and that wife takes my dog.
{4518}{4558}Okay,she didn't take the dog,|I gave it to her.
{4559}{4583}Yeah.But I didn't mean to|give it to her,
{4585}{4617}I meant to give it to him.
{4624}{4667}But that does not change the|fact that
{4670}{4766}she's got my mcdreamy|and my mcdog.
{4768}{4836}She's got my mclife.|And what have I got?
{4908}{4973}Do you know I can't remember|the last time we kissed?
{4985}{5037}'Cause you never think the|last time is the last time.
{5039}{5072}You think there'll be more.
{5091}{5142}You think you have forever,|but you don'T.
{5271}{5316}Plus,my conditioner decided|to stop working
{5318}{5361}and I think I have|brittle bones.
{5377}{5445}I just...|I just need something to happen.
{5471}{5521}I need a sign that things|are gonna change.
{5524}{5578}I need a reason to go on.|I need some hope.
{5590}{5661}And in the absence of hope,|I need to stay in bed

{12219}{12266}-You didn't leave a note.|-Yeah,well,I-
{12268}{12285}I had this thing to do.
{12287}{12354}-I--you know,I did this thing.|-And once again...
{12380}{12397}what?
{12400}{12450}We go to sleep,|I think everything is fine

{12535}{12586}I--I'm not crazy.|I had a thing.
{12615}{12636}Okay.
{12654}{12683}How's his respiratory effort?
{12685}{12726}Absent breath sounds|on the right side.
{12728}{12768}Air bubbling|at the site of the wound.
{12770}{12807}He's shocky|and getting a little cyanotic.

{13171}{13199}I'd like to say for the record
{13201}{13228}that I told her not to.
{13236}{13296}I tried to tamponade the wound|with gauze and pressure,
{13298}{13349}but the only thing that would|stop the bleeding was my hand.
{13353}{13411}Every time I try to move it,|he starts bleeding out.
{13435}{13468}Can I take my hand out now?
{13470}{13504}You don't stick your hand|inside of a patient
{13504}{13535}when you don't know|how he was injured.
{13537}{13574}You don't stick your hand inside|of a patient at all.
{13575}{13624}-Yeah,I know that now.|-Out of my room.
{13630}{13654}She gets to stay?
{13656}{13707}She has her hand stuck|inside of my patient.
{13821}{13882}-Nice. Thanks.|-Well,don't get happy.
{13885}{13917}You have your finger|on a major bleeder,
{13919}{13964}and mr. Carlson|is running out of time.
{13967}{14002}The only thing that you have won
{14004}{14055}is an all-expense-paid trip|to the O.R.
{14066}{14115}Dr. Grey,prepare to transport|him to the O.R.
{14117}{14160}And let's make this happen|quickly,people.

{14206}{14283}I want you to make that woman|stop screaming
{14284}{14313}and tell us what happened.
{14315}{14373}-I-I can't go into the O.R.?|-No,you have "a thing" to do.
{14440}{14460}What was that about?
{14462}{14491}If I had know you were|gonna get the good case,
{14493}{14526}I woulda let you stay in bed.
{14565}{14610}She's been going at least 15,|20 minutes.
{14612}{14645}This must be,like,|some kind of record.
{14647}{14695}Look at her.She's not even|turning red.

{15178}{15232}ma'am.Ma'am.
{15282}{15364}Mrs. Carlson...|are you injured?
{15390}{15444}I need you to try and calm down.
{15450}{15519}Mrs. Carlson?|Can you hear me?
{15532}{15564}Can you hear me?
{15759}{15792}Good. Okay.
{15795}{15863}Now can you tell me exactly|what happened to your husband?

{16632}{16671}O'malley,stop looking.
{16794}{16823}Pretty amazing,right?
{16834}{16868}The miracle of life.

{17840}{17900}6 centimeters dilated,|50% effaced,

{18103}{18145}Are you all right?|Can I get you anything?

{18201}{18233}is working his way|out of my body.
{18235}{18261}Can you give me something|for that?
{18263}{18291}Can you give me a new vagina?
{18295}{18336}-Uh,well--|-I didn't think so.
{18339}{18390}Look,everybody,|I appreciate the concern,

{18734}{18762}I don't wanna see|any of you again
{18765}{18805}until after the baby is born,
{18807}{18850}which,if he does|like I told him to
{18852}{18915}and stays on schedule,should be|in about four and a half hours.
{18951}{18989}I mean it.

{20594}{20625}What's bailey's husband's name?
{20627}{20648}Watch the wall.

{20883}{20932}And I gotta tell you,|this whole "insides are
{20935}{21008}bloody and squishy" thing is|so not good for my gag reflex.
{21024}{21083}But I'm good.|Is this okay?
{21086}{21125}Me being in here likeke this?
{21129}{21202}Once dr. Burke scrubs in,|he'll have you remove your hand.
{21205}{21270}And then you can go,|and we'll fix mr. Carlson.
{21273}{21327}Good.'Cause I know|how much medicine I know,

{24320}{24350}I mean,the shock part.
{24372}{24442}it was shocking.|I'm shocked.
{24445}{24482}You tell my husband|when I get my hands on him,
{24486}{24537}he's a dead man.|Do you hear me?
{24540}{24577}Scaring me like this.

{24799}{24829}Oh,he's bleeding|all over the place.
{24831}{24852}That's how he's doing.
{24854}{24910}The girl in the ambulance|put her hand inside of him!
{24912}{24938}That's how he's doing!
{24940}{24967}What are you yelling at me for?
{24968}{24987}Because!
{24989}{25074}Because you and james are like|idiots,playing like 8 year olds.
{25075}{25085}-Excuse me,um--|-we don't play
{25087}{25128}-Look,we reenact.|-You play.
{25130}{25164}You put on your costumes,
{25166}{25221}and you build your stupid|toys and you play.
{25222}{25282}-No,we reenact.|-Nobody reenacts world war ii,
{25285}{25335}-you moron!|-Again,exactly what happened?

{25362}{25437}What happened is my husband|and his moron best friend--
{25438}{25464}could you stop calling me a mor?
{25466}{25575}Moron best friend decided to|build some kind of big gun.
{25578}{25626}Yeah,an exact replica|of the finest
{25628}{25719}allied antitank weapon of|world war ii,the m981 bazooka.
{25720}{25774}So they put on their|stupid costumes,
{25777}{25815}and they go out into|the backyard,
{25817}{25853}and they try to shoot the thing.
{25855}{25902}I'm the gunner.|James is the loader,okay?
{25904}{25942}We followed the specifications|exactly.
{25943}{25985}You should see it.|It's a 60-millimeter,
{25986}{26041}1 1/2-pound rocket--|I mean,it's a beauty.
{26042}{26076}It didn't work,
{26079}{26151}so like an idiot,my husband|has to go and stand
{26153}{26211}in front of his big gun|to see what went wrong.
{26215}{26278}That's when the stupid toy|starts working.
{26281}{26338}-Stop calling it a toy.|-It's taking up half my garage.
{26340}{26378}I'll call it whatever I want!
{26380}{26456}Hold on.|He shot himself with a bazooka?
{26460}{26476}Yeah.
{26499}{26547}He shot himself with a bazooka?
{26549}{26613}Like I said,morons,|the pair of 'em.
{26615}{26646}-Was there an explosion?|-Huh?
{26648}{26710}-Was there an explosion?|-No,why?
{26739}{26763}Oh,crap

{27095}{27122}Hey,slow down.

{29145}{29173}unhook me.
{29332}{29379}Karev,if you interrupt me|in my O.R.,
{29381}{29425}-It better be for a good damn reason.|-Was it through and through?
{29427}{29446}What?
{29448}{29496}The wound on james carlson,|was it through and through?
{29498}{29554}No,it was just an entry.|No exit. Why?
{29610}{29664}he's cute.He single?
{30141}{30204}-hannah.|-Yes,dr. Burke.

{30953}{31017}-Yeah.Yeah,definitely.|-Oh,my god.
{31019}{31109}-Dr. Milton.|-What? What's wrong?
{31111}{31154}hannah,I don't want you to move--
{31159}{31253}not your hand,not your body,|not an inch.
{31258}{31333}Okay. You should know you're|starting to scare me.
{31335}{31403}Don't be scared.Everything's|going to be fine.
{31405}{31447}Dr. Grey,can you...
{31676}{31724}I want you to walk out|of this room--
{31739}{31789}walk,do not run--
{31795}{31895}go and tell the charge nurse|that whave a code black.
{31951}{32012}-I'm sorry,"code black"?|-Code black.
{32014}{32068}Tell him that I am sure,
{32071}{32157}and then tell him to call|the bomb squad.
{32289}{32317}god,can you imagine?
{32319}{32356}What'd she stick her hand|in there for anyway?
{32358}{32396}She was trying to save his life.
{32398}{32438}And now she might die|because of it.
{32491}{32526}What do we do now?
{32535}{32583}I go back in and wait for|the bomb squad.
{32586}{32611}You leave.
{32617}{32664}You all leave.
{32725}{32766}Mere,you comin'?
{32816}{32848}It's your funeral.
{32888}{32921}You need a surgical team.
{32923}{32966}All I need is dr. Milton|to keep him under.
{32968}{33001}I can do the rest myself.
{33225}{33302}fine.But you wait|by the elevator.
{33304}{33349}I don't want anyone in here|that doesn't need to be
{33351}{33377}in this O.R.
{33379}{33441}When the bomb squad arrives,|we'll take it from there.
{33443}{33496}Until then,milton and i are|doing this alone.
{33498}{33537}Now,go.
{33720}{33770}Okay,okay,okay.
{33873}{33904}eight minutes apart.
{33927}{33988}There is no shame|in an epidural,miranda.
{33991}{34064}Epidural increases the|possibility of a c-section.
{34066}{34136}It also decreases in.Mirand|this is a big baby,
{34139}{34174}it is your first baby,|and I am telling you,
{34176}{34228}it is not gonna a short|or an easy labor.
{34230}{34284}I can handle a little pain.|No problem.
{34292}{34372}Women all over the world|do this at home...
{34376}{34425}With nothing more than|a pair of scissors
{34427}{34459}and a bucket of hot water.
{34462}{34510}Well,women all over the world|also die giving birth at home
{34512}{34541}every single day.
{34642}{34682}I did not just say--
{34684}{34728}you're supposed to be making|yourself useful
{34729}{34770}and finding my husband.
{34774}{34824}-Well,I-I--|-he's not... here.
{34868}{34914}Oh,now he should be|here by now.
{34917}{34948}okay,we're gonna go find him,
{34950}{35003}-right,dr. O'malley?|-Right.
{35086}{35111}what?
{35149}{35223}Uh,nothing.I'll--|I'll be right back.
{35384}{35419}yang,could you check that?
{35472}{35539}-how's he doing?|-Ah,it' s touch and go.
{35544}{35584}I've located the clot.
{35586}{35628}I'm just trying to find the|source of the bleeding.
{35639}{35669}Go and find addison,
{35672}{35719}and tell her he's in worse|shape than I thought.
{35802}{35874}-What'd they want?|-They want us to evacuate.
{35876}{35912}Evacuate?Did they say why?
{35915}{35967}Uh,no,but your pager said,|"code black."
{36001}{36055}-You're sure they said that?|-Yes.
{36113}{36141}It could be a drill.
{36157}{36199}Even if it's not a drill,|I can't evacuate.
{36201}{36245}I've got an open brain|on the table.
{36287}{36332}I'm not leaving bailey's|husband on the table
{36335}{36372}with his skull flap open,
{36376}{36422}so if anybody wants to go,|they should go.
{36429}{36468}Anybody want to evacuate?
{36471}{36548}Going once,going twice,|three times.
{36636}{36672}You're sure they said,|"code black"?
{36673}{36694}Yes.
{36762}{36824}I don't like having to|lie to dr.Bailey.
{36832}{36903}-She would want--|-now is not the time,|dr. O'malley.
{36908}{36947}She'd want to know about|her husband.
{37037}{37066}"code black"?|What's a code black.
{37067}{37112}wait,wait,hold it.
{37116}{37154}Dr. Shepherd,|the other dr. Shepherd
{37156}{37186}wanted me to let you know|that tucker's bleed
{37188}{37231}is more extensive than|he originally thought.
{37234}{37287}It's gonna be a few more hours|before he has anything concrete
{37288}{37333}-to tell dr. Bailey.|-Thanks,stevens.
{37374}{37423}-What's a code black?|-A what?
{37478}{37515}"code black"?
{37524}{37593}Code red,code blue,code white-|I've never had a code black.
{37595}{37626}Dr. Shepherd?
{37639}{37682}Just--just go back to|your locker room
{37683}{37731}and wait for your resident|to give you instructions.
{37742}{37781}-We don't have a resident.|-What's going on?
{37784}{37812}Is it something bad?
{38004}{38043}yeah,it's something bad.
{38243}{38281}so...
{38299}{38405}so I'm touching live...|unexploded ammunition?
{38431}{38464}I'm afraid so.
{38516}{38567}not the greatest feeling|in the world.
{38609}{38633}No.
{38663}{38691}I guess not.
{38751}{38805}And he's still out?
{38814}{38837}yeah.
{38845}{38893}But he's not hooked up to|the machine anymore?
{38895}{38952}I had dr. Milton take him off|the ventilator.
{38954}{39001}The flow of oxygen|posed a danger.
{39020}{39114}The ambu bag is...breathing|for him now.
{39148}{39181}But he can't hear me?
{39193}{39215}No.
{39500}{39529}Hannah.
{39586}{39656}what if I just take my hand|out really quickly?
{39665}{39742}We'd have to ask the bomb squad|that when they arrive,
{39744}{39831}but I'm guessing that would cause|the ammo to shift and explode.
{39919}{39939}Oh.
{40223}{40291}-Hannah.|-Yeah.
{40311}{40405}Your hand is keeping mr. Carlson|from bleeding out.
{40430}{40506}You are keeping him alive.
{40574}{40651}Right.An--and the bomb squad|is coming?
{40654}{40698}The bomb squad is coming.
{40728}{40751}Okay.
{40812}{40835}Okay.
{40984}{41051}we are having pre-op patients|transported to mercy west.
{41053}{41119}all trauma rerouted to|seattle presbyterian.
{41121}{41202}there is no danger to the north,|south and west wings of this hospital
{41203}{41246}just the east surgical wing.
{41249}{41316}that said,anyone who wants to|leave can leave.
{41319}{41378}one stays unless they volunteer|to stay.
{41380}{41400}understood?
{41403}{41429}okay.
{41458}{41515}richard,it's a code black,|a real one?
{41517}{41550}yes,i've shut down the o. r. 's.
{41552}{41584}-to trauma?|-to everything.
{41587}{41625}wait a minute,to "everything"|everything?
{41628}{41702}as of ten minutes ago,all the|operating rooms at seattle grace
{41704}{41775}were completely evacuated,with|the exception fo dr.burke's team.

{42275}{42303}dr. burke has them in there.
{42305}{42342}and the rest of this floor|has been evacuated?
{42343}{42363}it has,yes.
{42365}{42424}all right,you stay here.|nobody moves unless i say so.
{42497}{42529}we've got people over here!
{42566}{42599}i thought you said the floor|had been evacucuated.
{42601}{42643}i thought it had. i'm not|in charge of anything.
{42644}{42673}-cristina!\-seriously,back up.

{43513}{43541}gotta eat something.
{43614}{43674}you knew meredith and cristina|would be on the floor with the bomb.
{43684}{43703}yeah.
{43707}{43730}is it wrong that we're jealous?
{43732}{43754}it's all right that we're|jealous,right?
{43755}{43779}the fact that we're jealous
{43781}{43861}because they might blow up and die|is not a reflection on our character.
{43870}{43928}-it's about feeling useless.|-ineffectual.
{43945}{44001}we couldn't even get meredith|out of bed this morning.
{44003}{44042}we had to call in cristina.
{44053}{44101}how embarrassing is that?
{44105}{44145}you know what i think,george?
{44156}{44236}i think meredith|and cristina are doers.
{44220}{44322}-They do.They're doers.|-They do,and we--
{44350}{44384}we watch.
{44450}{44479}We're watchers.
{44547}{44590}check mrs.Carlson's levels.
{44597}{44640}If they are stable,|she can come up here.
{44645}{44658}All right!
{44677}{44704}-Excuse me. -Oh,no problem
{44707}{44751}We have to become more|proactive,george.
{44774}{44806}We have to become doers.
{44862}{44897}fight for what we want.
{44921}{44959}-We have to do.|-Yeah.
{44995}{45023}Oh,you mean...
{45046}{45092}we are starting right now.|Okay.
{45192}{45207}Alex.
{45229}{45292}How crazy is this?|Dude,it's like the apocalypse.
{45294}{45324}-Alex.|-It's true.
{45326}{45348}I mean,look around you--
{45350}{45387}half the people who are|supposed to be saving lives
{45389}{45425}have fled the building|to save themselves,
{45427}{45488}bailey's husband almost died|coming to see his kid get born,
{45491}{45540}the annoying twins are down|on the O.R. Floor with a guy
{45543}{45584}who literally might explode|in their faces.
{45586}{45619}It's a morgue waiting|to happen in here.
{45621}{45664}I'm just saying,people should|get while the getting's good
{45666}{45695}because there might not|be a tomorrow.
{45696}{45734}-Alex!|-What?
{45915}{45983}-Take off your pants.|-Izzie,what are you doing?
{45997}{46045}I'm being a doer.|Getting while the getting's good.
{46047}{46072}Now take off your pants.
{46074}{46108}You do realize that when|I said "the apocalypse,"
{46110}{46146}I meant it metaphorically,|not literally?
{46158}{46177}Alex...
{46211}{46278}I haven't had sex|in 8 months and 12 days.
{46281}{46332}I'm horny,I'm half-naked,|and I'm saying yes.
{46333}{46363}You want to stand there|and talk metaphors
{46364}{46422}or do you want to literally|take off your pants?
{46627}{46684}dr.Shepherd,|there's an explosive device
{46687}{46738}in the O.R. Next door.|I need you to evacuate now.
{46740}{46793}Yeah,and I've got a guy whose|brain is exposed on this table.
{46795}{46839}I'm not gonna walk away|and leave him to die.
{46893}{46912}The rest of you can go.
{46939}{46957}You should go.
{46988}{47003}Suction.
{47423}{47499}You close him up.You do|whatever you have to do.
{47505}{47558}The chief of surgery has|authorized me to tell you
{47560}{47592}you cannot stay here.
{47594}{47633}The chief of surgery|doesn't scare me.
{47641}{47681}Dr. Bailey scares me.
{47688}{47736}I'm not gonna be the one|to tell her her husband died,
{47740}{47799}and that's what would happen|if we put his skull flap on
{47802}{47872}in this condition,|bomb or no bomb.
{47875}{47907}Now get out of my O.R.
{47975}{47997}Suction.
{48245}{48288}I'm trying to get gravity|to do me a favor.
{48291}{48328}I'm 9 centimeters dilated.
{48331}{48382}I need that last centimeter.
{48403}{48429}Good.|That's,uh...
{48461}{48479}that's good.
{48597}{48619}Dr.Shepherd.
{48718}{48825}Where exactly is my husband?
{48997}{49044}He's with my husband.
{49227}{49273}there's no telling|how dangerous it is.
{49309}{49338}We need more info.
{49402}{49423}The longer we wait,
{49426}{49473}the greater the chance|he'll bleed out and die.
{49690}{49774}-Pink mist.|-Excuse me?
{49887}{49952}That's what the bomb squad|calls you when you blow up.
{49979}{50046}Pink mist.|I read that somewhere.
{50105}{50142}The bomb goes off and...
{50171}{50248}anyone in range explodes|into a billion pieces.
{50270}{50326}You're liquid.|here's nothing left.
{50362}{50460}Just flecks of human|flesh and blood.
{50536}{50567}Pink mist.
{50623}{50674}Sometimes they don't|even find a finger.
{50711}{50746}One minute you're a|person...
{50785}{50838}the next,you're...
{50859}{50889}bloody rain.
{51124}{51189}-Here,take this.|-What?
{51203}{51218}Go ahead.
{51260}{51371}Now I want you to squeeze|it in even beats,okay?
{51372}{51426}No,not too fast.|Not too fast.
{51461}{51484}There you go.
{51760}{51783}Dr.Milton?
{52000}{52026}I've got kids.
{52124}{52193}Even beats.|Okay?
{52290}{52312}That's it.
{52706}{52743}what-- what about my husband?
{52770}{52848}How long can he staylike that,|with live ammo inside him?
{52857}{52885}I honestly don't know.
{52888}{52938}But you're gonna try to|save him,right?
{52940}{52965}We're gonna try.
{52969}{53019}First,the bomb squad has|to determine the best way
{53021}{53057}to retrieve the device.
{53061}{53104}I'm sorry,mindy.|I'm so sorry.
{53106}{53176}Shut up!We've got three kids,
{53179}{53232}and you've got him|building bazookas.
{53350}{53368}Oh,god.
{53425}{53469}he's gonna die.
{53490}{53550}Uh,paul,why don't you go with|the officer there
{53552}{53614}and answer his questions about|the device you guys built?
{53617}{53643}Oh,anything.Anything to help.
{53646}{53730}Uh,karev,why don't we get|mrs.Carlson a cup of coffee?
{53771}{53820}I-I guess I should look on|the bright side.
{53844}{53893}It's not like this|can get any worse.
{53932}{53990}I mean... this is it.
{53993}{54043}This is as bad as it gets.
{54071}{54089}Right?
{54277}{54333}Dr.Bailey...|um,I was...
{54339}{54367}dr.Bailey, what are you--
{54369}{54415}-get someone to find me my suitcase.|-I need my suitcase.
{54418}{54443}I'm goin' home.
{54454}{54492}Dr.Bailey, you're having a baby.
{54495}{54550}There's not going to be|any baby born today.
{54553}{54593}You hear me?|I'm holding it in.
{54597}{54632}I'll have him tomorrow.
{54635}{54676}Just not now.|Not like this.
{54682}{54746}No!|Just...
{54775}{54795}no.
{54818}{54842}I'm goin' home.
{54845}{54884}I'm goin' home right now.
{54998}{55025}I can't.
{55085}{55132}I can't do this without|my husband.
{55191}{55248}I can't do this all alone.
{55396}{55426}Okay,okay.
{55536}{55573}so how are they gonna|remove that ammo
{55574}{55647}without killing|hannah and james?
{55727}{55745}Cristina.
{55771}{55833}The bomb squad guy said you're|supposed to stay away from there.
{55835}{55875}Is it me or is hannah shaking?
{55950}{55977}Is she squeezing that|ambu bag by herself?
{55980}{56010}Where is dr.Milton?
{56201}{56218}Hannah.
{56264}{56311}Where is the anesthesiologist?
{56320}{56345}He,um...
{56378}{56401}he left.
{56431}{56462}He didn't want to die.
{56570}{56589}Hannah.
{56674}{56712}I think I'm gonna take|my hand out now.
{56794}{56832}When the hell are people|gonna learn?
{56862}{56913}it may not be as bad|as it seems.
{56931}{56981}Her hand is holding|that device steady.
{57003}{57070}Or maybe her hand is simply|in there with the ammo.
{57072}{57097}We can't know.
{57114}{57150}Yeah,well,my guy's talked|to the friend.
{57153}{57171}That device is homemade,
{57173}{57228}which means it's unstable|and very unreliable.
{57243}{57281}It could be a dud,|but we have no way of knowing.
{57283}{57329}Add to that the fact|that you've got a surgeon
{57331}{57365}in the O.R. Next door|refusing to leave
{57368}{57426}and a nervous paramedic's hand|inside the body cavity--
{57428}{57494}it's definitely|as bad as it seems.
{57511}{57545}That's what I'm saying.
{57554}{57621}hey,somebody! Help!|We need help in here.
{57650}{57711}I think I'm just gonna|take it out now,okay?
{57713}{57756}You made it almost to the finish|line.You can do this.
{57758}{57821}No,no,I just want to take it out|and be done with it.
{57823}{57876}hannah,it won't be much longer.
{57880}{57925}Remember,you're keeping him|from bleeding out.
{57926}{57981}No!I am 22 years old.
{57984}{58050}I should not even be in here.|This is some kind of mistake.
{58052}{58087}She's panicking.|We need to clear the room.
{58089}{58113}I'm not leaving.
{58114}{58157}-Grey,let's move.|-I'm not leaving her.
{58159}{58198}You need to get everyone|out now,dr.Burke.
{58199}{58244}She's my intern.|I am responsible for her.
{58246}{58295}No,it's gotta come out.|It has to come out.
{58296}{58346}-Yang,go with dylan.|-You go with dylan.
{58349}{58392}-Hannah,look at me.|-No,it's gotta come out.
{58394}{58426}-Hannah.|-No,no.
{58446}{58490}Hannah,look at me.|You can do this.
{58494}{58537}Hannah, you need to calm down.
{58539}{58587}You need to relax,hannah.|Everything's gonna be fine.
{58589}{58616}-No! -Hannah.
{58617}{58686}you can do this.|You can do this,hannah.
{58688}{58713}No,it has to come out.
{58716}{58778}No,you keep it there just|a little while longer.
{58779}{58782}I have to take it out!|I have to! I have to!
{58783}{58819}-Hannah. -I have to!
{58821}{58846}If you leave,|it'll break.
{59490}{59513}Meredith.
{59578}{59613}What did I do?
{59619}{59652}oh,god,meredith.
{59736}{59766}Just stay right|where you are.
{59789}{59835}Nobody move.|Stay exactly where you are.
{60080}{60126}What did I do?|What did I do?
{60128}{60153}What did I do?|What did I do?
{60155}{60188}What did I do?|What did I do?
