1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,649
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,614
I want Seattle Grace
to open a free clinic.

3
00:00:03,615 --> 00:00:04,965
- Why?
- I need

4
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:06,437
something to hold on to.

5
00:00:06,438 --> 00:00:08,350
- You still need funding.
- I have $8-million.

6
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:10,086
The Deny Duquette memorial clinic.

7
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:13,848
- What's all this about?
- They all want to be chief.

8
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,690
She's in a nursing home. Alzheimer's.

9
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:16,754
I gave up everything for him.

10
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:18,034
I should never have had a kid.

11
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:19,672
Marry me, Cristina Yang.

12
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:20,507
Marry me.

13
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:27,157
<i>As surgeons, we live in
a world of worst-case scenarios.</i>

14
00:00:27,883 --> 00:00:30,480
<i>We cut ourselves off
from hoping for the best</i>

15
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:34,020
<i>because too many times,
the best doesn't happen.</i>

16
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,441
<i>But every now and then,</i>

17
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,957
<i>something extraordinary occurs...</i>

18
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:04,722
<i>And suddenly...</i>

19
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:08,265
<i>best-case scenarios seem possible</i>

20
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:10,315
8 days, $8-million...

21
00:01:10,316 --> 00:01:12,925
And we're open for business.

22
00:01:13,092 --> 00:01:17,151
<i>And every now and then,
something amazing happens...</i>

23
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,284
She woke up this morning
completely aware.

24
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:22,156
She's her old self. It happens.

25
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:25,136
Medically, we don't know why.
It's just a random gift.

26
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,623
- So she's lucid? She remembers?
- Pretty much everything,

27
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:29,271
except the last five years,
and of course,

28
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:31,055
she doesn't realize,
she has Alzheimer's.

29
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:32,984
We thought she should hear it from you.

30
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:34,831
So she'll know me?

31
00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:37,264
I'm gonna walk in there,
and she'll know who I am?

32
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:38,494
She's been asking for you.

33
00:01:39,615 --> 00:01:42,021
<i>And against our better judgment...</i>

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,470
<i>we start to have hope.</i>

35
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:47,231
Hey, chief. I need a signature.

36
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,698
I'd like to use the helicopter
to transport a patient from Denver.

37
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:52,098
Good morning, chief. I found
a way to fund a stereotactic robot.

38
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:53,629
I want to make sure you're
on board before I move forward.

39
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,157
It's a little early in the morning
for you two to be chasing me down.

40
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,841
I'm going to be doing a bloodless

41
00:01:57,842 --> 00:01:59,727
pulmonary valve translocation
on this patient.

42
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:01,914
This machine is an excellent
source of revenue for...

43
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:03,119
Aren't you gonna get in there?

44
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,155
You want to be chief,
you gotta fight with the big boys.

45
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:06,891
Oh, I intend to fight like a girl.

46
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,882
I'll let them kill each other, and then,
I'll be the only one left standing.

47
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:12,074
And then there's me.

48
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:15,340
There you go, underestimating me again.

49
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:18,423
It's not that I underestimate you.
It's just that I don't think about you..

50
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:19,700
at all.

51
00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:22,348
Well, you should.

52
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:27,237
I was, uh, heading down to the clinic.

53
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,137
It's opening today, and I...

54
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:32,020
thought it might be nice to show
Dr. Bailey a little support.

55
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:33,387
Very thoughtful, Dr. Sloan.

56
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:35,577
I think I'll join you.

57
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:37,286
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me.

58
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:38,242
Certainly.

59
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:40,449
Nicely done.

60
00:02:42,024 --> 00:02:43,951
Meredith, what is going on?

61
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:46,925
- When did you get back from Europe?
- I went to Europe for two months,

62
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:48,654
- but that was--
- I've been sitting here

63
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:50,076
thinking about the fight we had.

64
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:52,345
The things I said.
I-I said some terrible things.

65
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:54,089
- It's fine.
- No, it's not.

66
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:55,961
After you left, I-I was upset.

67
00:02:57,307 --> 00:03:00,136
Did I-- Did I have a breakdown?
I must have had a nervous breakdown.

68
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:01,797
I'm in a-- Is this a hospital?

69
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,398
Because I can't remember anything
for the past two months, Meredith.

70
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,188
The last thing I remember,
is the fight we had.

71
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:09,881
And listen, if you don't want
to go to medical school, that is fine.

72
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:12,549
- It is your life. Just take me home.
- I went to medical school.

73
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,701
I-I want to go home, Meredith.
I-I need to go home.

74
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:17,359
You are home.

75
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:20,848
I went to Europe five years ago.

76
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:22,720
You got sick.

77
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:24,797
You have Alzheimer's.

78
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:27,342
This is your home.

79
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:29,803
You live here now.

80
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:34,852
No.

81
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:36,246
No!

82
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:38,792
- Mom...
- No.

83
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,165
Mom? Mom?

84
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:45,857
Mom! Somebody call 911.

85
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,935
- She had substernal chest pain--
- Chest pain and syncope.

86
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:56,836
My pulse was in the 200s,
But the rate has resolved on its own.

87
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:58,853
She's completely lucid.

88
00:03:58,989 --> 00:03:59,878
She's what?

89
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:02,395
She's aware. She's herself again.

90
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:03,830
Oh, my god. Is this...

91
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:05,538
Are we at Seattle Grace?

92
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,575
Yes, mom. This is where
I'm doing my residency.

93
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:09,559
Your daughter is
one of our finest interns,

94
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,938
following in your very big footsteps.

95
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,521
Do you know Richard Webber?
Is he still a doctor here?

96
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:15,805
What, the chief?

97
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:19,061
Richard Webber is the chief, of surgery?

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,947
Okay, welcome to
the Denny Duquette memorial clinic.

99
00:04:22,948 --> 00:04:25,079
Barring any surgical emergencies,

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,514
you will be working here today.

101
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,305
Working on what?

102
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,877
Right now, Olivia

103
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:34,389
will be familiarizing you with
the protocol for the flu vaccine.

104
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:37,173
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't-- Don't-- Don't touch that.

105
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,223
That was $79.

106
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:43,576
Oh, my god. I have got
to get out of here.

107
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:46,248
Burke has a bloodless
pulmonary valve translocation

108
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:48,819
flying in from denver tomorrow.
I should be preparing.

109
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,787
You don't get to scrub in
on the valve translocation.

110
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:52,413
- How do you know?
- Because I am.

111
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:54,738
- He picked you?
- You guys ready?

112
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:55,790
Where is everybody?

113
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:57,909
Uh, Grey will be late.

114
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,868
- O'Malley should be back from vacation.
- No, no, no, the patients--

115
00:05:01,246 --> 00:05:04,321
The underserved, uninsured population
that we're supposed to be helping.

116
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:06,850
The underserved uninsured will come.

117
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:08,777
You'll see. Just watch the door.

118
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:10,618
- They will come through it.
- I can't wait,

119
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:12,170
for the first patient.
It's gonna be amazing.

120
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:14,438
It's gonna be amazing
what Denny's money can do, right?

121
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:18,016
Just watch the doors, Stevens.

122
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,302
Dr. Bailey,

123
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:32,940
congratulations on the opening
of the clinic.

124
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:34,662
It is open, isn't it?

125
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:41,130
- Is Stevens all right?
- She's watching the door, sir.

126
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,494
Okay, then.

127
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:50,181
Someone's coming.

128
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:52,628
Damn it!

129
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,623
O'Malley, welcome back.
You're late.

130
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:01,804
Is O'Malley all right?

131
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,221
We got married in Vegas!

132
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:11,497
We're married!

133
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:15,639
Dude,

134
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,634
she-- She's Callie O'Malley.

135
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:31,012
It's-- It's fast.

136
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:34,170
You know, it seems really very fast.

137
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,247
Are-- Are you even happy?

138
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:37,535
We're incredibly happy.

139
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:39,038
Oh, yay. Well, great.

140
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:39,940
Yay.

141
00:06:40,516 --> 00:06:41,500
Show her the ring.

142
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,409
That's so great.

143
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,601
Tiny diamonds are great because you know
no one will every try to steal it.

144
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:55,637
Okay, that's it.
Yang, Burke needs you in cardio.

145
00:06:55,638 --> 00:06:58,548
O'Malley, the chief has
a surgical patient coming into the pit.

146
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:01,268
Stevens, Karev,
go find me some patients.

147
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,320
I don't care where you get them,
just get them.

148
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:05,672
Congratulations.

149
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,888
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

150
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:10,518
Okay, we've been out of our Vegas
hotel room bubble for six hours,

151
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,984
- and I don't like it.
- It's gonna be fine. We're married.

152
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:15,804
We're married.

153
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:18,388
All right.

154
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:22,037
So, chief,

155
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:23,622
we're a couple of married men.

156
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:27,515
Uh, Adele and I are getting a divorce.

157
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:32,046
Um... I didn't-- I didn't know.

158
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,106
That's life, O'Malley.

159
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:36,115
That's life.

160
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:38,891
Now this patient--

161
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:42,144
I removed a large tumor from her colon,
eight months ago.

162
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:44,686
Since then, she's been undergoing
chemo and radiation.

163
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:47,642
- We thought she had it beat.
- Excuse me.

164
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,685
Are you the doctors for Marina Wagner?

165
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:51,683
Yes. You brought her in?

166
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,316
I woke up this morning,
she was barely breathing.

167
00:07:53,317 --> 00:07:54,683
You think this could be
food poisoning?

168
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:56,699
'Cause we had sushi yesterday,
but I-I feel fine.

169
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,613
Could be complications
from the radiation.

170
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,143
- What do you mean, radiation?
- From her cancer treatment.

171
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:02,217
She doesn't have cancer.

172
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,226
I'm her boyfriend. I'd know.

173
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:08,070
O'Malley, get a C.B.C.,

174
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,364
a chem19 and a triple
contrast abdominal C.T.

175
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,819
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

176
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:17,508
Wait. Is she all right?

177
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:18,945
- She's--
- Richard Webber.

178
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:20,913
My god, you've aged.

179
00:08:21,698 --> 00:08:23,653
- Ellis...
- I was having arrhythmias.

180
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,096
They wanted to do tests, and...

181
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,556
I hear you're
the chief of surgery now.

182
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,636
That's wonderful.

183
00:08:30,128 --> 00:08:30,972
Yes, I'm...

184
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,619
but I'm stepping down soon.

185
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:34,671
Stepping down?

186
00:08:35,256 --> 00:08:37,156
Well, I can only assume
that was Adele's idea.

187
00:08:39,865 --> 00:08:40,698
Meredith.

188
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:42,872
I'll be right there, mom. Go ahead.

189
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:49,079
She's lucid.

190
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,182
She woke up this morning
with her memory back.

191
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:53,863
They say it's temporary.

192
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,866
My god.

193
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:59,538
Well, obviously, don't--
Don't worry about work today.

194
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,049
You need to be with her.

195
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:02,722
I mean, this time...

196
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:05,636
It's a gift.

197
00:09:06,675 --> 00:09:07,495
It's a gift.

198
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:09,170
Right.

199
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,215
Meredith's mother
had some runs of S.V.T.

200
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:19,514
I'm ordering an echo.

201
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:21,605
And she's lucid.

202
00:09:21,974 --> 00:09:23,546
- What?
- It happens, but...

203
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:25,612
- it won't last.
- I-Is Meredith okay?

204
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:28,501
She seems fine, but her mother's going
to need the best care we have to offer.

205
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:29,828
And you, Dr. Yang,

206
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:31,393
are the best.

207
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:37,475
You're still not wearing the ring.

208
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,279
I would like an answer.
It's been over a week.

209
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,352
I told you,

210
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:41,697
it's under advisement.

211
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:43,440
Well, do you not like the ring?

212
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:44,807
It's a ring.

213
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,691
It's 3-Carat, diamond-cut platinum...

214
00:09:47,692 --> 00:09:49,612
- It's-- It's the ring.
- Then what?

215
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:56,627
Are you using the surgery tomorrow to
pressure me into giving you an answer?

216
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,049
Is that why I'm not scrubbing in?

217
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:00,071
I need to give the other interns
a chance.

218
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:00,919
Why?

219
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,561
The echo, please,

220
00:10:02,753 --> 00:10:03,600
Dr. Yang.

221
00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:10,970
- Hey.
- Hi.

222
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:13,143
You been waiting long?

223
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:14,510
Almost an hour.

224
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:17,489
- Are you my doctor?
- I can be.

225
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:19,951
We have a clinic right outside
those doors. No wait.

226
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,923
What's wrong with you?

227
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:24,455
It hurts when I pee.

228
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:26,788
We can help with that.

229
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:28,429
Yeah, that's easy. It's nothing.

230
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,540
We can have you out of here
in less than an hour.

231
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,368
Are you hitting on me?

232
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:35,716
We need patients.

233
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:38,053
You need doctors.
And we just happen to be surgeons.

234
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:39,816
You think I need surgery?

235
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:41,279
You never know.

236
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:42,557
It's free.

237
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,851
A free clinic.

238
00:10:44,138 --> 00:10:45,805
My co-pay is only 10 bucks.

239
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:46,734
That's lunch.

240
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,487
Sounds like T.B.

241
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:54,763
Yeah. Very contagious.

242
00:11:02,774 --> 00:11:04,264
You and Meredith are good friends.

243
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:07,544
I can tell...

244
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,359
because you're afraid
to look at me...

245
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:13,534
As if I might ask you
some personal question

246
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,772
about her, and you'll accidentally slip.

247
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,384
But you don't do anything
accidentally, do you?

248
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,908
Has Meredith chosen a specialty?

249
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:29,535
That's a personal question.

250
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:31,970
For a surgeon, it's the most
personal question you can ask.

251
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:33,048
It tells you who they are.

252
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:36,014
My mother would want to know
whether I had a boyfriend.

253
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,176
Your mother sounds like
a frivolous woman.

254
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,763
If I chose cardiothoracics,
what would that say about me?

255
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:46,653
Heart surgeons are the know-it-alls.

256
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:48,470
They're the most ambitious,
the most driven.

257
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:49,993
They want it all,
and they want it now.

258
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:52,123
And they don't want anything
getting in their way.

259
00:11:55,487 --> 00:11:58,726
Meredith says I'm part of
an Alzheimer's research study.

260
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:02,772
I want a neuro consult with the doctor
who put me in the trial.

261
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,382
Hey, Mer.

262
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:07,558
I've been looking for you.

263
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,540
Burke has me on your mom.
Are you okay?

264
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,808
I'm avoiding her.
I'm avoiding the gift.

265
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:14,118
Yeah, well, uh, your gift
wants to meet Derek.

266
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,515
What? What did you say?

267
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:18,617
No, no, no. Not Derek, your boyfriend.
Dr. Shepherd, the neurosurgeon.

268
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:21,387
But she's gonna know that he's your
boyfriend anyway. She has ways.

269
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:22,684
I'm kind of in love with her,
by the way.

270
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:24,899
She has that affect on people
who aren't her daughter.

271
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:28,528
Hey, I heard about your mother.
That's unbelievable.

272
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:30,347
- Yeah, it's a gift.
- She's avoiding her.

273
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:32,660
Mer, she's your mother,
and she's really here.

274
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:34,143
This is your chance.
You should talk to her.

275
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:35,468
You should spend some time with her.

276
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:38,104
She has a very long history
of being disappointed in me.

277
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:39,019
You're a doctor now.

278
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,192
Parental disappointment
ends with a medical degree.

279
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:42,460
Can we get movin' ?

280
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:43,731
It hurts when I pee.

281
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:46,519
Are you stealing patients
from the E.R. ?

282
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,023
Yes, but only because
I have to know

283
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:50,944
that I did not spend
my entire inheritance

284
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:52,502
on an empty room
with empty beds.

285
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,350
Because if I did that,
I might go crazy,

286
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:55,908
And George called dibs
on all the crazy this week.

287
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,193
Do you think Callie's pregnant?

288
00:12:57,203 --> 00:12:59,416
- I'm going back to the E.R.
- Okay, just keep your pants on.

289
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:01,576
- We're going. We're going.
- What-- What-- What's going on?

290
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:03,531
Oh, yeah.
Bambi got married.

291
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:08,687
I'm sorry. One second.

292
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:11,134
Everything okay?

293
00:13:11,304 --> 00:13:13,162
- Are you off today?
- You got married?

294
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:14,988
Yeah,

295
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:16,494
I did.

296
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:18,476
It was a--
I know it was impulsive.

297
00:13:18,477 --> 00:13:21,038
Well, was it "good" impulsive,
or was it "Meredith" impulsive?

298
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,046
Because if it was Meredith impulsive,
Maybe I can help get you out of it.

299
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:25,006
No, but...

300
00:13:25,365 --> 00:13:27,320
No, it was a-- It's a good thing.

301
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:29,780
- Good.
- It's good. Um, but, uh...

302
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,863
- But thanks for the backup.
- You're welcome.

303
00:13:33,204 --> 00:13:34,790
Congratulations, George.

304
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:37,031
Thank you.

305
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:42,856
Are you planning on coming
to talk to me anytime soon?

306
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:01,995
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

307
00:14:02,969 --> 00:14:06,345
Uh, you know those cartoons
where there's a bear or whatever,

308
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,389
and it's starving,
and it looks at a table,

309
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,067
and the table turns into
this delicious cooked turkey,

310
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:13,746
with, like, lines of deliciousness
coming off it?

311
00:14:13,747 --> 00:14:16,622
I was not looking at him like that,

312
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:20,265
because he is the help, and I am not
going to be sleeping with the help.

313
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:21,937
I married the help.

314
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,603
- What?
- We went to vegas.

315
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:25,546
My idea.

316
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,432
- I embrace the trashy.
- That's...

317
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:32,116
Not that I'm not happy for you,
but why married so... fast?

318
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:34,713
You know those cartoons
where there's a bear and it's starving,

319
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,216
and it looks at a cute intern?

320
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:38,022
Well...

321
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:40,728
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

322
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:44,883
Oh, it's small.

323
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:47,270
- I know, it's small.
- It's beautiful.

324
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:48,234
You think so?

325
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:49,204
Yes.

326
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:50,680
Yes.

327
00:14:50,912 --> 00:14:52,539
So tell me about yourself.

328
00:14:55,716 --> 00:14:56,537
Well...

329
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:01,402
What's your life like?

330
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:05,929
I... really do want
to know you, Meredith.

331
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:08,897
Well, I have a boyfriend.

332
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:10,652
Does he understand
the demands of your career?

333
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:12,724
Because not all men do.
They say they do upfront

334
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:13,763
- but they--
- He's great.

335
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:15,735
He's a doctor, too, so he gets it.

336
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:16,540
Good.

337
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,731
- He's actually--
- Have you chosen a specialty?

338
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:20,607
No, it's still early.

339
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:22,616
Cristina's already
chosen cardiothoracics.

340
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:25,172
Yeah. Well, I guess I'm...

341
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,659
just waiting to be inspired.

342
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:30,614
I'm happy now. You know,
I feel like I know who I am.

343
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:32,959
Plus, I think when you have someone
in your life that you love--

344
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,817
You really love--
I think that's...

345
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:36,906
I don't know. I just...

346
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,362
I'm really happy.

347
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,582
What happened to you?

348
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:45,567
- What do you mean?
- You're happy?

349
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:46,647
You're happy now?

350
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:49,274
The Meredith I knew
was a force of nature,

351
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:51,132
passionate, focused, a fighter.

352
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,017
What happened to you?
You've gone soft.

353
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,437
Stammering about a boyfriend and--

354
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:55,897
And saying that you're waiting
to be inspired?

355
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:58,042
You're waiting for inspiration?
Are you kidding me?

356
00:15:58,043 --> 00:15:59,746
I have a disease for which
there is no cure.

357
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:01,345
I think that would be
inspiration enough.

358
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:03,094
- Mom--
- Listen to me, Meredith,

359
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:07,320
Anyone can fall in love
and be blindly happy,

360
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:10,573
but not everyone can pick up
a scalpel and save a life.

361
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:13,965
I raised you to be
an extraordinary human being.

362
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:16,848
So imagine my disappointment
when I wake up after five years

363
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:19,528
And discover that you're
no more than ordinary.

364
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,232
What happened to you?!

365
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,084
Yeah, we live in the same building.

366
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,041
So I'd see her in
the laundry room and, uh...

367
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:33,919
She's really sexy
when she folds clothes.

368
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,720
Once we started dating,
it was just like, boom, you know?

369
00:16:35,723 --> 00:16:37,265
We got really serious really fast.

370
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:38,588
Now I'm just kinda like--

371
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:40,679
I don't even know her middle name.

372
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:43,764
I'm trying to fill out these forms,
and I'm stumped on the first question.

373
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,367
Rose.

374
00:16:47,187 --> 00:16:48,239
That's her middle name.

375
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:50,002
Rose.

376
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:58,409
She's charming, she's fabulous,
and then suddenly, she's the enemy.

377
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,658
- I'm meeting the enemy?
- Just don't get personal.

378
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:03,180
- You're being ridiculous.
- I am not being ridiculous.

379
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:06,242
- Okay. It's gonna be fine.
- Just be careful. She has ways.

380
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:10,847
- Hey, George. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

381
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:13,540
You seem kinda shaky
and sweaty and...

382
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:14,568
pale.

383
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,564
Is it the marriage?
Are you totally regretting it?

384
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:19,557
No, the marriage is fine.
Do you mind, uh, taking that to, uh,

385
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:22,024
sorry, taking the blood
work to the, uh...

386
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:23,801
- lab for me?
- Sure.

387
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:24,869
Thanks.

388
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:26,257
I think I need to sit down.

389
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,238
George, if you need to talk...

390
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:29,861
Thanks.

391
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:33,285
Hey. Are you okay?

392
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,102
- You're sweating.
- Yeah, I'm good.

393
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:36,442
What's your,
what's your middle name?

394
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:37,644
It's bad. I don't tell anyone.

395
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:40,515
Come on. We're married, and
I don't even know your middle name.

396
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:45,711
Okay, I knew it.
It's your weird and judgy friends.

397
00:17:45,712 --> 00:17:47,481
- You let them get to you.
- No, it's...

398
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:49,870
I don't... I don't know...

399
00:17:50,107 --> 00:17:51,344
your middle name. God, I can--

400
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:52,916
I can-- I can barely breathe.

401
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:54,637
You know what? You didn't know
my middle name last week,

402
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,565
And you could breathe just fine.

403
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:57,703
What?

404
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,450
What about a functional M.R.I.
now, while I'm lucid?

405
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:04,523
An M.R.I.'s not gonna
show us anything new.

406
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:07,827
No test is gonna help us
understand what's going on.

407
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:11,209
So in five years,
you've made no advances,

408
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,230
and there is nothing else
you can do for me.

409
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:15,890
I don't know how you do it,

410
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:19,042
day in and day out, workith people
with this awful disease.

411
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:21,414
Oh, I-- Well, see...

412
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:24,257
Actually, I'm not
an Alzheimer's specialist.

413
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,168
I just took a special interest
in this case.

414
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:29,891
Because of Meredith.

415
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:33,193
You're what happened to her.

416
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:34,733
- I'm sorry?
- I thought you were here for me,

417
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:35,858
to offer me some hope,

418
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:37,977
to tell me about some new treatment,
but you're here for her.

419
00:18:37,978 --> 00:18:39,228
- Dr. Grey--
- An attending?

420
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:41,245
A neurosurgeon?
No wonder she's so unfocused.

421
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,926
- I don't think you understand.
- I understand.

422
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:45,165
I understand perfectly.
I've seen men like you before,

423
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,744
threatened by a woman who's their equal.
You just want someone to admire you.

424
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:52,294
And you don't care about the damage
you do to her along the way.

425
00:18:55,044 --> 00:18:56,178
I need to lay down.

426
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:58,447
Whoa. No, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey.

427
00:18:58,448 --> 00:19:02,233
Buster, do you know how much it costs
to have these linens laundered?

428
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:05,103
I'm sick. I'm shaky and sweaty
and my mouth is dry,

429
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,039
and my body aches.

430
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:08,256
Fine.

431
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:11,126
Uh, Karev, replace O'Malley in the O.R.

432
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:12,232
Yes.

433
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,941
So this is Marina Wagner,

434
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:17,197
- your colon cancer patient?
- Karev, where the hell's O'Malley?

435
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,342
- Curled up in a ball in the clinic.
- Is he okay?

436
00:19:19,343 --> 00:19:20,585
Well, he's married.

437
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:21,543
Right.

438
00:19:22,215 --> 00:19:24,128
Okay, Boki, 10-Blade.

439
00:19:30,008 --> 00:19:34,532
Stolen, and non emergent E.R. cases
and sick hospital staff--

440
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,473
This is what $8-million buys you.

441
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,565
Dr. Stevens, I swear on my life,

442
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:40,696
If I hear you say "$8-million"
on more time--

443
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:42,146
It's not about the money. It's...

444
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:46,574
It's Denny. It's his legacy. It's--

445
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:49,796
I was looking for meaning.
This was supposed to be meaningful.

446
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:52,611
- It will be meaningful.
- $8-million worth?

447
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:56,345
Uh, excuse me.
Are-- Are you, uh...

448
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:58,696
Can I-- Are-- Are you the doctors?

449
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,267
- Yes, we are.
- Are you a patient?

450
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,608
Like an actual
free-clinic patient?

451
00:20:02,778 --> 00:20:04,712
Not me. My-- My daughter.

452
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,919
- Oh, is your daughter sick?
- I'm not sick.

453
00:20:06,954 --> 00:20:08,238
Can we please go?

454
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:13,528
Kelley finds suddenly
she has a need for these products.

455
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:15,052
And, uh, and...

456
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:18,485
we were hoping you might show her
how to use them.

457
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,339
George,

458
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:29,431
you're married. You should be happy.

459
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:31,734
- You don't look happy.
- I'm sick, Olivia.

460
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:33,442
All right, you could--

461
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:36,727
Uh, you should go home, O'Malley.
Clearly whatever you have is contagious.

462
00:20:38,565 --> 00:20:41,094
- Aren't you from the lab?
- Yeah, I feel like crap.

463
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:43,458
Is that the lady you gave,
uh, Marina's blood to?

464
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:46,630
- Uh, yeah.
- And you all feel shaky and nauseous?

465
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:47,806
It's awful.

466
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,853
She's toxic.

467
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:51,673
Callie? Yeah.

468
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:54,329
- A lot of us feel that way.
- No, the patient's blood is toxic.

469
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,560
It's making us sick.

470
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:58,423
Has the chief started, uh,
Marina's operation?

471
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,868
They were wheeling her up
as I came down.

472
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,823
What's the extension for O.R. one?

473
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:15,298
The patient's blood
is apparently highly toxic.

474
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,447
Any contact is dangerous.

475
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:18,818
Nobody goes in there until we figure out
what the hell is going on.

476
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,727
How's he doing?

477
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:22,535
He's tachypneic,
but his B.P. is starting to stabilize.

478
00:21:22,536 --> 00:21:23,807
He's doing better on oxygen.

479
00:21:23,808 --> 00:21:25,322
It's a good thing
he got out of there when he did.

480
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:26,578
- Dr. Shepherd.
- What is it?

481
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:28,949
- Can you sign this?
- I just heard. How can I help?

482
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,118
You're off duty.
You should be with your mother.

483
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,535
I don't want to spend time
with my mother.

484
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:32,920
The chief is down. Alex is down.

485
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:34,593
- I would like to help.
- Dr. Grey...

486
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,377
You want to help?
Talk to your resident.

487
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,169
What do you got?

488
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,288
They found an herbal supplement
in her purse.

489
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:44,858
The lab guys think it combined
with the chemo chemicals

490
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:46,880
and turned her blood
to some kind of neurotoxin.

491
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:48,124
We're lucky,
they're not all dead.

492
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,047
The only reason she's alive
is because she's intubated.

493
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:51,611
Who got them out of there?
O'Malley.

494
00:21:53,673 --> 00:21:54,999
- George.
- Callie,

495
00:21:55,163 --> 00:21:57,418
she was toxic.
Her blood was toxic,

496
00:21:57,694 --> 00:21:58,692
not our marriage.

497
00:21:58,815 --> 00:22:00,359
You thought our marriage
was toxic?

498
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:03,940
Okay, all our people are being treated.
Now what do we do about her?

499
00:22:09,781 --> 00:22:10,587
Dr. Grey,

500
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:15,138
your holter monitor shows you're having
multiple runs of tachycardia every hour,

501
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:17,269
so Dr. Burke would like
to do a radioablation.

502
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,484
Why would he recommend surgery,

503
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:20,413
when medication
can keep it under control?

504
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:26,683
Because Alzheimer's patients
aren't always compliant with their meds.

505
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:29,705
And apparently, Meredith says...

506
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:32,507
you are particularly difficult.

507
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,297
I could elect not to treat it at all.

508
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:41,038
Your stress test shows
coronary artery disease.

509
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,906
That coupled with the tachyarrhythmias

510
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:45,097
could cause too much stress
on your heart, which would...

511
00:22:45,838 --> 00:22:46,781
eventually...

512
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:53,490
What would you do,

513
00:22:54,557 --> 00:22:57,386
if the thing that defines who you are

514
00:22:58,957 --> 00:22:59,914
was taken away?

515
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:06,959
Tell Dr. Burke...

516
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,250
I don't want the surgery.

517
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:16,064
I'm s-- I'm very sorry, Dr. Grey,
but technically, that...

518
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:18,114
decision isn't yours.

519
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,645
It's Meredith's.

520
00:23:21,926 --> 00:23:23,942
This is a maxi pad--
Heavy flow day.

521
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:25,760
Mini pad--
Pretty self-explanatory--

522
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:28,015
Just peel the label and stick it.

523
00:23:28,227 --> 00:23:30,209
And the tampon
we've already gone over. So...

524
00:23:30,612 --> 00:23:31,856
are we clear on everything?

525
00:23:34,817 --> 00:23:35,623
Kelley...

526
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:38,179
I understand that
you're a little mortified

527
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,546
that your dad dragged you in here,

528
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:42,566
But can you just talk
or nod or something?

529
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:43,940
I get it, okay?

530
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,430
How's it going
with our very first patient?

531
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:47,510
Kelley's a woman.

532
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:50,848
Can I just go to the gallery and learn
something, if that's okay with you?

533
00:23:56,528 --> 00:23:58,714
Uh, Mr. Hanson, if you could
go to the front desk

534
00:23:58,715 --> 00:24:00,847
and fill out some paperwork,
I can get you outta here.

535
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:04,196
Of course, of course.
Uh... thank you.

536
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,760
Since my wife died, I...

537
00:24:07,608 --> 00:24:09,617
I've been in the woods
a little with Kelley.

538
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,133
- Okay.
- Yeah.

539
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,948
Are you okay, Kelley? Any cramps?
'Cause a heating pad--

540
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:19,716
Could I be pregnant
if I had sex last week?

541
00:24:19,717 --> 00:24:22,081
Like, before the period thing started?
'Cause I did,

542
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:23,803
and it would really suck,
if I was pregnant

543
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:27,063
'cause now the guy's being a real jerk,
and he's totally ignoring me at school.

544
00:24:27,493 --> 00:24:29,181
So I really hope I can't be pregnant.

545
00:24:29,461 --> 00:24:30,418
I can't, right?

546
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,403
Any way you could, like, answer me
before my dad gets back?

547
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:40,342
I'm not sure refusing treatment
is what you want to do.

548
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:42,392
Apparently what I want doesn't matter.

549
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,018
It isn't even legally binding.

550
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,794
So it's really about what you want,
Meredith. You're in charge.

551
00:24:47,795 --> 00:24:50,281
You think I like making
these decisions for you?

552
00:24:50,516 --> 00:24:52,922
Do you think it's fun to get
calls from the nursing home

553
00:24:52,923 --> 00:24:55,218
asking whether I was planning
on giving the nurse

554
00:24:55,272 --> 00:24:57,678
who changes you every morning,
a christmas tip?

555
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:02,423
But I do it, because you have managed
to alienate everybody else in your life.

556
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,774
And I am the only one,

557
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:07,138
so I have to step up and do it.

558
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,489
You want to know
why I'm so unfocused,

559
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:14,024
so ordinary?

560
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:17,080
You want to know
what happened to me?

561
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:19,022
You. You happened to me.

562
00:25:19,023 --> 00:25:20,607
Then let me refuse the heart surgery.

563
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:21,550
- No.
- Why not?

564
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,108
Because killing my mother,

565
00:25:23,685 --> 00:25:26,378
is not gonna be another thing
that happens to me.

566
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,531
These suits are airtight.

567
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,478
Yeah, these packs recirculate
the air trapped inside.

568
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:37,469
These batteries
haven't been charging long.

569
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,560
I'm guessing you got about 30 minutes
before they die and,

570
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:40,517
you have to come out.

571
00:25:40,632 --> 00:25:43,147
My god. The anesthesia's wearing off.
She's waking up.

572
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:45,970
30 minutes starting now.

573
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:47,241
She's fighting intubation.

574
00:25:47,242 --> 00:25:49,273
We go inside before
these seals are secure,

575
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:51,308
we wouldn't last five minutes,
and she will die.

576
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:52,684
These guys are two minutes out.

577
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,631
- She doesn't have two minutes.
- Addison!

578
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:05,524
- Get the hell outta there!
- She's awake, Mark.

579
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:07,178
She's awake and open on the table.

580
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:09,802
I need to know her weight
so I can dose her with the propofol.

581
00:26:09,994 --> 00:26:12,140
She looks about 60 kilos.

582
00:26:13,249 --> 00:26:14,137
It's okay.

583
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:15,778
You're okay.

584
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:18,771
It's okay. Got it.

585
00:26:24,856 --> 00:26:26,681
I got you. I got you. Be careful.

586
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,193
Looks like S.V.T.

587
00:26:39,944 --> 00:26:41,912
Push 10 of adenosine
and page Dr. Burke.

588
00:26:41,913 --> 00:26:43,061
He's already gone into surgery.

589
00:26:43,062 --> 00:26:44,359
I'll get the adenosine.

590
00:26:45,962 --> 00:26:48,285
Carotid massage. Carotid massage.

591
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:51,463
Carotid massage can reboot
he heart and stop the S.V.T.

592
00:26:51,524 --> 00:26:52,891
Okay, okay, hold on.

593
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,160
Hold on, please. Hold on, please.

594
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:03,227
Hold on. Hold on.

595
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:06,076
Okay.

596
00:27:06,746 --> 00:27:08,359
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

597
00:27:23,552 --> 00:27:24,345
You're good.

598
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,313
Sharp under pressure.

599
00:27:27,304 --> 00:27:29,040
You'll make an extraordinary surgeon.

600
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,735
Dr. Grey, I need to ask you...

601
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:43,577
Will it get in my way?

602
00:27:45,012 --> 00:27:46,161
Can I have both?

603
00:27:46,614 --> 00:27:48,692
Can I be a great surgeon
and have a life?

604
00:27:48,693 --> 00:27:51,234
Because there is this man
who just asked me to marry him,

605
00:27:51,235 --> 00:27:52,682
and I know you tried to have both,

606
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,691
but you split up
with Meredith's dad and...

607
00:27:55,856 --> 00:27:59,000
- I know it is none of my business.
- It is none of your business.

608
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:08,027
And I didn't try hard enough.

609
00:28:11,444 --> 00:28:12,250
Thank you.

610
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:24,915
Are you feeling better?

611
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:28,991
Oh, I will be once
my patient's off the table.

612
00:28:29,483 --> 00:28:30,276
Look at these two--

613
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,899
A heart surgeon and a neurosurgeon

614
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,663
performing a bowel resection.

615
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:36,620
You think the world stops
when you stop,

616
00:28:37,536 --> 00:28:38,794
but it keeps on going.

617
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:45,248
People perform your surgeries
better than you could.

618
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:47,448
The next generation comes up and,

619
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:50,195
you're scared you'll be forgotten.

620
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,343
Your mother stopped for five years,

621
00:28:56,143 --> 00:28:57,229
and you became someone.

622
00:28:58,746 --> 00:29:00,195
According to her, I didn't.

623
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,887
According to her, I'm a disappointment.

624
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:07,300
Well, in a perfect world, she'd be able
to tell you she was proud of you.

625
00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:08,858
But it's not a perfect world,

626
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:12,726
and your mother's not a perfect woman.

627
00:29:18,003 --> 00:29:21,118
I think the person she'd most like
to see right now is you.

628
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,360
The only thing your mother
wants to hear from me

629
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:30,369
is that I regret staying with Adele.

630
00:29:31,005 --> 00:29:32,932
That's the only gift I could give her.

631
00:29:34,616 --> 00:29:35,736
And I can't tell her that.

632
00:29:37,978 --> 00:29:38,866
That's not true.

633
00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:56,021
They won't fit.

634
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,746
Stop right there.

635
00:30:00,306 --> 00:30:02,302
The bowel swelled.
You won't have any room.

636
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,603
How much time do you have?

637
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:04,711
Eight minutes.

638
00:30:05,982 --> 00:30:06,802
Okay,

639
00:30:07,178 --> 00:30:08,059
now listen to me

640
00:30:08,394 --> 00:30:09,836
and do everything I say.

641
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:12,682
Kelley, your pregnancy test is negative,

642
00:30:12,683 --> 00:30:14,615
And you're clean for S.T.D's.

643
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:15,627
- Oh, thank god.
- Great.

644
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:17,714
Thanks, I'm also grounded
for the rest of my life.

645
00:30:17,988 --> 00:30:18,985
Kelley, be polite.

646
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,106
I'm sorry, sir,

647
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:22,675
but polite doesn't seem
to be getting you two very far.

648
00:30:25,248 --> 00:30:26,040
Kelley,

649
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:28,842
your dad told me you lost
your mother a few years ago,

650
00:30:29,006 --> 00:30:31,753
and I want to say how sorry I am.

651
00:30:31,754 --> 00:30:33,872
You probably have a million questions,

652
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:35,761
and if your mother were here,

653
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,748
I'm sure she would have
more eloquent answers than I do.

654
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:42,271
But I think that she and I would
actually be saying the same thing,

655
00:30:42,316 --> 00:30:46,704
which is, if you keep going,
the way you're going,

656
00:30:46,936 --> 00:30:49,054
you will get an S.T.D.,

657
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:51,159
you will get pregnant,

658
00:30:51,203 --> 00:30:55,126
you will increase your chances
of getting cervical cancer.

659
00:30:57,053 --> 00:30:58,368
You're not being smart.

660
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:02,687
And you're too young for anyone
to expect you to be smart

661
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:06,104
the way you need to be
when you're having sex,

662
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,485
which means you shouldn't be having it.

663
00:31:11,587 --> 00:31:13,132
I thought he liked me.

664
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:17,181
Oh, honey, I know you did.

665
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:20,679
I know you did.

666
00:31:34,787 --> 00:31:36,154
Okay, you're gonna live.

667
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:37,657
Callie, wait.

668
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,076
I was a little bit heroic in there.

669
00:31:41,361 --> 00:31:43,097
- I thought you'd be proud of me.
- Proud?

670
00:31:43,098 --> 00:31:45,379
You were poisoned,
and you thought it was about me.

671
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,785
- It felt like an anxiety attack--
- About me.

672
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:51,769
You see, we-- We were fine when we were
in our Vegas bubble, when it was just...

673
00:31:51,946 --> 00:31:54,119
room service and pay cable
and us, it was bliss,

674
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,949
but then you get around your weird
and judgy friends for one day,

675
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,883
and suddenly you're racked
with uncertainty,

676
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:00,700
Toxic-gas-level uncertainty.

677
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:03,251
I guess it was too much to hope
you'd just stand up for me.

678
00:32:03,252 --> 00:32:05,343
- Cal--
- And my middle name is Iphegenia.

679
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:07,222
Okay?

680
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:10,028
I can't wait to hear what
your pals have to say about that.

681
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:26,201
So that was pretty cool,
what you just did--

682
00:32:26,202 --> 00:32:27,650
Going in and putting her back under.

683
00:32:27,651 --> 00:32:29,508
Cool or stupid...

684
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:31,230
take your pick.

685
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,447
Okay. All right. I gotta...

686
00:32:41,366 --> 00:32:42,200
go.

687
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,594
What's going on?

688
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:51,712
The chief figured out
the anesthesiologist

689
00:32:51,713 --> 00:32:53,544
didn't have time to drop an N.G. Tube.

690
00:32:53,545 --> 00:32:55,881
So now they have to place one
and decompress

691
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:57,938
and repack her intestines and close.

692
00:32:57,939 --> 00:32:59,948
And they're about to run out of air.

693
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:01,909
Holy crap.

694
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:04,358
This so beats tampon training.

695
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:08,144
Preston, you'll need to milk the bowel
to get out the excess fluid.

696
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:11,288
Pack her and wrap her
and get her stable for transport.

697
00:33:11,468 --> 00:33:13,473
- How's George?
- Medically he's fine.

698
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:15,507
Emotionally?
He's a little stunted if you ask me.

699
00:33:15,508 --> 00:33:17,898
You don't marry
the rebound girl. Am I right?

700
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,422
You don't marry anyone on a whim.

701
00:33:19,423 --> 00:33:20,871
Well, he needs our support.

702
00:33:20,872 --> 00:33:23,591
He doesn't need us.
He's got his Vegas show-wife.

703
00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:27,134
Chief, they're at 32 minutes.
You gotta pull 'em out.

704
00:33:27,968 --> 00:33:28,979
How you doin' on air?

705
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:35,769
- I'm out.
- You go.

706
00:33:36,904 --> 00:33:38,339
- I'll wrap it.
- Alone?

707
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,059
No, you can't.

708
00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:44,970
Burke?

709
00:33:45,517 --> 00:33:47,854
Burke? Burke! Burke.

710
00:33:49,522 --> 00:33:50,345
Burke.

711
00:34:01,862 --> 00:34:02,928
That's not good.

712
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,192
Okay, damage control.

713
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:12,074
We still have to pack her and wrap her
so that she's stable for transport.

714
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:14,069
We work in shifts--
One doctor at a time,

715
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,106
no one stays in
for more than 20 seconds.

716
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:17,885
Dr. Sloan, do you want to go first?

717
00:34:17,913 --> 00:34:19,047
I'm not going in there.

718
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:20,660
What?

719
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:23,797
It would be irresponsible
for the remaing healthy attending

720
00:34:23,798 --> 00:34:26,121
to expose himself to the neurotoxin.

721
00:34:26,178 --> 00:34:29,553
A neurotoxin whose long-term
effects we're still unaware of.

722
00:34:29,554 --> 00:34:30,661
So I'm staying in here.

723
00:34:34,757 --> 00:34:37,108
I can swim 3 lengths
of my parents' pool underwater.

724
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:40,224
You're up, Dr. Yang.
Let's get her a mask.

725
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:44,283
Sloan, give her the lap pads.

726
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:46,935
You're gonna wet them
and pack the cavity.

727
00:34:51,302 --> 00:34:53,270
If you feel faint, get out.

728
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,497
Come on, Yang. Hurry.

729
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:04,126
I-- Oh, I-- I've packed the wound.

730
00:35:04,127 --> 00:35:05,001
Dr. Stevens.

731
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,996
I couldn't get--
I couldn't wrap it.

732
00:35:06,997 --> 00:35:09,661
Remove the drape and secure
the plastic along her sides.

733
00:35:09,662 --> 00:35:11,042
It's gotta be tight.

734
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:19,955
Hurry.

735
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:22,924
Come on, Stevens.

736
00:35:23,444 --> 00:35:24,319
Come on.

737
00:35:31,648 --> 00:35:34,573
I couldn't, um... I didn't---
it-- It got-- It twisted.

738
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:37,566
Okay, the seal needs to be
as close to vacuum-tight as possible.

739
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:40,101
It'll inflate, and then
you'll know it's secure.

740
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:48,198
Come on, Grey.

741
00:35:49,373 --> 00:35:50,221
Come on.

742
00:36:02,822 --> 00:36:03,970
Is she still toxic?

743
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,763
She's on C.R.T.

744
00:36:05,818 --> 00:36:08,620
It's type of dialysis remove
the toxin from the blood.

745
00:36:09,372 --> 00:36:11,209
You should be able to go in,
in a few hours.

746
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:27,434
You woke up.

747
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:28,910
You're gonna be okay.

748
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,434
I was hoping you'd never have
to know about any of this.

749
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,168
I thought all the bad stuff
in my life was over when I met you.

750
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,877
It is...

751
00:36:40,551 --> 00:36:41,535
Marina Rose.

752
00:36:43,658 --> 00:36:44,765
That's my name.

753
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:48,374
Heroic work, all of you.

754
00:36:49,235 --> 00:36:50,041
Heroic.

755
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:52,042
Dr. Sloan, let's check
on our patient now.

756
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,893
How come we do all the work
and he gets all the glory?

757
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:01,810
Because he's Mark.

758
00:37:09,703 --> 00:37:10,892
I'm sorry I left.

759
00:37:11,308 --> 00:37:12,532
I-- It was...

760
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:17,575
I got to do damage control
on the toxic woman.

761
00:37:18,053 --> 00:37:18,969
Good for you.

762
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,153
Did you ever get any patients?

763
00:37:22,727 --> 00:37:23,786
Just that one.

764
00:37:24,551 --> 00:37:25,358
One.

765
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:30,185
$8-Million worth of one.

766
00:37:32,673 --> 00:37:33,834
Lock up for me.

767
00:37:47,108 --> 00:37:49,022
I heard you're having surgery tomorrow.

768
00:37:50,881 --> 00:37:51,687
Do you...

769
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,678
Do I know who Meredith is?

770
00:37:56,925 --> 00:37:58,947
Do I at least recognize Meredith?

771
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:00,915
You know she's someone important,

772
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:04,007
someone who loves you.

773
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,661
You'll look out for her?

774
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:10,488
Because she's got so much more to learn,
and I won't be able to teach her.

775
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,581
I'll look out for her.

776
00:38:13,221 --> 00:38:14,397
I wish I could go back.

777
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:18,554
I'd do everything so differently.

778
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,126
I'd fight harder for you.

779
00:38:21,192 --> 00:38:24,363
I think if--
If I'd fought harder for you, maybe...

780
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:36,913
We would've had
a wonderful life together, Ellis.

781
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:39,050
- You think so?
- I do.

782
00:38:40,212 --> 00:38:42,153
We would've done our fellowship here,

783
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:45,829
and then you would've fought me
for chief, and probably won.

784
00:38:47,387 --> 00:38:48,221
And...

785
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:50,299
I wouldn't have mind

786
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:52,851
because we'd have the kids at home.

787
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,464
We have kids?

788
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:58,129
Meredith would've need
a brother and sister.

789
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:02,188
Kids need family.

790
00:39:02,395 --> 00:39:03,625
We would've been a family.

791
00:39:03,626 --> 00:39:05,833
Probably bought
that big house on parker.

792
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:07,131
The one with the barn?

793
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:10,079
Yeah, that's a good place for a family.

794
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,790
And I would've been happy,

795
00:39:14,316 --> 00:39:16,175
just like Meredith says she's happy.

796
00:39:18,201 --> 00:39:19,185
And that would've...

797
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:22,117
changed everything.

798
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:24,720
Maybe...

799
00:39:26,438 --> 00:39:28,742
I would be fine,
and we could grow old together.

800
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:33,689
And life would be so perfectly ordinary.

801
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:38,593
Yes.

802
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:48,300
My life is so unfinished.

803
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:51,853
It's unfinished, and I'm not finished.

804
00:39:51,854 --> 00:39:52,461
No.

805
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:54,457
No, Ellis.

806
00:39:56,797 --> 00:39:57,576
Don't think that.

807
00:39:58,451 --> 00:39:59,995
Just close your eyes,

808
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:02,975
and think of the family,

809
00:40:04,464 --> 00:40:05,654
of the house...

810
00:40:06,808 --> 00:40:09,097
And you there every night
to come home to.

811
00:40:12,234 --> 00:40:13,177
And me there.

812
00:40:16,556 --> 00:40:17,465
I'm there.

813
00:40:25,102 --> 00:40:28,041
I am super scrubbed.
I'm minus my epidermis.

814
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:30,214
I still feel all fumey.

815
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:34,136
Hey. It's the little woman.

816
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:36,135
So what are your plans now?

817
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:37,871
You're not moving in, are you?

818
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:41,188
Nice.

819
00:40:43,552 --> 00:40:44,775
- Wait, Callie.
- Forget it.

820
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:45,800
- Just--
- No.

821
00:40:46,784 --> 00:40:47,864
Unbelievable.

822
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:51,098
You people-- You're supposed
to be my friends-- My closest friends.

823
00:40:52,254 --> 00:40:54,987
Callie's a big-- She's the most
important part of my life now.

824
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:58,352
If you want to drive her away--
And you're masters at it-- You'll do it,

825
00:40:58,502 --> 00:40:59,869
but if she's gone, I'm gone.

826
00:41:00,484 --> 00:41:01,646
She's my wife.

827
00:41:02,452 --> 00:41:04,762
Calliope Iphegenia Torres is my wife.

828
00:41:08,953 --> 00:41:10,251
- Ipheg--
- Don't you dare.

829
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:11,208
Okay.

830
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:17,606
<i>As doctors, we're trained to give
our patients just the facts.</i>

831
00:41:17,688 --> 00:41:19,957
<i>But what our patients
really want to know is...</i>

832
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:22,294
<i>Will the pain ever go away?</i>

833
00:41:22,529 --> 00:41:23,950
<i>Will I feel better?</i>

834
00:41:24,374 --> 00:41:25,631
<i>Am I cured?</i>

835
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,941
I thought you said
you didn't think about me.

836
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,048
I don't.

837
00:41:29,817 --> 00:41:33,712
I am actively not thinking about you...

838
00:41:34,628 --> 00:41:35,489
right...

839
00:41:37,156 --> 00:41:38,099
now.

840
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:41,314
<i>What our patients really want to know</i>

841
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:44,034
<i>is... is there hope?</i>

842
00:41:49,822 --> 00:41:51,038
I don't do rings.

843
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:02,641
Don't expect me to suddenly change.

844
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:05,689
I'm a surgeon, just like you.

845
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,490
And we'll have money.

846
00:42:08,914 --> 00:42:10,049
We can hire a wife.

847
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:15,681
Are you saying yes?

848
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:18,770
Yeah.

849
00:42:21,193 --> 00:42:24,071
- I'm not letting you scrub in tomorrow.
- Well, I'm not wearing a ring.

850
00:42:24,072 --> 00:42:25,410
- Okay.
- Okay, then.

851
00:42:26,968 --> 00:42:27,775
Yes!

852
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,960
Oh! Okay, okay, okay, okay!

853
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:35,691
<i>But inevitably, there are times
when you find yourself</i>

854
00:42:36,005 --> 00:42:37,713
<i>in the worst-case scenario...</i>

855
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,146
- Meredith--
- I just have to say this...

856
00:42:44,506 --> 00:42:47,144
The reason I want you
to have the surgery

857
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:49,522
is because I have this hope

858
00:42:50,342 --> 00:42:54,429
that in a year or two years or five,
they're gonna have a breakthrough.

859
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,175
They're gonna find
a cure for Alzheimer's.

860
00:42:57,818 --> 00:42:59,840
And you and I will have another chance

861
00:43:00,633 --> 00:43:01,836
to get to know each other.

862
00:43:03,066 --> 00:43:05,748
You'll have a chance to get to know me,

863
00:43:06,212 --> 00:43:07,019
to see,

864
00:43:07,565 --> 00:43:10,872
that I am not even remotely ordinary.

00:43:12,665 --> 00:43:15,412
So... I wish you would have the surgery.

866
00:43:16,645 --> 00:43:19,365
But it's up to you, mom.

<i>When the worst-case
scenario comes true,</i>

875
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,248
<i>clinging to hope,</i>

876
00:44:06,055 --> 00:44:07,585
