1
00:00:00,274 --> 00:00:01,951
Previously on
"Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,352 --> 00:00:03,714
I'm touchin' the aorta.

3
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:04,659
O'Malley?

4
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:05,895
Yes, sir?

5
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:07,501
You just flew solo.

6
00:00:07,694 --> 00:00:09,361
O'Malley plugs a hole
with his finger,

7
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:11,147
and everyone walks around
like he's some kind of hero.

8
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,714
- I have one off day. 
- You chickened out.

9
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:17,170
- I hesitated briefly. 
- Why didn't you kiss Izzie?

10
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:19,403
Cristina.

11
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,192
- It's my first day back. 
- I'm not waiting forever.

12
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,833
Okay, we're a couple.

13
00:00:25,323 --> 00:00:27,377
Whatever. Don't make
a big deal about it.

14
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:28,617
So pick me.

15
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:31,325
Choose me. Love me.

16
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,068
Derek, have you ever thought that even
if I am Satan and an adulteress bitch

17
00:00:35,098 --> 00:00:37,260
that I still might be
the love of your life?

18
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,526
You're staying with her.

19
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:40,342
Yeah, she's my wife.

20
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:49,006
Communication--

21
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:51,973
it's the first thing we
really learn in life...

22
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:59,850
She didn't even know
he was married.

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,246
I mean,
his wife just shows up and he dumps her.

24
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:04,218
I heard she flipped out.

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,547
What does she expect?

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,030
She got what she deserved,
dating an attending.

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,396
Dating McDreamy.

28
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:10,526
Have you seen his hair?

29
00:01:10,556 --> 00:01:11,770
No guy's that perfect.

30
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:13,161
I think it's kind of sad.

31
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:14,439
She has to work here--

32
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:16,200
with him, with them--

33
00:01:17,037 --> 00:01:17,957
everyone knows.

34
00:01:17,957 --> 00:01:23,687
Funny thing is, once we grow up, learn
our words and really start talking,

35
00:01:23,798 --> 00:01:29,188
the harder it becomes to know what to
say or how to ask for what we really need.

36
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,124
What do you need to,um,
make this marriage work?

37
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,960
I need her to move to Seattle.

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,360
- That's just-- 
- Addison...

39
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:36,749
What do you need?

40
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,966
I need him to stop
talking to Meredith.

41
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:41,496
But I work with her.

42
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:45,283
You want me to pick up my entire
practice and move here, fine.

43
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:47,327
I want you to give
up your girlfriend.

44
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:49,032
I did give up my
girlfriend. Okay?

45
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:51,186
You wanted me to take you back,
I took you back here in Seattle.

46
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:53,288
- See? Once again, it's all about what he wants. 
- She's not listening to me.

47
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:54,720
I'm not gonna move
back to Manhattan.

48
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,283
- I am not the same person. 
- I know.

49
00:01:56,313 --> 00:01:58,744
- You're a flannel wearing, wood chopping fisherman. 
- Oh that's it.

50
00:01:58,774 --> 00:02:01,130
- I'm not gonna talk to her anymore if she's gonna behave like this. 
- Fine.

51
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,844
Sorry, guys. Time's up.

52
00:02:03,044 --> 00:02:04,223
Good progress.

53
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:08,446
Well, we have to do something.

54
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:11,529
Meredith's become, like,
an exhibit like the--hey--

55
00:02:11,616 --> 00:02:15,305
like a zoo animal, like that rare
panda that everyone stares at.

56
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:17,677
Please don't say
that to her face.

57
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:19,207
I think that panda died alone.

58
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,291
This could just as easily be you
if people knew about you and...

59
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:25,494
You take that back.

60
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:29,612
No. I'm just sayin' we should
do somethin' to cheer her up.

61
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:31,709
Don't worry about it.
It's under control.

62
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:33,667
What--what do you
guys have goin' on?

63
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:35,057
- Nothing. 
- What?

64
00:02:35,482 --> 00:02:36,655
Where's Karev?

65
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:38,886
Probably off somewhere
not kissing somebody.

66
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,236
Let's go O'Malley.

67
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:44,457
Hey, so, um, after rounds,
we have something to show you.

68
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:49,381
- Mere? Meredith, can you hear us? 
- She's not deaf.

69
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:51,381
- Well, she looks weird. 
- What do you expect?

70
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:53,461
Derek didn't pick her.
She's gone mental.

71
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:55,046
Meredith, have you gone mental?

72
00:02:55,077 --> 00:02:57,577
- I have not gone mental. 
- See? Okay, she's fine.

73
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,373
We have something to show you.

74
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:02,302
So whatever you do, do not get
assigned to a surgery this morning.

75
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:03,286
It's really good.

76
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:06,386
- Give it a chance, Derek. 
- I gave it a chance. He's a moron.

77
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:12,536
Yeah, mind your own business.

78
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,528
Mrs. Kimberly Griswold.

79
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:17,824
A history of heart disease
and multiple surgeries.

80
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:19,980
In for a beating heart
quadruple C.A.B.G.

81
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,145
You're late.

82
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:25,489
Yes, Karev,
nice of you to join us.

83
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,579
Why keep the heart beating,
Doctor Yang?

84
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,487
I don't know.

85
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:34,084
- What? 
- What?

86
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,297
I have no idea.

87
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:42,678
Oh, I don't know, either.
I just don't.

88
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:44,894
Because of...ow.

89
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:47,672
Anyone else?

90
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:49,965
- Stress reduction because of the previous surgeries-- 
- O'Malley.

91
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:52,545
- I know--I know the answer. 
- I'm asking O'Malley.

92
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:56,208
Scar tissue's too deep.

93
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:57,543
The heart's too weak
to start up again,

94
00:03:57,573 --> 00:04:02,573
so you only immobilize the portion you're working on 
and you leave the rest of the heart on its own.

95
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:09,070
- Welcome to the case. 
- Thank you.

96
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:19,910
What is that?

97
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:22,111
P.J.'s.

98
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,594
That isn't fair,
and you know it.

99
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:24,926
He's punishing me
for the elevator.

100
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:27,245
He's punishing you because
you were late for rounds.

101
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:29,075
You wanna tell me
why you were late?

102
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:35,246
Dr. Shepherd needs somebody
on his nerve case today. Go.

103
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:38,567
And you three--

104
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,614
brush up on how not to embarrass
me in front of the attendings

105
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:44,310
or I'll see to it that your
hearts stop beating. You clear?

106
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,510
Sorry, Dr. Bailey.

107
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:46,877
We really apologize.

108
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:50,736
What is going on?

109
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,002
We found a case.

110
00:04:52,318 --> 00:04:54,824
- You stole a case. 
- Borrowed from psych.

111
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:57,704
Okay, the prelims--okay,
this thing is totally unprecedented.

112
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:58,633
And we found it.

113
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:01,179
- Stole it. 
- Okay, found, stole, hijacked, whatever.

114
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:06,305
Okay, Meredith, behind this door is the
coolest medical mystery I have ever seen.

115
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,812
Now you can either walk away,
you know, guilt free...

116
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:14,320
Or walk through this door,
risk your place in the program,

117
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:18,918
which could possibly lead to spending the rest 
of your life serving fries in bad clothing.

118
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:20,838
So are you in?

119
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,997
Hell, yeah.

120
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,883
- Mr. Herman. 
- Oh, no.

121
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:29,419
Please call me Shane.

122
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:31,940
I gotta hit the can--again.

123
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:34,690
Seems like I gotta go every
30 seconds these days.

124
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:36,566
- Just a guy. 
- Wait for it.

125
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:38,828
I sure am glad to be
off that psych floor.

126
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:42,466
- What's so special? 
- Wait for it.

127
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:48,268
I'm not nuts.

128
00:05:49,004 --> 00:05:50,258
I'm just pregnant.

129
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,142
I was fine, and then last month, unh.
Huge belly.

130
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:35,858
My doctor just kept tellin' me I
was gainin' weight with my wife.

131
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:37,151
She's due on the 30th.

132
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:39,239
- It's our first. 
- Congratulations.

133
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,330
The admitting intern
shipped him off to psych.

134
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,446
Barely did a physical.
Hear that?

135
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:45,436
It's not fluid.
There's somethin' in there.

136
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:47,428
Oh, yeah, no joke.
There's somethin' in there.

137
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,858
I've been able to feel it gettin'
bigger and bigger growin' in my...

138
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:54,363
you know... my womb.

139
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:58,669
Yeah, I know I sound crazy.

140
00:06:58,763 --> 00:07:01,866
I do. But I can prove it.

141
00:07:03,452 --> 00:07:05,134
This room is supposed
to be unoccupied.

142
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:06,764
- Whose patient is this? 
- Hers.

143
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:08,177
Who transferred him?

144
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,650
I don't have any paperwork.

145
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,893
- Any transfer documents. 
- Gimme a break.

146
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:13,307
We shuffle rooms all the time.

147
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:16,486
You know, if we need a bed pan changed,
um, we'll let you know.

148
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,704
Okay, Doctor, you do that.

149
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:21,194
Okay, where's his chart?

150
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,455
Don't tell me you
don't have his chart.

151
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,377
- You steal a patient-- 
- That was your job.

152
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:27,603
Yeah, I was on lookout.

153
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:39,824
How you doin'?

154
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:42,377
You good?

155
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,877
You look good.

156
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:48,396
Come on. We're friends.

157
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:50,647
What's my name?

158
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:57,475
Um...all right.
So I don't know your name.

159
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:01,054
It's not like we can't talk.

160
00:08:01,404 --> 00:08:04,053
You don't have to be a surgeon
for me to talk to you, you know.

161
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,564
- Really? 
- Really.

162
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:07,976
Because I thought you
only talk to attendings.

163
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:15,564
Uh, Nicole, you've been having
problems with spasticity?

164
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:16,924
Mom?

165
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:19,728
She says the spasms
make her legs dance.

166
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:22,656
We just wanted to make things
a little easier for her.

167
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:24,136
She starts college this fall.

168
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,601
Seattle community.

169
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:26,817
Right down the street from us.

170
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:29,317
Not that she wouldn't have her
pick of schools out of state.

171
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:31,679
But she's not
ready for that yet.

172
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:33,774
What, not because
she's in a wheelchair?

173
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:37,137
Has Dr. Ostfeld mentioned
something called a cystoplasty?

174
00:08:37,277 --> 00:08:40,271
No? It's an operation to
enlarge Nicole's bladder.

175
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,040
It creates an opening
called a stoma.

176
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,087
It's improved the quality of life
in a lot of my paralysis patients.

177
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:46,930
We toyed with the
idea a few years ago.

178
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,868
It's not for us.

179
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,755
Well, maybe we
should revisit it.

180
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:54,279
Revisit an invasive, risky procedure
that's got a 20% failure rate, I don't think so?

181
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,956
Nicole, it's something
worth considering.

182
00:08:57,095 --> 00:08:59,383
It means you wouldn't have to
wear the catheter all the time.

183
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,013
Not to mention the medical benefits.
It would, uh...

184
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:03,989
improve your quality of life.

185
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:06,085
You know?
You'd be like girls your own age.

186
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:08,611
You'd be in control of your own bladder.
No messy bags.

187
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:10,541
You could have a more
normal sex life.

188
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:18,937
Well, you know,
when that becomes an issue, of course.

189
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:21,217
We're here for the pain procedure.
That's it.

190
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:23,196
That girl and her mom
share the same brain.

191
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:24,392
She's not gettin' that surgery.

192
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:26,349
I want you to take Nicole with
you everywhere you go today.

193
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:28,409
Take her to labs, take her to coffee,
take her anywhere.

194
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:30,278
Just get her away
from her parents.

195
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:32,273
You want me to babysit
the wheelchair chick?

196
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:33,370
Nicole.

197
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:35,152
She thinks you're cute.

198
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:38,010
She's a teenager, which means
she might even listen to you.

199
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,730
You want me to convince
her to get that surgery.

200
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,309
I want you to convince her to
make the decision for herself.

201
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:43,867
And how am I
supposed to do that?

202
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:45,750
Dr. Karev, you're creative.

203
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:47,705
You'll think of something.

204
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:48,726
Thank you.

205
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:55,980
This will be an extensive operation even
for an open heart veteran like yourself.

206
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,408
My room was bigger last time.

207
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,152
It was brighter--more sun.

208
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,593
Alan, this water is warm.

209
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:02,765
I need more ice.

210
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:05,421
I'm sending you in
for a nuclear scan.

211
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,940
Then we'll get you into the O.R.
this afternoon.

212
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:09,737
You do understand
all of the risks?

213
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:12,435
I've been through it too many
times to not understand the risks.

214
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:14,447
Get the blinds.
Open the blinds.

215
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,159
This room is depressing.

216
00:10:17,381 --> 00:10:18,931
I'll check back a little later.

217
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:22,282
Take her for the thallium scan
and pick up her x-rays on the way.

218
00:10:22,494 --> 00:10:25,519
Dr. Burke, thank you for
choosing me to assist you today.

219
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:28,689
Well, you're my guy, O'Malley.

220
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:31,863
- I am? I mean, yeah. 
- Hand me the tissues.

221
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,021
No, no, wait.

222
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:35,163
Hospitals have germs.

223
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,496
Get my hand sanitizer
out of my case.

224
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,820
Why would you be with someone
who makes you that unhappy?

225
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:42,820
Excuse me?

226
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:46,006
I mean, like, well, like,
you're happy with Cristina.

227
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:47,760
And she's happy--well, happier.

228
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:49,094
You know, Cristina happy.

229
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:51,589
Which is not normal
people's happy, but...

230
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,175
Well, you know,
happy since you guys started, uh...

231
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:01,402
Scans. I'm on it.
I'm your guy...

232
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:08,531
and I'm an idiot.

233
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,392
Hi. Hello. Hi. Meredith.

234
00:11:14,486 --> 00:11:16,236
Maybe we could,
you know, uh, talk.

235
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:18,565
- No. 
- No.

236
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,352
Okay.

237
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:26,432
Beep, beep.

238
00:11:27,546 --> 00:11:30,024
- What'd you do to get stuck with me? 
- Nothing.

239
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,239
Come on, I know you're not just
wheeling me around for kicks.

240
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:34,887
Well, I was late for rounds.

241
00:11:35,323 --> 00:11:36,196
Why?

242
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:38,773
Oh, 'cause I had things to do.
Hey, Izzie!

243
00:11:39,203 --> 00:11:40,164
Izzie!

244
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,916
Hey, doll face.

245
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:50,457
I was gonna ask you a favor,
you know?

246
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:53,478
I thought since, you know, maybe
you're better with people than I am,

247
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:54,822
-I thought maybe you could-- 
-No.

248
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:56,430
-Uh, you haven't even heard-- 
-No, no.

249
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,335
You're like a
broken record. God.

250
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:02,704
You're only ever nice or friendly or
anything when it's convenient for you.

251
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,592
So no to your favor.

252
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,122
No to you. No.

253
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:06,843
What's up with you?

254
00:12:07,082 --> 00:12:08,369
I put on a dress.

255
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:09,551
I did my hair.

256
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:12,591
I had one night off in two
weeks and I used it on you.

257
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,055
And what do I get?

258
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:15,061
Nothing.

259
00:12:15,143 --> 00:12:17,148
No respect, no apology...

260
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:20,791
you couldn't even be bothered
to kiss me good night.

261
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:22,491
You know what?

262
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,626
You're a coward,
and you're just as shallow as you seem.

263
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:29,412
So I am done trying to be
your friend or whatever.

264
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,875
I'm over it.

265
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:36,156
She's really mad at you.

266
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:41,012
This urine sample is the last
thing we need, Mr. Herman.

267
00:12:41,746 --> 00:12:42,427
Uh...

268
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:44,476
- Meet Shane's wife Tina. 
- Hey.

269
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:45,662
She's also pregnant.

270
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:51,153
Can you tell us what precipitated the psychotic 
episode that got you admitted to the hospital?

271
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:53,174
It wasn't an episode, okay?

272
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:55,022
And I'm not psychotic.

273
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:56,630
I am pregnant.

274
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:58,895
I mean,
wouldn't you freak out if you were me?

275
00:12:58,925 --> 00:12:59,902
Honey, did you bring it?

276
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:01,513
- Yeah, yeah. 
- Oh, good.

277
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:04,347
I can prove to everyone
that I'm not crazy.

278
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:06,682
That is my patient!

279
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:10,315
Yeah, well, he's ours now, and if you
wanna fight me for it, I guarantee you I'll win.

280
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:13,497
- What is going on in here? 
- Dr. Bailey, just one moment. Here.

281
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:14,877
Please look at his abdomen.

282
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:17,299
It's a male
hysterical pregnancy.

283
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,403
It's a psych case,
and it's mine.

284
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:20,710
It's not hysterical.

285
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:21,998
I am pregnant.

286
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:23,397
See? Psych.

287
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:24,925
No, his belly is distended.

288
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,060
There's no signs of ascites, and I
clearly feel a mass with deep palpation--

289
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,993
- Surgical. 
- Guys.

290
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:32,475
I told you I could prove it.

291
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:33,505
- Psych. 
- Surgical.

292
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:35,669
Come on, you're doctors,
act like it.

293
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:36,432
Guys.

294
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:39,087
- Psych. 
- Surgical.

295
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:40,051
Guys!

296
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:42,656
Shane took a pregnancy test...

297
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,130
and it's positive.

298
00:13:47,023 --> 00:13:49,463
Well, he's definitely
a surgical patient now.

299
00:13:56,728 --> 00:14:00,110
Do not think for a moment I
condone stealing patients.

300
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:02,808
That said, way to go.

301
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,361
The first pregnancy
test I took...

302
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:07,788
was a joke to make Tina laugh.

303
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,086
Well, we didn't think it would lead to,
you know, this.

304
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,186
Mr. Herman, I can assure you,
you are in no way pregnant.

305
00:14:15,476 --> 00:14:20,021
That's a relief--to hear it, you know,
officially, but, hey, why was that stick blue?

306
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:21,474
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

307
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:25,713
Uh, Stevens, do a shotgun
workup including tumor markers

308
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:29,315
and get C.T.
to make some room for us in line.

309
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,944
What's this for again?

310
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,475
Uh, medical journals,
monthly case reports.

311
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:36,125
Annual banquet highlight reels.

312
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:40,799
Hey, whose pager is that?

313
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:43,453
Um, mine, but I found him.

314
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:44,716
So can someone else go?

315
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:46,880
No, we don't ignore
pages, Yang.

316
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,208
Would you excuse me?

317
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,806
We just need to get to the top.

318
00:14:57,806 --> 00:14:59,922
We'll be finished soon,
right, Dr. Bailey?

319
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:01,089
We, um...

320
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:02,625
Good.

321
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:04,784
Okay.

322
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:10,231
Patient in 4243 needs a rectal.

323
00:15:10,338 --> 00:15:15,407
Then I've got two infected wounds, a
foley, a groin abscess, four debridements, and, uh...

324
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,590
a case of explosive diarrhea.

325
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:22,424
You're kidding me, right?

326
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,518
I'm not known for my humor.

327
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:28,431
Uh, why did you page me about--

328
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:29,991
none of these are my patients.

329
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:31,636
You're Bailey's intern, right?

330
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:33,712
Then these are your patients.

331
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:36,700
Debbie here.

332
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:40,758
A portion of the intestine is
used to enlarge the bladder

333
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:44,008
and then we construct a pathway
to a hole in the belly button.

334
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:44,832
It's a very tiny hole.

335
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,537
It's virtually invisible.

336
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:47,939
She could wear a bikini.

337
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:49,183
No one would ever know.

338
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,436
Why would she need a bikini?

339
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:51,612
She doesn't know how to swim.

340
00:15:51,642 --> 00:15:53,995
She could go to the beach, lie in
the sun, hang out with her friends.

341
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:54,724
Oh, my god.

342
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,676
She's so self-conscious now.

343
00:15:57,805 --> 00:15:59,677
Nicole could have friends
her own age, Elaine.

344
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:01,023
When did you say
Nicole would be back?

345
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:03,327
After her labs.
Now just think about her future.

346
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:05,894
Nicole could be independent.
She could go to college anywhere.

347
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:10,330
She could have a job, have her
own apartment, date, get married.

348
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:12,490
These labs are
takin' a long time.

349
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,423
She can spend more than 20
minutes away from us, Elaine.

350
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,572
I'm asking about my only child.

351
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:18,929
She's not a child anymore.

352
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,093
She's my child.

353
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:21,721
She'll always be my child.

354
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,114
Alan, watch your step.

355
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:27,134
- You're hitting my chair. 
- I'm sorry.

356
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:28,879
- And hold onto my bag. 
- I got it.

357
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:31,100
- And don't rummage through it. 
- I won't.

358
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:37,073
"Please" and "thank yous"
were never her strong suit.

359
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:38,876
You're a very patient person.

360
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,994
Years of practice. Oops.

361
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:42,612
Oh, she won't see that.

362
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:45,112
I just try to keep her calm.

363
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:50,633
You know, they didn't think she was gonna survive 
the first surgery, let alone three more.

364
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:54,048
But here it is ten years later,
she's still here.

365
00:16:54,742 --> 00:16:59,006
Yeah, it's, uh,
it's a miracle that she's still alive.

366
00:16:59,222 --> 00:17:00,583
That's what everyone says.

367
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:01,870
What do you say?

368
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,651
Uh, it's right
there in the vows.

369
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,401
In sickness and
in health, right?

370
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:10,514
Thanks.

371
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:18,815
A pregnant guy?

372
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,649
You had a pregnant guy,
and you didn't tell me?

373
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:24,937
Well, we can get you floor
space in the O.R. for 50 bucks.

374
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:27,303
You're selling tickets, and we don't
even know what's wrong with him.

375
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,344
Whatever he's got inside
has got to come out.

376
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:30,755
We're just brokering
a few deals.

377
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:31,840
Sort of like backstage passes.

378
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,713
- You want in on the cash? 
- No.

379
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:35,093
I didn't get a pregnant guy.

380
00:17:35,123 --> 00:17:38,195
I was Burke's new go-to guy,
but that's over thanks to you.

381
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,290
- He didn't know that I knew about you two. 
- Stop talking.

382
00:17:43,365 --> 00:17:44,380
What on earth?

383
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:54,485
Hi.

384
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,246
I'm Alex's charity case.

385
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:58,589
Yeah, I like her already.

386
00:17:58,841 --> 00:18:00,567
- Are you volunteering? 
- Don't ask.

387
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:02,301
Why? It's not like we
can read your mind.

388
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,251
It's not like we have any idea what's
going on in your tiny, tiny, tiny little brain.

389
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:06,203
She has a point.

390
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,492
Oh! I am hungry!

391
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:12,427
So this is cool.

392
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:16,669
A real live lunchtime in a real
cafeteria with trays and--

393
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,613
and friends.

394
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:18,489
We're not his friends.

395
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,286
Don't you have a
cafeteria at your school?

396
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:21,754
I'm homeschooled by my parents.

397
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,123
That explains a lot.

398
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:26,366
So are you guys the cool kids
around here or something?

399
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,946
What would make you think that?

400
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,520
It seems like everyone's
talking about you.

401
00:18:41,176 --> 00:18:43,884
The guys and I were takin' bets
on who'd get to scan this dude.

402
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,114
Beers are on me tonight.

403
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:47,734
Next up,
the wager on what this thing is.

404
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:49,882
You're taking bets?

405
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,390
On what's inside his belly.

406
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:52,974
You want in? 10 bucks.

407
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,516
Well, I know it's not fat,
food or a fetus, so...

408
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:56,845
Jeez.

409
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,376
Are those teeth?

410
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:03,486
Cristina's gonna be so
mad she missed this.

411
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,678
I was told to page you and only
you if somethin' like this came up.

412
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:09,067
Who told you, Bailey?

413
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,565
- No. 
- Oh, yes,

414
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:16,663
and all I can say is you must've
made one serious faux pas.

415
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:19,435
I hate vomit.

416
00:19:20,222 --> 00:19:21,624
You're gonna need this.

417
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,857
Bailey knows.

418
00:19:49,392 --> 00:19:51,249
- Knows what? 
- She knows.

419
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:52,937
O'Malley knows.

420
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:55,112
- Why not Bailey? 
- So you didn't tell her?

421
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:57,166
- Why would I do that? 
- This is bad.

422
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,699
We have to manage the damage ourselves
before this thing spins too far out of control,

423
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:03,090
- and that means coming clean to the chief. 
- What?

424
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,038
If we come out in the open,

425
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:06,149
- then no one has anything to say. 
- No. No. No way. No way.

426
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,385
- That's the only way. 
- Good morning.

427
00:20:08,677 --> 00:20:10,454
- Morning, chief. 
- Thank you, Dr. Burke.

428
00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:11,791
You're welcome. Ahem.

429
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,088
Great board, chief.

430
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:24,594
Would you make sure that they get the breathing tube 
out of my throat right after surgery this time?

431
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:29,127
Are you trying to cut
off my circulation?

432
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:31,337
He's just doin' his job.

433
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:33,266
What did you say?

434
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:36,952
I said,
"he's just doin' his job."

435
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,602
Well, I don't really care
whose job he's doing.

436
00:20:40,728 --> 00:20:42,699
He's squeezing my arm off.

437
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,557
Are you just gonna sit there?

438
00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:48,137
Shut up, Kim.

439
00:20:51,072 --> 00:20:52,059
Just...

440
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:54,623
shut up, huh?

441
00:20:55,193 --> 00:20:58,197
You complain to me, about me...

442
00:20:58,496 --> 00:21:01,076
around me all day...

443
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:03,336
every day.

444
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:07,104
A little silence would be nice.

445
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:11,284
A few measly minutes of quiet.

446
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:13,586
- Can't you for once... 
- Mr. Griswold.

447
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:15,380
In your life...

448
00:21:15,528 --> 00:21:18,275
just shut up?!

449
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:27,698
What do we got?

450
00:21:27,795 --> 00:21:31,402
She had a levine sign and her E.K.G.
shows S.T. elevations in ******

451
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:34,633
She's havin' a heart attack.

452
00:21:34,706 --> 00:21:36,019
Give her 4 migs of morphine.

453
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:38,209
Run nitro 10 mics per minute.

454
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:41,016
Let's do this fast so we can
get into surgery, people.

455
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:43,066
Oh, I did this.

456
00:21:44,822 --> 00:21:46,391
I did this to her.

457
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,028
Look, mesenteric
teratoma, chief.

458
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:50,978
In an adult male.

459
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:52,298
Is this possible?

460
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:53,541
It is now.

461
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:56,021
Large bilobed cystic lesion...

462
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:57,829
with a solid
calcified structure.

463
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,738
A deformed mandible.

464
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:03,586
Labs show elevated
H.C.G. levels.

465
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:06,594
That explains the false
positive on the pregnancy test.

466
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:09,550
- Which also means... 
- It's probably malignant.

467
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,636
You okay?

468
00:22:11,937 --> 00:22:13,378
You look a little green.

469
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:16,522
I think he needs
some air, chief.

470
00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:18,804
Deep breaths, Mr. Herman.

471
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:23,401
Just--most of this medical
speak goes right over my head.

472
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:28,381
You have what's called a teratoma,
and it's really very rare in adults.

473
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:30,147
Which is why you're so popular.

474
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,440
It's just a mass of cells that's
probably been there your whole life,

475
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,972
- only now-- 
- Now it's growing.

476
00:22:35,002 --> 00:22:38,828
Yeah, growing jawbones and toenails and,
uh, clumps of hair.

477
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:40,613
Yeah, I've been listenin'.

478
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:42,643
It's just no one's
really talking to us.

479
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,952
Just about you.

480
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,810
I know what that's like.

481
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,051
Um, hi. What'd I miss?

482
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,179
Ew, is that...

483
00:22:51,695 --> 00:22:54,272
is that rectal jelly
on your scrubs?

484
00:22:59,157 --> 00:23:04,245
Dr. Bailey, all the attention,
all the people are making them panic.

485
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,626
You know, when you said you
found a lunch spot with a view,

486
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,527
I knew I should have
taken you literally.

487
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:15,607
I found it in my "best
of Seattle" guide.

488
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,959
It's hardly brown bagging it on the top
of the Empire State Building, but...

489
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,700
they did have these cute
little viewfinders.

490
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:26,025
You always find something
to complain about.

491
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,230
Okay, is there anything that
you like about me anymore?

492
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:33,198
Because if there is,
I really need to know now.

493
00:23:33,937 --> 00:23:37,787
Well, I like that you like cute little
viewfinders in every city you live in.

494
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:40,118
I don't live here yet.

495
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:48,881
Are you going to stop
talking to Meredith?

496
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:50,326
- I will. 
- When...

497
00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:53,256
Today, tomorrow, next week?

498
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:55,788
Maybe I'm not ready yet.

499
00:23:57,825 --> 00:24:00,570
Are you ever gonna
be ready, Derek?

500
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:03,880
What if I say no?

501
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,229
Then I'm not moving here.

502
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:10,892
Then I guess we're
at an impasse then.

503
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:19,676
Dr. Yang...

504
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,139
we never finished
our conversation.

505
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,110
Yes, we did.

506
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:25,899
We decided we're not gonna
tell you know who about us.

507
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:27,220
Oh, we decided?

508
00:24:27,497 --> 00:24:29,469
If you're worried about your
career and your reputation,

509
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:32,122
they're in much more danger if he
hears about us through the grapevine.

510
00:24:32,152 --> 00:24:36,259
- He doesn't have to hear about us at all. 
- Only he will. It's just a matter of time.

511
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:38,389
Unless you're hesitating
because of some--

512
00:24:38,505 --> 00:24:39,499
some different reason.

513
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:40,742
Okay, you are not
thinking this through.

514
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:43,672
Like you not wanting to admit
to this relationship at all?

515
00:24:47,592 --> 00:24:48,992
We are a couple.

516
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:55,439
- Fine. 
- Burke.

517
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,955
I said, "fine."

518
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:04,757
So what's up with you not
wanting to get this procedure?

519
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,967
I'm fine the way I am.

520
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:09,209
Good point. Your choice.

521
00:25:13,177 --> 00:25:16,263
So you're not gonna try
and talk me into it?

522
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:17,819
Right now, I'm gonna study.

523
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:23,723
"Nuclear something
fancy name-ology."

524
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:27,045
- Is that why you were late--you were studying? 
- No.

525
00:25:29,034 --> 00:25:31,670
- Is that girl Izzie your girlfriend? 
- No.

526
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,013
Do you want her to
be your girlfriend?

527
00:25:35,043 --> 00:25:37,363
Look, I got stuck with you
because I was late for rounds.

528
00:25:37,393 --> 00:25:39,565
So if you don't mind,
kid, I'm kinda busy.

529
00:25:41,403 --> 00:25:42,585
I'm 18, you know.

530
00:25:42,815 --> 00:25:43,489
What?

531
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:45,302
I'm not a kid. I'm 18, and...

532
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:47,722
and I don't have to stay
down here with you.

533
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:49,891
- I could go back to my room. 
- So go.

534
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,733
Izzie's right.

535
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:56,575
You're an ass.

536
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:57,675
I'm not an ass.

537
00:25:57,963 --> 00:25:59,521
Okay, I am an ass...

538
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:01,598
But I'm a cute ass, right?

539
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,397
How come you didn't kiss her?

540
00:26:07,787 --> 00:26:09,141
I thought you were leaving.

541
00:26:10,926 --> 00:26:14,640
If I had a chance to kiss someone
I liked, I wouldn't hesitate.

542
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:18,374
If I had the chance to lose the urine
bag around my ankle, I wouldn't hesitate, either.

543
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:21,504
But then again, I don't let my
mommy do all my talking for me.

544
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:25,357
I don't like you.

545
00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:27,019
Yes, you do.

546
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,969
- Jerk. 
- Motormouth.

547
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:31,231
- Babysitter. 
- 2-wheeler.

548
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,366
Now that's just
politically incorrect.

549
00:26:40,218 --> 00:26:42,634
Looks like 
Mrs. Griswold is doin' well.

550
00:26:42,854 --> 00:26:43,944
Wait a minute...

551
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:45,945
<i>just a little suction.</i>

552
00:26:46,224 --> 00:26:48,716
<i>We'll fix the mechanical
stabilizer later.</i>

553
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:53,676
<i>Right now I'm just gonna hit a
few--a few of these little bleeders.</i>

554
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:08,239
Look at that.

555
00:27:08,811 --> 00:27:12,233
A perfectly exposed,
partially-numb beating heart.

556
00:27:13,226 --> 00:27:14,620
It's a beautiful thing.

557
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:15,461
<i>Code red!</i>

558
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:16,850
<i>Oh my god.</i>

559
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,565
I think it just
burst into flames.

560
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:20,704
Her heart--it's on fire.

561
00:27:20,734 --> 00:27:21,600
We have to save Mrs. Griswold.

562
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,260
- Begin fire protocol. 
- I'm on it.

563
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,966
Code red! Begin fire protocol!

564
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:26,616
- Move, people! 
- We need wet towels.

565
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:28,939
- O'Malley, disconnect the electrical leads. 
- I got it.

566
00:27:28,969 --> 00:27:29,921
Let's go, rookie.

567
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:33,324
Any unnecessary personnel in this room,
evacuate now.

568
00:27:33,414 --> 00:27:34,465
Shut down the o2.

569
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:35,576
Already on it.

570
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,174
Start manual respiration.

571
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:43,261
I've got the ambu bag.
Starting manual respiration.

572
00:27:44,115 --> 00:27:45,865
We've got to control
this bleeding.

573
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,725
Her vitals are stabilizing.

574
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:52,672
We might just have
a chance here.

575
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:55,672
She was on fire.

576
00:27:56,015 --> 00:27:58,628
I have never seen anything like that.
What was that?

577
00:27:58,693 --> 00:27:59,893
It was a freak accident.

578
00:28:00,104 --> 00:28:02,737
- But she was on fire. 
- All right. You already said that.

579
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:06,012
I know, but she was... on fire.

580
00:28:06,095 --> 00:28:07,382
George, you okay?

581
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:08,419
She was on fire.

582
00:28:11,404 --> 00:28:12,217
That was intense.

583
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:13,197
Are you okay, or...

584
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,715
I'm fine. O'Malley, let's go.

585
00:28:21,998 --> 00:28:23,463
I'm so over this.

586
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:31,432
Hey, I heard a heart
caught on fire in the O.R.

587
00:28:31,717 --> 00:28:36,776
I am the best intern you've got, and you
are wasting me on puke and boils, and I get it. I--

588
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,578
I even deserve it, but please, you
can't keep me away from this surgery.

589
00:28:40,608 --> 00:28:42,109
I earned this surgery.

590
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:44,165
I stole the surgery.

591
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,275
What are you
talkin' about, yang?

592
00:28:46,322 --> 00:28:48,117
You, punishing me.

593
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:56,152
You have no idea what I'm talking about,
do you?

594
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,925
Well, then, like,
who has been paging me all day?

595
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:01,050
The nurses have
been on me nonstop.

596
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:07,048
A little bit of respect, and you
could've saved yourself a very long day, Dr. Yang.

597
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:12,433
Pissing off the nurses.

598
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:14,861
Stupid.

599
00:29:15,332 --> 00:29:17,032
Well, I can still
scrub in, right?

600
00:29:17,784 --> 00:29:19,791
He wants me to move
here, Richard--

601
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:22,093
to pick up everything and move.

602
00:29:22,202 --> 00:29:23,629
Don't stay for him, Addison.

603
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:24,814
Stay for me.

604
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,253
Stay for yourself.

605
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:29,494
- Richard, I-- 
- Look, in Seattle, you could be front page news.

606
00:29:29,582 --> 00:29:32,653
With your reputation and the
money I'll put into promoting you,

607
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:36,833
Seattle Grace will become one of the
foremost neonatal hospitals west of Manhattan.

608
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:45,011
You're serious.

609
00:29:45,121 --> 00:29:47,378
I'm ready to put my
money where my mouth is.

610
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,574
- Turn around. Walk away. 
- From who?

611
00:29:59,653 --> 00:30:00,914
From my intern.

612
00:30:01,177 --> 00:30:02,175
Well, I wasn't.

613
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,838
Yeah--yeah. Yes, you were.

614
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:06,461
Come on, look--look,
you can't do this.

615
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:07,521
You don't have the right.

616
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:08,366
Not anymore.

617
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:09,801
I just wanna find
out if she's okay.

618
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:10,847
No, she's not.

619
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:14,876
She's a human traffic accident, and 
everybody's slowin' down to look at the wreckage.

620
00:30:14,906 --> 00:30:17,560
She's doin' the best she
can with what she has left.

621
00:30:17,637 --> 00:30:22,323
Look, I know you can't see this because
you're in it, but you can't help her now.

622
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:23,626
You'll only make it worse.

623
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,384
Walk away. Leave her to mend.

624
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:32,063
Go on.

625
00:30:38,118 --> 00:30:40,968
It's not that I don't want
the operation. I do, you know.

626
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,439
I want things.

627
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:44,319
It's just...

628
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,726
what if I'm not ready?

629
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:48,292
Ready for what?

630
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:50,720
For everything--

631
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:57,382
for taking care of myself,
for being on my own, for sex.

632
00:30:58,472 --> 00:30:59,415
For love.

633
00:31:02,242 --> 00:31:04,034
I've never had a boyfriend.

634
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:08,639
I've never even been kissed.

635
00:31:10,442 --> 00:31:14,542
I'm, like, the oldest living prospective
college freshman not to go to first base.

636
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:18,231
It's mortifying.

637
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:21,241
There are way older losers than you.
Trust me.

638
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:29,748
Alex...

639
00:31:32,212 --> 00:31:33,359
would you kiss me?

640
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:37,282
Wh--what?

641
00:31:38,783 --> 00:31:41,923
I know you're a doctor, I'm your
patient and it's against the rules,

642
00:31:41,953 --> 00:31:44,565
but I would never tell anyone.

643
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,591
For a kiss to be really good,
you want it to mean something.

644
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,639
You want it to be with someone
you can't get out of your head,

645
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:10,049
so that when your lips finally touch,
you feel it everywhere.

646
00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:14,732
A kiss so hot and so deep,
you never wanna come up for air.

647
00:32:17,578 --> 00:32:19,693
You can't cheat your
first kiss, Nicole.

648
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:26,011
Trust me, you don't want to, 'cause when
you find that right person, the first kiss...

649
00:32:27,617 --> 00:32:28,646
it's everything.

650
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,490
- Her heart-- 
- Caught on fire. Yes.

651
00:32:37,924 --> 00:32:41,126
There will, of course, be an
investigation, but you should know,

652
00:32:41,345 --> 00:32:43,513
this is not as
unusual as it sounds.

653
00:32:43,981 --> 00:32:45,941
Your wife is going to be fine.
She's well.

654
00:32:45,971 --> 00:32:51,512
Um, we completed the operation and I
expect that she will make a full recovery.

655
00:33:00,818 --> 00:33:02,032
Mr. Griswold?

656
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:14,071
So that's it, isn't it?

657
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:25,694
Her heart caught on fire in the middle
of her fifth open heart operation and she survived?

658
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:33,632
Whoa. Well...

659
00:33:35,156 --> 00:33:37,179
she's like some, uh...

660
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:40,750
some mythical monster.

661
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:45,397
She's never gonna die!

662
00:33:45,532 --> 00:33:46,777
Uh, Mr. Griswold...

663
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,003
Mr. Griswold.

664
00:33:48,313 --> 00:33:50,856
I know this is an
emotional time for you.

665
00:33:51,632 --> 00:33:53,087
Um, if you'd like to wait...

666
00:33:53,183 --> 00:33:55,055
Wait? No, no.

667
00:33:55,389 --> 00:33:58,430
I'm not waiting any longer.

668
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:06,430
You tell her...

669
00:34:06,953 --> 00:34:09,865
tell her...hell.

670
00:34:10,896 --> 00:34:15,985
Tell her she'll
survive without me.

671
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:29,618
We can add two more,
standing room only.

672
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:30,770
Hey, hands off.

673
00:34:30,845 --> 00:34:32,359
What is going on in here?

674
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:35,494
Everybody out!

675
00:34:35,494 --> 00:34:36,794
- We already have-- 
- Out!

676
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,598
Mr. Herman is a patient--

677
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:44,512
a surgical patient who's sick and
embarrassed and tired of being stared at.

678
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,972
You two--this isn't a zoo!

679
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,102
Out! Out!

680
00:34:49,182 --> 00:34:50,689
Out! You know what?

681
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:55,451
If all of you want to point and whisper
and stare at me, knock yourselves out.

682
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:56,434
"Look at Meredith.

683
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:58,946
"Isn't she sad and
pathetic and heartbroken?

684
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:00,483
"Maybe she's gone mental."

685
00:35:00,595 --> 00:35:05,029
Maybe I have, but leave Mr.
Herman alone.

686
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,735
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

687
00:35:13,963 --> 00:35:15,897
And what are you looking at?

688
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:30,544
So--so do you tell
his wife or should I?

689
00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:38,970
Heh heh. This is--

690
00:35:41,093 --> 00:35:41,897
I...

691
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,507
I want to thank you...

692
00:35:51,773 --> 00:35:54,388
for helpin' me out in the
surgery today, O'Malley.

693
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:58,747
It was a-a high pressure situation
today, and you were on top of it.

694
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:01,205
Well, thank you, Dr. Burke.

695
00:36:04,715 --> 00:36:08,426
And, hey,
I'm sorry about before.

696
00:36:08,518 --> 00:36:11,467
About, you know, bringin' up,
you know, you and Cristina.

697
00:36:11,891 --> 00:36:12,764
That...

698
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:14,789
it's just like...

699
00:36:28,665 --> 00:36:30,165
You're still my guy, O'Malley.

700
00:36:31,426 --> 00:36:32,426
You're still my guy.

701
00:36:40,419 --> 00:36:43,269
I always thought I'd hold your
hand in the delivery room.

702
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,780
I'll let you know when
the surgery's over, okay?

703
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,574
Okay. This is as far as I go.

704
00:36:58,401 --> 00:37:01,808
Dr. Grey, don't let 'em show it off,
you know...

705
00:37:02,078 --> 00:37:05,139
put it in a jar or pass
it around or nothin'.

706
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:06,084
Your teratoma?

707
00:37:06,229 --> 00:37:07,277
Yeah.

708
00:37:08,502 --> 00:37:11,402
I feel weird about havin' my
insides on display like that.

709
00:37:11,972 --> 00:37:13,598
- You promise? 
- I promise.

710
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:22,240
At the end of the day, there are some
things you just can't help but talk about.

711
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:32,204
You really wanna be the one
to dispose of this, Grey?

712
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,073
I made a promise.

713
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:41,303
I am worried about my career--

714
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:43,395
I'm worried about my
reputation and my--

715
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,448
I will not be Meredith Grey.

716
00:37:57,568 --> 00:38:00,316
I busted my ass to get here,
and people won't make allowances for me.

717
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:03,096
This is not about making allowances,
and you know that.

718
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:06,467
- Everyone will know. 
- That's the point.

719
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:09,096
I don't want to tell
the chief, okay?

720
00:38:09,216 --> 00:38:10,070
I just...

721
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:12,933
don't.

722
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,386
Some things we just
don't want to hear...

723
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:26,586
and some things we say because
we can't be silent any longer.

724
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:32,774
I'm getting the operation.

725
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:36,213
- She's clearly not considering-- 
- She is considering.

726
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:37,591
I'm getting the operation.

727
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:42,170
You two talk and talk, but have you
noticed how you never ask me anything?

728
00:38:42,748 --> 00:38:43,848
Part of it's my fault.

729
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:47,315
I let you do it,
but I'm not cheating anymore.

730
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:52,367
I'm not sitting back and
giving over control because...

731
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,101
I am ready to handle
things for myself.

732
00:38:56,297 --> 00:38:58,416
Some things are more
than what you say...

733
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:00,274
they're what you do.

734
00:39:01,683 --> 00:39:03,383
I appreciate your
candor, Preston.

735
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,530
I can take whatever
you threw at Shepherd.

736
00:39:05,706 --> 00:39:07,360
I don't need any
special treatment here.

737
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,840
And you're not gonna get any.

738
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:09,965
You're not married.

739
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:10,981
You're not hiding.

740
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,273
You came to me.

741
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:15,796
You clearly value
your relationship.

742
00:39:17,294 --> 00:39:18,744
What you two have together...

743
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:24,179
I understand that, Preston,
and it does matter.

744
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:27,716
Some things you say because
there's no other choice.

745
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:41,238
I've given it a lot of consideration,
and I've decided to move to Seattle.

746
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:45,844
Mm, and, um, well,
Meredith won't be an issue anymore.

747
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,344
She's out of my life. It's--

748
00:39:48,903 --> 00:39:50,212
well, it's taken care of.

749
00:39:51,126 --> 00:39:54,238
Well, I must say, this is,
um, remarkable progress.

750
00:39:54,955 --> 00:39:56,510
I applaud both of you.

751
00:39:57,251 --> 00:40:00,858
You've, um,
taken a very significant leap.

752
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:06,025
That's what marriage is
about...compromise, right?

753
00:40:08,092 --> 00:40:12,148
Yeah, it's, uh, well,
it's about, um, give and take.

754
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:15,750
Some things you
keep to yourself.

755
00:40:22,435 --> 00:40:23,675
She yelled at you?

756
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:25,950
Oh, we probably deserved it.

757
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:27,237
We sold...

758
00:40:27,528 --> 00:40:30,132
$485 worth of tickets
to the surgery.

759
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:32,634
Yeah.

760
00:40:33,526 --> 00:40:34,614
Did you sell more?

761
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:40,427
Oh, yeah.

762
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:41,901
Out of control.

763
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,628
Hey, Joe.

764
00:40:44,928 --> 00:40:45,874
Hey.

765
00:40:51,922 --> 00:40:54,848
So you guys really don't have
anything else to talk about.

766
00:40:55,963 --> 00:40:57,263
No.

767
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:05,025
And not too often...

768
00:41:07,012 --> 00:41:08,666
but every now and then...

769
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:10,848
What?

770
00:41:13,197 --> 00:41:14,041
What?

771
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:17,528
Some things simply
speak for themselves.

772
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,091
Good night.

773
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:45,929
Seriously.
