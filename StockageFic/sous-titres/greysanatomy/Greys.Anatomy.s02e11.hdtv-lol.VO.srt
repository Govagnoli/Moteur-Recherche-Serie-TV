1
00:00:00,986 --> 00:00:02,466
<i>Previously on "grey's anatomy"...</i>

2
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:03,656
that was amazing.

3
00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:04,866
Meredith won't
be an issue anymore.

4
00:00:05,016 --> 00:00:07,036
She's out of my life.
Good-bye,derek.

5
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:08,936
You could start thinking
about moving in with me.

6
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:09,956
She's cute and she likes you.

7
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:11,316
You shouldn't let a
little syph get in the way.

8
00:00:11,406 --> 00:00:13,546
I like you,olivia.
I just don't like you enough.

9
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:15,596
Do you feel like doing it now?

10
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:19,986
You're married?

11
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:22,536
I'm pregna, you blind moron.

12
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:24,016
How much sodium did you give him?

13
00:00:24,126 --> 00:00:25,196
500 cc over 4 hours.

14
00:00:25,356 --> 00:00:27,096
Why didn't you do a follow-up?
I gave you one thing to do

15
00:00:27,256 --> 00:00:29,416
I have a lot to teach
if you want to learn.

16
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:31,556
So when you decide
how important it is

17
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,186
for you to hate me,
let me know.

18
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:35,366
Dorie Russell,
she's giving birth to quints.

19
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:38,176
we're gonna need
all the hands we can get.

20
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:42,496
<i>40 years ago,</i>

21
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:46,036
<i>the beatles asked the world
a simple question.</i>

22
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:50,056
<i>He wanted to know where all
the lonely people came from.</i>

23
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:53,026
<i>My lest theory is that a great many
of the lonely people</i>

24
00:00:53,176 --> 00:00:54,636
<i>come from hospitals.</i>

25
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:56,016
<i>More precisely,</i>

26
00:00:56,206 --> 00:00:58,586
<i>the surgical wing of hospitals.</i>

27
00:00:58,706 --> 00:01:00,256
I have the best quint. Lucy...

28
00:01:00,406 --> 00:01:01,636
She just smiled at me.

29
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:04,006
She's 9 hours old,george.
I'm sayin'

30
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:06,486
there are five babies here,
and clearly,

31
00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:08,146
mine is the advanced one.

32
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,256
Charlotte's smart.

33
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:12,576
She's got wrinkles on her forehead...
very serious.

34
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:15,356
Okay,"a," this
is not a competition,

35
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:18,296
and "b," my quint
kicks your quints' asses.

36
00:01:18,436 --> 00:01:20,666
Emily's strong,
she won't let go of my finger.

37
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:24,056
Hey,julie has her organs
on the outside of her body,

38
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:26,266
and she's still alive,
thank you.

39
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:28,336
Kate's the best one.

40
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,106
Izzie.
Leave.

41
00:01:32,246 --> 00:01:33,926
Can we please just talk?

42
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:35,886
You're too busy
screwing nurses to talk.

43
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:37,986
Just get out.

44
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:40,656
Can someone make sure that
kate's vitals remain stable?

45
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:42,236
I will.

46
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:44,356
He is unbelievable.

47
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:46,226
I am so glad
i never slept with him.

48
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:49,336
Which is his loss,
because i'm really good in bed...

49
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:51,846
mind-blowing...
mind-blowingly good in bed.

50
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:53,456
Are you trying to seduce us?

51
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,946
And then he sleeps
with Olivia instead of me.

52
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:58,236
<i>Olivia.
Hey,I slept with olivia.</i>

53
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:00,376
Yeah? Well,
then you both have bad taste.

54
00:02:01,446 --> 00:02:03,436
You know,you can't
say that you weren't warned.

55
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:04,706
Alex has always been alex.

56
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:06,356
You dodged a bullet,izz.

57
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:07,986
You're better off without him.

58
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:09,956
Why are you even surprised?

59
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:12,866
You sleep with a snake, you get bit.

60
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:15,406
Thanks,guys,

61
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,116
for the support.

62
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:18,846
Who's on call tonight?

63
00:02:18,986 --> 00:02:20,216
I am.
All right,

64
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:23,096
the rest of you go home,sleep.

65
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,146
All five quints are still alive.

66
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:26,086
It's a good day.

67
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:28,926
<i>As surgeons,
we ignore our own needs</i>

68
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:31,336
<i>so we can meet
our patients' needs.</i>

69
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:34,176
<i>We ignore our friends
and families</i>

70
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:37,086
<i>so we can save other people's
friends and families.</i>

71
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:39,596
<i>Which means that,
at the end of the day,</i>

72
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:42,406
<i>all we really have
is ourselves...</i>

73
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:49,286
<i>and nothing in this world
can make you feel more alone than that.</i>

74
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:56,886
i made breakfast.

75
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:59,196
Li don't have time for breakfast.

76
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:01,016
I have to round
before everyone else does

77
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:04,026
if i want to get the good cases.
You know that.

78
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:06,406
Right.

79
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:10,606
Well,coffee?

80
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,836
Bye.

81
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:28,516
So i was thinking we,
i mean,

82
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,796
me and you could maybe,
uh,joe's

83
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:32,086
later to talk by ourselves.

84
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:34,066
why should i be the one to move?

85
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:35,916
because you live in a glorified campground.

86
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:38,826
It's 40 acres of some of
the most beautiful land in seattle.

87
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:41,636
I did not give up a central
park brownstone to come live in the forest.

88
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:43,266
Addi, Our house in the hamptons had trees.

89
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:45,406
You didn't mind those trees, did you?
They were the hamptons.

90
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:47,176
Why are you pointing at me like that?

91
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:50,066
I'm sorry. What were you saying?
Uh,nothing.

92
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:53,646
Ugh. Does anybody
have any decent food?

93
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:55,036
You really should eat breakfast.

94
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:56,876
God,you sound like burke.

95
00:03:57,016 --> 00:03:59,326
You know,sometimes i think
we'd be better off with dogs.

96
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:00,366
Thanks.

97
00:04:00,496 --> 00:04:02,506
Preachin' to the choir.
I'm over men.

98
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:04,216
Real nice.

99
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:09,256
a dog is not a replacement
for a human being.

100
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:12,336
You guys better wake her.
If bailey catches her sleeping, she's dead.

101
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:15,496
Izzie. Izzie.

102
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,506
What?

103
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:21,576
Hell hath no fury like a girl
whose non-boyfriend screws a nurse.

104
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:23,336
Bitch.

105
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:26,516
I like you better pissed off.

106
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:29,146
You're almost
like a normal person now.

107
00:04:30,606 --> 00:04:31,986
Okay,what do we got?

108
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:33,716
Uh,karl murphy,52

109
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,076
Multiple skin melanomas.
Underwent reconstructive surgery to his nose

110
00:04:35,246 --> 00:04:36,956
his right ear, as well
as a skin graft of the left index finger.

111
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:39,126
how's the capillary refill?

112
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:40,466
It's slow. About four seconds.

113
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:42,626
What do you recommend to get
that blood moving again,dr. O'malley?

114
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:45,316
At this stage,our best option
is probably a biotherapeutic agent.

115
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:52,326
Wh-what is that?

116
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:54,856
We put leeches on your face.

117
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:57,576
Leeches? Huh,you don't say?

118
00:04:57,706 --> 00:04:59,356
They secrete blood thinners that help

119
00:04:59,486 --> 00:05:01,676
break up pooled blood
so it can be evacuated.

120
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:04,176
It's sort of like a big drain.

121
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:05,626
Look,if this makes you uncomfortable...

122
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:08,576
no,no,no. I've been a hiker for 40 years.

123
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:10,136
Almost 40 years,yeah.

124
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,376
And mother nature hasn't come up with
anything yet i haven't found a reason to love.

125
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,536
You a big outdoorsman?

126
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:19,216
How do you think i got all
these melanomas in the first place?

127
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,856
Oh,dr. Shepherd, you're in early.

128
00:05:22,986 --> 00:05:25,296
If you'd like us to come back...
No,go ahead.

129
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:26,676
robert martin,45.

130
00:05:26,796 --> 00:05:29,776
Collapsed and hit his head,
which caused a small subdural hemorrhage.

131
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,616
That was the problem.

132
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:35,926
Mr. Martin was found to have
a rathke's cleft cyst on his pituitary,

133
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:40,016
and surgery was postponed when...

134
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:41,946
when i told a nurse...
Oivia.

135
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:45,976
When i told a nurse to administer
an incorrect dosage of hypertonic saline.

136
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:47,706
Essentially dehydrating mr. Martin's brain.

137
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:50,266
He still has a chance.
He could wake up and be fine.

138
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:53,886
There's a chance.
I know i screwed up. Just...

139
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:56,696
put me back on this case,please.
There's not much of a case left here,dr. Karev.

140
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:58,376
You saw to that. You want back on this?

141
00:05:58,516 --> 00:06:01,036
Be my guest.

142
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:20,276
oh,good. bvHere you are.

143
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:22,086
Mom and dad are anxious for an update.

144
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,356
Dr. Yang?

145
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:26,946
we've done the initial surgery
on julie's omphalocele.

146
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,756
A primary closure was attempted,

147
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:30,496
but there was pulmonary compromise,

148
00:06:30,626 --> 00:06:31,616
so we couldn't contin...

149
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:35,056
yang, how about we do this in plain english?

150
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:39,396
Oh,um,we operated on julie's
external sack of organs,

151
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:41,986
and we pushed in as much
of the bowel as we could, and

152
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:45,246
we think we can push in the
rest with a second operation.

153
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:47,126
She has to have a second operation?

154
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:48,866
Yeah.

155
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,086
Oh,well, not for a few days.

156
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:52,826
dr. O'malley?

157
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:54,906
We put in lucy's brain shunt yesterday,
and she's doing very well.

158
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:57,826
We just have to keep monitoring
her to make sure that

159
00:06:57,956 --> 00:06:59,646
the spinal fluid doesn't back up.

160
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:01,926
Stevens?
Dr. Burke used a catheter

161
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:04,776
to open emily's atrial septum last night.

162
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,006
Today we're gonna go in and try to
reconstruct the left chamber of her heart.

163
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:10,336
We're very hopeful.
Dr. Grey?

164
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:13,516
Charlotte's lungs were a little more
underdeveloped than the rest of the quints

165
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:16,556
So we put a special mask
on her to help her breathe

166
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:18,666
and we're monitoring her closely.

167
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,326
And that just leaves kate.

168
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:21,856
She seems to be pretty healthy.

169
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:23,416
No major issues have been identified.

170
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:26,566
But we're gonna keep her in the
isolette until she makes it to 4 pounds.

171
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,256
You hear that,honey?
Kate's doing really well.

172
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:32,816
I'll be in my room.

173
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,306
Dr. Shepherd...

174
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:38,706
tom,she's just had five babies.

175
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:40,596
Her hormones are all over the place.

176
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:43,596
You've just got to give her
some time. She'll come around.

177
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,936
Grey,keep an eye on
the mother of the quints.

178
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,976
Make sure her hormones
don't get the best of her.

179
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:51,036
I can look out for dorie.

180
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:53,606
No,you have emily's
heart surgery with dr. Burke.

181
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:55,286
But i have a relationship
with the mother.

182
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:57,126
Why are you arguing with me?
Because i don't understand why

183
00:07:57,246 --> 00:08:00,536
i'm being pushed off of a case...
hey,stevens,i don't know what you're so angry about,

184
00:08:00,726 --> 00:08:02,876
but i don't care,and you
better keep it to yourself.

185
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:04,686
On top of every other patient
we have under our care,

186
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:07,256
we have quints
to worry about, understood?

187
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,756
Look,these are preemies, people.

188
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,356
They were supposed to have spent
another eight weeks in the womb.

189
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:14,336
Just like interns,
they're not ready for the real world.

190
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:17,716
Oh,it's the pit. Yang,
come with me.

191
00:08:19,406 --> 00:08:21,356
Constance ferguson,40,

192
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:25,066
inmate at henderson, swallowed
a razor blade. Attempted suicide?

193
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:28,356
Attempted field trip. Worked,too.

194
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:34,306
What do you mean,"field trip"?
She was in solitary

195
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:35,486
This is her way out.

196
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:36,506
So is she crazy?

197
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:39,066
Only if you'd call a murderer crazy.

198
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:41,666
Yeah,baby. That's what i'm tain' about. Whoo!

199
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:53,876
ms. Ferguson,are you
experiencing any discomfort?

200
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:56,206
You mean apart from
these snazzy handcuffs

201
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:57,596
you've got pinching my wrists?

202
00:08:57,736 --> 00:08:59,906
Did you at least put tape on the blade?

203
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:02,936
I'm not an idiot.
You swallowed a razor blade.

204
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,466
So you're not gonna tell me what hurts?

205
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:06,196
What,and shorten my vacation?

206
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:07,886
Hey,since you're just standing around,

207
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:09,376
why don't you get me some chocolate pudding?

208
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:11,626
Make thelade go down smoother.

209
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,586
Yang,get an x-ray. Make it portable.

210
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,966
With prisoners,we have
to minimize flight risk.

211
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,216
Okay,okay,but i'm supposed
to check on julie.

212
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:20,196
I thought you said we're supposed
to keep a close eye on the quints.

213
00:09:20,346 --> 00:09:22,156
Julie's my quint,too. I got that covered.

214
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:23,396
You do this.

215
00:09:23,516 --> 00:09:24,626
Are you sure you can't do it?

216
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:27,866
I can. I choose not to.

217
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:30,356
Come on,baby.

218
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:32,276
I'm not gonna hurt you.

219
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,786
I only murdered three people,

220
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:36,716
and none of them were doctors.

221
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:40,106
Olivia.
Dr. O'malley.

222
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:41,876
How are the leeches doing?
They're not.

223
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,226
I still can't get them to bite.

224
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:45,826
With all this blood,you'd think
it'd be a no-brainer for a leech.

225
00:09:45,956 --> 00:09:48,196
sometimes they get a
little anxious... bright lights,

226
00:09:48,306 --> 00:09:50,096
thunder storms,you know...
ohh!

227
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,736
Nervous handlers.

228
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:54,286
I'm sorry. I should be better at this.

229
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:56,546
I still get a little
squeamish around leeches.

230
00:09:56,686 --> 00:09:58,996
Oh,that is not what i have heard.

231
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:03,456
Dr. O'malley can take over from here.

232
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:08,556
Whoa,whoa. What
was that all about?

233
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:10,636
Nothing.

234
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:17,986
There we are.

235
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:19,846
He's in.

236
00:10:33,946 --> 00:10:36,746
I had no idea that you
and alex were a couple.

237
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,576
It's just...

238
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:40,336
i was having a bad day,

239
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:43,796
and it was good to have someone.

240
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:47,286
Good to talk to,i mean. Not good to...

241
00:10:47,956 --> 00:10:51,366
alex really is good.

242
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:55,626
I mean,he's good in the
way he's a good person good.

243
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:57,616
Not the other kind of good.

244
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:00,876
You know, good in bed good.

245
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:05,356
Which,he is, as i'm sure you know.

246
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:07,006
But...

247
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:11,226
okay,well... bye.

248
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:21,246
Any temperature spikes?

249
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:22,956
No,no fever. Vitals are stable.

250
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:26,596
Good. That's very good.
Go ahead. After you. Thank you.

251
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:33,536
So you're giving up the trailer?

252
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,226
I'm not giving up the trailer.

253
00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:37,766
Is addison telling people
that i'm giving up the trailer?

254
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:41,396
It's just funny. I ju would
never have pegged you for that guy.

255
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:42,076
What guy?

256
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:46,386
You know, the marble bath,
private pool,gated-community guy.

257
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:48,526
Don't peg me. I'm not peggable.

258
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:50,896
You're pegged. Deal with it.

259
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:53,406
B.p. 's low. She's tachycardic

260
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:54,476
sats?

261
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:56,946
Dropping on high-flow 02.

262
00:12:01,226 --> 00:12:02,796
No breathing sounds on the right side.

263
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:04,706
Her lung has collapsed.
Should i call the other dr. Shepherd?

264
00:12:04,846 --> 00:12:06,896
There's no time. Here,stick
this between her second and third rib.

265
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:08,286
Do not go too deep.

266
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:11,216
You're gonna hear a small gush of air.

267
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,356
I heard it.

268
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:28,286
Nice job. Thank you.

269
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,406
I'm not giving up the trailer.

270
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:33,166
Whatever you say, dr. Shepherd.

271
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:37,686
Her lung collapsed?
And i know it sounds scary,

272
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:41,406
but it's reay not that
uncommon in a preemie this size.

273
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:44,276
So we've inserted a
tube into charlot's chest,

274
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,726
and that will help her breathe

275
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,776
until her lung can stay up on its own.

276
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:51,376
Mrs. Russell?

277
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:54,966
She really is doing fine now.

278
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:57,496
That's me. I gotta go.

279
00:12:57,626 --> 00:13:00,416
My mom can only handle
the triplets for half a day.

280
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:02,776
She's 74,so...

281
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:08,486
i'll call you as soon as i get home,okay?

282
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:10,546
I love you.

283
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:19,686
Could you,uh...
i'll keep an eye on her.

284
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:22,156
Thank you.
Okay.

285
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:27,586
Dorie.

286
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:30,636
This isn't your fault.

287
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:33,966
You can't blame yourself for this.

288
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:38,866
I've got one baby who can barely
breathe and one with half a heart

289
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,226
Two of the others are...

290
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:48,526
if i'd have listened to the doctors,

291
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:51,026
i could've had three
healthy girls instead of five

292
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,176
who might not live until tomorrow.

293
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:55,236
It was my decision.

294
00:13:56,256 --> 00:13:57,906
Tom agreed with the doctors.

295
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:01,596
So really,dr. Grey...

296
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:07,176
who else should i blame?

297
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:10,026
First step in the norwood
is the cardiopulmonary bypass.

298
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:12,126
With h. I.h. s.,
what else do you get besis

299
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:13,906
hyperplasia of the ventricle?

300
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:16,886
Stenosis or atresia of
the mitral and aortic valves.

301
00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:19,166
Why are we using the rv-pa conduit

302
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,316
instead of the modified
blalock-taussig shunt?

303
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:24,106
It limits diastolic runoff.

304
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:26,416
Well,you've done your homework.

305
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,046
I was on call last night.

306
00:14:28,176 --> 00:14:30,276
I study when i'm on call.

307
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:34,246
well,no matter what the books say,

308
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:36,116
i guarantee you

309
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:38,546
you have never seen a heart this small.

310
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:45,006
Betcha i have.

311
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:46,586
How you doing,you?

312
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:48,956
You know, i'm having a baby,too.

313
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,106
Yes,i am. A little boy.

314
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:54,276
Maybe you can meet him someday.

315
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,906
How's that sound? Does that sound good?

316
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:58,596
We could...

317
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:05,426
pregnancy has not made me soft.

318
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:08,676
I haven't gone soft. I don't do soft.

319
00:15:09,036 --> 00:15:10,146
Of course not.

320
00:15:10,296 --> 00:15:12,316
You were just talking to a patient.

321
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:14,636
What's this?
The inmate's x-rays.

322
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:18,706
that foolish,foolish woman.

323
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,676
She swallowed four razor blades?

324
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:23,856
Mm-hmm.

325
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:28,776
Hey! Hey you!

326
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:30,866
Hey,nurse!

327
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:33,206
Would you keep it down, please?

328
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:34,326
I'm starving.

329
00:15:34,486 --> 00:15:36,816
You're n. p. o. No food allowed.

330
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:38,626
Come on,april,baby, don't go for him.

331
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,426
He's such an idiot.

332
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:44,626
I didn't come here to starve to death.

333
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:46,786
I want mint chocolate chip ice cream.

334
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:48,516
Mint,okay? Not rocky road.

335
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:51,296
You tter not get me that rocky road. It sucks.

336
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:52,436
Oh,thank god.

337
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:54,856
Mama bear,help me out here, okay?
I'm starving.

338
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:56,376
Don't give her anything.

339
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:59,586
See,right there you're in official
violation of the eighth amendment.

340
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,996
You can't eat anything because
you're about to undergo major surgery.

341
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:05,196
What? What's she talkin' about?

342
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:07,056
You're at risk for a perforated intestine

343
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:08,906
and half a dozen kinds of infection.

344
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:11,046
We need to operate right away.

345
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:12,126
I don't need an operation.

346
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:15,306
I taped up the blade like i always do.
It passes the next day.

347
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:16,146
What's the big deal?

348
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:20,066
You swallowed four blades this time.
That's the big deal.

349
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:23,566
I thought it would buy me an extra day.

350
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:28,016
Does this operation have a nice,
long recovery time?

351
00:16:28,156 --> 00:16:29,836
you realize this is major surgery?

352
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:31,736
It's dangerous and you could die.

353
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,236
Mint chocolate chip.

354
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:38,586
I want at least a gallon

355
00:16:38,716 --> 00:16:41,836
after you ghouls are
done splitting me open.

356
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,716
what exactly is it that we're doing?

357
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:49,226
We're visiting.

358
00:16:49,356 --> 00:16:51,696
We've thrown all this medical talk at you

359
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:53,956
and outlined all these worst-case scenarios,

360
00:16:54,086 --> 00:16:56,456
which has probably
scared you half to death

361
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:58,016
The one thing we haven't done

362
00:16:58,176 --> 00:17:01,266
is actually given you a
chance to be with your daughters.

363
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,076
Well,how is that gonna help?

364
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:05,016
If i learned anything
in these past few days,

365
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:07,616
it's that i need to face reality.

366
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,656
Here's kate.

367
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:13,896
You can reach in
and touch her if you like.

368
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:20,216
I would like to very much.

369
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:24,776
dr. Grey, charlotte's
not breathing.

370
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:31,996
Page addison shepherd. She's in the o. r.

371
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:34,396
we didn't see this on the echo.

372
00:17:34,546 --> 00:17:36,936
You can never get
an exact measurement.

373
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:38,386
What?

374
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:42,516
The baby's aorta
is narrower than we thought.

375
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:44,476
The diameter is only a millimeter.

376
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:46,646
Just not getting enough blood flow.

377
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,416
Damn.

378
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:54,316
I wanted you to see this
before i started closing up.

379
00:17:54,426 --> 00:17:56,346
You're closing up?
You didn't do anything. Dr. Stevens.

380
00:17:56,496 --> 00:17:59,306
No,we barely started.
Dr. Burke has done as much as he can do for now

381
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:02,026
so unless you know how
to do a first stage norwood,

382
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:04,376
he's gonna close this baby's chest.

383
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:13,136
You okay?

384
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:15,906
I'm fine. May i go?

385
00:18:17,116 --> 00:18:18,516
Yes.

386
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:22,326
What happened?

387
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:23,766
She had an apneic episode.

388
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:26,726
She's still not
breathing on her own.

389
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:30,006
let's intubate
and give her surfactant.

390
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:33,836
Push. 1 atropine
and 3 milligrams of ketamine.

391
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:35,156
Meds are in.

392
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:37,286
Tube.

393
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:42,776
Okay. Place the c02 detector.

394
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:44,536
She was doing fine with the chest tube.

395
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,476
That's the thing with r. d. s. Cases.

396
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,366
Just when you think
the baby's getting better,

397
00:18:48,516 --> 00:18:51,186
they can slip right back.

398
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:52,706
Breath sounds equal.

399
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:54,966
Good.

400
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,216
Mrs. Russell.

401
00:19:04,956 --> 00:19:06,176
Unbelievable.

402
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:07,616
Who would do this to themselves?

403
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:10,166
The woman wasn't just in prison,yang,

404
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,406
she was in solitary.

405
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:15,626
Well,she was seriously deranged.

406
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:17,906
You try spending a month

407
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,736
locked in a room with no windows,

408
00:19:19,886 --> 00:19:22,486
no one to talk to

409
00:19:22,636 --> 00:19:23,986
23 hours a day,

410
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:26,096
see how deranged she is then.

411
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:27,586
Dr. Bailey, she's a murderer.

412
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:29,736
I didn't say she wasn't.

413
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:31,126
One,two,three...

414
00:19:31,276 --> 00:19:34,656
i said try having no one
to make your snarky comments to

415
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:36,326
for a solid month.

416
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:37,936
My guess

417
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,736
is you'd swallow the entire razor.

418
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,476
How are they treating you, Mr. Murphy?

419
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,276
Oh,i've done worse for company.

420
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,176
Oh,they're definitely filling up.

421
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:51,196
The tissue is getting nice and pink.

422
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,006
You make up with that cute
little girlfriend of yours yet?

423
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:56,576
Olivia's hardly my girlfriend.

424
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:00,306
Is she okay?

425
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:01,906
She?

426
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:04,146
Yeah. Isabella.

427
00:20:04,576 --> 00:20:07,056
And this one here on my finger...

428
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,746
that's darcy.

429
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:10,556
And that little guy on my nose...

430
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,706
named o'malley.

431
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:14,716
That's right. I named hiafter you.

432
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,786
You're the one that got him to bite.

433
00:20:17,196 --> 00:20:19,126
Isabella's fine. She's just full.

434
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:20,586
Oh. Oh.

435
00:20:20,706 --> 00:20:22,586
Wwait,what are you gonna do with her?

436
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:23,726
She's done her job.

437
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:25,626
We don't really have any more use for her

438
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,046
except as medical waste.

439
00:20:27,196 --> 00:20:30,446
No. I'd like to keep her,

440
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,136
if i could.

441
00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:34,826
crazy nature man.

442
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:36,946
You wanna take a leech home as a pet?

443
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:38,476
That's fine with me.

444
00:20:38,616 --> 00:20:40,306
You had no right to speak to me
that way in front of a patient.

445
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:42,826
Yeah? Well, you hurt my friend.

446
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,756
I had no idea alex was seeing izzie.

447
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:46,826
That's not what you're upset about.

448
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:48,506
You have no idea why i'm upset.

449
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:51,076
Besides,you know what
i don't understand is,uh,

450
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:54,866
why alex, and why again?

451
00:20:56,036 --> 00:20:58,946
People get lonely,george.

452
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:04,716
Hi,mr. Russell. It's meredith grey calling.

453
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:07,026
I was wondering
if there was any chance

454
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,166
maybe you could bring
your boys by to visit their mom.

455
00:21:10,326 --> 00:21:13,116
I think she could use the company.

456
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:14,836
Oh,the flu.

457
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:17,296
No,definitely don't bringhem.

458
00:21:17,436 --> 00:21:19,706
Thank you. You too.

459
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:27,376
you've been lying low.

460
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:28,656
Well,nobody's talking to me

461
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:31,076
so it makes it kind of easy,right?

462
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:35,326
I'm talking to you...

463
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:37,366
in short, monosyllabic sentences

464
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,616
laced with disdain and contempt.

465
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:42,466
So,what, according to girl rules,
now you all have to hate me?

466
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:43,816
I don't hate you.

467
00:21:43,956 --> 00:21:44,946
If my mother hadn't gotten alzheimer's,

468
00:21:45,076 --> 00:21:46,626
i'd probably be you.

469
00:21:46,766 --> 00:21:49,146
Oh,really?
Really.

470
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:51,436
Before she got sick, i mean,i...

471
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,696
i mean,i finished college,but

472
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:55,746
i was partying way too much,

473
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:58,096
staying out way too late to keep a job.

474
00:21:58,236 --> 00:21:59,676
I was the one at family reunions

475
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:01,596
everybody was embarrassed to talk about.

476
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:04,486
So that's what you think of me?

477
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:08,336
Are you okay?
I almost killed a guy yesterday.

478
00:22:09,186 --> 00:22:11,166
Mr. Martin.

479
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:13,116
So i'm just trying to
find anything i can to help him.

480
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:15,336
Okay,well, what are we looking for?

481
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:19,826
Uh,anything on central
pontine myelinolysis.

482
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:29,926
unbelievable.

483
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:32,616
Izzie.

484
00:22:35,466 --> 00:22:36,356
Izzie,come on.

485
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:37,766
Come on? Come on?

486
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:40,536
You're fraternizin with the enemy,
and you're telling me to come on.

487
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:42,306
Alex and i are sort of friends.

488
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:43,346
Since when?

489
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:45,076
Since when are you and alex friends?

490
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:47,806
You tell me to cut my losses,
that i'm better off without him,

491
00:22:47,936 --> 00:22:49,446
and as soon as i turn my back...

492
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,776
izzie,you're making way
too big a deal outta this.

493
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,506
Right,of course,because
i'm the unreasonable one.

494
00:22:53,636 --> 00:22:55,376
You know what,meredith?
Do whatever you want.

495
00:22:55,496 --> 00:22:56,806
Sleep with the guy for all i care.

496
00:22:56,956 --> 00:22:58,816
Well,obviously i'm not
going to sleep with him,izzie.

497
00:22:58,956 --> 00:23:01,626
Why not? You've slept with everyone else.

498
00:23:08,746 --> 00:23:10,686
You'll have some abdominal
pain for a day or two...

499
00:23:10,826 --> 00:23:12,136
just a day or two?

500
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,406
We'll watch you until your
bowels start moving again.

501
00:23:14,546 --> 00:23:15,836
The average is about 36 hours.

502
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:17,516
36?

503
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:20,136
4 razor blades, and
that's all you can give me?

504
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,886
Come on,sugar plum.
I thought we were having fun.

505
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:24,046
Don't leave.

506
00:23:24,176 --> 00:23:25,776
What?

507
00:23:25,886 --> 00:23:27,786
Just maybe a little conversation.

508
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,046
I mean,they got me
in here all by myself.

509
00:23:29,186 --> 00:23:32,096
I thought i'd have a roommate,
somebody to talk to.

510
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:34,216
Okay.

511
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:38,076
Why'd you kill three people?

512
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,126
Start off a little small talk,
why don't you?

513
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:43,906
I was high...

514
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:47,356
on meth.

515
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:54,116
And i had this boyfriend who...

516
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:57,906
had this robbery all planned out.

517
00:23:58,056 --> 00:24:02,256
He said that he would
leave me if i didn't help him.

518
00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:05,936
Things got out of control.

519
00:24:07,076 --> 00:24:09,676
He was gonna leave me.

520
00:24:10,176 --> 00:24:12,396
He... he was all i had.

521
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:15,686
I would've been all alone.

522
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:20,516
Clearly,being alone has its benefits.

523
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:31,886
You paged me?

524
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:33,286
Another leech fell off,

525
00:24:33,426 --> 00:24:34,456
and i can't get the new one to bite.

526
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:36,266
I'm sorry. They just really freak me out.

527
00:24:36,386 --> 00:24:37,536
I'm a surgeon,olivia.

528
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,876
You're an intern,george.

529
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:43,116
You know what time it is?

530
00:24:44,156 --> 00:24:45,756
Time for you two kids
to kiss and make up,

531
00:24:45,896 --> 00:24:47,536
that's what time it is.

532
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:49,766
Mr. Murphy, we are not a couple.

533
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,846
Oh,you can't pull much over on me.

534
00:24:52,046 --> 00:24:54,776
Now i say there's something
between the two of you.

535
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,736
You're right,mr. Murphy. There was.

536
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:00,486
Olivia,this isn't the time. And this..

537
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:02,626
really isn't the place.
He broke up with me for this girl

538
00:25:02,776 --> 00:25:03,986
who doesn't even know that he's alive.

539
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:05,576
She does so know i'm alive.
Listen to me,george.

540
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:07,276
You,meredith grey... never gonna happen.

541
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:09,926
What? Why... why would
you even think it's meredith?

542
00:25:10,046 --> 00:25:11,416
Anyone who's paying the
slightest bit of attention

543
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:12,926
knows how you feel about meredith,

544
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:15,876
except meredith, which should
tell you something,shouldn't it?

545
00:25:16,026 --> 00:25:18,606
Sorry,mr. Murphy.

546
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:23,596
She gave me syphilis.

547
00:25:23,726 --> 00:25:25,486
Remember what you did to me

548
00:25:25,646 --> 00:25:27,236
when i was an intern?

549
00:25:27,386 --> 00:25:28,876
How could i forget?

550
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:31,446
You didn't speak
to me for almost a year.

551
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:34,056
But you learned.

552
00:25:34,226 --> 00:25:37,266
Yeah,well,i think
i gotta do that to izzie stevens.

553
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:40,296
Well,she's smart, hardworking.

554
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,866
Gets a little too
involved with her patients.

555
00:25:43,006 --> 00:25:43,926
A lot like you.

556
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:45,546
I know.

557
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:48,316
It took me a long time
to recover from that,richard.

558
00:25:48,456 --> 00:25:51,216
But it made you a
better surgeon,addison.

559
00:25:51,786 --> 00:25:52,856
The question is,

560
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:55,506
is she talented enough
to make the lesson worth it?

561
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:58,146
She's the best i've seen in years.

562
00:25:58,276 --> 00:26:01,196
I was hoping that we could...
you're not here to make friends,addison.

563
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:03,006
You're here to make better surgeons,

564
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:06,706
and being a teacher
can be a lonely business.

565
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:13,376
I'm telling you, meredith was all over him.

566
00:26:13,516 --> 00:26:15,646
Seriously? She was all over him?

567
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:18,516
What,like,uh,mounting him with
all the babies watching? Seriously?

568
00:26:18,636 --> 00:26:20,646
Well,she would've been if i hadn't interrupted.

569
00:26:20,726 --> 00:26:22,106
She was talking to him.
You don't talk to bastards

570
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,246
who cheat on their girlfriends,
george. That's the rule.

571
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:25,826
You weren't officially his girlfriend.

572
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:27,496
That's not the point.
It is kind of the point.

573
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:29,836
You don't see me getting I
emotional over people i'm not dating.

574
00:26:29,976 --> 00:26:33,736
Really? You wanna go there?

575
00:26:35,466 --> 00:26:37,726
No.
I'm having a moment here.

576
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:39,536
Don't mess with me.

577
00:26:39,836 --> 00:26:42,686
You're not gonna have a nervous
breakdown or kill yourself, are you?

578
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,746
No.

579
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:48,076
So there's no chance you'll kill us?

580
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:53,366
Oh,that was wrong on so many levels.

581
00:26:54,476 --> 00:26:55,496
So good.
That was...

582
00:26:55,626 --> 00:26:57,246
that was good.

583
00:26:57,386 --> 00:26:58,206
Yeah,it was good.

584
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:03,096
Your lungs are not good.

585
00:27:06,006 --> 00:27:08,246
I know we got you out
of there a little earlier

586
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:10,196
than you would've wanted.

587
00:27:10,246 --> 00:27:12,356
We have to find something to help you.

588
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:15,486
So if you have any ideas,charlotte...

589
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,076
dr. Stevens.

590
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:30,896
Dr. Shepherd, is there something you need?

591
00:27:31,106 --> 00:27:32,636
Yes,dr. Burke and i have reassessed.

592
00:27:32,766 --> 00:27:34,366
We think there's a
chance with the norwood

593
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,056
if emily can make it
through the next ten hours.

594
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:38,586
Would you look
after her for the night?

595
00:27:38,706 --> 00:27:41,076
I s on call last night.

596
00:27:41,546 --> 00:27:43,006
But,i mean,yeah, of course.

597
00:27:43,126 --> 00:27:44,716
Good. I've left a list of meds,

598
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:47,906
and you're familiar with
pediatric life support?

599
00:27:48,026 --> 00:27:49,966
Got myself certified
as soon as i got in the program.

600
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:51,066
Okay then.

601
00:27:51,206 --> 00:27:53,516
Is there anything else
i should know to look out for?

602
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:55,386
No. That should do it.

603
00:27:55,516 --> 00:27:57,886
Should i notify mrs. Russell about emily's...
No.

604
00:27:58,016 --> 00:27:59,836
I've done that.

605
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:02,846
Dr. Stevens,this baby
is your responsibility.

606
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:05,386
She better be alive when
i get back in the morning.

607
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:07,506
Okay.

608
00:28:10,496 --> 00:28:11,956
Dr. Shepherd, i found these studies

609
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:13,886
where they used aggressive plasmapheresis.

610
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:15,506
I think these could work on mr. Martin.

611
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,266
Those are all isolated cases.

612
00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:19,456
But still,the studies resulted
in improved clinical symptoms.

613
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:22,066
No trial study's ever been done.
There is nothing you can do.

614
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:24,046
Okay,what about thyrotropin releasing hormone?
No,no.

615
00:28:24,186 --> 00:28:27,556
There's european studies...
karev,it's over. It's done. You screwed up.

616
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:29,886
Mr. Martin's fried.
You fried his brain.

617
00:28:30,026 --> 00:28:31,356
If he wakes up,
you put him in a wheelchair.

618
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:34,076
If he dies, you killed him.

619
00:28:34,216 --> 00:28:37,396
Deal with it.

620
00:28:43,946 --> 00:28:47,626
dr. Stevens,baby's v02 is
still 40% after transfusion.

621
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:48,606
How's her b. p. Doing?

622
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:50,996
Still low. Last systolic was 52.

623
00:28:51,126 --> 00:28:54,426
Okay,i'm gonna push 30 cc's of n. s. Manually.

624
00:28:59,016 --> 00:29:02,076
Nice start. Pressure's 65.

625
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:11,496
hey,izz.

626
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:15,106
Okay,really? You
think i'm talking to you?

627
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:17,886
Well,i just wanted to say i'm sorry.

628
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:20,606
What are you sorry for?

629
00:29:22,116 --> 00:29:24,286
When derek broke up with you,
i never once said,"

630
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:26,206
you're better off without him. "

631
00:29:26,246 --> 00:29:28,726
It's not supportive. It's condescending.

632
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:30,256
I was there.

633
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:32,156
All i ever am is there for you guys,

634
00:29:32,286 --> 00:29:34,666
and the one time i need you...

635
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:38,816
just... go away,meredith.

636
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:47,786
what the hell happened?
She was fine. She just started seizing.

637
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:53,056
She's not seizing, she's choking.

638
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:09,576
she swallowed a lightbulb.

639
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:16,276
We're losing her.
I can see that.

640
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:18,516
Don't you think i can see that?

641
00:30:25,846 --> 00:30:27,906
She needs an airway.

642
00:30:32,906 --> 00:30:34,836
Oh,she's clamped down. I can't intubate.

643
00:30:34,956 --> 00:30:35,906
We need some help in here.

644
00:30:36,036 --> 00:30:37,756
You want me to get paralytic
to relax the muscles?

645
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:39,306
Uh,no. She'll be dead by then.

646
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:41,146
Li need a scalpel for a crich.

647
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:42,746
ave you done one?
Of course not.

648
00:30:42,886 --> 00:30:44,656
Go.

649
00:30:47,426 --> 00:30:48,976
I was gonna do a crich.

650
00:30:49,096 --> 00:30:50,076
How long has she been unconscious?

651
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:51,376
She just went down.

652
00:30:51,526 --> 00:30:53,536
Prep o. r. 2. Emergency thoracotomy.
Right away

653
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:55,016
Cristina,it'll be okay.

654
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,976
Come on. Come on. Come on.

655
00:30:59,046 --> 00:31:01,146
She's coding.
Again?

656
00:31:01,356 --> 00:31:04,416
Okay,uh, turn up the epi drip.

657
00:31:07,526 --> 00:31:09,426
Okay.

658
00:31:16,786 --> 00:31:19,326
Okay.

659
00:31:19,456 --> 00:31:21,406
Okay.

660
00:31:25,626 --> 00:31:27,086
Hi,dorie.

661
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:29,436
What are you doing?
I'm packg.

662
00:31:29,576 --> 00:31:32,026
Dorie,you've just had major abdominal surgery.

663
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:34,846
You're not in any condl...
i'm going home,dr. Grey

664
00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:36,556
i need to go home.

665
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,486
I can't be here. I can't watch them die.

666
00:31:41,096 --> 00:31:42,656
They're not dying.

667
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,496
They're trying to live.

668
00:31:44,606 --> 00:31:46,886
And you leaving them isn't going to help them.

669
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,366
I have three boys who need me.

670
00:31:48,436 --> 00:31:49,526
Your daughters need you.

671
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:53,436
Don't you understand that i can't do it?

672
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:55,746
I can't do it.

673
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:57,526
They're too sick. They're too hurt.

674
00:31:57,646 --> 00:31:59,026
Which is why they need their mother.

675
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:01,936
If emily dies,I...
if emily dies,

676
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:06,056
it will be horrible.

677
00:32:06,286 --> 00:32:09,626
But if emily dies, and you're not here...

678
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:11,376
i can't even hold them.

679
00:32:11,526 --> 00:32:12,906
But you can sit with them

680
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:14,246
and talk to them

681
00:32:14,356 --> 00:32:16,206
and let them know they're not alone in this world.

682
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:18,246
That's all they need.

683
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:21,256
That's all anybody...

684
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:23,966
what?

685
00:32:24,086 --> 00:32:26,786
I think i know how to help charlotte.

686
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:35,596
I don't know why i didn't think of this sooner.

687
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:36,566
What are you doing?

688
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:37,886
It's called cobedding.

689
00:32:37,996 --> 00:32:39,896
Hospitals sometimes do it with twins

690
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:42,286
when one of them is sick.

691
00:32:42,436 --> 00:32:44,876
And the other one gets... better?

692
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,166
It helps.
How?

693
00:32:47,306 --> 00:32:49,146
We don't really know.

694
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:51,716
Sometimes babies get
stressed in the i. c. u. S

695
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:54,576
from all the activity.

696
00:32:54,696 --> 00:32:58,136
This way,there's someone
there to comfort them,

697
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,966
to be there with them.

698
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:10,306
That's excellent blood
flow at all three places.

699
00:33:10,436 --> 00:33:11,726
You're healing very nicely.

700
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:13,176
And i like my new nose.

701
00:33:13,306 --> 00:33:14,716
Well,i'm sure your wife
will like it,too.

702
00:33:14,856 --> 00:33:18,036
I'm not so sure what she'll say
about your new houseguests.

703
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:22,386
Oh,i'm gonna let these guys go
in the lake near my favorite hiking trail.

704
00:33:22,526 --> 00:33:23,416
Saved my face.

705
00:33:23,556 --> 00:33:24,606
Least i can do for 'em.

706
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,236
And i don't have a wife.

707
00:33:26,386 --> 00:33:28,426
Oh,i'm sorry. I thought your wedding ring...

708
00:33:28,566 --> 00:33:31,606
no,i'm divorced. Just never took it off.

709
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,536
By the way,uh...

710
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:38,446
sorry you had to see that little scene earlier.

711
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,446
Oh,you mean talking with the
girl who isn't your girlfriend

712
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,496
about the girl who you'd
like to be your girlfriend.

713
00:33:43,616 --> 00:33:47,086
Yeah. She shouldn't have said that stuff.

714
00:33:47,246 --> 00:33:48,556
It's just... she was...

715
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:50,736
very unprofessional.

716
00:33:50,956 --> 00:33:55,016
Yeah,but is it true?

717
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:57,896
Do you like this meredith person?

718
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,866
I don't think that's
really any of your business.

719
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:04,596
She's okay.

720
00:34:06,406 --> 00:34:08,506
I like her okay.

721
00:34:11,836 --> 00:34:13,836
All right,i love her.

722
00:34:14,296 --> 00:34:16,436
Oh,come on. Don't be embarrassed.

723
00:34:16,566 --> 00:34:18,676
I loved my wife.

724
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:21,166
But sometimes,no matter
how much you love someone,

725
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:24,946
they just can't love you back in the same way.

726
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:28,726
Believe me,son.

727
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,806
Living with a woman who
can't love you back...

728
00:34:31,956 --> 00:34:34,356
way lonelier than being alone.

729
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:36,036
what do you want to do?

730
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:38,356
We can... we can put her on ecmo.

731
00:34:38,496 --> 00:34:40,706
Baby this size,you're risking
intracranial hemorrhage.

732
00:34:40,836 --> 00:34:43,326
Um,she's already coded three times.

733
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,156
You paged dr. Shepherd?

734
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:46,396
She called to say you have
to handle this for yourself.

735
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:48,711
What? I'm an intern. What is she...

736
00:34:48,746 --> 00:34:50,426
dr. Stevens?
Just give me a second.

737
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:51,686
You don't have a second.

738
00:34:51,816 --> 00:34:53,796
Okay,ecmo is too dangerous.

739
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,206
We're just gonna have
to keep her going on epi.

740
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,106
Too much epi, it'll stop her circulation.

741
00:34:57,236 --> 00:34:58,786
There's no point in
keeping her heart rate up

742
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:00,656
if she doesn't have functioning arms
or legs in the morning.

743
00:35:00,691 --> 00:35:02,836
I know that.

744
00:35:04,566 --> 00:35:06,236
I'm sorry.

745
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:07,186
It's...

746
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:08,996
we're just gonna have
to keep pushing epi.

747
00:35:09,126 --> 00:35:10,096
It's our best option.

748
00:35:10,236 --> 00:35:12,396
We'll just have
to find a middle ground

749
00:35:15,216 --> 00:35:17,816
you can do this.

750
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:35,306
i can't believe you would
consider moving out of your trailer.

751
00:35:35,446 --> 00:35:37,466
The view alone...

752
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:39,336
See the mist rise off the lake.

753
00:35:39,466 --> 00:35:40,666
Yeah.

754
00:35:40,796 --> 00:35:42,576
Yeah.

755
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:46,316
I'm not moving.

756
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:53,016
you're still you?

757
00:35:53,136 --> 00:35:55,096
I'm still me.

758
00:35:55,896 --> 00:35:58,626
Good.

759
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:13,676
where's emily?

760
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:14,706
They took her away.

761
00:36:14,846 --> 00:36:16,116
Where? Why didn't you wake me?

762
00:36:16,226 --> 00:36:17,876
Dr. Shepherd told us not to.

763
00:36:18,006 --> 00:36:19,286
What?

764
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:22,156
Where is the baby?

765
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:25,156
Dr. Stevens,she died half an hour ago.

766
00:36:48,786 --> 00:36:50,936
It wasn't your fault.

767
00:36:51,946 --> 00:36:54,126
You put me icharge. I fell asleep.

768
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:55,626
I killed that by.

769
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:57,286
No,you didn't.

770
00:36:57,396 --> 00:36:59,236
She was gonna die anyway.

771
00:36:59,396 --> 00:37:00,986
She had a restricted atrial septum

772
00:37:01,116 --> 00:37:02,836
and virtually no aorta.

773
00:37:02,956 --> 00:37:04,556
As soon as dr. Burke opened up her chest,

774
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:08,196
we knew she didn't have a chance.

775
00:37:10,736 --> 00:37:12,216
I don't get it.

776
00:37:12,726 --> 00:37:15,506
You ordered me to stay
the night... Take care of her.

777
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:17,386
I worked my ass off

778
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,506
doing c. p. r. And
pumping her fulL of every

779
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:21,646
drug on the planet, and,

780
00:37:21,786 --> 00:37:24,376
i mean,god,do you have any idea
how scared i was? It was all for nothing?

781
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:26,646
Hardly. If the situation ever comes up again,

782
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:27,966
i know you'll be able to handle the pressure.

783
00:37:28,096 --> 00:37:28,866
You lied to me.

784
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:31,456
You have to learn distance, stevens.

785
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:34,366
You'll be a better doctor for it.

786
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:39,286
A better... a better doctor?

787
00:37:53,746 --> 00:37:55,606
I heard you worked a miracle last night.

788
00:37:55,796 --> 00:37:57,646
She came around so fast,

789
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,096
i thought the equipment was malfunctioning.

790
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:02,096
Her sats are completely stable

791
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:04,356
She's gonna make it.

792
00:38:05,276 --> 00:38:06,606
Go home,grey.

793
00:38:06,746 --> 00:38:08,516
You've earned it.

794
00:38:08,646 --> 00:38:10,226
And,grey...

795
00:38:10,926 --> 00:38:13,216
way to go.

796
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:19,396
Did you hear that? "Way to go. "

797
00:38:33,126 --> 00:38:35,756
My baby died.
We know.

798
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:40,286
She just...

799
00:38:40,406 --> 00:38:43,556
...died.

800
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:51,956
I have an idea.

801
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:18,806
the first person i killed...

802
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:21,596
i was a second-year resident.

803
00:39:21,786 --> 00:39:24,366
James hanson.

804
00:39:27,226 --> 00:39:30,786
You should go home,alex.
There's nothing you can do here.

805
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:37,406
nobody should die alone.

806
00:39:38,536 --> 00:39:41,576
<i>400 years ago,
another well-known english guy</i>

807
00:39:41,686 --> 00:39:44,486
<i>had an opinion about being alone...</i>

808
00:39:44,626 --> 00:39:46,306
<i>john donne.</i>

809
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:49,496
<i>He thought we were never alone.</i>

810
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:51,926
<i>Of course,it was fancier
when he said it.</i>

811
00:39:52,076 --> 00:39:54,336
Don't... don't try and talk.

812
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,966
Your windpipe was perforated.

813
00:39:56,086 --> 00:39:57,296
Dr. Burke repaired it,

814
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,526
and you should be fine.

815
00:40:03,796 --> 00:40:06,846
we'll keep you here at
least ten days for observation

816
00:40:06,986 --> 00:40:09,926
and make sure there's no infection.

817
00:40:15,226 --> 00:40:16,606
Maybe just to be on the safe side,

818
00:40:16,726 --> 00:40:19,776
we'll make it two weeks.

819
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:23,556
<i>no man is an island</i>

820
00:40:23,686 --> 00:40:27,086
<i>entire unto himself.</i>

821
00:40:35,606 --> 00:40:36,956
oh.

822
00:40:37,026 --> 00:40:38,156
That's him.

823
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:40,786
Yeah. That's him.

824
00:40:49,426 --> 00:40:51,836
i'm lonely,derek.

825
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,876
<i>Boil down that island talk,
and he just meant</i>

826
00:40:58,016 --> 00:41:02,626
<i>that all anyone needs
is someone to step in...</i>

827
00:41:28,956 --> 00:41:32,796
<i>and let us know
we're not alone.</i>

828
00:41:37,076 --> 00:41:39,246
Good boy,doc.

829
00:41:40,256 --> 00:41:41,326
<i>And who's to say</i>

830
00:41:41,456 --> 00:41:45,836
<i>that someone can't have four legs?</i>

831
00:41:46,216 --> 00:41:49,456
<i>someone to play with
or run around with...</i>

832
00:41:57,366 --> 00:42:03,476
<i>or just hang out.</i>
