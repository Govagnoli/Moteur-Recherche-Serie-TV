1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,183
<i>Previously on Grey's Anatomy...</i>

2
00:00:01,208 --> 00:00:02,880
You people are taking a test

3
00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:05,542
that will determine the course
of your entire medical careers.

4
00:00:05,602 --> 00:00:07,119
- You want big wedding?
- Yes.

5
00:00:07,138 --> 00:00:09,403
I know you think I have
feelings for you, but I don't.

6
00:00:09,544 --> 00:00:11,803
Search and rescue
found those lost climbers.

7
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,399
- One's still missing.
- Tell me the truth.

8
00:00:13,418 --> 00:00:15,300
Do you remember?
Do you know who you are?

9
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:17,572
He's making his recommendation
to the board tomorrow

10
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,742
for chief of surgery
and chief resident.

11
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:22,118
- You're adopting?
- She hasn't actually picked us yet.

12
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,545
This heartburn, it's like it...

13
00:00:24,974 --> 00:00:27,595
- Fourth climber.
- Is that an ax in his head?

14
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:30,738
If Richard finds out that
you're carrying another man's baby...

15
00:00:30,757 --> 00:00:31,801
Somebody help!

16
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:38,749
<i>Being chief
is about responsibility.</i>

17
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:43,370
Every single surgical patient
in the hospital is your patient,

18
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,158
whether you're the one
who cut them open or not.

19
00:00:46,543 --> 00:00:49,115
Come on. She's lost a lot of blood.
<i>The scalpel stops with you.</i>

20
00:00:49,154 --> 00:00:52,771
Start 2 large bore I.V's
and bolus 2 liters L.R.

21
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,588
You need to be able
to look at a family...

22
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:56,391
Ready? One, two...

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,758
And tell them your team
did everything they could

24
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:00,035
to save someone's child...

25
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,278
Get me a stat E.K.G.
And a portable chest, Brooke.

26
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:05,035
- She's 34 weeks pregnant with twins.
- Their husband...

27
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:07,054
You guys, why don't you go have
a seat in the waiting room?

28
00:01:07,063 --> 00:01:08,087
We're not leaving her.

29
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:11,355
Their wife.

30
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:13,542
What happened?

31
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:15,537
I don't know.
I found her unconscious.

32
00:01:15,623 --> 00:01:16,678
You get caught up...

33
00:01:18,498 --> 00:01:20,124
Taking care
of other people' families.

34
00:01:20,152 --> 00:01:22,658
She's lost blood,
a-a lot of blood.

35
00:01:22,774 --> 00:01:26,015
And the responsibility,
it makes you...

36
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,552
I didn't know
she was in the hospital.

37
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:28,799
What was she doing here?

38
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:32,113
You take care
of other people's families...

39
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:37,181
<i>And you sacrifice your own.</i>

40
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:41,096
I thought I was gonna hate this party
game thing, but it's kinda great.

41
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,181
Can we set her on fire after?

42
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:44,562
No, we cannot.

43
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:46,862
Okay, these wedding vows
are not all gonna fit on here.

44
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:49,102
- Okay, then write smaller.
- Be still, please.

45
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:52,022
- "vow" just became "cow."
- You don't need vows on your hand.

46
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,801
When you get up there,
just speak from the heart.

47
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:56,529
Izzie,
the heart is an organ.

48
00:01:57,114 --> 00:02:00,213
It pumps, it circulates blood,
it gets clogged from time to time.

49
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:03,220
It does not, however, speak.
It doesn't have tiny little lips on it.

50
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:05,088
Well, you're all
"glass totally empty."

51
00:02:05,107 --> 00:02:06,943
I'm gonna like being married.

52
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:09,135
It's the wedding part
that's ridiculous.

53
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:13,389
- Party's over.
- Damn.

54
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,780
Hey, mine didn't go off.

55
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,537
Piece of crap.

56
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:20,396
You can do this, right?

57
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:22,801
Become a piece of chattel?
Sure. Looking forward to it.

58
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:24,576
I mean, no matter what,

59
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:26,567
you're walking down
that aisle today.

60
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,913
I need you
to go down that aisle.

61
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:31,399
Is the toilet paper
cutting off your circulation?

62
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:33,239
You marrying Burke,
it's a sign.

63
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:36,376
It's a sign that people
like you and me... can do this.

64
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:38,300
Be healthy, be happy.

65
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,004
You marrying Burke,

66
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,155
restores my faith in me.

67
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:44,560
Oh, I get it.

68
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:46,131
My wedding's about you.

69
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:47,287
- Yes.
- Okay.

70
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:48,934
You can do this, right?

71
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:50,295
I can do this.

72
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:55,711
Hey. They found
the fourth climber.

73
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:58,069
Vitals are stabilizing
after fluids, but...

74
00:02:58,105 --> 00:02:59,787
- Thought he was dead.
- He was according to his friends.

75
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:02,508
- Did the C.T. show a bleed?
- Uh, we haven't done a C.T. Yet.

76
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:03,942
I don't understand.
You said there's a head trauma.

77
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:06,140
Yeah, there's been
a little head trauma.

78
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:07,780
Ice ax to the head.

79
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,859
What the hell happened
up on that mountain?

80
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,154
That's a good question.

81
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:20,718
You don't think it could be
uterine cancer, do you?

82
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:22,575
It runs in the family.

83
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:23,730
No, it's not...

84
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:27,378
She was in earlier.
She was in a fender bender.

85
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:32,003
My wife came into my hospital,
and you neglected to tell me?

86
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:33,618
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

87
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:36,539
We're still married.
She's unconscious.

88
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,652
There are medical decisions
to be made.

89
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:41,192
Legally I have a right to know.
I have a right...

90
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:42,289
She might...

91
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:44,844
be having a miscarriage.

92
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:47,639
She's pregnant.

93
00:03:52,537 --> 00:03:54,644
I need to know what time
your chest pain started.

94
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:55,919
I don't know.

95
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,309
Yesterday afternoon.

96
00:03:57,686 --> 00:03:59,883
What time exactly?
This is important.

97
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:02,525
Around 3:00.

98
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:05,573
What's wrong with me?

99
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:08,318
I'm gonna explain everything
to you. I promise.

100
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:11,107
But right now we need to get you
up to the surgical floor.

101
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:13,248
Surgery? But...

102
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,236
What about my babies?

103
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,025
I think those babies
are coming out today.

104
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:20,815
But I-I haven't decided.
I...

105
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,011
I haven't chosen the parents.
I need time to decide.

106
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:29,451
You don't need to decide
anything right now.

107
00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:31,829
Right now
the most important thing

108
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:33,426
is making sure
that you are okay.

109
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:35,621
All right?

110
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:41,734
Ah, I've got a surgery,

111
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,467
but it shouldn't be more
than four hours, five tops.

112
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,176
- I can scrub in.
- How's Rina?

113
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:47,719
I need to get a C.T. angio,

114
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:49,630
but I'm pretty sure
it's a tear in her aorta.

115
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:50,984
Her heart is about to blow.

116
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:53,519
Most dissecting aortas
burst within 48 hours.

117
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:55,314
Which means we have
less than 12 hours

118
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,840
- to fix it before she's dead.
- So you need me to get the babies out.

119
00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:00,221
- So I can save her life.
- You have an aortic dissection?

120
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,826
Hey, I promise I will make it
to the chapel in time.

121
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:06,766
I...

122
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:08,882
Okay.

123
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:11,898
Listen up. Uh, O'Malley,
you're with Shepherd and Sloan.

124
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,461
Stevens, you're with Burke.
Karev, Addison. Go.

125
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:15,781
Grey...

126
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:18,207
You are with the chief's wife.

127
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:20,167
- The chief's wife?
- Is pregnant.

128
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:21,640
Yes, I did say pregnant.

129
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,598
I recommend that you lose
the shocked look

130
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:26,556
and try for something
a little more dignified.

131
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:27,626
Go.

132
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:29,831
Who am I on?

133
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:31,851
Uh, I didn't page you.
Go home. Get some sleep.

134
00:05:32,647 --> 00:05:34,051
Yeah,
but I'm here already, so...

135
00:05:34,322 --> 00:05:36,656
You're getting married
in less than 12 hours.

136
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,899
Give us room.

137
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:40,215
Well, Burke's getting married, too,

138
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:42,684
- and he gets to operate.
- There's only one preston Burke.

139
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:44,913
There's only one
Cristina Yang.

140
00:05:45,113 --> 00:05:47,657
I've given you the day off,
the whole day.

141
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:49,497
It's a kindness. Take it.
It's your wedding day.

142
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,488
- There'll always be more surgeries.
- But...

143
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,268
Really, what would you
rather be doing,

144
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,080
prepping a patient
or prepping for your wedding?

145
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:56,235
Go home.

146
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:04,550
I never got the sense
you really wanted the job.

147
00:06:05,836 --> 00:06:07,704
Seems to me you got in the race
to play out

148
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:10,465
some kind of unfinished business
you had with Derek.

149
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:14,328
I was in this to win.

150
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:17,823
Sir. I don't know
if he's your new chief,

151
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:20,430
but if he is, he got there
because I made him fight for it.

152
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:22,683
You made them all
fight for it.

153
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:26,765
So I'm not gonna be chief.

154
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:28,795
No, you're not.

155
00:06:30,993 --> 00:06:32,374
They recovered Lonnie's body?

156
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:34,811
Not his body. He's alive.

157
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:39,679
So why don't you tell me what really
happened up there on the mountain?

158
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:49,073
We're half way up this ice wall.

159
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:50,125
There's a...

160
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:53,690
There's a ledge a couple
of huned feet above us.

161
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,253
We figured
we'd set up the tents,

162
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,075
wait out the storm.

163
00:06:58,198 --> 00:07:00,677
Only Lonnie's insisting
we go down the mountain.

164
00:07:01,574 --> 00:07:02,864
I told him,
we gotta dig in,

165
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:04,619
sit tight.

166
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:05,718
He started freaking out,

167
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,167
keeps saying
down's the way to go.

168
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,018
And then, he starts climbing down.

169
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:10,552
We were tied together.

170
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,316
- And just like that...
- We're falling.

171
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:14,874
I swing out with my ice ax,

172
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:17,024
just trying to catch a rock.

173
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,087
And I clip Lonnie
in the back of the head.

174
00:07:22,105 --> 00:07:23,128
Ax just...

175
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:24,608
snags.

176
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:27,897
We thought he was dead.

177
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:32,693
It was an accident.

178
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:40,576
What happened?

179
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:42,962
You've been unconscious
for a while.

180
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:47,142
- What about...
- He knows.

181
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:49,428
Adele, you lost a lot of blood.

182
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:50,805
I'm gonna try to find
a heartbeat.

183
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,127
You should prepare yourself.

184
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:03,427
Heartbeat.

185
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:07,099
It's a little slower,
than I'd like,

186
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:10,498
but once we tank you
with liquids and a transfusion,

187
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:12,956
it might get stronger.

188
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:14,981
Um, I've gotta rush off
to surgery,

189
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:16,910
but I will back with you
the minute I'm done.

190
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,490
- Thank you.
- Okay.

191
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,841
Adele, why didn't you tell me?

192
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:28,639
Come on, Richard.

193
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:31,424
What do you think
you would've done,

194
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:33,424
congratulate me?

195
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,992
I'm sure you have work to do.

196
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:48,314
I'm good right here.

197
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,330
The peds resident's on call.

198
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:51,893
He'll be in the O.R.
For Rina's delivery.

199
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,757
Great. Just make sure
they notified the nicu.

200
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Hi. Sorry for interrupting.

201
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,691
Uh, the nurse said that
you're Dr. Montgomery.

202
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:01,222
Yes.
Can I help you with something?

203
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:02,556
Yeah, I'm Jeff Pope...

204
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:05,016
Rebecca's husband?

205
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:32,036
Rebecca?

206
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:48,597
Hi, Jeff.

207
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:52,316
You, uh...

208
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:55,495
Your face...

209
00:09:58,611 --> 00:09:59,662
But it's you.

210
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,262
I'm so sorry, baby.

211
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:14,028
I should've never let you go.

212
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,366
I'll never let you go again.

213
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:22,987
- I have a surgery.
- I heard you're the best man.

214
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,737
Well, maid of honor,
best man, kinda perfect.

215
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:31,336
I know I haven't been myself lately,
but I'm me again,

216
00:10:31,353 --> 00:10:32,978
so I was thinking maybe
you should sleep over,

217
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:35,547
because the me that I am
is horny for the you that you are.

218
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:36,901
I met a woman last night.

219
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:41,007
- You met a woman last night?
- At Joe's.

220
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:42,676
Nothing happened.

221
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:45,300
She was pretty,
I noticed, and we talked.

222
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:47,897
- You met a woman last night?
- Yeah.

223
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,001
So should I be
worried or something?

224
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:52,292
Should you be worried
that I met a woman? No.

225
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:54,501
Should you be worried that,

226
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,534
for me, flirting with that woman
was the highlight of my week?

227
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:00,572
Yeah, you should be
worried or something.

228
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,249
I don't understand.

229
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,868
- It's not you.
- No, I understand that part.

230
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:08,436
What I don't understand is why.

231
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:11,634
I need this job, Richard.
I need it more than the others.

232
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:14,488
- Addison...
- No, I need a reason to stay here.

233
00:11:14,638 --> 00:11:17,126
I need a reason to get up in the morning
I need to wake up...

234
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:20,040
and not care that it's raining
or that I'm 39 and alone.

235
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:22,681
I need the job, Richard.

236
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:24,521
That's why.

237
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,440
If you need a job
to give you a life,

238
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,966
you either need a new job
or a new life.

239
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:43,270
I'm thinking four hours tops
to repair this heart,

240
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:44,814
if all goes well.

241
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:46,763
You're a lucky man, Burke.

242
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:48,678
Cristina's great.

243
00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:50,080
She's there, she's sure.

244
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:52,118
She's willing to commit.

245
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,373
You're a lucky man.

246
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:56,550
And you're not?

247
00:11:58,842 --> 00:11:59,968
There he is.

248
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:01,752
T-minus five hours.

249
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:03,751
And how's the best man?
Up to the challenge?

250
00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:05,780
I was an excellent best man.

251
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:09,660
The worst case scenario is I sleep
with your wife in ten years.

252
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:19,573
I just checked. Chief resident
hasn't been posted yet.

253
00:12:19,597 --> 00:12:21,886
- I wasn't looking for chief resident.
- Yeah, you were.

254
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:23,601
Yeah. Okay, I was.

255
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:33,566
What I'm about to say is,
uh, is crazy.

256
00:12:33,914 --> 00:12:36,195
And, uh, I-I am not responsible.

257
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:38,123
I-I am saying this
against my will.

258
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:39,585
Because I am a surgeon, okay?

259
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,248
I-I love my job. I love
my life exactly as it is.

260
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:44,232
Okay? Exactly as it is.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

261
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:45,253
Not really.

262
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:47,450
I-I have no desire
to house a human being

263
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,830
in my body for nine long months
and then... and then...

264
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:51,342
And then push it out
and raise it.

265
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:53,351
- Okay? None. Zero.
- Okay.

266
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:55,021
Except housing a human,

267
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,763
for nine long months
is all that I can think about.

268
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,507
It... It...
The thoughts are invading

269
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:02,240
the surgeries that I love,
and it's...

270
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:04,024
It's... It's hormonal.

271
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:05,964
It's... And horrible.

272
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:08,875
But it is happening...

273
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:10,900
To me.

274
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,241
You want to have a baby?

275
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:16,564
Apparently.

276
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:19,490
There's a guy with an ax
in his head.

277
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:21,007
Right. So go.

278
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:24,424
I'm a freak.
Just go. Just run. Just...

279
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:25,683
- Thank you.
- Please.

280
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:28,374
Go. I'm fine.

281
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,451
Take your pill...
and drink your water.

282
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:34,848
Richard, you know
you wanna go out that door

283
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,688
and start bossing
some people around.

284
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:38,322
Take your pill, Adele.

285
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:43,486
See?

286
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,787
I can do my bossing
right from this chair.

287
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:54,710
Go ahead, Richard, ask.

288
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:58,029
I know you are dying to know
whose baby...

289
00:13:58,095 --> 00:13:59,381
Not really my place.

290
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:02,681
Mrs. Webber...

291
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:04,376
Your room is ready.

292
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:06,977
Excuse me,
but what do you want to do

293
00:14:06,987 --> 00:14:08,959
about the announcement
for chief of surgery?

294
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,348
Look...

295
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:13,559
I will be right back.

296
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:15,986
I promise.

297
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:21,852
We've met before.

298
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,406
You probably don't remember.

299
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:25,938
You were little.

300
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:31,353
My husband always flirted
with your mother.

301
00:14:34,142 --> 00:14:36,846
I didn't want to see that, so...

302
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,894
I watched you a lot,

303
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:40,903
watched you grow up.

304
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:42,758
You turned out well.

305
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:45,058
I'm sorry about your mother.

306
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:47,078
I'm...

307
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:49,141
sorry about my mother, too.

308
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:52,405
It wasn't your fault.

309
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:54,605
Maybe it wasn't anyone's fault.

310
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,339
You get married at 25
thinking, this is it,

311
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:00,310
happily ever after.

312
00:15:01,406 --> 00:15:03,744
Maybe there is
no happily ever after.

313
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:08,316
It's stunning.

314
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:10,174
It's a little...

315
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:12,022
Um, is it supposed to be so tight?

316
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:13,887
Well, it's a choker.

317
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:16,395
It's beautiful.

318
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:19,499
It's really, really beautiful.

319
00:15:20,982 --> 00:15:22,569
I just don't know if it's me.

320
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:25,790
Five generations of Burke women

321
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,368
have worn this
on their wedding day.

322
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,423
It's a way of...

323
00:15:30,342 --> 00:15:32,784
joing our family,
becoming a Burke.

324
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:34,492
A Burke.

325
00:15:36,138 --> 00:15:38,711
I'm afraid
I misjudged you early on.

326
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,988
I thought you were selfish.

327
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,387
But you've given way

328
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,259
to Preston's ideas
about the wedding,

329
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:46,572
and you've been flexible
about the things that are...

330
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:49,673
most important to him.

331
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:51,780
And that is wonderful.

332
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:54,338
Oh! It's just...

333
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:58,862
What were you planning to do
about your eyebrows?

334
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,178
Nothing.

335
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,504
How's she doing?

336
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:09,874
B.P.'s 92 over 56.

337
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:11,791
How'd the reunion go

338
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,634
- with Jane Doe's husband?
- Whatever.

339
00:16:13,768 --> 00:16:15,543
He cried like a baby.
She looked bored.

340
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,258
Don't go overboard
with compassion, Karev.

341
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:20,504
She's not even sure
if she wants to stay with the guy.

342
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:23,164
- It's complicated.
- It's not actually... complicated.

343
00:16:24,164 --> 00:16:25,685
They're married.
She took a vow.

344
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:27,861
You don't mess with vows.
Married is married.

345
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:30,070
Game over.
So freakin' over.

346
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:34,331
Just an opinion.

347
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:36,143
Pressure's dropped to 60.

348
00:16:36,158 --> 00:16:37,848
She's bleeding out.
Addison, how much longer?

349
00:16:37,857 --> 00:16:38,994
Rupturing the membrane now.

350
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:40,632
I just need 2 minutes
to get these babies out.

351
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:43,439
Make it one. She's flatlined.
Stevens, start compressions.

352
00:16:44,243 --> 00:16:45,465
Got the first one out.
Clamp.

353
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:46,912
Come on, come on.

354
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:49,168
Second baby's out.
Okay, go.

355
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:50,219
Boki, 10-blade.

356
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,981
Poor guy...
he just wanted to climb a mountain,

357
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:00,188
and he ends up
with an ax in his head.

358
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:01,899
He shouldn't have tried turning back.

359
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:04,082
The group is going up,
you move with the group.

360
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,763
- Okay, drill, please.
- He panicked.

361
00:17:05,772 --> 00:17:07,699
You have a right to turn back
if you're scared.

362
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:09,699
No, you don't.
You chose to climb a mountain.

363
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,915
You can't change your mind
in the middle of the climb.

364
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,000
Okay.
Now we pull it out?

365
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,991
Ah, yeah, but the ax went in
as they fell,

366
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,710
so there will be some tearing,

367
00:17:23,883 --> 00:17:25,188
it should be a shallow wound,

368
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,001
and it should come out easily.

369
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:28,085
You got it?

370
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:32,247
All right, everybody.
Here we go. Ready?

371
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:35,327
Okay, one, two...

372
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:36,984
three.

373
00:17:42,122 --> 00:17:43,305
That's strange.

374
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:45,442
One...

375
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,193
two...

376
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:49,491
Three!

377
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:56,356
That's a clean cut.

378
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,186
Thought you said
there was gonna be tearing.

379
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:00,159
I know.
It doesn't make sense.

380
00:18:02,272 --> 00:18:03,671
You are a lucky guy.

381
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:07,286
Or the ax didn't go in there
by accident.

382
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:11,657
It's probably unfair,

383
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,122
but I hold you
to a higher standard.

384
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:17,528
And you let me down
this year, Preston.

385
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,637
After you got shot,
the tremor...

386
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:24,624
This job is about making
the tough calls.

387
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:28,062
Sometime the toughest call
you can make

388
00:18:28,084 --> 00:18:30,018
is admitting
when you're in over your head.

389
00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:31,755
You don't do that.

390
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:34,623
You know a lot, Preston.

391
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:38,158
You're one of the best surgeons
I know...

392
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:40,386
One of the best men.

393
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,806
But you're not perfect.

394
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:47,569
You don't know everything.

395
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:54,354
I want to give you the job.

396
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:58,018
I want to.

397
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:02,143
But I can't.

398
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:09,215
Preston.

399
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:11,612
I have a wedding to get to.

400
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,159
Thank you.

401
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,908
Yeah. The babies are doing great.

402
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:20,101
They're in the nicu.

403
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:21,810
How are you doing up there,
Preston?

404
00:19:21,998 --> 00:19:23,622
Close call, but she's stabilized.

405
00:19:23,651 --> 00:19:24,984
Good work, Dr. Burke.

406
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,283
We may actually get you
to the church on time.

407
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:28,828
You nervous?

408
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:31,486
No, not really.
More, uh...

409
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:33,610
excited.

410
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:37,003
Um, except by my vows.

411
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:39,181
I wrote them myself, and...

412
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:42,121
I don't know.
They may be too...

413
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,559
- I want 'em to be right.
- Well, let's hear 'em.

414
00:19:46,949 --> 00:19:48,874
- What, now?
- You've got a room full of women.

415
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:50,086
Try it out on us.

416
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,770
Cristina...

417
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:04,437
I could promise...

418
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:08,417
to hold you...

419
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:11,230
and to cherish you.

420
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:15,553
I could promise to be there
in sickness and in health.

421
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:18,076
I could say...

422
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:21,037
till death do us part.

423
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:23,479
But I won't.

424
00:20:24,711 --> 00:20:25,937
Those vows...

425
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:29,621
are for optimistic couples,

426
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:31,610
the ones full of hope.

427
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:34,754
And I do not stand here
on my wedding day,

428
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:36,828
opmistic...

429
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:38,490
or full of hope.

430
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,308
Okay, um...

431
00:20:41,978 --> 00:20:43,875
I am not optimistic.

432
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:45,868
I am not hopeful.

433
00:20:47,268 --> 00:20:48,291
I am sure.

434
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:51,759
I am steady.

435
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:54,476
And I know.

436
00:20:56,899 --> 00:20:58,091
I am a heart man.

437
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,055
I take 'em apart.

438
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,295
I put 'em back together.

439
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:07,186
I hold them in my hands.

440
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:10,722
I am a heart man.

441
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,921
So of this I am sure...

442
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,455
You are my partner...

443
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:21,843
My lover...

444
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:24,150
My very best friend.

445
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:28,323
My heart...
My heart... beats for you.

446
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:30,772
And on this day,

447
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:32,955
the day of our wedding,

448
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,067
I promise you this...

449
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:37,635
I promise you...

450
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:40,573
to lay my heart
in the palm of your hands.

451
00:21:44,043 --> 00:21:46,128
I promise you... Me.

452
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:57,304
Too trite?
Because I can rewrite it...

453
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
No.

454
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:00,675
No. It's...

455
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:03,725
I think I speak for...

456
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:07,497
every woman in this room

457
00:22:07,863 --> 00:22:09,708
when I say dump her.

458
00:22:09,837 --> 00:22:11,414
Dump Yang and marry me.

459
00:22:24,948 --> 00:22:26,997
Hey. Oh, god.
Did I miss a page?

460
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:28,934
No, no, no, no, no.
Everything's okay.

461
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:33,975
What?

462
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:35,666
Is this really what you want?

463
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,543
'Cause if it's really
what you want, we could do it.

464
00:22:45,785 --> 00:22:46,903
- Really?
- Yeah.

465
00:22:49,804 --> 00:22:50,978
Okay, wait. Really?

466
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:52,275
Really.

467
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:55,008
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

468
00:22:55,062 --> 00:22:56,282
- Really.
- Really.

469
00:23:07,128 --> 00:23:08,327
She looks like Rebecca.

470
00:23:08,728 --> 00:23:10,712
Well, at least what
Rebecca used to look like.

471
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:12,975
But still...

472
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:15,503
around the eyes.

473
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,908
Yeah.

474
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,605
I thought
I'd give her some space.

475
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:20,801
She seemed a little overwhelmed.

476
00:23:27,552 --> 00:23:29,496
The ferry crash
was on the news everywhere.

477
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,086
Your wife goes missing...

478
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:33,730
How could you
not look for her?

479
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:37,718
I thought she left me.

480
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:42,284
We got into a fight that night.

481
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,075
She was trying to tell me
how unhappy she was and...

482
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:46,837
I shut her down.

483
00:23:49,605 --> 00:23:51,877
Yeah, I didn't look for her
when she was missing,

484
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:53,145
but what's worse is...

485
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:56,289
I didn't see her
when she was there.

486
00:23:58,033 --> 00:23:59,038
I can't imagine

487
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:00,681
what it must have
been like for her,

488
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,724
what her face must have
looked like all broken.

489
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:05,290
She was beautiful.

490
00:24:14,098 --> 00:24:15,769
I... I love her.

491
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,368
You know?

492
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:36,543
Meredith.

493
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,691
You are not gonna believe...

494
00:24:39,907 --> 00:24:41,503
Derek met a girl...

495
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:43,322
In a bar.

496
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:46,030
And he flirted with her.
And he told me.

497
00:24:46,293 --> 00:24:48,342
You know, no big deal.
Just thought I should know.

498
00:24:48,481 --> 00:24:50,387
- Meredith.
- I'm not exaggerating.

499
00:24:50,644 --> 00:24:52,860
He didn't even hint.
He just flat out told me.

500
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:54,682
Meredith, you know how
sometimes it's about you,

501
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,949
and sometimes it's about me?

502
00:24:56,137 --> 00:24:59,132
This is really,
really about me.

503
00:25:01,754 --> 00:25:03,228
Mama took my eyebrows.

504
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:05,274
She took my eyebrows,

505
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,059
and now I am a Burke.

506
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:13,727
Lonnie's stable...

507
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:17,581
But the damage he sustained
is significant.

508
00:25:18,323 --> 00:25:19,741
But is he gonna wake up?

509
00:25:20,627 --> 00:25:22,383
- Do you want him to?
- What?

510
00:25:22,924 --> 00:25:25,591
The ax in his head
was put there deliberately.

511
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:29,543
I just wanted to give you three guys
another oportunity to tell me the truth.

512
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,552
- It wasn't...
- Shut up, Andy.

513
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,040
- But we can't just sit here...
- I said shut up, Andy.

514
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,268
Is that how you let him
talk to you at 14,000 feet?

515
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:44,451
I have to talk to his family.

516
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:46,048
You guys can talk to the cops.

517
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:57,100
Dr. Bailey.

518
00:25:57,527 --> 00:25:58,616
Yeah. What?

519
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,560
Cristina needs to cut something.

520
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:03,983
I can't really explain it

521
00:26:04,077 --> 00:26:05,608
in a way
that won't make you glare.

522
00:26:06,568 --> 00:26:08,605
But... they took her eyebrows

523
00:26:08,897 --> 00:26:10,197
and they called her a Burke.

524
00:26:10,324 --> 00:26:12,474
She really needs
to cut somebody open.

525
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:13,935
Yang...

526
00:26:15,061 --> 00:26:18,282
Go... do...
getting married things.

527
00:26:19,154 --> 00:26:20,497
Get out of this hospital.

528
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:22,273
Hey!

529
00:26:24,636 --> 00:26:26,451
I mean... hey.

530
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:28,421
I...

531
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:31,537
You have to let me cut,

532
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:35,705
because I am standing here
eyebrowless with no dignity left.

533
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:37,665
I am a surgeon, Dr. Bailey.

534
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:39,335
But right now
I don't feel like one.

535
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:40,546
I feel...

536
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:42,706
like...

537
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:45,226
somebody else.

538
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,676
Do you know what that's like,

539
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:50,126
not to feel like yourself?

540
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:57,117
Yeah.

541
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:00,442
- Oh!
- What's going on?

542
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:03,017
She started cramping and then
she got really diaphoretic.

543
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:05,862
Alert O.B. to a possible D&C,

544
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:07,674
due to an incomplete miscarriage.

545
00:27:08,147 --> 00:27:09,809
Adele, you could have

546
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,786
a placental abruption
due to the trauma.

547
00:27:11,926 --> 00:27:13,702
We've got to get you
to into an O.R. Now.

548
00:27:13,975 --> 00:27:15,411
Let's move, people!

549
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:23,902
Sir, Dr. Shepherd is here.

550
00:27:26,273 --> 00:27:27,381
Thank you.

551
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:31,939
Richard, are you sure
you want to...

552
00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:34,498
You don't have to do this today.

553
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:39,435
Yes, I do.

554
00:27:45,646 --> 00:27:47,336
She went into early D.I.C.

555
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,149
I gave her blood,
platelets, F.F.P,

556
00:27:51,454 --> 00:27:53,553
pregnancy at 52 is dangerous.

557
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:56,614
I tried everything.
I couldn't save...

558
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,130
I thought...

559
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:19,893
I thought...

560
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:22,685
For a second,
I thought I'd lost you.

561
00:28:28,717 --> 00:28:29,797
Do you want to...

562
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,272
call somebody? I can...

563
00:28:32,554 --> 00:28:33,681
No, no one.

564
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:36,966
Well, the father of the baby,
maybe you want to...

565
00:28:37,492 --> 00:28:39,849
He doesn't even know about it.
I didn't tell him.

566
00:28:40,793 --> 00:28:41,826
I, um...

567
00:28:42,004 --> 00:28:43,751
I think I misjudged him.

568
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:47,653
I thought he'd go running
for the hills.

569
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:49,615
But actually...

570
00:28:51,624 --> 00:28:53,802
He's a much better man
than I thought.

571
00:28:55,395 --> 00:28:58,466
He'll get over his initial judgments,
and he'll...

572
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:00,347
sit with you...

573
00:29:02,814 --> 00:29:04,777
And he'll make you drink
your water.

574
00:29:13,556 --> 00:29:14,589
Adele...

575
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,305
It was a boy.

576
00:29:19,336 --> 00:29:20,463
I'm sorry.

577
00:29:29,418 --> 00:29:30,461
All right, Dr. Leonard,

578
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:32,010
would you please close
for Dr. Burke?

579
00:29:32,057 --> 00:29:33,277
He has a wedding to get to.

580
00:29:33,747 --> 00:29:36,319
One cut, and then you're gone.

581
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,398
One.

582
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:38,821
But... But I still have to...

583
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:41,065
Come on. You want your bride
waiting for you at the altar?

584
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:42,492
They don't like that.
Let's go.

585
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,494
We gotta go now, Cristina.

586
00:29:47,613 --> 00:29:49,819
- Grey.
- Put the scalpel down, Cristina.

587
00:29:57,248 --> 00:29:58,666
you can still do this, right?

588
00:30:05,374 --> 00:30:06,379
What?

589
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:08,088
Hold on a minute.

590
00:30:14,577 --> 00:30:17,432
I just wanted to make sure
no one's around so I can say this.

591
00:30:17,488 --> 00:30:19,169
I think we've said everything
we need to say.

592
00:30:19,178 --> 00:30:20,305
Shut up.

593
00:30:20,933 --> 00:30:22,023
I am an optimist.

594
00:30:23,912 --> 00:30:25,293
I am hopeful.

595
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:27,143
I am not sure.

596
00:30:27,171 --> 00:30:29,171
- Look, I can do this myself.
- Let me speak.

597
00:30:33,183 --> 00:30:34,550
Because I'm your best friend,

598
00:30:35,245 --> 00:30:36,390
and because I love you,

599
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:39,860
if what you want
is to be with Callie,

600
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:43,243
then I will do everything
in my power to support you

601
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:46,191
and help you
make your marriage work.

602
00:30:49,045 --> 00:30:50,510
But because
I'm your best friend...

603
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:53,871
and because I love you...

604
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:58,752
I also have to say...

605
00:31:02,104 --> 00:31:03,202
that I'm in love with you.

606
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,686
I'm in love with you.

607
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,488
I can't promise the future,
I can't....

608
00:31:13,966 --> 00:31:17,380
promise perfection because
we're us and I'm me,

609
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,299
and who knows what will happen.

610
00:31:21,758 --> 00:31:23,045
But in my heart...

611
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:25,627
I am sure.

612
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:30,130
I'm in love with you, George.

613
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:32,927
And I hope
you're in love with me, too.

614
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:40,996
Say something.

615
00:31:42,051 --> 00:31:43,892
- What time is it?
- You got 30 minutes.

616
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:45,728
Crap. I'm gonna be late
for my own wedding.

617
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:47,135
No, you're not.

618
00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:50,688
Dr. Burke asked me
to check on you.

619
00:31:51,741 --> 00:31:52,831
Let's see. Your, um...

620
00:31:53,974 --> 00:31:55,476
Your post-op X-rays look good.

621
00:31:55,645 --> 00:31:57,016
We'll discuss releasing you.

622
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,828
- Any change in Lonnie?
- Andy?

623
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,895
Who are you?

624
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,707
He's my lawyer.

625
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:05,415
- That was fast.
- Don't you dare judge me.

626
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:07,923
You weren't there.

627
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:11,088
We thought...
he was almost dead.

628
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:13,154
No way he was gonna make it.

629
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:15,898
He was in so much pain.

630
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:19,984
So I...

631
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,690
picked it up...

632
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:24,149
- Andy, shut up.
- No!

633
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:26,801
I'm not gonna shut up.

634
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,993
I put him out of his misery.

635
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:38,069
And if I was back there
right now...

636
00:32:39,816 --> 00:32:41,149
I'd do the same thing.

637
00:32:42,897 --> 00:32:44,062
He was my friend.

638
00:32:46,001 --> 00:32:47,109
He is my friend.

639
00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:51,316
I put him out of his misery.

640
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,593
Anyone got any deodorant?

641
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,677
Um, you're not putting my
deodorant in your hairy armpits.

642
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:01,076
Don't move.
You're gonna have a unibrow.

643
00:33:01,086 --> 00:33:02,299
And I have some in my locker.

644
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,914
Uh, closed? Open?

645
00:33:05,312 --> 00:33:06,326
Closed.

646
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,814
Perfect. Dashing.

647
00:33:08,876 --> 00:33:10,059
- Thanks.
- You look great.

648
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,327
- Moment of truth, people.
- Those our scores?

649
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,472
Grey.

650
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:15,964
Karev. Yang.

651
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,411
Stevens.

652
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:19,654
- O'Malley.
- Yes!

653
00:33:19,688 --> 00:33:20,805
Right here, baby.

654
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:22,453
Yes. Thank god.

655
00:33:24,388 --> 00:33:27,289
- Did you pass?
- You bet your married booty, I did.

656
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:31,199
- How'd you do? Did you pass?
- Yeah.

657
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:34,079
I'll talk to you
at the church.

658
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:38,419
All right. Let's go.

659
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:40,303
- Excuse me.
- Meredith.

660
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,286
I'll meet you at the chapel.

661
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:43,694
Iz, will you take the dress?

662
00:33:44,237 --> 00:33:45,495
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

663
00:33:53,228 --> 00:33:54,312
I like the suit.

664
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,585
The suit is way better
than the scrubs.

665
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,718
Thanks.
Hey, uh, I passed my intern exam.

666
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:00,866
- Good!
- Yeah.

667
00:34:00,894 --> 00:34:01,955
That's good.

668
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,629
We got discharged,
me and the baby.

669
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:14,042
Oh, come on, you just...
You just had brain surgery.

670
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,365
You're still on antibiotics.

671
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:17,686
My body's been signed off on by...

672
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:20,109
plastics, cardio...

673
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:22,062
orthopedics, neuro and O.B.,
and my...

674
00:34:22,078 --> 00:34:24,454
And also, my teeth
got the blessing from...

675
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:26,821
Wait, I can say this...
Prosthodontics.

676
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:27,965
But there's still your memory...

677
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:29,234
You know how I know
my memory's fine?

678
00:34:29,246 --> 00:34:30,821
Because I can say prosthodontics.

679
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:34,038
- Yeah, but the baby...
- Discharged, by peds.

680
00:34:34,912 --> 00:34:35,954
Yeah, but...

681
00:34:42,568 --> 00:34:43,892
I have every reason to go.

682
00:34:44,512 --> 00:34:46,404
And... And yeah, I'm scared.

683
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:48,715
And yeah, this is...
this is moving at warp speed.

684
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:51,250
And yeah, I'm freaking out,
but Jeff is good.

685
00:34:51,553 --> 00:34:53,309
And... And Jeff is
the father of my child.

686
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:55,911
The man is out buying
a car seat right now.

687
00:34:56,459 --> 00:34:57,830
And the minute he gets back...

688
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:02,329
I-I have every reason to go,

689
00:35:02,845 --> 00:35:04,010
because medically...

690
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,986
there's no need
for me to stay.

691
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:09,650
Medically.

692
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:17,022
Okay. Well, then I'll just
check the chart. And just...

693
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,680
- Damn it.
- We got, uh...

694
00:35:19,515 --> 00:35:21,158
- What?
- Are you...

695
00:35:21,654 --> 00:35:24,345
Do I... Do I have to spell
everything out for you?

696
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:27,471
I mean, did... did you sniff
too much glue as a child?

697
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,041
I'm asking you something here.

698
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:32,046
What do you want from me?

699
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:34,525
I want...

700
00:35:36,278 --> 00:35:38,259
I want you to give me
a reason to stay...

701
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:41,632
A real reason.

702
00:35:43,162 --> 00:35:44,195
I mean, Jeff's...

703
00:35:44,317 --> 00:35:46,833
Jeff's a decent guy,
a good, decent guy.

704
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,425
But to him, I'm Rebecca,

705
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:53,302
and I don't know
if I am Rebecca anymore and...

706
00:35:55,193 --> 00:35:56,311
You know me. You knew--

707
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,423
You knew when I couldn't
even speak who I was.

708
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,620
You...

709
00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:03,446
You named me Ava,
and I was more me...

710
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,409
as Ava...

711
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:07,072
then I'll ever be as Rebecca.

712
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:11,282
Look, I-I have every reason
to go back to my life.

713
00:36:13,276 --> 00:36:14,299
And I will.

714
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:18,217
Unless... you...

715
00:36:21,942 --> 00:36:24,628
Alex, I'm asking you to give me
a reason to stay here...

716
00:36:25,238 --> 00:36:26,769
A reason from you.

717
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:32,390
Jeff loves you. He's a...

718
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,344
He's a decent guy.

719
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:35,827
Alex, give me a reason.

720
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,743
I think you should stay
with the decent guy.

721
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,897
If you want to break up
with me

722
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:07,395
so you can see other women,
just do it.

723
00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:09,391
Don't tell me you met
another woman.

724
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:11,174
Just end it
if that's what you want.

725
00:37:11,471 --> 00:37:13,293
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

726
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,816
Here's how it goes...

727
00:37:15,604 --> 00:37:17,791
Meredith, I don't want
to see you anymore.

728
00:37:18,045 --> 00:37:20,176
Meredith,
I don't love you anymore.

729
00:37:20,195 --> 00:37:21,242
Meredith...

730
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:24,956
I do love you.

731
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:27,464
Don't you see?

732
00:37:28,877 --> 00:37:30,023
Don't you understand?

733
00:37:32,732 --> 00:37:33,905
You're the lover of my life.

734
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:36,340
I can't leave you.

735
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,065
But you're constantly leaving me.

736
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:43,626
You walk away when you want,
you come back when you want.

737
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:45,438
Not everyone,

738
00:37:46,448 --> 00:37:48,720
not your friends,
but you leave me.

739
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:53,781
So I'm asking you...

740
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:57,570
If you don't see a future for us,
if you aren't in this...

741
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,353
Please...

742
00:38:02,554 --> 00:38:03,972
Please just end it,
cause I can't.

743
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,033
I'm in it.

744
00:38:08,178 --> 00:38:09,634
Put me out of my misery.

745
00:38:14,498 --> 00:38:16,714
I... I can't.

746
00:38:16,743 --> 00:38:19,278
I...
Cristina is getting married.

747
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,749
I have to go
make sure she gets married.

748
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:23,819
Meredith...

749
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:26,888
I really need to make sure
she gets down that aisle.

750
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,315
Let's go.
We're running late.

751
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:45,834
You okay?

752
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,853
I'm fine. I'm fine.

753
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:51,121
You need anything?

754
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:53,678
Need a mint, huh?
A getaway car?

755
00:38:55,222 --> 00:38:57,009
If it's the chief thing,
don't worry about it.

756
00:38:57,028 --> 00:38:58,042
You deserve it.

757
00:38:58,098 --> 00:38:59,685
Richard didn't pick me
to be chief.

758
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:03,429
We all assumed you...

759
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:07,214
- Well, who did he pick?
- I don't know. It wasn't me.

760
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:11,533
You really don't...

761
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:13,272
look so good.

762
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,969
Meredith and I
may not make it.

763
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:19,513
I think I want it
more than she does.

764
00:39:20,481 --> 00:39:22,810
But today's your day.
It's all about you today.

765
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:24,999
You really are
a good best man.

766
00:39:26,022 --> 00:39:27,046
I try.

767
00:39:28,381 --> 00:39:29,386
Cristina.

768
00:39:35,342 --> 00:39:36,534
I didn't run.

769
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,606
You look beautiful.

770
00:39:43,408 --> 00:39:45,042
I'm proud of you.

771
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,612
Thank you.

772
00:39:46,725 --> 00:39:48,936
Frankly, I always feared...

773
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:52,311
you were too emotionally
stunted to settle down.

774
00:39:55,832 --> 00:39:56,856
You can do this.

775
00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:01,627
I've always found it confusing.

776
00:40:01,948 --> 00:40:05,225
If you know both the bride and
the groom which side do you sit on?

777
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,690
I look for the hottest chick
in the room

778
00:40:07,707 --> 00:40:09,285
- and sit next to her.
- Stop.

779
00:40:09,344 --> 00:40:11,325
Wanna ditch the reception,
grab a drink instead?

780
00:40:11,357 --> 00:40:12,404
Stop it.

781
00:40:13,921 --> 00:40:14,944
You don't want me.

782
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:16,109
Maybe I do.

783
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:17,266
No, you don't.

784
00:40:19,397 --> 00:40:20,449
You want Ava.

785
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,670
She's not Ava anymore.

786
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:23,463
She's Rebecca now,
and I barely know her.

787
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:25,982
Look at me.

788
00:40:27,063 --> 00:40:28,424
Look at me.

789
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:30,620
You suck.

790
00:40:31,413 --> 00:40:32,549
To me, you suck.

791
00:40:32,568 --> 00:40:35,065
I kind of... hate you.

792
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:37,054
But, Alex...

793
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:40,072
We do not get
unlimited chances,

794
00:40:40,653 --> 00:40:42,789
to have the things we want.
And this...

795
00:40:43,295 --> 00:40:44,300
I know...

796
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,718
Nothing is worse
than missing an opportunity

797
00:40:47,732 --> 00:40:49,300
that could've
changed your life.

798
00:40:49,978 --> 00:40:51,461
And no matter
what her name is,

799
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,554
she'll always be Ava to you.

800
00:40:59,882 --> 00:41:00,915
Dr. Bailey.

801
00:41:02,797 --> 00:41:04,324
You didn't go
to the wedding either.

802
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:05,450
No.

803
00:41:08,816 --> 00:41:12,384
I am... so sorry, George.

804
00:41:14,478 --> 00:41:15,915
So, um...

805
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:19,120
What do I do now?

806
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:24,260
You fail your intern test,
you have two options.

807
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:25,344
You can...

808
00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:29,685
walk away from being
a surgical resident altogether,

809
00:41:30,002 --> 00:41:33,523
or you can start
from the very beginning.

810
00:41:34,303 --> 00:41:35,956
Repeat my internship?

811
00:41:38,336 --> 00:41:39,448
No.

812
00:41:41,993 --> 00:41:42,998
I can't.

813
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,284
I can't.

814
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:03,678
Did I... Did I fail you...

815
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:05,332
George?

816
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:06,745
No.

817
00:42:10,255 --> 00:42:11,316
No.

818
00:42:14,244 --> 00:42:15,605
I failed you.

819
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:29,196
It looks so pretty in there.

820
00:42:30,135 --> 00:42:31,271
I see Burke.

821
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:35,026
Yang...
The twins looks nice in that dress.

822
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:37,282
Thank you. Sort of.

823
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,404
- I gotta go. I gotta check...
- You're on call?

824
00:42:39,413 --> 00:42:41,526
Wait, alex.
Did you see George in there?

825
00:42:42,874 --> 00:42:43,973
I don't see him.

826
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,350
He's, uh...
Probably gonna be late.

827
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,595
We had kind of a big,
emotional day.

828
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:49,853
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

829
00:42:49,891 --> 00:42:52,473
Did something happen
between you two? I mean...

830
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:54,507
No. It's just that I was
named chief resident.

831
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:56,447
Plus we decided
to have a baby, so...

832
00:42:58,643 --> 00:42:59,938
- A baby?
- Yeah, we're trying.

833
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,220
We tried today, in fact.

834
00:43:02,107 --> 00:43:04,004
Yeah. Big day.

835
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:11,435
- Okay, this is it.
- Yeah.

836
00:43:11,595 --> 00:43:12,731
- Okay?
- Yeah.

837
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,036
- You have the bouquet.
- Yeah.

838
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:15,285
- I have the ring.
- Yeah.

839
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:16,932
You remember your vows?

840
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,265
- Okay.
- I wrote them on my...

841
00:43:19,635 --> 00:43:20,752
Oh, my god...

842
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:23,391
I scrubbed in.

843
00:43:23,941 --> 00:43:26,711
I scrubbed in, and the vows were on
my hand. I scrubbed off my vows.

844
00:43:26,955 --> 00:43:28,714
- Oh, okay. Um...
- Okay, hello?

845
00:43:28,735 --> 00:43:29,913
I scrubbed off my vows.

846
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:31,537
I-I can't do this.
I don't have any...

847
00:43:31,556 --> 00:43:32,922
I don't have anything
on my hand!

848
00:43:40,843 --> 00:43:42,365
I should go see
what's going on.

849
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:44,355
Well,
Cristina wouldn't be Cristina

850
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:45,782
if she didn't need
a little push.

851
00:43:47,779 --> 00:43:49,108
There are no words
in my head. Okay?

852
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,451
I have no vows.
No vows.

853
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,283
It's okay.
It's going to be okay.

854
00:43:52,302 --> 00:43:53,469
You know what?
Stop saying that!

855
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:55,468
- Will you say sometng else?
- Like what?

856
00:43:55,486 --> 00:43:57,167
Say something
that is gonna help me.

857
00:43:57,205 --> 00:43:58,983
Okay, okay! I...

858
00:44:00,881 --> 00:44:02,496
Meredith, please.
You know what? Say something.

859
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,355
Say... I don't know what.
Say... Say... Okay.

860
00:44:04,763 --> 00:44:06,660
Say what I would say to you
if you were me.

861
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:08,843
- Okay.
- Good.

862
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,185
- Got it.
- Good, go.

863
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:13,105
Stop whining.

864
00:44:13,682 --> 00:44:14,687
This is your wedding day.

865
00:44:14,888 --> 00:44:17,066
You will go down that aisle
and you will get married.

866
00:44:17,095 --> 00:44:19,722
If have to kick your ass every step
of the way to get you there,

867
00:44:19,749 --> 00:44:22,018
you will walk down the aisle.
You will get married.

868
00:44:22,043 --> 00:44:24,072
Do you hear me, Cristina?
We need this.

869
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:26,482
We need you to get
your happy ending.

870
00:44:29,463 --> 00:44:30,477
Okay, I'm ready.

871
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:31,642
All right, then.

872
00:44:32,177 --> 00:44:33,275
My train.

873
00:44:34,844 --> 00:44:35,933
I'll go.

874
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:13,568
I'm ready. I'm fine. I...

875
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:15,253
Meredith talked me down.
Really I'm fine.

876
00:45:15,281 --> 00:45:17,063
Go, go, go.
I'll be right behind you.

877
00:45:18,955 --> 00:45:19,959
I'm sorry.

878
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,480
I can do this.

879
00:45:24,517 --> 00:45:26,602
You know, I had a momentary
freak out, but now I'm fine.

880
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:28,808
- I can do this. Go.
- But you don't want to do this.

881
00:45:30,876 --> 00:45:33,031
I'm up there waiting for you
to come down the aisle,

882
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:35,351
and I knew
you don't want to come.

883
00:45:36,093 --> 00:45:37,398
I know
you don't want to come

884
00:45:37,408 --> 00:45:39,736
but that you'll come anyway
because you love me.

885
00:45:42,346 --> 00:45:43,670
And if I loved you...

886
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,946
If I loved you,

887
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:48,469
not the woman
that I'm trying to make you be,

888
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,817
not the woman
that I hope you'll become,

889
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:52,929
but you...

890
00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:55,594
If I did...

891
00:45:57,122 --> 00:45:59,047
I wouldn't be up there
waiting for you.

892
00:46:01,907 --> 00:46:03,212
I would be letting you go.

893
00:46:07,895 --> 00:46:09,576
I am wearing the dress.

894
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:11,362
I'm ready.

895
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:15,112
And maybe I didn't want to before,
but I want to now.

896
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:16,792
I really think I want this.

897
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:20,168
And I really wish
that you didn't think.

898
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:23,150
I wish that you knew.

899
00:46:58,018 --> 00:46:59,266
It's over.

900
00:47:00,828 --> 00:47:02,293
You can all go home.

901
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:05,175
It's over.

902
00:47:08,397 --> 00:47:09,852
It's so over.

903
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:20,075
He's gone.

904
00:48:21,953 --> 00:48:23,822
I-I don't think he's gone.

905
00:48:24,232 --> 00:48:26,157
- Uh, his stuff is still here.
- No, it isn't.

906
00:48:26,617 --> 00:48:28,748
His trumpet was here.

907
00:48:30,732 --> 00:48:32,807
His entire Eugene Foote collection...

908
00:48:33,711 --> 00:48:35,288
Vinyls and cds...

909
00:48:35,577 --> 00:48:38,375
His grandmother's picture
was by the bed.

910
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:43,323
His lucky scrub cap
was hanging on the door.

911
00:48:51,373 --> 00:48:52,528
He's gone.

912
00:48:55,939 --> 00:48:57,047
I'm...

913
00:48:58,469 --> 00:48:59,539
I'm free.

914
00:49:02,913 --> 00:49:03,937
Damn it.

915
00:49:05,749 --> 00:49:06,787
Damn it.

916
00:49:07,457 --> 00:49:09,082
Damn it. Damn it.

917
00:49:10,359 --> 00:49:11,748
Oh, god.
Get this off me.

918
00:49:12,638 --> 00:49:14,268
Take this off!
Take this off!

919
00:49:14,794 --> 00:49:16,193
Please, just...

920
00:49:21,673 --> 00:49:23,561
Help me, help me, help me!

921
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,178
Do we get assigned lockers
here or what?

922
00:50:01,217 --> 00:50:02,382
Dude, it stinks in here.

923
00:50:02,391 --> 00:50:03,727
What do you want?
It's a locker room.

924
00:50:03,746 --> 00:50:04,934
No, it's our locker room.

925
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,504
You guys, look,
bloody scrubs.

926
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,595
- Hi.
- Hi.

927
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,665
Come on, you guys.
Let's go check out the cafeteria.

928
00:50:15,684 --> 00:50:16,745
Yeah.

929
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,801
We're the new interns.

930
00:50:26,617 --> 00:50:28,534
Well, you look seasoned and wise...

931
00:50:28,998 --> 00:50:30,089
Got any advice?

932
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,699
No.

933
00:50:36,941 --> 00:50:40,283
Learn how to do an appendectomy
start to finish before your first day.

934
00:50:44,104 --> 00:50:45,513
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

935
00:50:46,349 --> 00:50:47,412
Better offer?

936
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,119
Just, uh...

937
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,006
You know, life.

938
00:50:56,151 --> 00:50:58,348
Anyways, uh,
good luck with...

939
00:50:59,315 --> 00:51:00,733
life, Doctor...

940
00:51:03,055 --> 00:51:04,090
My name is George.

941
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:05,865
I'm lexie. Lexie grey.

942
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,903
Congratulations.
You'll make a fine chief.

943
00:51:19,683 --> 00:51:21,233
I'm not the best man
for this job.

944
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:24,524
You're the best man
for this job.

945
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,252
What are you talking about,
Derek?

946
00:51:27,893 --> 00:51:30,118
A good chief learns
from his mistakes.

947
00:51:30,347 --> 00:51:31,614
I'm still working on that.

948
00:51:31,886 --> 00:51:32,891
But you...

949
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:36,634
If you had a chance to do it all over
again, you'd do it differently.

950
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:39,667
Go ahead.
Do it all over again.

951
00:51:41,753 --> 00:51:42,769
Be the best man.
