1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,178
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:04,375
I'm getting married to Burke.

3
00:00:05,502 --> 00:00:08,450
I went to the board this morning
and told them I was retiring.

4
00:00:08,464 --> 00:00:09,935
One of us could be chief.

5
00:00:09,936 --> 00:00:12,222
We were here long before
you two started fooling around.

6
00:00:12,223 --> 00:00:13,051
He is my husband.

7
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:14,526
Stop saying that like
it means something.

8
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:16,037
Jane Doe, about six months pregnant.

9
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:17,267
Found under a pile of rubble.

10
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:19,953
She can't remember anything
from before the accident.

11
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:22,582
Go 60 days with no sex,
no other women.

12
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,333
My mother's dead, isn't she?

13
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:27,369
Why didn't you stay and fight for us?

14
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:28,946
I-I tried.

15
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:32,204
Alex, I'm sorry. I can't.

16
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:43,665
<i>People have scars in all sorts
of unexpected places,</i>

17
00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:46,924
<i>like secret road maps
of their personal histories,</i>

18
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:50,060
<i>diagrams of all their old wounds.</i>

19
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:52,851
Alex! God.

20
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:55,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Seen it all before.

21
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,518
What the hell are you doing here?

22
00:00:57,536 --> 00:00:59,180
- Moving in.
- What?

23
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:03,328
<i>Most of our old wounds heal,
leaving nothing behind, but a scar.</i>

24
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:04,700
<i>But some of them don't.</i>

25
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:06,071
Alex is moving in?

26
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:07,385
To this house?

27
00:01:07,423 --> 00:01:09,658
- He's taking George's room.
- Why?

28
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:11,123
I was asleep just a minute ago.

29
00:01:11,347 --> 00:01:13,609
And I was naked in the bathroom
when Alex walked in.

30
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,531
Lucky I didn't come out
of the shower to find him peeing

31
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:17,106
- all over the seat.
- And we're up.

32
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:19,138
What's wrong with
where he was living before?

33
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:20,793
I don't know where
he was living before.

34
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:21,922
Probably a whorehouse.

35
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,940
I can't have him living in the room
right next door. It's weird.

36
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:26,490
People are what matters.

37
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:29,335
Alex is one of our people.
We can't leave him out in the cold.

38
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,724
"People are what matters"?
You don't like people.

39
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:33,114
Is this about your mother?

40
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:35,790
No. I had a near death whatever, and...

41
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:37,419
I was dead.

42
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:39,090
And now I'm not, so...

43
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:41,254
I'd like to use this chance
I've been given

44
00:01:41,264 --> 00:01:42,419
to be more positive.

45
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:45,062
People are what matters.

46
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:47,827
Paint with all the colors of the wind.

47
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:51,775
You're crazy now.

48
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:54,104
- I'm alive.
- Yeah, okay.

49
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:56,677
No, no.
Um, I'm not done in there yet.

50
00:01:57,588 --> 00:01:59,956
Oh, don't worry.
Not looking, not interested.

51
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,454
<i>Some wounds we carry
with us everywhere,</i>

52
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,501
<i>and though the cut's long gone...</i>

53
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:06,801
No, she's selfish, is Izzie's problem.

54
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,727
<i>The pain still lingers.</i>

55
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,849
She's not selfish.
She's generous. But...

56
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:13,009
She-She's self-absorbed.

57
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,248
I mean,

58
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:17,508
her problem is that she doesn't see
other people's perspectives.

59
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,142
Hey, give me a bite.

60
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:22,913
You know, it's weird because

61
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:25,129
she's so ridiculously compassionate
with her patients.

62
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,244
You'd think she'd roll some
of that out for her friends, but...

63
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:29,016
How about we not talk
about her anymore?

64
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:32,996
That's a fine idea.

65
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:40,162
He is in George's room,

66
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:42,340
and when George's stupid
marriage crashes and burns,

67
00:02:42,406 --> 00:02:44,763
he's gonna want to move back in,
and he won't be able to.

68
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:47,833
His life will be in a shambles, he'll
finally notice that his dad is dead

69
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,684
and he made a fool
out of himself by marrying

70
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:52,251
somebody he doesn't really love,
and he'll have no place to go.

71
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:53,261
Is that what you want?

72
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,788
That's exactly what I want.

73
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:58,049
Hey, look who found some clothes.

74
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,504
- Shut it.
- How you doing?

75
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:02,236
Okay, everybody, let's do this once.

76
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:04,011
I'm fine, she's cremated,

77
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,229
I picked out a beautiful urn, and she's
hanging out in the back of my closet.

78
00:03:07,306 --> 00:03:10,104
Any more questions about my dead mother,
or can we get back to work?

79
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:13,190
Does anyone know who
the new chief candidate is?

80
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:14,494
The chief's bringing in a ringer

81
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,739
in case he doesn't want to give
the job to either of your boyfriends.

82
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,335
O'Malley, you're with Shepherd today.

83
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:21,001
Yang, Dr. Montgomery.
Stevens, to the clinic.

84
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:22,461
Karev, Jane Doe.

85
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:23,559
Grey, scut.

86
00:03:23,606 --> 00:03:25,502
Once again, I am fine.

87
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:27,617
You can tell everybody you fine
till you're blue in your face.

88
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:29,875
Your mom died,
and you almost joined her.

89
00:03:29,913 --> 00:03:31,096
You're taking it easy.

90
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:33,969
Anybody come looking for me yet?

91
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,223
Well, no match on your prints, no.

92
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,055
No hits from missing persons,plus--

93
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:40,455
My face is hard to identify.

94
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:42,671
Well, the second
they find something out

95
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,584
about your identity,
I'm gonna come tell you.

96
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:48,420
Dr. Sloan says
I need surgery on my eye.

97
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:51,366
He just wants to make sure
you don't lose vision there completely.

98
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:54,383
But Dr. Montgomery says I should wait
a day or two 'cause of the baby.

99
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,902
I don't know
what I'm supposed to make of that.

100
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:59,045
Yeah, well, I mean,
surgery can be hard on a baby,

101
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:01,256
but you're gonna be on a fetal
monitor the whole time,

102
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:02,988
so if anything goes wrong,
we'll catch it.

103
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:05,341
Thank you.

104
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:09,962
I really-- I really appreciate
you taking the time to...

105
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:13,953
I mean, you're-- you're
all I've got in this place.

106
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:15,878
Does that hurt?

107
00:04:16,076 --> 00:04:18,160
Of course it hurts.
Don't poke it like that.

108
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:19,719
Has the lump been there a long time?

109
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:21,446
I got shot 50 years ago.

110
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:23,296
It's been there a long time.

111
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,012
But it hasn't bothered
you till... recently?

112
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:28,331
It bothers me
there's a bullet in there.

113
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,847
It'd bother you, too,
but it didn't start hurting

114
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:32,429
till a couple of months ago.

115
00:04:32,511 --> 00:04:34,606
- You think it's a bullet?
- I don't "think", lady.

116
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,690
I know. I wanted it out.

117
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:39,640
But the army doctors
didn't want to go get it.

118
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:43,321
So they let me keep it in
for half a lifetime.

119
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,750
Let's get some pictures,
see if you're right.

120
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:51,745
I know I'm right.
Save your film.

121
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,482
Just get me something for the pain.

122
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:57,306
Mr. Scofield,
I'm sure you are right,

123
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:58,874
but we're still gonna
do this my way.

124
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:03,373
- Derek.
- There she is.

125
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:04,538
How was your flight?

126
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:07,045
They didn't feed me,
which I don't understand.

127
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:08,690
Dr. O'Malley, Dr. Crawford.

128
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:10,424
- She's a big pain in the ass.
- Pleasure.

129
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:12,520
He says that because
we worked together in new york

130
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,815
and I was the only one
who never had a crush on him.

131
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:16,214
No, I-I don't buy that.

132
00:05:16,975 --> 00:05:18,036
What do we know, O'Malley?

133
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:20,503
Dr. Crawford has
a parafalcine meningioma

134
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:22,101
along the superior sagittal sinus.

135
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:24,342
You've operated three times.
It keeps on coming back.

136
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:25,708
Yeah, it's in dangerous territory,

137
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,956
so we leave a little bit of
the tumor behind each time,

138
00:05:27,957 --> 00:05:30,093
and we go back every couple
of years and tune it up.

139
00:05:30,216 --> 00:05:31,652
But this is the last time.

140
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:34,615
- Sorry?
- This is it, Derek.

141
00:05:34,803 --> 00:05:36,080
I'm done after this.

142
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:39,747
Helen...

143
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:42,038
the recovery takes forever,

144
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:44,686
and it's not like
when jake was around.

145
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:46,752
I go through this by myself now.

146
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,451
Don't throw in the towel.

147
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,259
I'm looking at the situation as it is.

148
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:53,645
I am going to do this now,

149
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,326
then I am going to spend
the next two years of my life

150
00:05:57,495 --> 00:06:00,378
lying on a beach,
enjoying the sun.

151
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:03,312
Stop looking at me
like I killed your cat.

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,118
The decision is made.

153
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,448
You guys seen Bailey?

154
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:19,262
- What are we doing?
- Checking out the new chief candidate.

155
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:21,213
Chief's in with the ringer.
We're lurking

156
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:23,178
in a way that was subtle
when it was two of us,

157
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:24,370
but isn't now that it's 12.

158
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:26,060
I heard it was someone from Stanford.

159
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,875
All the professors there loved me.

160
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:29,095
They loved you?

161
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:30,610
I was a great student.

162
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,672
- How you doing, Grey?
- I'm fine, sir. Thank you.

163
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:35,047
- Move, move, move.
- She doesn't like it when people ask.

164
00:06:35,048 --> 00:06:36,535
The ringer's in there with the chief.

165
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:38,181
And whoever it
is loves Cristina because

166
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:40,942
everyone at Stanford
just loved Cristina.

167
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,975
Shut up.

168
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:44,394
She's a motivated student.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

169
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:45,994
- Thank you.
- A bit of a kiss ass,

170
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:47,205
but that's hard to control.

171
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,257
They're coming out. Look away.

172
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,316
That's Colin Marlowe.

173
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,940
Like the Marlowe transplant?

174
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:59,374
Like the brightest thing in
cardiothoracic surgery in a generation.

175
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:01,510
Dr. Marlowe...

176
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:04,102
I'm, uh, Preston Burke.

177
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:05,647
I'm a great admirer of your work, sir.

178
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,750
- Uh, particularly the--
- Yes, thank you. I--

179
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:09,677
Would you excuse me
for just a second?

180
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:17,055
Well...

181
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:19,261
you gonna give me a hug or what?

182
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:43,690
So what was that, exactly?

183
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:45,315
He was my professor.
We were close.

184
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:47,341
"close" appears to be
something of an understatement.

185
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,817
It was a long time ago.

186
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:51,405
I talk about him all the time.
You never thought to mention it?

187
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:54,597
Well, um, I didn't think you wanted to
hear about every guy I ever slept with.

188
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:56,809
I have a hysterectomy to prep.

189
00:07:57,523 --> 00:07:58,847
Are we done with the curiosity?

190
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:00,687
Great.

191
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:02,969
What are you doing tonight?

192
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:05,818
'Cause I don't want to go home and
find Alex, and it's just the two of us,

193
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,470
You know?
It's weird and awkward, and...

194
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:10,229
And he doesn't know whether
he should talk to me or not talk to me.

195
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:12,292
It's just such an awkward situation.

196
00:08:12,414 --> 00:08:14,545
I'd rather it be group
awkwardness, you know?

197
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:17,404
I don't want to just be
standing there staring at him.

198
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:20,520
- Meredith?
- Have you seen Montgomery?

199
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:23,555
Hey! What are you doing tonight?
You want to come over?

200
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,066
'Cause you and I never really
get a chance to hang out and...

201
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,123
It might be kind of fun.

202
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:29,582
Alex just moved in,
which was meredith's brilliant idea.

203
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,359
And he still has a thing for me,
so it's...

204
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:34,864
- What the hell?
- This is my hiding spot.

205
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,590
My father is out there.
Go somewhere else.

206
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:38,558
- I need this closet, Meredith.
- Colin Marlowe?

207
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,223
Yes, he was my professor.
We were close.

208
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:42,517
He had his hand on your ass.
I sure hope you were close.

209
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:44,130
Did you see somebody go in there?

210
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,036
I did. Someone's hiding from me.

211
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,946
Yes, I think
someone's hiding from me, too.

212
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:51,325
You were that girl, huh?
The girl who slept with the professor.

213
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,029
We had one in my class.
She only got to the radiologist, though.

214
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,827
No one got near the cardio god.

215
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,534
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I scored big. You know,

216
00:08:58,723 --> 00:08:59,794
hide in the bathroom.

217
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,583
My awkwardness with my father
is well-established.

218
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,733
You and the cardio god,
on the other hand,

219
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:06,221
have loads to catch up on.

220
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:08,427
But I don't want to talk
to the cardio god.

221
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,154
You know we can hear you
in there, right?

222
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:11,315
Loud and clear.

223
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,262
- Hi.
- Hi.

224
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:21,107
- Excuse me. May I?
- Yeah.

225
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:24,752
Oh, I was just leaving, actually.

226
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:26,104
We heard about your mother.

227
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:28,282
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

228
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:30,038
There wasn't a funeral or anything?

229
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:31,737
Oh, she didn't want that.

230
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,734
I hope everything's okay with the baby.

231
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:35,966
We're not here with the baby.

232
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:38,655
We're here because we wanted
to make sure that you were all right.

233
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:40,600
That's sweet, but...

234
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,517
We don't have to do this.
I'm not in shock.

235
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:44,583
I'm not racked with grief.
I'm just moving on.

236
00:09:45,364 --> 00:09:46,980
But you're hiding in a broom closet.

237
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:48,867
Well, if you could just move my father.

238
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,152
I sent him to go get some coffee,

239
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,504
but we'd really like to...

240
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:54,854
You know, make dinner or something...

241
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:56,251
for you.

242
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:58,232
He's been really worried about you.

243
00:09:59,229 --> 00:10:01,089
And he's the family you have left,
Meredith.

244
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,182
I-I don't see it that way.

245
00:10:03,652 --> 00:10:05,117
When is this gonna stop?

246
00:10:06,461 --> 00:10:09,043
Yes, he made some mistakes,
but he's not a monster.

247
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:10,536
He's just...

248
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,306
an inarticulate person who spills
food on his shirt, a lot.

249
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,625
Have dinner with us,

250
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,458
tonight. I'll make some chili.

251
00:10:17,543 --> 00:10:19,155
The whole thing will be over in an hour.

252
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:20,970
You think you can do that?

253
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:24,532
I can't believe you hid in a closet
when you saw me coming.

254
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:25,572
If it wasn't just tragic,

255
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:27,496
it might be the most adorable thing
I've ever seen.

256
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:29,197
You could've warned me.

257
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,045
I thought, Cristina Yang
wouldn't hide in a closet

258
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:32,350
'cause she doesn't
want to talk to me,

259
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:35,560
which clearly she doesn't because
she fled like a roach in sunlight

260
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:38,191
- when she saw me coming.
- You know,I did not flee. I was--

261
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:40,973
I have work to do. I'm not
a professional note taker anymore.

262
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:43,452
- You grew your hair. It's lovely.
- Don't flirt with me.

263
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:44,696
I have a person.

264
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:45,898
Really? Who?

265
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:47,543
Preston Burke.

266
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:49,637
You never change.

267
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,327
- Must be adorable.
- No. Shut up.

268
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:53,055
It is a real relationship.

269
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,773
- I bet it is.
- I'm marrying him.

270
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,725
Good.

271
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:00,298
Congratulations.

272
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:03,753
No, I'm being genuine.

273
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:05,861
It's wonderful.

274
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,484
Can I give you a congratulatory hug?

275
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:13,920
Don't touch my ass.

276
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:16,690
My stomach is growling.

277
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:20,139
Sorry. We can't let you eat
before the surgery.

278
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:22,852
That's okay. I stayed
at the archfield last night.

279
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:25,190
I had them make me
breakfast at midnight.

280
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,937
You should try the French toast.

281
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:28,622
It'll blow your mind.

282
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:31,354
Breakfast at the archfield
on an intern's salary?

283
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:33,217
Yeah, I kinda live
there at the moment.

284
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:34,842
My wife has a deal there.

285
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,964
That's one hell of a deal.

286
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,470
So our room service bill

287
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:41,293
at the archfield,
is that part of the deal?

288
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,065
Yeah, sure.

289
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,520
I mean, breakfast alone is,

290
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:47,351
what, probably 50 bucks a day?

291
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,233
And they still only charge us
$400 a week?

292
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:51,100
Sometimes I pay them
more for room service.

293
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:55,013
OK. Then just tell me how much it is,
and we'll split it like we do the rest.

294
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,538
- Don't worry about it.
- No come on.

295
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,346
I'm not gonna have you
pay for all the food.

296
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:00,398
Just tell me how much
the room service bill is.

297
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:02,859
We pay about, 800 a week.

298
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,253
Dollars?

299
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:05,908
I told you not to worry about it.

300
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:07,100
You can't afford that.

301
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:08,940
- Yes, I can.
- How?

302
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,580
I'm your husband now.
You're supposed to tell me this stuff.

303
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:14,191
Okay. Just come here.

304
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:16,370
All right, my parents
have a lot of money...

305
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:17,418
- What?
- And so I...

306
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:19,155
have more money than I'm making.

307
00:12:19,563 --> 00:12:22,914
And we don't... have
a special deal through family friends

308
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:24,616
at the archfield.
I just-- I pay for it.

309
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:25,773
How much?

310
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:29,091
$2,500 a week.

311
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,456
- You're an heiress.
- Okay.

312
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:33,915
- See, this is why I don't tell people.
- You're an heiress.

313
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,245
Don't-- just don't,

314
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,968
okay? Stop talking. Stop talking.

315
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,626
I mean it.
I-I didn't tell you because

316
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:41,407
my parents' money has affected
every single relationship in my life,

317
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:43,143
and so I've stopped talking
about it and living--

318
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:44,274
No, wait, wait. So wait.

319
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:46,209
So I've been--
I've been paying you

320
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:48,603
$200 a week for what, fun?

321
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,478
No. I use it to tip housekeeping.

322
00:12:55,469 --> 00:12:56,964
Great! Oh!

323
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:59,480
Oh, I'm-- you know,
I'm glad I could pitch in.

324
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:02,184
You know, is there anything else
that I should know about,

325
00:13:02,203 --> 00:13:04,447
that's, I don't know,
huge like this?

326
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,597
Uh, I-I-I used to have
a pet ferret for nine years.

327
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:09,333
George...

328
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:11,220
Great.

329
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:14,069
Stop distracting the staff.

330
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,382
You're pushy.
Anybody ever tell you that?

331
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:21,070
Um, so what do you think
of a sagittal sinus bypass?

332
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:25,192
Have you ever scrubbed in on
a sagittal sinus bypass, Dr. O'Malley?

333
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,619
It is what they call
"big balls" surgery.

334
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:31,470
- Apparently I have a surgeon with--
- It's been very successful.

335
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:33,737
- When the patient doesn't stroke out.
- If it works,

336
00:13:33,738 --> 00:13:35,952
the tumor's all gone. We never
have to go back in there again.

337
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:37,367
If it doesn't work, I'm dead.

338
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:39,434
If you refuse to come back
in 2 years, you're dead anyway.

339
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,961
That's a decision I can live with.

340
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:42,558
That isn't a decision I can live with.

341
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:44,417
O'Malley, go find her labs.

342
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:52,148
So what do you think, huh?

343
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:54,635
A few years on a beach,

344
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,279
and then what?

345
00:13:56,683 --> 00:13:58,251
After you piss away your savings,

346
00:13:58,594 --> 00:14:01,176
your memory goes,
motor skills deteriorate,

347
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:04,221
and you're dying a very slow,
miserable,

348
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:05,905
painful death...
You're gonna call me up

349
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:08,917
and you're gonna ask me why we didn't do
something when we had the chance.

350
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:10,828
Now that is not something
I can live with.

351
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:13,804
Not...

352
00:14:14,706 --> 00:14:16,978
when we can do something
right now to prevent it.

353
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:22,578
Well, it looks like the bullet
has damaged your scapula.

354
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:24,198
No wonder it hurts.

355
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:26,256
How did you get shot, sir?

356
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:29,111
Korea. Garden spot.
Makes a nice vacation.

357
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,787
Can I get a damn painkiller?

358
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,505
I think we'll do you one better.
We're gonna take it out.

359
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:34,837
My bullet?

360
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:37,180
There was no reason to remove it
when you first got hit,

361
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:40,249
but now it's infected.
It's working its way into your scapula,

362
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:41,357
and we can't have that.

363
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:42,794
I need to see that bullet.

364
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:45,423
- You gonna frame it?
- No, smarty-pants.

365
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:47,972
I was fragged a couple
of weeks before it all ended.

366
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:50,798
- "Fragged"?
- Yeah, shot by one of his own men.

367
00:14:50,878 --> 00:14:52,821
I made a decision,
and they didn't like it.

368
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:55,247
And then what do you know?
We're facing enemy fire,

369
00:14:55,248 --> 00:14:57,689
and I take a hit
from the wrong side of the line.

370
00:14:57,961 --> 00:14:59,247
I could never prove it,

371
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:00,895
but we can prove it now,

372
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:02,979
when you pull the damn thing out of me.

373
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,617
Get me my bullet.

374
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,105
Let's calm down, Mr. Scofield.

375
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,306
Do you know what it's like,

376
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:09,410
when your own men turn on you?

377
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:12,263
It's not a good feeling.

378
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:20,994
I just agreed to have dinner
at my father's house, tonight.

379
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,074
And Cristina slept with Colin Marlowe.

380
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:25,755
"Marlowe transplant" Marlowe?

381
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,450
They had a thing
when she was a student.

382
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:28,848
How could I have
a meal at my father's house?

383
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:29,994
He slept with Cristina?

384
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,055
Derek.

385
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,613
Oh, right. Sorry. Okay.

386
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:34,566
Have dinner at your house.

387
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:36,795
It's your place. I'll come.

388
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:39,236
I'll be your wingman. It'll be fun.

389
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:41,545
Okay, it won't be fun.
But it'll be...

390
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:42,699
It'll be fine.

391
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:44,051
They're your family.

392
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,393
Why does everyone assume that?

393
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,746
You deserve to have a family,

394
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:48,135
whether you like them or not.

395
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,334
I thought we had a deal.

396
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,669
We agreed I wouldn't sleep
with anybody for two months.

397
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,978
We never said I wouldn't look.

398
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,254
- You didn't think I'd hold out.
- No, I didn't.

399
00:15:58,343 --> 00:15:59,348
You're worth it.

400
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:00,625
You bet your ass I am.

401
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:03,934
She's rich, totally rich,

402
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:04,990
boatloads of money.

403
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:07,046
- George, that's fantastic.
- No,it's...

404
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:09,215
it's not fantastic.

405
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:11,724
Cristina did Colin Marlowe.

406
00:16:12,503 --> 00:16:13,508
Callie's rich.

407
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,310
Don't talk to her about it.

408
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,262
Her? I am sorry,
I don't have a name anymore?

409
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:19,249
Don't tell anyone.
Those were my words.

410
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,351
- So she's rich.
- Just shut up about it.

411
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,639
Do you think that's possible?

412
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,578
If you give me the "people is what
matters" thing again, I will kill you.

413
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,003
Colin Marlowe.

414
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:36,389
Was it good? Was he good?

415
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:38,095
Did he make you a better lover?

416
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:40,581
Remember all the other times
I've talked to you about my sex life?

417
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,699
- No.
- Exactly.

418
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,459
Did I miss anything
about her doing the old guy?

419
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,193
- She's not talking.
- Oh, she'll talk.

420
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:46,837
So I was supposed to be
back in the game today,

421
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:49,605
but instead I'm planning dinner
for my father in my dead mother's house.

422
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:51,307
I don't cook. How am I supposed
to cook for them?

423
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:52,557
I will make your stupid dinner.

424
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:55,197
So were there any little
blue pills involved,

425
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,770
or is he untouched by time?

426
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:58,539
Dude, that's just wrong.
Don't answer that.

427
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,920
Because I am your friend,

428
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,728
I will show up at your house 45 minutes
into the dinner with a fake crisis.

429
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:06,293
So if it's, uh, unbearable,
you can abort.

430
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,363
Oh, thank you.

431
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:09,194
Come on. He's not a young man.

432
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:11,252
He wasn't getting a little help?

433
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:14,218
Poppin' the pill?
Dad's best friend?

434
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:17,435
Come on. You're gonna give me nothing
after everything we've been through?

435
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:18,848
Nothing?

436
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:22,680
It's a miracle drug.

437
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,624
And someday, it'll save your life.

438
00:17:27,722 --> 00:17:29,523
Dr. Marlowe? Derek Shepherd.

439
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:32,588
I'm doing a sagittal sinuspass
today if you'd like to observe.

440
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:33,929
Really? That's quite a procedure.

441
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,733
It's a good trick,
but if you're really interested

442
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:37,258
to see what this hospital can do,

443
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:40,122
I'm performing
an arterial switch operation

444
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,667
for a T.G.A. this afternoon.

445
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,106
If you gentlemen are trying
to intimidate the competition,

446
00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:45,112
it's working.

447
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,954
- Good.
- I'll see both of you in surgery.

448
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:52,030
Colin Marlowe.

449
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:53,307
The one and only.

450
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:54,575
- He...
- Yes.

451
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:55,936
- With...
- Yes.

452
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:58,490
- Indeed.
- Yeah.

453
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:01,300
Suction.

454
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,488
No, not like you're driving a tractor.
Slowly.

455
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:06,414
Better.

456
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:08,761
What's the chance she wakes up
and remembers everything?

457
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:09,841
I wouldn't count on it.

458
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:11,876
Dr. Sloan, the baby's having decels.

459
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:14,907
Are you sure? Sometimes the monitor's
not on right. You get a false read.

460
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:16,873
She's got vaginal bleeding.
The baby's in distress.

461
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:19,344
Damn it. Page Dr. Montgomery. Now!

462
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,824
You're making an honest
woman of Cristina Yang.

463
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:25,018
That's-- That's impressive.

464
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,712
I always thought she was collecting us,
like baseball cards.

465
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:29,319
Baseball cards?

466
00:18:29,624 --> 00:18:31,559
Well, she likes an authority figure,
someone...

467
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:34,532
with something to teach her. I never
thought she would actually commit.

468
00:18:34,718 --> 00:18:36,808
She use to say to me
that she thought that marriage

469
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:38,403
was for the weak and undirected.

470
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:40,732
I made a number of

471
00:18:40,914 --> 00:18:42,345
marriage proposals.

472
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:44,485
It seemed the polite thing to do

473
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:46,802
after such a long time together,
but, uh,

474
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,861
- she wouldn't have it.
- All what time?

475
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,679
You were just having
a fling with a student.

476
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:51,770
A fling?

477
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,751
Cristina and I were together
for three years.

478
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:02,557
Is the problem
that I slept with my professor,

479
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,073
or that I was committed enough
to keep at it for three years?

480
00:19:05,074 --> 00:19:08,016
You told him that you thought
marriage was an idiotic institution.

481
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:09,288
- It is.
- Then why did you say yes?

482
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:10,657
- Cause I wana make you happy.
- "Happy"?

483
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:12,652
You know, I'll do a lot of things
to make you happy.

484
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:15,827
Do I give a crap about a ceremony
with a dress and a flautist?

485
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:16,992
No.

486
00:19:17,104 --> 00:19:19,418
But I'm happy to do it
if it'll make you happy.

487
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:22,225
Heartwarming.

488
00:19:22,783 --> 00:19:23,788
Thanks.

489
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,390
You couldn't have waited one day?

490
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,938
She was 40% vision compromised
in her right eye.

491
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:35,380
- It would've been gone tomorrow.
- No, it wouldn't, actually,

492
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:38,320
but there's a snazzy new chief candidate
marching around the hall today,

493
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:40,831
and you needed to be a hero.
That's what needed to happen today.

494
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:42,467
The patient was fine, Addison.

495
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:44,936
The baby's still in her uterus,
and she's not losing an eye.

496
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:46,749
Every surgery is risky.

497
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:48,139
The patient chose this one.

498
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:50,788
Karev...
don't just stand there.

499
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,956
The patient's baby was in distress.

500
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:54,299
Go. Stay with her.

501
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:55,463
Somethin' happen with Jane Doe?

502
00:19:55,464 --> 00:19:57,718
Yeah, she can see,
and Addison's got a problem with it.

503
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:00,479
He rushed her into surgery,
and she almost lost the baby.

504
00:20:00,497 --> 00:20:02,721
I had to sew  her cervix shut.

505
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:04,986
The complications had nothing
to do with the surgery.

506
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:06,948
Why? Why do you think
Mark moved so quickly, Derek?

507
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:09,133
Do you think it's because
a piece of the orbital bone

508
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:10,569
was floating towards the brain?

509
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:12,917
Well, I think it's because
Mark wants a promotion.

510
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:15,581
You're not her husband.
This isn't your patient.

511
00:20:15,637 --> 00:20:16,566
Stay out of it!

512
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:18,533
What the hell
do you people think you're doing?

513
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:20,849
You're supposed to be
the leadership of this hospital.

514
00:20:20,893 --> 00:20:22,836
Screaming about
a patient in the hallway?

515
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,535
Are you out of your minds?

516
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,429
Tough procedure.

517
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:33,932
It's a bold choice.

518
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,965
We've been fighting
this one for a while.

519
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,959
I'm hoping this will be
the end of it.

520
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:40,266
What happened?

521
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:43,087
End-tidal CO2 just dropped
from 30 to 16. Bagging manually.

522
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:44,631
Doppler's showing air
in the left ventricle.

523
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:45,976
0-2 stat's down to 89.

524
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,011
Aspirate the central line.

525
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,742
- She's bradycardic.
- Push 1 of atropine.

526
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:49,967
There's no air in the central line.

527
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:51,655
Level her out.
I'm gonna flood the field.

528
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:53,964
Asystole.
Push 1 milligram of epi.

529
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:55,363
Start compressions. Go.

530
00:20:55,795 --> 00:20:57,241
Get in there.
Get in there! Do it!

531
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,333
That things been in there
since the korean war?

532
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:03,796
He's lucky it didn't travel
down to his aorta.

533
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:05,741
Okay, a little suction there.

534
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:07,543
Almost...

535
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,184
I got it.

536
00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:14,113
Make sure we get that back.
The patient wants it.

537
00:21:14,114 --> 00:21:15,752
He's got a warped sense of nostalgia.

538
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:18,449
I get it. If they pulled a bullet
out of me, I'd want it

539
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,046
cast in gold
and mounted on my wall.

540
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,472
Yeah, well, you can afford it.

541
00:21:22,204 --> 00:21:24,373
Just a little more suction.
Let's get ready to close.

542
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:31,863
She's not responding.

543
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,820
- I'm gonna open her up.
- Open cardiac massage?

544
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:35,948
You're a neurosurgeon.

545
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:38,470
You have no privileges in this hospital.
Get the glasses off.

546
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:40,315
- Should we page Dr. Burke?
- No I've got it.

547
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:42,633
Cross clamp the hilum. You don't
want air in the cerebral arteries.

548
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,109
Yeah, I got it.
Give me a 10-blade.

549
00:21:44,197 --> 00:21:46,244
10-blade quickly, please.
O'Malley, get over here.

550
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:48,909
Let's roll her. Ready?
One, two, three. Go.

551
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:52,565
Okay, rib spreader.

552
00:22:00,128 --> 00:22:01,189
Okay, scissors.

553
00:22:09,102 --> 00:22:10,276
Massage her heart, O'Malley.

554
00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:16,064
I need to aspirate.

555
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:19,685
Any air return?

556
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:21,055
10 cc's.

557
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:29,179
End-tidal CO2 is going back up.

558
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,832
The heart's starting
to beat on its own.

559
00:22:30,874 --> 00:22:33,311
Pressure's 60 over 40.
It's low, but it's there.

560
00:22:33,673 --> 00:22:34,828
She's gonna make it.

561
00:22:42,472 --> 00:22:43,702
Should I start closing her up?

562
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,133
Dr. Shepherd?

563
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,417
O'Malley, I just sliced my friend's
chest open. Give me a moment.

564
00:22:54,893 --> 00:22:56,865
That was very well-handled,
Dr. Shepherd.

565
00:22:57,062 --> 00:22:58,152
Very impressive, indeed.

566
00:22:58,153 --> 00:22:59,819
Not something I want to do
every day, but thanks.

567
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,926
Doctors, what happened?

568
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:04,074
Dr. Shepherd's patient
had a venous air embolism.

569
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:06,820
He had to split her chest open,
massage her heart

570
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:10,924
and manually aspirate right
in the middle of his procedure.

571
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:12,970
Why didn't you call me?

572
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:15,242
Uh, you were operating.

573
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:17,179
I was next door.
You could've pulled me out.

574
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,324
There was no time.
I handled it.

575
00:23:18,325 --> 00:23:21,026
You think I crack people's heads open
if you're in the building

576
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:23,006
just because I think
I can handle a brain bleed?

577
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,939
The patient is lucky,
and you were showboating.

578
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,241
Showboating?
What, are you out of your mind? I was--

579
00:23:27,242 --> 00:23:30,337
We seem to be going out of
our way to impress Dr. Marlowe.

580
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:32,208
- I'll bet we are.
- Gentlemen...

581
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,665
Good day,

582
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,205
doctors.

583
00:23:47,975 --> 00:23:49,205
How you feeling, Mr. Scofield?

584
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:51,919
Where's my bullet?

585
00:24:00,697 --> 00:24:01,702
That it?

586
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:03,664
Where's the rest of it?

587
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:05,582
That was it.

588
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:07,309
Is that a letter?

589
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:09,103
Can you read that?

590
00:24:09,112 --> 00:24:12,154
I-I don't think it's much of anything.
I-I think it's just a scratch.

591
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:14,968
It's so small.

592
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,118
It could just be anything.

593
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:18,620
It's been a long time.

594
00:24:18,902 --> 00:24:20,190
They don't hold up that well.

595
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:24,068
Could you have your lab,
you know, analyze it?

596
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,270
Tell me if it's one of ours or--

597
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:29,878
We're not set up for that kind
of investigation, Mr. Scofield.

598
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:32,109
You could try to send it
to a forensic lab,

599
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,329
but I don't know
if they'll tell you much either.

600
00:24:39,971 --> 00:24:43,417
I've been stewing for 50 years.

601
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,459
Maybe it's time to move on.

602
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:47,851
To what?

603
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,442
I lost my whole unit over this.

604
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:52,895
I came home.

605
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:55,655
My wife, she didn't get it.

606
00:24:56,148 --> 00:24:59,308
I've been blazing mad my whole life.

607
00:25:01,424 --> 00:25:02,861
I got nothing left.

608
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:09,837
It's not too late
to let it go and start over.

609
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:13,659
You're a sweet kid,

610
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:17,210
but you don't know what it's like

611
00:25:17,248 --> 00:25:20,271
to have something
change you in your soul.

612
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:23,954
I do.

613
00:25:25,438 --> 00:25:26,874
I wish I didn't, but I do.

614
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,433
Don't let it turn you.

615
00:25:35,215 --> 00:25:37,046
You look like you had a long day.

616
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:39,788
You know what fragging is?

617
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,276
We've got an epidemic of it today.

618
00:25:42,797 --> 00:25:45,323
My esteemed attendings
are gonna be the death of me.

619
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:46,538
Is there a front-runner?

620
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:47,745
I don't know.

621
00:25:48,773 --> 00:25:50,970
What I do know is
I don't want my attendings

622
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:52,415
tearing each other's throats out

623
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,293
because of some internal
power struggle.

624
00:25:54,907 --> 00:25:56,428
It's too dangerous for the hospital.

625
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,865
Does that mean...

626
00:25:58,717 --> 00:26:01,186
is Colin Marlowe gonna be the new chief?

627
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:03,859
Good night, Dr. Bailey.

628
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:13,426
This is ready.

629
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:16,393
Don't slosh it around.
It's all about the presentation.

630
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,957
Come in and eat with us.

631
00:26:17,986 --> 00:26:19,796
You need to bond
with your people, Meredith.

632
00:26:20,002 --> 00:26:21,250
People are what matters.

633
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,663
- I hate people.
- Yeah, well, do your own talking.

634
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:24,639
We talked.

635
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,843
We talked hospital, we talked
his research, we talked dead mother.

636
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:29,392
- I'm out.
- Ask about the baby.

637
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:32,126
Ask if it poos.
People can go on about that for hours.

638
00:26:35,816 --> 00:26:38,204
- The chicken looks delicious.
- Yeah.

639
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:39,838
It's from the store.

640
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:43,438
Well, the green beans
look great as well.

641
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,509
I... didn't do those either.

642
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:51,258
It's beautifully presented.

643
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:53,220
Izzie did that.

644
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:55,511
Alex!

645
00:26:57,087 --> 00:26:58,129
Come, sit.

646
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,650
Oh. No, go ahead.

647
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:01,279
Eat. We're eating.

648
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:04,458
This is Susan, and this is my father.

649
00:27:04,477 --> 00:27:05,425
Hi.

650
00:27:05,801 --> 00:27:07,754
- Here, you can have this plate.
- Cool.

651
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:11,707
So how are you?
How was your day?

652
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:12,984
Okay. Hungry.

653
00:27:13,829 --> 00:27:14,834
Good.

654
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,399
How's the baby?

655
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:23,638
- Great.
- She's smiling no, sometimes.

656
00:27:24,718 --> 00:27:27,967
She looks exactly like
molly wh-when she smiles.

657
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,557
I mean, it's amazing. I've got
this old picture of Molly and me

658
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:32,834
When Molly was...

659
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:35,172
I don't know, 5, and she's,

660
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,872
sitting on this red sled in the snow,
this great, big fir tree...

661
00:27:38,197 --> 00:27:39,999
- You know, I'm not sure that that--
- Yeah.

662
00:27:40,178 --> 00:27:42,610
No, honey, it's a massive douglas fir.

663
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:44,095
And in the picture,

664
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:47,611
couldn't look more like the baby.
I mean, incredible.

665
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:49,020
That's me.

666
00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:55,359
The red sled and the big fir tree in the

667
00:27:55,932 --> 00:27:58,617
park at the middle school
in the ugly, yellow,

668
00:27:59,537 --> 00:28:00,776
plaid wool coat.

669
00:28:01,743 --> 00:28:02,748
That isn't Molly.

670
00:28:04,335 --> 00:28:05,350
It's you and me.

671
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,189
- Oh, great.
- <i>Crap.</i>

672
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:18,503
- Sorry.
- <i>I think I blew a fuse.</i>

673
00:28:18,507 --> 00:28:20,329
- I'll get it.
- No, you know, I can get it.

674
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,066
- It's--
- Oh, in the laundry room.

675
00:28:24,717 --> 00:28:26,538
- I keep forgetting.
- What?

676
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:28,256
It's his house.

677
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:34,313
I'm going home.

678
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:42,268
Are you going home?

679
00:28:43,573 --> 00:28:44,583
How did it end?

680
00:28:47,118 --> 00:28:50,434
It ended.
School was ending, I was leaving.

681
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,524
You were done.

682
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,968
I came here.
I fell in love with you.

683
00:28:55,297 --> 00:28:56,367
A new mentor,

684
00:28:57,353 --> 00:28:59,251
with a host of new things
to teach you.

685
00:28:59,252 --> 00:29:01,371
If you think that I'm
in this for the education--

686
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,231
Do you or do you not find my knowledge
and my skill compelling?

687
00:29:04,232 --> 00:29:06,401
God. You know what?
You are blowing this way out of--

688
00:29:06,402 --> 00:29:07,963
A man three times your age,

689
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:10,634
believed that he was having
a substantial relationship with you...

690
00:29:10,635 --> 00:29:11,879
Well, yeah, he was.

691
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,208
And one day,
you're done just like that?

692
00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:16,575
Yes.

693
00:29:17,912 --> 00:29:20,551
You don't open yourself up...
to anyone.

694
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:22,748
Sometimes...

695
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:26,685
I think it's charming-- She's different,
she's not like other women.

696
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:29,568
But the simple fact is--
is that you have never let me in.

697
00:29:30,131 --> 00:29:32,305
What, you think that
it's gonna make a good marriage?

698
00:29:32,943 --> 00:29:33,948
Well, I don't.

699
00:29:34,962 --> 00:29:37,328
I don't want you to marry me
because you're placating me.

700
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:39,553
That doesn't interest me.

701
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:42,022
It doesn't interest me at all.

702
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:49,945
- Do you think he's okay?
- He'll find it.

703
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:54,302
He probably can't see.
Um, there's a flashlight in the closet.

704
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:55,475
- I'll go get it.
- Thanks.

705
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:56,480
Excuse me.

706
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,194
- I'm sorry.
- It's going fine.

707
00:30:03,945 --> 00:30:04,949
I just...

708
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,156
I don't know what to say to him.

709
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,865
Well, it's not easy.

710
00:30:09,297 --> 00:30:10,622
That's 'cause he's afraid of you.

711
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,677
I shouldn't have bit his head off.

712
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,898
I wish I could've just...

713
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:18,978
Meredith, it's okay to get angry.

714
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,738
It's you in the picture.

715
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:25,581
Izzie Stevens?

716
00:30:25,754 --> 00:30:28,483
I share something with you that
I clearly feel uncomfortable about,

717
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:29,740
and you tell Izzie Stevens?

718
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:31,444
No, I didn't tell Izzie.
I told Meredith.

719
00:30:31,445 --> 00:30:33,285
Oh! Oh, so that's better?

720
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:34,807
No, it was an accident. I--

721
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:36,525
It was an accident.

722
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:37,821
I was pissed off--

723
00:30:37,888 --> 00:30:40,067
Why can't you give me
the benefit of the doubt that--

724
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:42,119
That maybe sometimes
I'm on your side?

725
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,843
Because you choose
your friends over me

726
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:45,412
- every chance you get.
- No, I don't.

727
00:30:45,623 --> 00:30:48,769
I married you, and I haven't talked
to my best friend in weeks.

728
00:30:48,863 --> 00:30:51,519
Meanwhile you lied to me
about where we live and why.

729
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:54,493
You lied to me about your background.
You lied to me about your family!

730
00:30:54,532 --> 00:30:56,429
And still I'm the dog
who gets whacked on the nose

731
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,972
with a newspaper all the time.

732
00:30:57,998 --> 00:30:58,960
When is this gonna stop?

733
00:30:58,961 --> 00:31:01,008
- Oh, so this is my problem?
- Yeah, maybe it is.

734
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:03,782
Oh, oh, so the fact that your best
friend violently disses our marriage

735
00:31:03,783 --> 00:31:07,443
every chance she gets,
publicly, repeatedly...

736
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:09,771
Why do you think she does that?
Have you ever thought about that?

737
00:31:09,781 --> 00:31:12,264
She's having a problem with this.
I understand that.

738
00:31:12,273 --> 00:31:13,769
She has feelings for you.

739
00:31:14,924 --> 00:31:17,243
- What?
- She wants you.

740
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:20,895
She wants you.
That's what this is about.

741
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:21,975
That's why she hates me.

742
00:31:25,336 --> 00:31:29,019
George, George, do not laugh at me.
Do not laugh at me.

743
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:31,188
No. No, I'm not. I'm not.

744
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:32,959
Oh, god.

745
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:35,391
I'm not. I--

746
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,498
It's just, come on, she's Izzie.
She's--

747
00:31:38,818 --> 00:31:41,137
She's bl-- She's blonde,
she's stacked, she's--

748
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:43,334
She's a supermodel.
I'm George.

749
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:49,652
- So what does that make me?
- No.

750
00:31:49,943 --> 00:31:51,426
No, come on. You are gorgeous...

751
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,989
And you're curvy, and I never
thought you'd go for me.

752
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,049
Just shut up.

753
00:31:56,375 --> 00:32:00,429
This is my hotel room that
I pay for with my huge piles of money.

754
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:02,522
Get the hell out of it!

755
00:32:13,858 --> 00:32:15,189
I'm sorry about the lights.

756
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:17,784
Eh, whatever. The food was good.

757
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,049
- You want some pie?
- Nah, I gotta go.

758
00:32:20,312 --> 00:32:22,125
Oh, big plans. Got a hot date?

759
00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:28,895
Well, good for you.

760
00:32:30,623 --> 00:32:33,825
I guess "not interested"
really meant not interested.

761
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,215
Iz...

762
00:32:37,318 --> 00:32:39,365
- You didn't want me.
- Yeah.

763
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:43,000
But that doesn't mean I want
you to want anyone else.

764
00:32:46,057 --> 00:32:48,885
Am I gonna be alone,
pining over a dead guy forever?

765
00:32:49,693 --> 00:32:51,571
I hope not.
It's kind of a waste.

766
00:32:54,216 --> 00:32:55,568
Am I supposed to move on now?

767
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:57,850
Do people look at me and go,

768
00:32:58,197 --> 00:33:00,564
"she's gotta get over it already.
It's ruining her life"?

769
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:03,330
You'll move on when you're ready to.

770
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,413
Why are you sitting in the dark?

771
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:18,017
- Izzie blew a fuse.
- Okay, I'm having a crisis.

772
00:33:18,488 --> 00:33:20,759
Oh, I don't need rescuing.

773
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,009
Susan is very nice,
and we're getting through it.

774
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:25,787
Limping through, but we'll make it.

775
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:27,413
Okay, no, this isn't a fake crisis.

776
00:33:27,414 --> 00:33:31,879
This is a real, "my ex is about to
ruin my impending marriage" crisis.

777
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,915
Hey. Hey. Where's Izzie?

778
00:33:35,995 --> 00:33:37,000
Kitchen.

779
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:39,661
Sorry. It's not always like this.

780
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,556
Yeah, it-- it kinda is.

781
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:46,867
They're in the other room.

782
00:33:46,903 --> 00:33:48,341
I need you to get over yourself.

783
00:33:48,388 --> 00:33:49,794
I need you to start liking my wife.

784
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:51,718
I need you to like her
because sometimes I don't,

785
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:53,378
and I need you to talk me
back into it.

786
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:54,642
You say you're my friend?
That's the job.

787
00:33:54,942 --> 00:33:56,770
I need to vent,
and I need it to be okay.

788
00:33:58,293 --> 00:33:59,592
And I need to vent with alcohol.

789
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:09,304
I got married,
and I'm scared it was a bad idea.

790
00:34:11,907 --> 00:34:14,526
Nobody ever got married and
didn't think that at least once.

791
00:34:23,368 --> 00:34:24,673
Did you find the fuse box?

792
00:34:25,745 --> 00:34:27,904
Yeah. Yeah, I just needed to...

793
00:34:29,176 --> 00:34:31,082
- Take a break?
- I don't know...

794
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:35,178
how to--
Or what to talk to her about.

795
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,291
Work's a good place to start.

796
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,652
You know,
she's proud of what she does.

797
00:34:39,816 --> 00:34:40,924
She's good at it, too.

798
00:34:41,723 --> 00:34:42,812
I'd start with that.

799
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:45,234
You get each other.
That's nice.

800
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:47,986
Some days it's nice.

801
00:34:50,618 --> 00:34:51,717
Some days I'd like to...

802
00:34:51,886 --> 00:34:54,188
come home to someone
who doesn't know a thing about it.

803
00:34:55,238 --> 00:34:56,243
Rough day?

804
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:01,637
I almost lost a friend
in my own O.R.

805
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:03,937
Was it your fault?

806
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,904
I don't know.

807
00:35:11,128 --> 00:35:12,377
You were both nervous tonight.

808
00:35:13,513 --> 00:35:14,518
It'll get easier.

809
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,208
She was nervous?

810
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:19,516
She's tough.

811
00:35:20,258 --> 00:35:22,220
She tries to hide it.
She's difficult.

812
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:24,297
But if you make an effort,

813
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:25,668
she's worth it.

814
00:35:27,931 --> 00:35:28,992
You okay?

815
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,015
Not entirely.

816
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,986
She's worth the effort.

817
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,343
All right.

818
00:35:45,673 --> 00:35:47,035
Ah, nice.

819
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:52,554
- Damn it.
- Gotta go back in, huh?

820
00:36:01,223 --> 00:36:04,297
Why is there an 11-inch
incision in my chest?

821
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:07,544
You coded on the table--
Air embolus.

822
00:36:07,895 --> 00:36:09,705
I had to open you up and aspirate.

823
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,447
See, I'm sure you did a great job,

824
00:36:12,832 --> 00:36:15,163
but that's why you're gonna have
some real trouble

825
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,106
convincing me to do it again.

826
00:36:17,749 --> 00:36:18,716
Helen...

827
00:36:19,693 --> 00:36:20,697
we got it all.

828
00:36:21,824 --> 00:36:24,034
The tumor-- We never have to
go back in there again.

829
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,486
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

830
00:36:28,678 --> 00:36:31,354
You're gonna live a long,
long life.

831
00:36:32,772 --> 00:36:35,241
And here I thought
you were just being an ass.

832
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:37,307
Ah, I was an ass.

833
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:45,095
I had no right to push you
like that.

834
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:47,930
No, you did not.

835
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:50,993
I was going through
some stuff, and I just-- I...

836
00:36:52,072 --> 00:36:53,143
I was an ass.

837
00:36:55,002 --> 00:36:59,417
But in this moment, you're the ass
who gave me my life back.

838
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,821
I'm so glad we did this.

839
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:06,771
I am, too.Thank you for suggesting it.
Because I--

840
00:37:06,772 --> 00:37:09,213
You never would have
in a million years.

841
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:11,785
- God night, sweetie.
- Thank you. Good night.

842
00:37:15,378 --> 00:37:17,886
I'm-- I'm sorry
about your mother.

843
00:37:18,421 --> 00:37:19,425
Thank you.

844
00:37:19,998 --> 00:37:21,003
Thanks.

845
00:37:23,478 --> 00:37:24,511
Swing's still here.

846
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,342
Yes, it, uh, doesn't swing.
Nobody uses it.

847
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,425
Here.

848
00:37:38,124 --> 00:37:40,979
I put this in there.
You used to catch your fingers in it.

849
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,654
Suck it up,

850
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:07,326
go back with your tail between
your legs and just apologize.

851
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:09,172
- No!
- No, really. Look, you just--

852
00:38:09,173 --> 00:38:12,069
- I'm always apologizing.
- "I'm sorry. I'm an ass." blah.

853
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,248
And it's over.
And then it's all over.

854
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:17,735
No. Not real--
I can't be wrong all the time.

855
00:38:18,438 --> 00:38:20,693
Is that really possible?
Don't-- Don't finish it.

856
00:38:20,702 --> 00:38:22,930
- Hey, don't be grabby.
- You-- I don't have any.

857
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:25,034
Bogie.

858
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:29,123
Maybe you're wrong all the time,
maybe she's just really insecure.

859
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:30,936
It doesn't matter.
You still have to grovel.

860
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:32,430
Don't you-- Fill...

861
00:38:33,454 --> 00:38:35,135
Yeah, um, she's...

862
00:38:35,889 --> 00:38:37,307
She's insecure.

863
00:38:37,939 --> 00:38:39,297
Yeah. That is a fact.

864
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:42,127
She's insecure.

865
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,375
What?

866
00:38:45,638 --> 00:38:46,690
What?

867
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:48,512
Just tell me.

868
00:38:49,582 --> 00:38:50,962
- Come on.
- No.

869
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,072
Come on!

870
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:54,227
Shut up.

871
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,274
No, it's, um, ju-- nothing.

872
00:38:58,284 --> 00:39:02,763
Just that she thinks you have feelings
for me, like that's the problem.

873
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:05,892
I love that.
That's fabulous.

874
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:08,243
- And-- and-- and...
- Oh, I need a tissue.

875
00:39:08,271 --> 00:39:10,549
That, uh,
I-I-I desperately want you.

876
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,006
I'm crying.

877
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,602
I'm crying.

878
00:39:21,499 --> 00:39:22,898
Is she crazy?

879
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,916
You know, I think--
I think she's maybe a little crazy.

880
00:39:27,982 --> 00:39:29,511
- Oh, can't breathe.
- Shut up.

881
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:30,729
I can't breathe.

882
00:39:31,343 --> 00:39:32,357
We gotta be quiet.

883
00:39:45,986 --> 00:39:47,184
Scary day, huh?

884
00:39:48,301 --> 00:39:50,226
Well, your amniotic sac's intact,

885
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:52,211
the placenta's in good position.

886
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:55,451
Dr. Montgomery sewed your cervix up
so tight, nothing's coming outta there.

887
00:39:56,184 --> 00:39:58,043
So the baby's gonna be okay?

888
00:39:59,902 --> 00:40:01,648
We're gonna have to see how it goes.

889
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,325
I'm sorry.

890
00:40:05,575 --> 00:40:08,205
You asked me what I thought,
and I told you to go for it, and...

891
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:09,603
I'm...

892
00:40:10,473 --> 00:40:12,473
- I'm really sorry.
- It's not your fault.

893
00:40:12,595 --> 00:40:15,185
No, see, when I pulled you out
of that water at the ferry, I...

894
00:40:15,684 --> 00:40:16,689
You're...

895
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,538
I talked to you like you were
my sister, and I shouldn't have.

896
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,436
I'm an intern.

897
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:25,589
You gotta get your medical
advice from an attending.

898
00:40:25,892 --> 00:40:28,267
I asked you 'cause I trust you.

899
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:32,682
Why don't you sit and tell me
a bedtime story or something?

900
00:40:33,593 --> 00:40:34,767
<i>What's worse,</i>

901
00:40:35,546 --> 00:40:38,201
<i>new wounds,
which are so horribly painful...</i>

902
00:40:40,098 --> 00:40:42,098
Move over.
You're in the middle of the bed.

903
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,349
<i>Or old wounds that should've
healed years ago and never did?</i>

904
00:40:56,694 --> 00:40:58,584
Am I gonna screw up this engagement?

905
00:41:01,129 --> 00:41:02,823
I don't know. Do you want to?

906
00:41:06,438 --> 00:41:07,470
I don't know.

907
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:12,111
My mom is dead.

908
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:16,721
Yeah, she is.

909
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:21,247
<i>Maybe our old wounds teach us something.</i>

910
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:25,563
<i>They remind us of where we've been</i>

911
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:27,872
<i>and what we've overcome.</i>

912
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,724
<i>They teach us lessons about
what to avoid in the future.</i>

913
00:41:36,235 --> 00:41:37,700
<i>That's what we like to think.</i>

914
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:42,453
<i>But that's not the way it is, is it?</i>

915
00:41:44,453 --> 00:41:47,465
<i>Some things we just have to learn,</i>

916
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:49,621
<i>over and over,</i>

917
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,563
<i>and over again.</i>

918
00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:13,520
