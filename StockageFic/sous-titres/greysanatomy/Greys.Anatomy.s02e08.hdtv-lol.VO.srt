1
00:00:00,056 --> 00:00:01,365
Previously on
"Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:02,302
Her or me.

3
00:00:02,398 --> 00:00:04,685
I need him to stop
talking to Meredith.

4
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:06,535
- You're staying with her.
- She's my wife.

5
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:08,027
I broke up with Derek.

6
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:11,023
- So where are we?
- We are a couple.

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,951
I know the rules, but I don't want to
have a relationship that's secret.

8
00:00:16,112 --> 00:00:17,424
Boys are stupid.

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,156
- What, you got a date?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

10
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:24,396
- You're married?
- Ten years today.

11
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,502
- How come I didn't know you were married?
- You never asked.

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,623
In the eighth grade, my english
class had to read "Romeo and Juliet."

13
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:43,357
Then for extra credit, Mrs. Snyder
made us act out all the parts.

14
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:49,741
Sal Scaffarillo was Romeo.

15
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:53,765
As fate would have it,
I was Juliet.

16
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:05,492
All the other
girls were jealous,

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,241
but I had a slightly
different take.

18
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:11,955
I told Mrs. Snyder
that Juliet was an idiot.

19
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:20,130
For starters, she falls for the
one guy she knows she can't have,

20
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,327
then she blames fate for
her own bad decision.

21
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:30,211
- You kissed me.
- Yes, I did.

22
00:01:30,378 --> 00:01:31,748
Should we--I mean...

23
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:36,605
there's a discussion we could have
if you wanted to have one be--

24
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:41,335
Izzie, I kissed you with tongue,
and I plan to do it again and again.

25
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,338
Get used to it.

26
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:44,687
End of discussion.

27
00:01:50,654 --> 00:01:54,555
Mrs. Snyder explained to me
that when fate comes into play,

28
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,129
choice sometimes
goes out the window.

29
00:01:57,764 --> 00:01:58,652
God.

30
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:05,718
Congratulations.

31
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:07,502
Uh, on what?

32
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:08,778
Your fellowships.

33
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:11,072
Five applications, five offers.

34
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,793
Do you know how rare that is?

35
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:14,019
This is your year.

36
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:15,831
Everybody wants to
dance with you.

37
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:19,050
Of course, Seattle Grace's
fellowship program is the best.

38
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:20,731
Oh, yeah.

39
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:22,995
Yeah.

40
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:32,038
- You are taking my fellowship, aren't you?
- I... don't know.

41
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:34,278
I-I haven't made
a decision yet.

42
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:40,277
At the ripe old age of 13,
I was very clear that love, like life,

43
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:41,781
is about making choices...

44
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,053
I would not wish
this on anyone.

45
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,544
Literally, it's like someone
reached in and ripped my guts out.

46
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:47,040
Baby, you had food poisoning.

47
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:50,122
I had one lousy
restaurant clam.

48
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:54,314
Wait a minute,
where's billing again?

49
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:56,104
- The basement.
- The basement.

50
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:58,817
And fate has nothing
to do with it.

51
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,280
We're going the wrong way.

52
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:03,551
Coffee?

53
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:05,149
Oh, thank you.

54
00:03:06,134 --> 00:03:07,173
It's date night.

55
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:09,818
Yeah, it's a night,
uh, with a date.

56
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,938
- You forgot.
- No.

57
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,146
Yes.

58
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:16,951
You want to cancel?

59
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:19,794
No.

60
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,644
Everyone thinks
it's so romantic--

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,670
Romeo and Juliet,
true love, how sad.

62
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,969
Crap!

63
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:39,218
If Juliet was stupid enough
to fall for the enemy,

64
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,683
drink a bottle of poison and
go to sleep in a mausoleum...

65
00:03:44,414 --> 00:03:46,418
she deserved whatever she got.

70
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:23,094
Window washer fell from
fifth floor scaffolding,

71
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:25,248
obvious open tib/fib fracture,

72
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,448
- but otherwise, okay.
- Equal breath sounds.

73
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:29,535
After a 5-story fall,
he's got equal breath sounds.

74
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:31,515
It's unbelievable.
Do you want to hear?

75
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:32,998
Somehow, I believe you.

76
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:35,217
Yang, get in there and
palpate his abdomen.

77
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:37,954
- Does this hurt anywhere?
- No.

78
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:40,913
You fell from the sky--five
stories--and you only injured your leg.

79
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:43,641
- George.
- No, don't "George" me.

80
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:45,898
A few seconds earlier,
he would've landed on me.

81
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:47,436
Okay, rolling on three, please.

82
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:49,169
One, two, three.

83
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:54,908
Are these feathers?

84
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:57,472
My life was saved
by that pigeon.

85
00:04:57,662 --> 00:05:00,170
Let's get some x-rays,
and after that,

86
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:03,436
you might wanna get in there
and look for the rest of tweety.

87
00:05:04,622 --> 00:05:05,585
Thank you.

88
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:08,540
Esme wanted to wait until
tomorrow to see her doctor,

89
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:11,764
but she hasn't been able to keep
anything down since yesterday,

90
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:13,192
so I brought her in.

91
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:18,807
Okay, Mrs. Sorrento,
you have acute cholecystitis,

92
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:21,472
which means that your
gallbladder may have to come out.

93
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:22,678
She has gallstones?

94
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:25,218
He watches cable.
He thinks he's a doctor.

95
00:05:27,715 --> 00:05:32,170
I'm giving you antibiotics and I.V.
fluids to cool the gallbladder down.

96
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:34,168
And then I'm gonna
go call Dr. Bailey,

97
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:37,255
and I'm going to see if surgery
is the best way for us to go.

98
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:38,717
Do you have any questions?

99
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:41,007
Honey, what happened
to your forehead?

100
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:43,211
Nothing.

101
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:47,216
I've already told you,
I don't need an appointment.

102
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:48,481
I  am not a patient.

103
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:50,960
I am a friend from New York.

104
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:53,579
- Weiss?
- Derek.

105
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,179
I've been looking for you.

106
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:56,443
Sav.

107
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:58,484
Why didn't you tell
me you were coming?

108
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:03,082
If  I knew you were coming,
I would've taken the day off.

109
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,812
- Well, it's kind of last minute.
- Is everything okay? Are you all right?

110
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:11,210
A month ago, her mother died.
Ovarian cancer.

111
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,046
Catherine died?

112
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:16,242
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:21,016
And Savvy, she's--I mean,
you know how close they were.

114
00:06:21,144 --> 00:06:24,694
I mean, all she can think about is
this breast and ovarian cancer gene.

115
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:26,318
B.R.C.A.

116
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:30,946
A positive test result isn't
the end of the world, Sav.

117
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,241
It just means you
have a gene mutation

118
00:06:33,328 --> 00:06:35,078
- that could--
- I know what it is.

119
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:38,843
I've talked to the genetic counselor,
I've been to my gynecologist,

120
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:41,323
and now I'm here.

121
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:50,029
Addie, you're the best
surgeon there is.

122
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,160
True.

123
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:56,248
- But this isn't surgical.
- Yes, it is.

124
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:59,299
No, Sav.
You understand, you don't have cancer?

125
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:01,851
And I have no intention
of getting it.

126
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:09,965
So you want me...

127
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:12,531
I want you to take out my
ovaries and the uterus,

128
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:14,367
and when that's done...

129
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:19,138
you're gonna find the best person
out there to cut off my breasts.

130
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:33,141
- We need to widen this incision to take a better look.
- All right.

131
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:38,588
- Does your leg hurt a lot?
- I'm fine, man.

132
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:40,617
Just... do your thing.

133
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:44,475
Is there anyone you'd
like me to call?

134
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:45,536
What for?

135
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,918
You fell five stories and
lived to tell about it.

136
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,502
I'd kind of want to shout
it from the rooftops...

137
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:54,128
so to speak.

138
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:55,684
It's a miracle.

139
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:58,007
You may not understand
the medicine of it,

140
00:07:58,096 --> 00:07:59,145
but a 5-story fall--

141
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:01,462
your lungs should be collapsed,
your back should be broken,

142
00:08:01,492 --> 00:08:04,631
- your aorta should be totally severed.
- George, enough.

143
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:13,971
I'm just saying, you know,
there's a reason for this.

144
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,282
You lived. We both did.

145
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,783
Carpe diem, man.

146
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:21,477
Seize the day.

147
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:25,568
Any chance you could
make him leave?

148
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,475
I really, really wish I could.

149
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:32,706
Mr. Vargas,
your lower left leg bones are shattered.

150
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,709
We'll need to get
you into surgery.

151
00:08:34,923 --> 00:08:36,004
Oh, great.

152
00:08:36,352 --> 00:08:37,614
Just my luck.

153
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:38,819
Beak.

154
00:08:40,516 --> 00:08:43,106
Could I--would you mind?
Could I keep that?

155
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,463
My mother died of it, my aunt,

156
00:08:46,574 --> 00:08:50,084
- my cousin--she's 37--has ovarian cancer.
- But you don't.

157
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:51,267
You don't have cancer.

158
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,217
- This is crazy, Savvy.
- But I have the gene, Weiss.

159
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,580
Which gives her up to an 85%
chance of getting cancer, Weiss.

160
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:58,192
And a 15% chance she won't.

161
00:08:58,211 --> 00:08:59,578
- I'm sorry. Were you invited?
- I'm not betting my life on 15%.

162
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:02,162
- Weiss asked me to come.
- I thought it might help.

163
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:05,803
Help what? I'm sorry, Derek, 'cause I
love you and I'm really glad to see you,

164
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:10,233
but until you grow a uterus and watch
your mother die from this disease, you don't get--

165
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:11,624
you don't get a vote.

166
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:13,481
- Did she tell you they're trying to get pregnant?
- Yes, she did.

167
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,702
- Having a hysterectomy is gonna throw a wrench into that.
- Derek!

168
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:18,046
- We've been trying for months.
- Why give up now?

169
00:09:18,076 --> 00:09:18,890
Come on.

170
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:20,205
We've talked about this.

171
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:22,086
There are other ways to
make a family, Weiss.

172
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:24,416
- We can adopt. We can do--
- Savvy, I just--

173
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,533
No. No!
I'm not talking about this.

174
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:30,291
Let's just take a step back.

175
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,298
All right,
take a deep breath and think about this.

176
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:36,234
I've already thought
about it, Derek.

177
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:37,254
This...

178
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:40,162
this is going to happen.

179
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,162
Dr. Stevens, get a complete
history and do her pre-op labs.

180
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,722
Get her scheduled for
a double mastectomy

181
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,882
and consult Dr. Cwynar in
plastics for her reconstruction.

182
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:48,686
Derek--

183
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:52,218
- Addison, this conversation is not over.
- She is my patient, Derek.

184
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:56,132
We're doing a bilateral prophylactic
oophorectomy and hysterectomy tomorrow.

185
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:58,056
Get moving.

186
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:01,324
Prophylactic surgery
is extreme.

187
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:03,048
Oh! This has nothing
to do with you.

188
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:03,998
Why were you even in there?

189
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:05,861
She came to me for a
medical consultation, Derek.

190
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:07,125
I'm her doctor. Me.

191
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,766
Those are some of
our closest friends.

192
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:11,152
- This isn't medical it is personal.
- Fine. Okay.

193
00:10:11,182 --> 00:10:15,520
If it's personal, then we should be
dealing with them as a couple, acting like a couple.

194
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,898
What? What does that mean?

195
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,139
- See the ring?
- Don't go to the ring.

196
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,215
The ring, Derek, remember?

197
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:25,889
When  we're here at work, you won't talk
to me, or on the ferry where you pretend not to see me,

198
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,833
or in couples therapy three times a week where we're arguing
about whether or not we should be in couples therapy--

199
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:31,772
What are we doing?

200
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:33,472
- This is not about us.
- It is.

201
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:36,269
Medicine aside, our friends are
going through hell in there,

202
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,849
and we can't even act like we like
each other long enough to help them.

203
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,518
What's  that other animal
that's monogamous?

204
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:49,147
I think it's wolves.

205
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,695
Oh, I know it's hard.

206
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:51,868
I'm a pincushion.

207
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:53,153
It's okay. Don't worry.

208
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:55,384
I won't stick until
I find a good one.

209
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:58,329
- Otters mate for life, you know?
- Excuse me?

210
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:01,412
As do wolves, I suppose.

211
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:04,921
Okay, I got it. Hold still.

212
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:08,045
It's gonna take a second
for the tube to fill.

213
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:09,735
Mm, I've always liked otters.

214
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:12,610
I've always been more
of a dog person myself.

215
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,323
Shouldn't he be more excited?

216
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:20,504
Maybe he's in shock.

217
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:22,100
I mean, he survived.

218
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,108
That's huge.

219
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:26,027
He's gotta realize that
things happen for a reason.

220
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:28,657
Oh, yeah. My ex-boyfriend
moved his wife to Seattle.

221
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:30,375
Reason? To torture me.

222
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:32,073
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

223
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:35,006
- What's with the hello kitty on your forehead?
- I don't want to talk about it.

224
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:36,561
George, can I sign
out to you early?

225
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:39,273
- You don't want in on Stu's surgery?
- Can't.

226
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,902
I have a test date.

227
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,148
Burke is testing me.

228
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:45,833
Plus, I've already spent an hour picking
bird parts out of the guy, I'm over it.

229
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:46,931
Carpe diem.

230
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:50,626
I have a giant zit on my forehead and
I'm beginning to look how I feel, carpe that.

231
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:53,218
This is the luckiest
day in the world.

232
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:55,556
Tell that to the bird.

233
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:02,208
Thank you.

234
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,573
Is it the kid thing?

235
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:06,866
I saw your face upstairs.

236
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,708
It's the kid thing
for most people.

237
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:12,699
And the breasts.

238
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:16,456
Oh, and the total menopause,
like, overnight.

239
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:17,638
It's a big step.

240
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:19,080
Well, I think it's brave.

241
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:20,212
Thank you.

242
00:12:20,558 --> 00:12:22,629
And, yes,
I'd love to be pregnant.

243
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:23,788
I want a lot of things.

244
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:26,915
I want to skydive,
I'd like to learn italian.

245
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:30,680
I want to go Saint-Tropez with my
husband and lie topless on the beach.

246
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:33,348
They do excellent implants and
reconstructions these days.

247
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,425
Won't even know the difference,
plus, you know,

248
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,115
you'll never have to
wear a bra again.

249
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:38,422
That's something, right?

250
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:39,646
Alex...

251
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:43,859
didn't I see your service on the O.R.
board for a biopsy right about now?

252
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:51,472
- It's not the kid thing.
- Okay. What?

253
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:55,883
It's not like I have
a lot of options.

254
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:58,323
One, take my chances
and never get cancer.

255
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:00,162
Two, take my chances
and die young.

256
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:01,782
There's a third option,
you know?

257
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:02,928
Okay, I'm listening.

258
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:06,529
Take your chances, get cancer,
and fight like hell to survive.

259
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:14,150
Uh... they're both really nice.

260
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:15,915
I know. I bought them.

261
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:17,191
But which one's right?

262
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:19,959
For what?
You're gonna look hot in either one.

263
00:13:19,989 --> 00:13:21,123
Well,  clearly.

264
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:22,317
That's not the point.

265
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:23,687
Wow, you look hot.

266
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:27,389
Yeah, Burke and I are gonna talk
about how hot I am over dinner.

267
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:29,719
This date is such a mistake.

268
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:31,513
It's easy to get
nervous on dates.

269
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:33,413
It's especially hard if
you're out of practice,

270
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:36,574
- so you just gotta be mellow, relaxed--
- I know how to date, George.

271
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:37,462
I'm not you.

272
00:13:37,577 --> 00:13:39,249
Well, I have her scheduled
for the mastectomy,

273
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,345
and I get to stay while plastics
does a transflap reconstruction.

274
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,292
I couldn't do it.

275
00:13:43,425 --> 00:13:47,245
Do what, make yourself all hot and
sexy for your boyfriend like Yang?

276
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:48,875
Go wrestle something.

277
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,578
I couldn't cut off my ovaries and
breasts just because I might have cancer.

278
00:13:52,608 --> 00:13:53,706
Think of it like a hand.

279
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:57,482
If someone told you you'd die if you
didn't chop off your hand, you'd do it.

280
00:13:57,512 --> 00:14:00,816
Except when you chop off a hand,
you don't kill your sex drive,

281
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:05,122
have silicone breasts, get hot flashes
and lose your ability to bear children.

282
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:06,764
If it were me,
I wouldn't even have the test.

283
00:14:06,794 --> 00:14:07,772
I mean, what's the point?

284
00:14:07,802 --> 00:14:09,502
We're all gonna
die anyway, right?

285
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:13,349
It's the hello kitty
band-aid on my forehead.

286
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:14,503
It's freakin' me out.

287
00:14:16,158 --> 00:14:17,608
I say slice 'em and dice 'em.

288
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:19,016
Whatever. They're body parts.

289
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:20,591
Oh, so you'd cut
off your penis?

290
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:21,781
If it kept me from dying.

291
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:22,834
Besides...

292
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:24,785
I've got plenty to spare.

293
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,580
I could do hot in my sleep.

294
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,765
I look hot in scrubs.

295
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:34,228
I'm a hot person.

296
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:38,503
He's seen me naked
a thousand times.

297
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,141
Bad, bad images in my head.

298
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:42,932
But he's never seen you
outside the hospital.

299
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,694
Thank you.

300
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,834
You look lovely.

301
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:55,686
Thanks.

302
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:05,996
Very polite.

303
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,848
Okay, Grey, adhesions are down.

304
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:20,026
What next?

305
00:15:20,501 --> 00:15:23,907
Put in graspers to lift the
gallbladder so we can dissect it out.

306
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:27,175
Good. And what are we looking
for in calot's triangle?

307
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:30,099
- The cystic artery.
- That's right.

308
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:31,480
Wait a minute.

309
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:33,751
What do you see?

310
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,211
Porcelain gallbladder.

311
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:39,842
That's not good.

312
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:46,588
Mr. Sorrento,
when we removed your wife's gallbladder,

313
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,277
we found that there
were calcifications.

314
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,848
What does that mean?

315
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:53,588
It's often a sign of
gallbladder cancer.

316
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:56,275
We sent it off to pathology.

317
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:02,160
- She has cancer?
- I'm afraid so.

318
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:04,041
We can keep her
comfortable but,

319
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:07,739
she's going to need more tests
to see what our next steps are.

320
00:16:07,784 --> 00:16:09,881
This might include
more surgery.

321
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,356
But this--this surgery
will save her, right?

322
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,691
The cancer appears
to be advanced.

323
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:18,951
There are palliative
surgeries that we can do.

324
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:21,338
That is surgeries to
help with the pain.

325
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:23,369
But it won't cure it.

326
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:28,081
How long has she got?

327
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:32,573
From what we can tell so far,
she has about four to six months.

328
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,039
I'm so sorry.

329
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,868
I don't want Esme to know.

330
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:45,372
What?

331
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,309
Esme--I don't want her
to know she's dying.

332
00:16:48,696 --> 00:16:50,154
You don't want to tell her?

333
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,863
Please... you saw her.

334
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:54,430
She's happy.

335
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:56,727
Let me take her home.

336
00:16:57,907 --> 00:17:00,439
I don't want her to be
afraid before she dies.

337
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:02,639
She  doesn't need to know.

338
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,878
No, please, don't.

339
00:17:16,471 --> 00:17:18,057
No more carpe diem, man.

340
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:19,805
I don't want to seize the day.

341
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:20,922
See, that's what I don't get.

342
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:24,002
I'm standing here, and I'm just
incredibly happy to be alive.

343
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:26,388
You know, I'm lookin' at the sky,
it's bluer.

344
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,965
Food tastes better.

345
00:17:28,354 --> 00:17:30,652
And I didn't survive
a 5-story fall.

346
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:43,093
You jumped, didn't you?

347
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:54,189
All the way down,
all I can think about was Daisy.

348
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,150
She's my ex-girl.

349
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:58,131
She works in this hospital.

350
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:01,452
Pfft. What kind
of joke is that?

351
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:07,854
Maybe you got a second chance.

352
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:14,947
Daisy--you got to go
and find her for me.

353
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:17,043
You know, talk to her...

354
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:20,240
tell her she's the
reason I'm alive.

355
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:25,748
You know, we had a future.

356
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:26,928
You know, we had plans.

357
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,622
We picked out baby
names together.

358
00:18:31,372 --> 00:18:32,680
She betrayed that...

359
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:35,014
without even asking
my opinion...

360
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:40,243
without even giving me
time to process it.

361
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:44,652
It's a difficult time,
for both of you.

362
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:47,651
She's emotional.

363
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:49,861
And hormone changes,
mood swings...

364
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,290
they say she could
lose her sex drive.

365
00:18:54,304 --> 00:18:56,918
You'll get through this,
all right?

366
00:18:58,449 --> 00:18:59,595
You can do this.

367
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:02,417
You guys love each other.

368
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,933
Is that what you said
about you and Addie?

369
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,121
What?

370
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:11,143
You left her.

371
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:12,566
That was different.

372
00:19:12,831 --> 00:19:14,018
Was it, Derek?

373
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:16,113
Really?

374
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:22,335
You know, I gotta check on a
patient then get ready for dinner.

375
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:24,675
I'll see you later.

376
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,578
Sure.

377
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:40,828
Where's the butter?

378
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:46,121
Oh, no. That's olive oil.
I want butter.

379
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:52,134
Should I send the
sommelier over?

380
00:19:52,263 --> 00:19:53,674
Ah, that won't be necessary.

381
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,984
Uh, what is a, um,
nice, okay Chardonnay?

382
00:19:57,067 --> 00:19:58,135
Oh, I want Bordeaux.

383
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:00,352
The Chardonnay will be
better with the lobster.

384
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:01,613
I'm having steak.

385
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:06,745
You--you eat red meat?

386
00:20:07,464 --> 00:20:08,373
You don't?

387
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:19,145
You're seriously going to
try to find this girl,

388
00:20:19,172 --> 00:20:21,412
hunt her down while
she's working?

389
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:22,411
Look...

390
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:26,915
Okay, I know it's crazy, but
someone's gotta tell her how he feels.

391
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:28,399
I mean, he's alive, right?

392
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:30,195
Something good has got
to come out of this.

393
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:32,528
I mean,
this could change everything.

394
00:20:34,302 --> 00:20:35,340
See, I...

395
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:37,737
I thought you were a romantic.

396
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,428
"Was"--past tense.

397
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:45,025
Well, this is fun. Hello again.

398
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:48,888
I like the hello kitty,
by the way.

399
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:51,073
Very pink, very cheerful.

400
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:56,381
- Daisy works in billing, which is where?
- In the basement.

401
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:08,486
You need somethin', chief?

402
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:11,139
- I have one more surgery, and then I'm free.
- No, no.

403
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:16,695
- Have you made a decision yet?
- Sir?

404
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,323
The fellowship.

405
00:21:18,424 --> 00:21:19,726
The Seattle Grace fellowship.

406
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:20,932
I thought you would've
accepted by now.

407
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:23,827
- Busy. I just haven't had a chance to fill out--
- We're a private hospital,

408
00:21:23,857 --> 00:21:25,257
we have extensive resources.

409
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:28,152
You'll get more surgical experience
here than anywhere else.

410
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:29,457
You can write your own ticket.

411
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:30,729
Why aren't you more excited?

412
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,873
No, I'm excited.

413
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:32,520
I just...

414
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:33,846
I'm sorry. Excuse me, sir.

415
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,342
I just--I need to scrub in.

416
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:45,548
What?

417
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,642
Oh. Nothing.

418
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,226
You know,
we should probably skip dessert.

419
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:55,956
I have a--I have
an early morning.

420
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,925
Oh. Right.

421
00:21:58,711 --> 00:21:59,710
Not a problem.

422
00:22:08,797 --> 00:22:09,570
Oh, my god. Help!

423
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,900
Is there a doctor in here?

424
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:13,938
- Yes!
- Yes!

425
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:16,969
Call 9-1-1.

426
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:17,994
He said he was
having heartburn.

427
00:22:18,024 --> 00:22:18,799
I thought he was joking.

428
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:21,329
- Is there a pulse?
- Yes, it's rapid and unequal.

429
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:26,844
Look at this--

430
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,355
the length of his fingers.

431
00:22:28,385 --> 00:22:31,143
- Oh, he's gotta be at least 6'4".
- Marfan's.

432
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:32,626
What do his fingers have
to do with anything?

433
00:22:32,656 --> 00:22:35,350
Your husband is showing classic
markers for Marfan's syndrome.

434
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,916
It means that the walls of
his blood vessels are weak.

435
00:22:37,946 --> 00:22:40,306
- We need that ambulance.
- Fast. He could be dissecting.

436
00:22:40,336 --> 00:22:42,523
- We need to get him to the O.R.--
- Before his aorta ruptures.

437
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:43,488
What are you talking about?

438
00:22:43,518 --> 00:22:44,579
Who are you people?

439
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:46,580
We have a dissecting
thoracic aorta.

440
00:22:46,654 --> 00:22:48,792
We need a C.T.
cleared and an O.R. ready.

441
00:22:48,923 --> 00:22:52,119
Start another large bore I.V.,
continue high-flow o2,

442
00:22:52,177 --> 00:22:54,881
transport sirens and
lights to Seattle Grace.

443
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,973
Who the hell are you?

444
00:22:56,003 --> 00:22:59,203
Hey, he's the cardiothoracic
surgeon who's gonna operate on him.

445
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:00,848
And she's with me.

446
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:10,370
Oh, I didn't--

447
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:12,267
have you been discharged?

448
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:13,315
N-no.

449
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:16,615
I'm going out to dinner with
my surgeon and our husbands.

450
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,491
Sort of a last supper, I guess.

451
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:22,181
I know, I know,
nothing after midnight.

452
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:25,053
You're disappointed,
aren't you?

453
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:27,627
How do I look?

454
00:23:28,962 --> 00:23:30,708
You're a beautiful woman.

455
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:32,102
And so are you.

456
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,377
Is that why this is so
hard to understand?

457
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:40,701
Oh...

458
00:23:41,431 --> 00:23:43,150
menopause, I know.

459
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:44,945
The boobs.

460
00:23:46,376 --> 00:23:49,707
But they have hormone
replacement, reconstructions.

461
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:52,406
But the sexy Savvy...

462
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:57,426
the Savvy that gets noticed
when she walks into the room...

463
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:04,422
the Savvy that loves to wake her husband
up in the middle of the night to make love...

464
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:09,515
Yeah, I wonder if that
Savvy's still gonna be there.

465
00:24:11,874 --> 00:24:12,940
Honestly, I--

466
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:13,913
I haven't a clue.

467
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:20,260
But then I think,
is that why Weiss married me?

468
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:25,158
God, I hope not.

469
00:24:39,223 --> 00:24:40,776
Could this place be
any further away?

470
00:24:40,806 --> 00:24:42,206
It's like Siberia down here.

471
00:24:42,288 --> 00:24:44,288
That's 'cause we don't
like sick people.

472
00:24:46,222 --> 00:24:48,172
You know,
you're--you're in a hospital.

473
00:24:50,554 --> 00:24:53,243
Uh, are you Daisy?

474
00:24:53,382 --> 00:24:55,816
I don't deal with billing
questions after 7 P.M.

475
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:57,219
I'm just data entry at night.

476
00:24:57,249 --> 00:24:58,514
No, actually, uh...

477
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,320
Stu sent me.

478
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,881
Is this some kind of joke?

479
00:25:03,911 --> 00:25:05,755
No. He's in this hospital.

480
00:25:06,345 --> 00:25:07,274
He's had an accident.

481
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:08,604
I'm his doctor. He's fine.

482
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:10,148
We're taking him into surgery.

483
00:25:10,396 --> 00:25:12,449
Um, but he wanted
me to find you.

484
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:20,721
Well, you just tell that bastard that he
could've come lookin' for me, like, ten years ago.

485
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:39,151
What are you pissed about?

486
00:25:41,449 --> 00:25:43,172
You look at everything
in a skirt.

487
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:47,032
I'd look at you in a skirt--short,
maybe something schoolgirl, pleated.

488
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:52,021
If that skirt didn't have a pair of big,
bouncing boobs attached to it, you'd stop looking.

489
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,251
When you cut 'em off,
you build 'em back up.

490
00:25:54,498 --> 00:25:55,766
Maybe you get to upgrade.

491
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:56,836
Life goes on.

492
00:25:57,575 --> 00:25:59,731
If there was a genetic test
for testicular cancer,

493
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:02,520
do you think men who tested
positive would have the surgery?

494
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,756
No. You know why?

495
00:26:03,846 --> 00:26:05,007
It's castration.

496
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:09,502
What man would willingly get rid of the
part of his anatomy that makes him a man?

497
00:26:10,764 --> 00:26:12,873
This woman is having
herself castrated,

498
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:15,479
and we book an O.R.
and act like it means nothing.

499
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:17,089
It's not nothing.

500
00:26:18,037 --> 00:26:20,473
God, how can you possibly
act like it's no big deal?

501
00:26:20,503 --> 00:26:21,803
I mean, what if it was me?

502
00:26:21,898 --> 00:26:24,508
Izzie, you're freaking out.

503
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:25,659
You know that, right?

504
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:27,342
If I was the one with
the cancer gene,

505
00:26:27,372 --> 00:26:29,859
if I showed up tomorrow and
my boobs were made of plastic

506
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:33,771
and my skin had aged ten years
and my sex drive had dried up--

507
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:37,903
if it was me, Alex,
would you be so fine with it then?

508
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:40,238
Yeah.

509
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,124
You'd be really hot to kiss me
with tongue then, wouldn't you?

510
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:55,032
Dr. Bailey's scrubbing in,
so we're gonna get started.

511
00:26:55,062 --> 00:26:56,859
Okay. Hey, George.

512
00:26:56,976 --> 00:26:59,247
Listen, uh, did you find her?

513
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,433
I'm very sorry, Stu.

514
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:06,937
They said she was on vacation.

515
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:08,607
Oh, yeah?

516
00:27:10,653 --> 00:27:12,043
Maybe her parents.

517
00:27:12,762 --> 00:27:14,992
I bet you she went
up to New Hampshire.

518
00:27:15,025 --> 00:27:17,262
- That's where she's from.
- I'm gonna push the joy juice.

519
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:18,617
Ooh. Up, up and away.

520
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:20,751
Maybe you can see her
after your surgery.

521
00:27:20,781 --> 00:27:22,291
You know, when you recover.
Maybe then.

522
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:23,844
It's all good, man.

523
00:27:24,605 --> 00:27:26,033
Thanks for tryin'.

524
00:27:26,836 --> 00:27:28,399
It really meant a lot--

525
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:31,908
Hold on, guys.

526
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:33,051
There's a problem.

527
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:34,098
He's crashing?

528
00:27:34,396 --> 00:27:35,541
Dr. Bailey.

529
00:27:35,903 --> 00:27:37,272
O'Malley, start C.P.R.

530
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:41,663
Push epi.

531
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:51,698
- You'll need to notify the family.
- What happened?

532
00:27:51,728 --> 00:27:53,080
There'll be an autopsy.

533
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:55,886
Sometimes, people get on the table,
and they just die.

534
00:27:56,036 --> 00:27:59,186
There's no way of knowing beforehand,
no way of controlling it.

535
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,059
But he fell five
stories and lived.

536
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,440
It doesn't make any sense.

537
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,836
He survived so I could
go and find Daisy,

538
00:28:04,931 --> 00:28:07,605
and then she didn't even want to
see him, so what's the point?

539
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:10,485
We're all part of the
cosmic joke, O'Malley.

540
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,658
Now leave me alone.

541
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:15,620
- Oh, Dr. Bailey.
- What?

542
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,817
Mr. Sorrento doesn't want me to
tell his wife that she's dying.

543
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:21,934
- You haven't told her yet?
- No.

544
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:23,676
Okay, I didn't
hear you say that.

545
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,120
You're her doctor.

546
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,544
It's your responsibility
to give your patients

547
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:29,864
the information necessary to
make an informed decision.

548
00:28:29,894 --> 00:28:32,294
Now I'm hungry, I'm tired,
and you're in my way.

549
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,589
- Can you see the echo from here?
- That dissection isn't subtle.

550
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:40,019
Did you see that wingspan...

551
00:28:40,062 --> 00:28:42,337
- and the pectus carinatum?
- What about his palate?

552
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,195
The definition of high-arched.

553
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:56,171
You're being wooed, aren't you?

554
00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:57,553
Excuse me?

555
00:28:57,648 --> 00:28:58,398
The fellowship.

556
00:28:58,481 --> 00:29:00,250
L.A. Med, Chicago Central--

557
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,714
they're wooing you.

558
00:29:01,812 --> 00:29:04,030
I mean, you're fielding offers,
you're looking at bonus packages.

559
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,503
You're letting
yourself be wooed.

560
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:07,168
- No, chief, I--
- No, it's--it's fine.

561
00:29:07,198 --> 00:29:08,088
It's fine.

562
00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:09,819
Go be a hotshot somewhere else.

563
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:11,271
But tell me...

564
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,125
how could you do this to me?

565
00:29:17,495 --> 00:29:18,580
I mean...

566
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:19,764
you know, I'm hurt.

567
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:22,937
Really hurt.

568
00:29:23,603 --> 00:29:25,179
After all I've done for you.

569
00:29:25,488 --> 00:29:29,151
You're gifted and you're ungrateful,
and that's all I'm saying.

570
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:33,612
I'm pregnant, you blind moron.

571
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,027
You're what?

572
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:42,454
My heart rate is 110,
I'm burning 3,000 calories a day,

573
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,034
my legs are swollen,
I've got indigestion and gas.

574
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:51,833
Did you know that carrying a boy in your uterus
means you burn 10% more calories than if you had a girl?

575
00:29:51,946 --> 00:29:53,146
Guess what I'm carryin'.

576
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,094
I try for seven damn years, and a month
before my fellowship notifications,

577
00:29:58,165 --> 00:29:59,726
the stick turns blue.

578
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,820
Men.

579
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,600
From the very beginning, they just
suck the life right out of you.

580
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,653
I'm not leaving.

581
00:30:06,748 --> 00:30:07,859
I'm pregnant.

582
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:13,139
Congratulations.

583
00:30:15,936 --> 00:30:17,140
Dr. Yang...

584
00:30:19,163 --> 00:30:20,363
you're handling the saw.

585
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:28,145
Thank you, Dr. Burke.

586
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:36,252
You won't let me pick the wine,
but this you'll let me do?

587
00:30:37,164 --> 00:30:39,486
- Are we all set for bypass?
- Almost there.

588
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:03,713
So... apparently we both
live on this elevator.

589
00:31:07,852 --> 00:31:08,817
Meredith...

590
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:13,818
you know,
you could at least acknowledge I exist.

591
00:31:22,152 --> 00:31:25,019
- Hello, Dr. Grey.
- Hello.

592
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,000
- Are you ready to go?
- I was on my way.

593
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:45,689
Well, it took three hours,
but the surgery went perfectly.

594
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:48,844
All we have to do now is wait and
see how he's doing when he wakes up.

595
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:50,048
Why did this happen?

596
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:53,369
Almost every patient with
Marfan's has an aorta that fails.

597
00:31:53,649 --> 00:31:55,213
It's just a matter of when.

598
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:58,635
I guess it's lucky you two were
having dinner at the next table.

599
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:01,419
It was.

600
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,740
Take care.

601
00:32:05,732 --> 00:32:09,470
And we can treat it
with surgery and chemo.

602
00:32:10,058 --> 00:32:11,089
But...

603
00:32:18,627 --> 00:32:21,377
We're supposed to go to Venice
at the end of the month.

604
00:32:21,895 --> 00:32:23,575
- Do you know the story?
- No.

605
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,657
Oh, they say if you ride a
gondola under the bridge of sighs,

606
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,813
you're together for eternity.

607
00:32:32,031 --> 00:32:33,611
You didn't tell Jed, did you?

608
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:34,866
Excuse me?

609
00:32:34,962 --> 00:32:38,663
He's always been so
worried that I'd go first.

610
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:40,103
You don't want him to know?

611
00:32:41,381 --> 00:32:42,407
You're young.

612
00:32:42,832 --> 00:32:45,872
I don't expect you to understand
an old broad like me.

613
00:32:46,016 --> 00:32:48,726
You can't have a
relationship built on a lie.

614
00:32:49,098 --> 00:32:50,190
Can you?

615
00:32:50,295 --> 00:32:51,911
Oh, honey, it's not a lie.

616
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:54,931
It's our future.

617
00:32:57,621 --> 00:33:00,441
I've been with the love
of my life for 60 years.

618
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:02,899
And now I'm dying.

619
00:33:07,324 --> 00:33:08,980
We're going to Venice.

620
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,942
We're gettin' in that gondola.

621
00:33:23,487 --> 00:33:27,604
When Addie told me she was coming
out here, I had such a good feeling.

622
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:30,384
You guys are gonna make it.

623
00:33:30,923 --> 00:33:32,367
You were always meant to be.

624
00:33:32,592 --> 00:33:34,646
Yeah, a couple of clams
on the half shell.

625
00:33:34,697 --> 00:33:36,877
A couple of peas in a pod.

626
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:39,939
- We're still working on the pod part.
- It's about choices.

627
00:33:40,132 --> 00:33:42,806
Well, here's to taking
life in your own hands.

628
00:33:42,835 --> 00:33:44,422
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

629
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,670
Yeah, and here's to bull
and here's to crap.

630
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,518
And here's to oophorectomy...

631
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:55,497
- Oh, god.
- Hysterectomy, double bilateral mastectomy.

632
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,489
- Please stop.
- How smart am I to know all those words?

633
00:33:58,581 --> 00:33:59,516
Stop.

634
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:03,936
Here's to breast reconstruction,
nipple reconstruction.

635
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:06,737
Here's to losing your wife.

636
00:34:07,818 --> 00:34:10,556
Here's to being the ass
who can't be supportive.

637
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:12,807
Here's to that.

638
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,324
Weiss.

639
00:34:31,013 --> 00:34:32,317
Don't talk to me.

640
00:34:32,495 --> 00:34:33,519
Keep walking.

641
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:35,407
You should get some sleep,
sober up,

642
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:37,061
so you're ready for
Savvy's surgery.

643
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:38,291
Come on. I'll drive you.

644
00:34:38,853 --> 00:34:39,859
Oh...

645
00:34:40,923 --> 00:34:43,673
I'm supposed to hold her hand
while they rip her apart?

646
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:45,369
That's the definition of love?

647
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:48,218
You can do this.

648
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:49,992
Maybe I can't.

649
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:55,483
- Maybe I'm just a guy who likes to screw his wife.
- Weiss...

650
00:34:55,775 --> 00:34:57,703
That's what she'll
think if I'm not there.

651
00:34:57,733 --> 00:34:59,083
Then you're gonna be there.

652
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:04,214
This is comin' from a guy who packed
his bags in the middle of the night

653
00:35:04,244 --> 00:35:06,659
and drove 3,000 miles
to live in a trailer.

654
00:35:07,026 --> 00:35:09,512
Yeah, well.
What am I doin' with Addison now?

655
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,350
I'm tryin' to work it out.

656
00:35:14,826 --> 00:35:16,763
I don't know,
am I out of my mind?

657
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:17,985
I don't know. You tell me.

658
00:35:26,106 --> 00:35:27,435
It's about the ring.

659
00:35:29,318 --> 00:35:30,651
It's about the vows.

660
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:36,060
Savvy didn't screw around with
you with your best friend.

661
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:38,433
And she's looking for support.

662
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,626
If you don't give
that to her now,

663
00:35:42,604 --> 00:35:44,468
if you don't give
her that support,

664
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:47,874
then what the hell am I doing?

665
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:00,936
You didn't tell her, did you?

666
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,518
No. I didn't tell her.

667
00:36:34,273 --> 00:36:36,266
I thought he cheated fate.

668
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,809
- Maybe he did cheat fate.
- He died.

669
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:44,143
I think you can't wait for someone to
fly underneath you and save your life.

670
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,985
I think you have
to save yourself.

671
00:36:49,384 --> 00:36:51,830
Do you mean the pigeons
aren't going to come?

672
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:56,258
The pigeons aren't
going to come.

673
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,202
Hold still.

674
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:05,086
Come on.
Make sure you get both sides.

675
00:37:05,193 --> 00:37:08,044
You know these are gonna be
next year's holiday cards.

676
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:11,498
I want 'em to be immortalized
before they're gone.

677
00:37:11,745 --> 00:37:14,595
And this way Weiss gets to
look at 'em whenever he wants.

678
00:37:17,714 --> 00:37:19,108
These are gonna be great.

679
00:37:19,685 --> 00:37:21,205
We're scheduled to go in at 8?

680
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:27,235
I'm gonna take you down to the
pre-op in just a few minutes.

681
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:30,988
Weiss will show up, Addie.

682
00:37:31,012 --> 00:37:32,228
He always does.

683
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:34,915
Sav...

684
00:37:35,727 --> 00:37:38,850
as your doctor,
you know I'm 100% on your side but,

685
00:37:39,387 --> 00:37:42,648
as your friend,
are you absolutely sure about this?

686
00:37:44,707 --> 00:37:46,139
I know what I'm losing.

687
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,162
I get it.

688
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,901
But think about
what I'm gaining--

689
00:37:51,946 --> 00:37:53,174
my life.

690
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:55,225
This gives me a shot--

691
00:37:55,811 --> 00:38:01,537
a shot at the future, at shot at
me and Weiss becoming this crazy,

692
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:06,154
old wrinkled couple that
argues all the time.

693
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,247
I mean...

694
00:38:10,314 --> 00:38:11,767
wouldn't you want that?

695
00:38:12,885 --> 00:38:14,786
A chance to grow
old with Derek?

696
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:17,703
Yeah.

697
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,012
Yeah, I do.

698
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:28,945
- Oh, god.
- Sav, Sav.

699
00:38:29,055 --> 00:38:32,090
Maybe Romeo and Juliet
were fated to be together,

700
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:33,811
but just for awhile,

701
00:38:35,101 --> 00:38:37,070
and then their time passed.

702
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:40,891
If they could've
known that beforehand,

703
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:42,828
maybe it all
would've been okay.

704
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:45,163
Here's the thing.

705
00:38:45,294 --> 00:38:46,440
I like your rack.

706
00:38:46,544 --> 00:38:47,878
God, what is wrong with you?

707
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,208
Why do you have to be so--

708
00:38:49,308 --> 00:38:50,849
god, what is wrong with you?!

709
00:38:51,592 --> 00:38:55,742
I like your rack, and I'd want them
around if I could have them, trust me, I would.

710
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,744
But it wouldn't be the end of
the world if you got rid of them.

711
00:38:58,774 --> 00:39:00,204
Because really...

712
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:02,506
I'd want you.

713
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:09,680
What was that for?

714
00:39:09,768 --> 00:39:14,308
I told Mrs. Snyder that when I was
grown-up, I'd take fate into my own hands.

715
00:39:19,742 --> 00:39:22,401
I wouldn't let some
guy drag me down.

716
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:44,180
Mrs. Snyder said I'd be lucky if I ever
had that kind of passion with someone,

717
00:39:44,374 --> 00:39:48,101
and that if I did,
we'd be together forever.

718
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,892
I guess we never
really got our date.

719
00:39:51,232 --> 00:39:52,127
Are you kidding?

720
00:39:52,254 --> 00:39:54,304
That was the best date
I've ever been on.

721
00:40:03,738 --> 00:40:08,926
Even now I believe that, for the
most part, love is about choices.

722
00:40:19,523 --> 00:40:21,068
He's not coming, is he?

723
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:31,129
You're shaking.

724
00:40:35,346 --> 00:40:36,794
You're here.

725
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:44,680
It's about putting down the poison and
the dagger and making your own happy ending...

726
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:45,988
most of the time...

727
00:40:50,673 --> 00:40:52,623
I'm gonna go ahead
and get started now.

728
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:53,917
You ready?

729
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,282
Yeah...

730
00:40:57,687 --> 00:40:58,733
ready.

731
00:41:08,073 --> 00:41:09,568
And that sometimes,

732
00:41:09,683 --> 00:41:13,687
despite all your best choices
and all your best intentions,

733
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,940
fate wins anyway.

734
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,129
I miss you.

735
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:54,683
I can't.
