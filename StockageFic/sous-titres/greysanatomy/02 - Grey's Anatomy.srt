[Narrator] Previously on Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,937
[Richard] The seven years here
as a surgical resident

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,204
will be the best and worst.
You'll be pushed to the breaking point.

4
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:14,337
Eight of you will switch to an easier
specialty. Five crack under pressure.

5
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,348
Two of you will be asked to leave.

6
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,646
We should pretend it never happened.

7
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,949
What never happened? You sleeping
with me, or you throwing me out?

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,354
You're an attending,
and I'm your intern.

9
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,221
Stop looking at me like that.

10
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,385
- Like what?
- Like you've seen me naked.

11
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:32,192
Your first shift starts now
and lasts 48 hours.

12
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:36,395
You're interns, grunts, nobodies,
bottom of the surgical food chain.

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,367
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,872
You and I are gonna
have so much fun together.

15
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,575
You know Meredith is inbred?

16
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,077
Like it's uncommon here
to be a doctor's parents.

17
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,080
Her mother is Ellis Grey.

18
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,479
Shut up. The Ellis Grey?

19
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,710
She's a living legend.

20
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:52,911
What's your name?

21
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,887
It's me, Mom. Meredith.

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,047
Oh, right.

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,355
We're gonna survive this, right?

24
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,432
[Tegan and Sara: You Wouldn't Like Me]

25
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:19,169
[Meredith] It's all about lines.

26
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,679
The finish line
at the end of residency.

27
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,711
Waiting in line for a chance
at the operating table.

28
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,379
[Tires screeching]

29
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,789
And then there's
the most important line,

30
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,555
the line separating you
from the people you work with.

31
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,565
It doesn't help to get too familiar.

32
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,000
To make friends.

33
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:54,004
You need boundaries
between you and the rest of the world.

34
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,644
Other people are far too messy.

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,881
It's all about lines.

36
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,582
Drawing lines in the sand

37
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,921
and praying like hell
no one crosses them.

38
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,395
I'm sure you're very nice,

39
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,093
but I'm very particular about who lives
in my house. You're just not right.

40
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,332
Why? Look, I'm quiet.
No loud music, no parties.

41
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,430
Where were you when
Challenger exploded?

42
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,497
The what?

43
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,634
The space shuttle. Challenger.

44
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,804
Uh, I think I was in kindergarten.

45
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,610
Exactly. No.

46
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,310
[Lzzie] Why put up posters
if you don't want roommates?

47
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,183
I do want roommates.
We're together 100 hours a week.

48
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,189
You want to live together too?

49
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,588
I see you bring bribes now.

50
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,094
I need a place to live. My mom irons
my scrubs. I have to get out of there.

51
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,426
It's not a bribe.
I don't think it's a good idea.

52
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,261
- I can put down last...
- It's totally a bribe.

53
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,426
I can cook,
and I'm an obsessive cleaner.

54
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,766
[Meredith] No.
I just want two total strangers

55
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,999
who I don't have to talk to
or be nice to.

56
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,439
And it's not a bribe.
It's a mocha latte.

57
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,637
George, run the code team.
Meredith, take the trauma pager.

58
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,146
Cristina, deliver the labs
to the patients.

59
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,682
Izzie, you're on sutures.

60
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,546
Dr. Bailey, I was hoping
to assist you in the OR today.

61
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,714
Maybe do a minor procedure.

62
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,849
I think I'm ready. Mocha latte?

63
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,053
[Cristina] If she gets to cut,
I want to cut.

64
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,528
- [Lzzie] Me too.
- I wouldn't mind another shot.

65
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,655
Stop talking.

66
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,160
Every intern wants
to perform their first surgery.

67
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,965
That's not your job.
Do you know what your job is?

68
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,030
To make your resident happy.
Do I look happy? No.

69
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,302
Why? Because my interns are whiny.

70
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,310
You know what will
make me look happy?

71
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,370
Having code team staffed,
having the trauma pages answered,

72
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,211
having the weekend labs delivered

73
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,843
and having someone down
in the pit doing the sutures.

74
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:46,015
No one holds a scalpel till I'm so happy
I'm Mary-freakin'-Poppins.

75
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,151
Mocha latte, my ass.

76
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,696
Why are y'all standing there? Move!

77
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,736
Seattle has ferryboats.

78
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,509
- Yes?
- I didn't know that.

79
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,035
I've been living here six weeks.
I didn't know there were ferryboats.

80
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,446
Seattle is surrounded
by water on three sides.

81
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,007
- Hence the ferryboats.
- [Elevator bell dings]

82
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,519
Now I have to like it here.

83
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,350
I wasn't planning on liking it here.

84
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,381
I'm from New York. I'm genetically
engineered to dislike everywhere,

85
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,722
except Manhattan.

86
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,024
I have a thing for ferryboats.

87
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,569
I'm not going out with you.

88
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,730
Did I ask you to go out with me?

89
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,167
Do you want to go out with me?

90
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,734
I'm not dating you, and I'm
definitely not sleeping with you again.

91
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,803
- You're my boss.
- I'm your boss's boss.

92
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,372
You're my teacher
and my teacher's teacher.

93
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,747
And you're my teacher.

94
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,786
"I'm your sister. I'm your daughter."

95
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:51,051
- You're sexually harassing me.
- I'm riding an elevator.

96
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:55,060
Look, I'm drawing a line.
The line is drawn.

97
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,959
There's a big line.

98
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,561
So, this line, is it imaginary,

99
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,298
or do I need to get you a marker?

100
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,712
[Dings]

101
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,985
[Clears throat]

102
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,758
We'll talk later?

103
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,264
[Beeping]

104
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,302
- Are you the surgeon?
- Yeah.

105
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,530
We've got a rape victim.
Better get in there.

106
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,507
[Woman] 25-year-old female found
down at the park. Status: Post-trauma.

107
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,375
She came in with a GCS
of six. BP: 80 over 60.

108
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,677
Exam is significant
for blunt head trauma.

109
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,219
Unequal breath sounds,
right pupil is dilated.

110
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,882
And she's ready for X-ray.
Ready to roll?

111
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,783
- Hey!
- Yeah.

112
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,361
Call ahead to clear CT.
Let them know I'm coming.

113
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,991
Load up the portable monitor.

114
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,036
Call Respiratory for a ventilator.

115
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,004
I'll get x-rays while I'm down there.

116
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,311
She's going to spend a long time
in recovery and rehab.

117
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,541
If she survives.

118
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:27,416
[Derek] Is she 5'2", 100 pounds?
She's breathing after what this guy did?

119
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,819
Catch the guy, they should castrate him.

120
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,380
[Burke] See how shredded her hands are?

121
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,050
- She tried to fight.
- Tried?

122
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,994
Rape kit came back negative.
She kicked his ass.

123
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,198
So we have a warrior among us, huh?

124
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,699
[Chuckles]

125
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,065
Allison.

126
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,805
Her... her name is Allison.

127
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,700
Allison.

128
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,837
[Burke] I think I may have
found the cause of our rupture.

129
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,847
Large hemostat.

130
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,576
[Burke] More suction.

131
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,616
What is this?

132
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,884
Does anyone know what this is?

133
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,856
Oh, my God.

134
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,225
What? Spit it out, Grey.

135
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,730
- She bit it off.
- Bit off what?

136
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,790
That's h-his...

137
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,232
...penis.

138
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,199
She bit off his... his penis.

139

[Psapp: Nobody Knows]

140
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,170
Ouch!

141
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,570
If she can fight the infection,
she'll be fine.

142
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,542
It's all gonna depend on whether or
not she wakes up in the next 72 hours.

143
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,512
We should get a drink later.
You can tell me the long story,

144
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,913
what makes a doc
leave the Big Apple for Seattle.

145
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,382
Short story, actually.

146
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,682
Your chief of surgery
made me an offer I couldn't refuse.

147
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,619
Richard asked you to come?

148
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,521
Yeah. Why?

149
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,090
Oh, nothing.

150
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,152
See you later.

151
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,899
Do you know what
the code team does?

152
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,440
Saves lives.

153
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,705
I shock a heart, and someone
lives to see another day.

154
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:32,971
That's upbeat.

155
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,808
It's, uh, glass half full.

156
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,612
Bambi, don't say another word till
after the hunter shoots your mother.

157
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,250
I don't like you.

158
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,949
I have a BA from Smith,
a PhD from Berkeley

159
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,289
and an MD from Stanford,
and I'm delivering lab results.

160
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,420
It will take all day
to get through these.

161
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,485
Then get started.

162
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,032
Oh, I-I wasn't complaining.

163
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,625
Intern was reassigned,
so he's mine now.

164
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,397
Have him shadow you for the day.

165
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,496
Show him how I do things.

166

Alex Karev. Nice to meet you.

167
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,741
You're the pig
who called Meredith a nurse.

168
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,245
I hate you on principle.

169
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,612
And you're the pushy,
overbearing kiss-ass.

170

I, uh, I hate you too.

171
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,878
Oh, it should be fun then.

I'm Dr. O'Malley.

All right. I'm going to sit with her.

348
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,235
Dr. Burke? There's a baby up in Peds.

349
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,932
I saw him have a tet spell,
and I think I hear a murmur.

350
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,998
Hmm. Did Peds call us for a consult?

351
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,271
- No, they're not...
- So, you want me to what?

352
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,176
If you could just go up
and look at him.

353
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,612
Not without a Peds consult.

354
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,672
I'm a busy man, Grey,
and there are rules.

I'm the chief or something.

- What about you?
- Hiding from Alex.

372
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,651
I kissed Derek.

00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,248
You kissed Derek?

that and carrying around a penis

382

just makes everything seem
so shiny and happy.

was wearing your shoes.

- Take a look.
- What?

Let's get him to OR 1.
Call the chief.

I saw Allison.

You can't believe
the beating that she took.

396

And then to see this.

397
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,083
Like that saying,
"You should see the other guy."

398
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,279
Why not attempt to reattach the penis?

399
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,346
Teeth don't slice.
You can only reattach with a clean cut.

400
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,585
If she wanted to slice him off
with a knife...

401

The digestive juices
didn't leave much of the flesh.

So, what do we do?

403
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,422
Sew him up minus part
of the family jewels.

404
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,830
And his outlook?

405
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,165
He'll be urinating
out of a bag for a long time.

406
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,761
Not to mention he'll never
be able to have sex again.

- Too bad.
- Shame.

- Why?

You really want to know?

416

I want to know when you stopped
thinking of me as your number one.

417

Richard, I do more
in this hospital than...

You do only exactly
as much as is necessary.

You never take an extra step.

420

You never give an extra minute.

421
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,576
You're comfortable and arrogant,
and it doesn't impress me.

turning away patients. Boohoo.

a crime-scene guy down for hours,
