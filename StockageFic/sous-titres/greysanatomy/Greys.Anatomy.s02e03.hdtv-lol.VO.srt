1
00:00:00,222 --> 00:00:01,915
Previously on
"Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,143 --> 00:00:03,472
Derek's married.

3
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:06,256
You waited two
months to tell me,

4
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:10,107
and I had to find out by her
showing up and telling me herself.

5
00:00:10,107 --> 00:00:12,100
You had brain surgery
and didn't tell me?

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,877
- You called my wife?
- You called mine.

7
00:00:13,877 --> 00:00:15,782
- It's not like we're divorced.
- Practically divorced.

8
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:18,160
- You've had counseling?
- We had adultery. That was enough.

9
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,044
- I think it's best to make a clean break.
- Oh, you're ending this.

10
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:22,533
I'm pregnant.

11
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:25,276
Have you even bothered to
tell Burke about the baby?

12
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:28,284
The clinic wouldn't let me
confm my appointment unless I

13
00:00:28,284 --> 00:00:30,755
designated an emergency
contact person.

14
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:32,530
- You're my person.
- I am?

15
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,314
I heard your mother
was leaving mayo.

16
00:00:34,314 --> 00:00:36,143
She goin' back with the U.N.?

17
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:38,497
She's, uh, taking time off.

18
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:39,771
What's your name?

19
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:41,921
It's me, mom, Meredith.

20
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,359
Oh, you are stupid.

21
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,721
Oh, god.

22
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:57,530
You're a stupid, evil sadist,

23
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,502
- and I wanna kill you!
- Endorphins are good.

24
00:00:59,532 --> 00:01:01,366
Endorphins are mood elevators.

25
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:05,146
- This is supposed to make us feel better.
- Oh, god. Do you feel better?

26
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:07,983
I'm stupid.

27
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,861
Slutty mistress.

28
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,667
Pregnant whore.

29
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:14,936
Sleeping with our bosses
was a great idea.

30
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:20,750
- You know what's ruined for me?
- Oh.

31
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:23,280
Ferry boats.

32
00:01:23,454 --> 00:01:25,595
I used to love ferry boats.

33
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,353
And Derek's got a
thing for ferry boats.

34
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:31,253
- Now every time I see a freakin' ferry boat--
- You know what's ruined for me?

35
00:01:32,065 --> 00:01:36,345
Coronary artery bypass
grafts and aortic aneurysms.

36
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:38,664
God, I used to love
aortic aneurysms.

37
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:43,612
Surgeons are control freaks.

38
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,906
With a scalpel in your hand--

39
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:48,712
- Oh, crap.
- You feel unstoppable.

40
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:53,289
There's no fear,
there's no pain.

41
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:55,047
- Have you cried yet?
- Hello.

42
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:57,509
You're 10 feet tall
and bulletproof.

43
00:01:57,692 --> 00:01:59,774
Do you think we'd feel
better if we cry?

44
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:01,452
You know, just like,
let it out?

45
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:05,101
Probably, yeah.

46
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:07,232
And then you leave the O.R--

47
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,292
You wanna cry now?

48
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:13,609
- No.
- Okay, let's--let's jog.

49
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:17,893
And all that perfection,
all that beautiful control

50
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,727
just falls to crap.

51
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:24,335
What is she doing?

52
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:27,702
She's hanging out with Alex.

53
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:29,538
Why?

54
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:33,138
I don't know.

55
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:38,670
- I think--think they, uh, might be friends.
- Do another one.

56
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:43,787
Make the lambs stop screaming.

57
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,906
You guys are wrong about him,
all right?

58
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,837
Once you get to know him,
he's really sweet.

59
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,865
- He's Alex.
- Punk-ass.

60
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:56,447
Hey, Grey, Izzie was telling me you have
tapes of your mom performing surgery.

61
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,568
I'd kill to see the
Ellis Grey in action.

62
00:02:58,568 --> 00:02:59,388
Hey, you know what?

63
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,567
Maybe you can come over tonight and
we can all watch it together, right?

64
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:05,168
Oh, yeah,
if this were a hell dimension.

65
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:06,675
Run away, pig boy.

66
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:09,955
- Do you have a thing for Alex?
- No.

67
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:11,574
I don't.

68
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:13,501
Are we saving lives or
having a tea party?

69
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:14,997
Walk faster, people.

70
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,854
Ahem.

71
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:29,307
Nice hat.

72
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:31,026
Shut up.

73
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:32,055
What are you doin' here?

74
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:34,935
- I'm going back to work
- You're not cleared for surgery.

75
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,012
Leave me alone.

76
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:39,900
I've been sittin' home for a week,
watching Oprah give away things on tv.

77
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:41,934
Oprah, Derek.

78
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,497
You clear me now,
or I'll hurt you.

79
00:03:44,497 --> 00:03:46,424
If you want me to
clear you so soon,

80
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:49,866
you should've thought of that before you
gave chief to Burke and invited Satan to Seattle.

81
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,105
Satan?

82
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:52,640
Good morning.

83
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,711
Richard, like the hat.

84
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:55,605
Satan speaks.

85
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:58,896
Actually, I prefer to be called
ruler of all that is evil,

86
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:02,088
- but I will answer to Satan.
- What is she still doing here?

87
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:03,602
I asked her to stay.

88
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:06,679
We have a pediatric surgery
attending on maternity leave.

89
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,801
Actually, I could
use you on a consult.

90
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:11,042
Will you meet me
up there, Derek?

91
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,946
- Yeah, fine.
- See you, Richard.

92
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:15,103
Nice lady.

93
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:16,663
I'm not clearing
you for surgery.

94
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:18,714
Fine, I can catch
up on my paperwork.

95
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:24,512
Mr. Gaston is scheduled for a resection
non-small cell carcinoma today.

96
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:27,381
He did well overnight,
has remained afebrile.

97
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:29,676
He's had a dose of
ceftriaxone this morning.

98
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:31,963
His pre-op labs
are unremarkable.

99
00:04:31,963 --> 00:04:35,290
His chest x-rays are
unchanged from previous.

100
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,420
I own a couple of
dry cleaning stores.

101
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,983
I never believed what they said
about inhaling the chemicals, but--

102
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,968
We're gonna do everything
we can for you, Mr. Gaston.

103
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:44,836
Did oncology see him yet?

104
00:04:46,523 --> 00:04:48,423
They're waiting for
the surgical path.

105
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:50,458
Thank you, Dr. Yang.

106
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:51,994
You're welcome, Dr. Burke.

107
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:56,859
I know, and I just think you should
still tell him about the baby because

108
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:59,246
at least he should have the
responsibility of having to pay.

109
00:04:59,276 --> 00:05:01,640
No! Look, he will never know.
It's over.

110
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:06,240
Once this pregnancy's taken care of, Burke won't even
be a blip on my radar. He'll be a smudge.

111
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,112
Right.

112
00:05:07,112 --> 00:05:10,280
You know, Meredith,
leave the sarcasm up to me.

113
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,133
Really. It doesn't suit you.

114
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:20,201
Kelly Roche, 23 years old, in for a scheduled E.T.S.
for treatment of erythrophobia with hyperpyrexia.

115
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,330
Erythrophobia?

116
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,524
Blushing.

117
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:25,750
You have any questions
about the procedure?

118
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:27,643
Doctor--

119
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,074
Dr. Shepherd explained everything.
He was very...

120
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:33,557
helpful.

121
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,237
He gave me some litera--

122
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:36,912
Sorry.

123
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:41,131
Don't be. Half the patients that come
through here have the hots for Shepherd.

124
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,021
Dr. Karev.

125
00:05:43,354 --> 00:05:44,534
What?

126
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,050
It's true.

127
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:48,882
Hey.

128
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,565
- Why do you do that?
- What?

129
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:53,552
Act like an ass when everybody but me is
around. They hate you enough as it is.

130
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:55,964
So? What?

131
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,504
Hey, there's a new surgical case coming
up from the pit, likely diverticulitis.

132
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:00,722
Let's go.

133
00:06:05,634 --> 00:06:06,875
Watch it. Hands off me.

134
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,462
I could report you to the chief
and you'd be out on your ass!

135
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:11,324
- Where is the chief?!
- Patient's name is, um--

136
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,095
Where is the chief?
You're all amateurs!

137
00:06:13,095 --> 00:06:16,077
Complaining of intermittent cramping,
pain and diarrhea.

138
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:17,807
Also suffers from--

139
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:19,540
Amateurs!

140
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:21,917
- Alzheimer's.
- The patient's name?

141
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:24,853
Um-- Yang,
the patient's name?

142
00:06:26,114 --> 00:06:27,764
What the hell are
you doing here?

143
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:29,061
Haven't I told you?

144
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:31,600
How many times have I told you
not to bother me when'm at work?!

145
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,956
Ellis Grey.

146
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,316
- Meredith's mother.
- You're amateurs! You're amateurs!

147
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:49,503
Nobody knows where they
might end up nobody knows

148
00:06:58,216 --> 00:07:00,115
Oh, oh

149
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:03,054
Suppose you'll never know

150
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,546
Meredith, are you okay--

151
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:13,489
Dr. Karev, stick with the E.T.S.
case. And, Alex,

152
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:14,707
her blushing impulse--

153
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:17,523
not a toy for you to play with or a
button for you to push, understood?

154
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:21,639
Hey, Meredith, you know, um, my
great-grandmother, she died with Alzheimer's.

155
00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:23,008
My god.

156
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:25,176
- Why would you say that?
- Look, I'm just tryin' to help.

157
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:28,219
Izzie, the Dr. Shepherds need
an intern up in the N.I.C.U.

158
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:31,250
Wait, both of them, together?

159
00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:33,719
And me, by myself,

160
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:36,365
- with the two married people who hate each other?
- Go.

161
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:39,030
- Cristina, you're on the thoracotomy.
- Oh, with Burke?

162
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,601
- Oh, can I have the hateful married couple instead?
- Okay, I'm sorry.

163
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:44,317
I thought I was your resident,
not your hostess.

164
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:45,732
I assign, you take.

165
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,973
Is that a problem?

166
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,373
Is there some reason why it's inconvenient for you
to spend the day in the O.R. learning from Dr. Burke?

167
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:55,295
No, I'm very happy to be working
with Dr. Burke. Thank you very much.

168
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:57,567
George, take care of Dr. Grey.

169
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,441
Yes. Thank you.

170
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:03,470
She needs a friend right now--

171
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:06,979
Oh, you mean Ellis the--

172
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,362
mother.

173
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,687
Are you able to work today?

174
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:18,580
Yes, I'm fine.

175
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,739
'Cause I would understand it if
you wanted to be with your--

176
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:22,962
No.

177
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:25,253
My mother and i don't
have the easiest--

178
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:29,206
it's just better
if I'm working.

179
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,126
Okay.

180
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:32,764
You're on scut.

181
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:33,609
Excuse me?

182
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:36,675
While we take care of your mother,
you can catch up on charting,

183
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:38,838
run samples to the lab,
go over--

184
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:40,778
I told you, I'm fine.

185
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:43,003
Yeah, and I appreciate
that you're fine.

186
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:45,986
But I have to anticipate a certain
level of distraction from you today,

187
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:47,538
even in the face of
all that fineness.

188
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,419
So scut, now.

189
00:08:53,937 --> 00:08:55,154
Where's the mother?

190
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:56,320
Gone.

191
00:08:56,324 --> 00:09:00,024
She stuck around long enough to get
the kid strung out, and then took off.

192
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:01,373
Nice, huh?

193
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,484
Addison--

194
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:04,323
Derek, I know it's a long shot.
I know that.

195
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:06,805
You told me that you had a
newborn with an invasive mass.

196
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:11,176
You failed to mention she's premature,
underweight and addicted to narcotics.

197
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:13,661
There is no way that this
baby is gonna survive--

198
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:15,556
- spinal surgery.
- You don't know that.

199
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,390
Even if she does, she's a mess.

200
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,564
Look at her, she's got meningitis seizures.
She's just gonna live a short and painful life.

201
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:22,405
- You don't know that.
- It is my job to know that.

202
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:23,936
- You're not god, Derek.
- Excuse me?

203
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:27,006
- I'm sorry, honey, but you're not. You don't get to just decide--
- Did you just call me "honey"?

204
00:09:27,036 --> 00:09:28,285
Don't call me honey.

205
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:30,228
Fine. You're not god,
Dr. Shepherd.

206
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:33,486
Look, if a patient has any chance at
survival, which I think she does,

207
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:36,447
- then you have a responsibility--
- Don't talk to me about responsibility.

208
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:38,920
- You took an oath, Derek.
- Oh, and don't you dare talk to me about oaths.

209
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,457
Derek, I messed up.

210
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:42,436
People mess up.

211
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:44,920
- You slept with my best friend in my favorite sheets.
- The flannel sheets?

212
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,716
- You hate the flannel sheets.
- No, I loved those sheets.

213
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:47,814
- You like the italian sheets with the paisleys.
- I did.

214
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:49,060
- Would you just stop talking about the sheets?
- Fine.

215
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,628
I'm sorry. I'm just gonna go.
I'll go check on the labs.

216
00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:59,165
- Addison, don't do that.
- Derek, look, she's a fighter.

217
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,177
- Look how far she's come already.
- Don't get attached, don't get involved.

218
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:05,452
Just don't make her life more
painful than it already is.

219
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:07,088
Derek, please.

220
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:08,203
She has nobody.

221
00:10:08,203 --> 00:10:09,953
She needs someone
to fight for her.

222
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,882
She's too far gone.

223
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:13,719
We have to let her go.

224
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,297
Let her go in peace.

225
00:10:16,378 --> 00:10:18,067
Fine, Derek. Walk away.

226
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:22,580
It's what you do best.

227
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:27,642
I've enjoyed the opportunity to show you
my capabilities in this arena, however brief.

228
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:29,989
Stop fishing, Preston.

229
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:32,375
You did a good job.

230
00:10:32,571 --> 00:10:37,035
But I'm back now, and I don't plan
on going anywhere anytime soon.

231
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:39,239
I am glad that you're back.

232
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,662
I'm just hiding my
joy deep down inside.

233
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:45,894
And, uh, chief--

234
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:50,141
the hat--

235
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:53,286
it's a little pimped out.

236
00:10:59,254 --> 00:11:00,557
Welcome back, chief.

237
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:02,368
It's good to be back, Dr. Grey.

238
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:03,713
What can I do for you?

239
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,410
It's my mother, sir.

240
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,673
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner.

241
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:24,869
I know you two are close,
but she made me promise.

242
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:30,815
She seems to be reliving the heyday
of her residency a lot these days.

243
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:34,810
And I just thought maybe if you
could stop by and say hello,

244
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:37,736
it would mean a lot to her.

245
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,802
Oh, of--of course.

246
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:44,904
Do you need a day off or a--

247
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,805
Oh, no. I'm fine.

248
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,846
Yeah.

249
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,150
Okay.

250
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:59,447
- If you could just hold--
- I'm in the middle of my workday, Thatch.

251
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:01,902
Thatch? No, I'm Dr. O'Malley.

252
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:05,169
I'm-- okay.

253
00:12:08,071 --> 00:12:09,805
I just need to check your--

254
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:11,751
Darling, I'm not in the
mood to play doctor now.

255
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:13,214
Hands off. I'm busy.

256
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:14,431
George.

257
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:16,224
Damn it, Thatch, I mean it. No!

258
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:18,278
George.

259
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:30,176
She's allergic to penicillin.

260
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:32,897
- Yeah? Yeah. It said in her chart.
- Oh.

261
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:35,208
You just have to be patient.

262
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,272
Okay. Do you, um, who's Thatch?

263
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,339
My dad Thatcher.

264
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,006
What did she-- is she--

265
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:47,587
is she talking about him?

266
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:49,792
Um, yeah.

267
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,077
She never talks about him.

268
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:54,069
- Are you all right?
- No. Yeah, yeah.

269
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:55,579
I'm good.

270
00:12:55,632 --> 00:12:58,736
Um-- I can't be here.

271
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,184
Of course.
I mean, we're good here.

272
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:01,650
- Okay.
- We're great.

273
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:27,413
Dr. Shepherd.

274
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:29,498
Meredith.

275
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,762
I heard. Is it true?

276
00:13:31,762 --> 00:13:33,550
Yeah. Secret's out.

277
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,838
- Dr. Shepherd, I--
- You don't have to call me Dr. Shepherd.

278
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:40,661
Dr. Shepherd,
I want in on a surgical case.

279
00:13:40,783 --> 00:13:42,840
I can't just do
nothing all day.

280
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:45,393
And you owe me this.

281
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:49,418
And I never ask you for
anything like this, so--

282
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:52,562
I have an E.T.S.
this afternoon.

283
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:53,953
You'll scrub in.

284
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:05,884
You're late.

285
00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:07,752
I apologize.

286
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,025
I'm just starting to dissect around Mr.
Gaston's tumor.

287
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:22,413
I've almost got visualization.

288
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:30,289
Hey, Kelly.

289
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,250
Dr. Shep--

290
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,152
Dr. Shepherd.

291
00:14:34,152 --> 00:14:36,505
God. Sorry.

292
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:37,737
Damn it.

293
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:39,328
- Kelly.
- Yeah.

294
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,001
- Kelly.
- Mm-hmm.

295
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:43,551
This might be the last time
that that ever happens.

296
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:45,620
How are her labs?

297
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,898
H and h are stable,
chest x-rays show no acute process.

298
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:49,912
Good.

299
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:53,597
- You ready to go?
- Are you kidding? I've been ready since the third grade.

300
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:55,205
Did you read the
literature I gave you?

301
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:56,933
You understand the
possible side effects?

302
00:14:56,963 --> 00:15:00,209
Compensatory sweating of the back,
abdomen, thighs and legs,

303
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:02,252
possible gustatory sweating.

304
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:05,190
Horner's syndrome occurs in
less than 1% of patients.

305
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,326
Brachial plexus injury, pneumothorax
and hemothorax are highly unlikely,

306
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,105
but possible side
effects of the surgery.

307
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:14,614
You did your homework.

308
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,904
Take her to pre-op.

309
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:17,346
I'll alert the O.R.

310
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:20,809
Do you know what all
those words mean?

311
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,287
Brachial plexus injury could
cause paralysis of the arms.

312
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:26,993
Pneumothorax is
a collapsed lung.

313
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:29,110
I know.

314
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:35,244
Are you sure you want to risk all of
that over a little bit of blushing?

315
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,185
Is that--

316
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:41,250
what you think this is,
a little bit of blushing?

317
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:45,049
Just a
schoolgirl embarrassment?

318
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:48,380
Look, you both saw what
happened when Dr. Shep--

319
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:51,225
when Dr. Shepherd was here.

320
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:52,187
What did you think?

321
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:54,601
Well, I thought you liked him.

322
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:56,668
I do, but you think I want a--

323
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:59,068
a roomful of doctors
to know about it?

324
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:01,162
It's not like we're gonna--

325
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:02,958
It's not just you guys.

326
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,145
It's not just this once.
It happens--

327
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,007
every time I have a feeling
for anyone in my life.

328
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:22,388
I can't get mad, I can't--
be happy,

329
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:25,319
I can't feel anything without
the whole world knowing.

330
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:28,340
I can't have a secret.

331
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,284
Can you--

332
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:32,769
imagine living that
way your entire life?

333
00:16:36,706 --> 00:16:38,872
Get away from me,
you insipid little man!

334
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,822
- Dr. Grey, calm down.
- Get out of here! Get out of my room!

335
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:43,823
- Please calm down.
- What can I do?

336
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:45,740
Please get some haloperidol.

337
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,233
Don't give me that look.

338
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:49,873
That sad little,
soulful little puppy routine.

339
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:52,616
I know it by heart,
Thatch, and I'm over it.

340
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:57,166
I don't wanna hear about your day or your
students or your pathetic little research grants.

341
00:16:57,927 --> 00:16:59,363
My--

342
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,768
my work is what counts!

343
00:17:03,073 --> 00:17:04,840
It's what pays for this house.
It pays for--

344
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,324
it pays for you
and it pays for--

345
00:17:06,324 --> 00:17:09,609
it pays for Meredith and
for your precious lifestyle.

346
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,554
So why don't you just leave
me alone and let me do it?!

347
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:18,635
Meredith may think she needs you,
but I sure as hell don't.

348
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:20,520
- Dr. Grey.
- Here it is.

349
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:30,314
Are you okay?

350
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:37,568
That's something I'm
supposed to be asking you.

351
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:47,320
O'Malley.

352
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,347
- I understand that you're working on Ellis Grey.
- Yes, sir. I'm tryin' my best.

353
00:17:52,377 --> 00:17:55,042
All right, keep me informed of her
progress and take good care of her.

354
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:56,455
She's an old friend of mine.

355
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:59,332
Really? Because, actually,
I could use some help.

356
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:02,795
Could--could you
help me examine her?

357
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:06,687
Uh, um,
I'm just a little busy just now.

358
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:08,643
- Gotta run.
- Right, okay.

359
00:18:08,643 --> 00:18:12,843
It's just that she seems to think I'm
her ex-husband and she won't let me touch her.

360
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:20,253
Funny. You--you do look
a bit like Thatcher.

361
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,314
I look like Meredith's dad?

362
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:27,551
Um, just take good
care of her, George.

363
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,128
But I look like her dad?

364
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,356
I need help.

365
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:35,851
Hey.

366
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,446
Hey.

367
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:39,046
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

368
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,979
You have an eyelash.

369
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:43,323
Make a wish and blow it away.

370
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:47,569
Hey, nurse ratched, there's a
dead guy stinkin' up room 4125.

371
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:49,559
Do somethin' before he rots.

372
00:18:50,273 --> 00:18:53,315
See? That is exactly
what I'm talking about.

373
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:57,105
Why are you so afraid of showing people
that you're a decent human being?

374
00:18:57,135 --> 00:19:01,193
Remember when he wallpapered the hospital
with pictures of you in your underwear?

375
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:03,244
Yeah.

376
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,757
Yeah, I do.

377
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:06,191
That was before I knew you.

378
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:12,238
- Thanks, man. Very helpful.
- I need you to help me do an exam on Meredith's mom.

379
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:14,341
Oh, a standard exam.
You did go to med school, right?

380
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,461
She thinks I'm her ex-husband.

381
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:17,728
She won't let me.

382
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:21,462
- Dr. Grey.
- Oh, damn it, Thatcher, I'm at work.

383
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:25,153
I've already told you. I'm too busy to
deal with you. Now no more cartoons.

384
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:26,603
She means interruptions.

385
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:28,180
No more interruptions, Thatch.

386
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,843
You heard the doctor.

387
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,979
Hi, I'm--I'm Dr. Karev.

388
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:35,398
Pleased to meet you, Dr. Grey.
I've always admired your work.

389
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,875
So you're familiar with the
laparoscopic Grey method?

390
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:41,309
Oh, I studied footage of
the operation you pioneered.

391
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:43,259
You're something else.

392
00:19:43,652 --> 00:19:46,263
Good. Well, then,
we're wasting time.

393
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:47,534
Let's scrub in.

394
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:51,592
Well, Dr. Grey, I'm gonna need to do
a short exam before you start surgery.

395
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:55,249
I know. New hospital policy.
Annoying bureaucrats.

396
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:57,283
Make it quick.

397
00:19:57,624 --> 00:19:59,918
Why don't you wait
outside, Thatcher?

398
00:20:00,004 --> 00:20:01,672
I can take it from here.

399
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:04,983
Take a deep breath.

400
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:16,258
She's got a good grip.

401
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,495
Yeah.

402
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:18,997
I don't think I--

403
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,482
it doesn't look good.

404
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:25,434
She's got a resistant
strain of pneumococcus.

405
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:28,785
The antibiotics aren't working.

406
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:31,616
You may wanna get yourself reassigned,
Dr. Stevens.

407
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:33,661
I don't think we'll
be operating today.

408
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:35,852
So do you think Dr.
Shepherd was right?

409
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:38,071
It's just too far gone.

410
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:41,775
She does have a good grip.

411
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,640
The tumor has infiltrated
the pericardium.

412
00:20:58,681 --> 00:20:59,799
Yang.

413
00:21:02,691 --> 00:21:03,711
Yang?

414
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:05,754
What? Sorry.

415
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:08,587
Is my surgery interfering
with your daydreaming?

416
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,559
No.

417
00:21:11,153 --> 00:21:12,376
Sorry.

418
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,641
- You have a problem?
- No.

419
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:29,280
- You have a mocha latte?
- No.

420
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:31,716
Then go away.

421
00:21:32,346 --> 00:21:34,203
Actually, I need
a new assignment.

422
00:21:34,203 --> 00:21:37,215
The Shepherds' preemie
case is non-surgical.

423
00:21:37,215 --> 00:21:38,615
Non-surgical?

424
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:40,056
Non-operable.

425
00:21:41,747 --> 00:21:43,040
That sucks.

426
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,509
Yeah.

427
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:48,393
Did you know about Ellis Grey?
Did Meredith tell you?

428
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:49,973
No.

429
00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:51,628
It's just you think--

430
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:54,713
you think you know someone,
you know who they are,

431
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:58,697
you share a house and make
wishes on eyelashes with them.

432
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,147
And we don't know each other.
None of us.

433
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:06,806
We're just a bunch of interns who
work together. There's nothin' there.

434
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:12,279
There is an arrhythmia when
I press down on the tumor.

435
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:15,443
That is a sign of what, Yang?

436
00:22:16,326 --> 00:22:17,633
Um--

437
00:22:19,026 --> 00:22:21,611
uh, it's a sign of-- it's a s--

438
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:25,855
it's a sign that the tumor has
infiltrated the pericardium.

439
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:27,338
Possibilities?

440
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:28,891
I-I'm sorry.

441
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:31,872
- I--
- Do your homework, Yang.

442
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:35,191
It could be causing a tear in
the outer muscle of the heart.

443
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:38,638
So he's got a broken heart?

444
00:22:41,462 --> 00:22:42,437
Cristina.

445
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:43,617
Cristina.

446
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:46,419
Somebody help her.

447
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,216
Cristina.

448
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:53,964
Don't just stand there, damn it.
Somebody help her.

449
00:22:53,994 --> 00:22:55,684
Get a gurney in here!

450
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:57,405
Cristina.

451
00:22:57,405 --> 00:22:58,462
We got it, Dr.
Burke. We got it.

452
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,338
All right, talk to me.
What do we know? What do we know?

453
00:23:00,368 --> 00:23:01,866
- Talk to me, Stevens.
- I don't know.

454
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:04,545
- Come on, people, let's move.
- Cristina, what hurts?

455
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:07,695
Let's get her outta here.
There's a patient on the table. Lift.

456
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:12,815
Dr. Bailey, when you get her stabilized,
I need a report, please.

457
00:23:12,845 --> 00:23:14,790
- Dr. Bailey!
- Right, Dr. Burke.

458
00:23:18,802 --> 00:23:20,574
Her pulse is racing.

459
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:22,517
I need her on a monitor,
need to get a B.P.

460
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:25,589
Also, I want her started on
at liter of L.R. wide open.

461
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:28,262
Izzie, get to emergency.
Let 'em know we're on our way.

462
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:30,053
- What?
- Seven weeks. I'm pregnant, Izzie.

463
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:31,623
Izzie, I'm pregnant.

464
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:36,745
Uh, okay, no.
We're going to pre-op instead.

465
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:39,322
Find Addison Shepherd,
and, Izzie, be discreet.

466
00:23:42,002 --> 00:23:43,586
So I'm leaving in the morning.

467
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:44,505
No.

468
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:45,507
Excuse me?

469
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,519
No, I'm not accepting
your resignation.

470
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,107
It's not a
resignation, Richard.

471
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:51,657
It's notification.
I don't officially work for you.

472
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,281
I came here for one case.

473
00:23:54,281 --> 00:23:56,148
I can track the twins'
progress from New York.

474
00:23:56,148 --> 00:24:00,048
- Well, what about the preemie.
- I'm letting go of the preemie, you know that.

475
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,834
He calls me Satan, Richard.

476
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:06,859
- You don't like to hide from a fight.
- No fight. He wins.

477
00:24:07,361 --> 00:24:08,798
I'm leaving in the morning.

478
00:24:10,091 --> 00:24:13,499
- What is it, O'Malley?
- It's Dr. Grey, sir. Ellis.

479
00:24:15,864 --> 00:24:20,749
C.T. confirmed diverticulitis,
but a liver mass was also found.

480
00:24:20,936 --> 00:24:22,333
My god.

481
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,202
Poor Meredith.

482
00:24:23,202 --> 00:24:26,371
As if her mother having Alzheimer's isn't bad enough,
now she has to deal with liver cancer.

483
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:29,552
You won't know that it's cancer
until you do a biopsy, O'Malley.

484
00:24:29,582 --> 00:24:31,406
Right. Sorry.

485
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,435
Excuse me, Dr. Shepherd,
we need you, fast.

486
00:24:34,484 --> 00:24:37,702
Um, it's Cristina,
one of our interns.

487
00:24:37,702 --> 00:24:40,398
She's-- she's collapsed.

488
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:42,009
Cristina's collapsed?

489
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:43,909
Why do you need me?

490
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,741
- Cristina's pregnant?
- Shut up, George.

491
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,796
Please come.

492
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:57,146
Doesn't change anything, Richard.
I'm still leaving in the morning.

493
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,073
This is a very bad day.

494
00:25:01,606 --> 00:25:04,550
Okay, Dr. Karev,
if we're gonna stop her blushing,

495
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:09,083
we have to expose the sympathetic
ganglion chain which resides where?

496
00:25:09,397 --> 00:25:12,259
- It's time to clear me for surgery, Shepherd.
- What?

497
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:13,653
I know you heard me.
I'm standing right here.

498
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:15,662
Chief, I'm a little busy here.
We'll talk about it later.

499
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:17,424
Just give a verbal okay.

500
00:25:17,703 --> 00:25:19,996
- We can do the paperwork later.
- I cannot do that.

501
00:25:20,026 --> 00:25:21,471
I am your chief of surgery.

502
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:22,655
This is not a request.

503
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:26,227
With all due respect, sir, in this situation,
I'm not your subordinate, I'm your doctor.

504
00:25:26,257 --> 00:25:29,255
One week after brain surgery, you are
not ready to resume medical practice.

505
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:31,522
It's a simple procedure.
A needle biopsy.

506
00:25:31,522 --> 00:25:34,018
- A resident could do it.
- So let a resident do it.

507
00:25:34,018 --> 00:25:35,462
What am I missing here?

508
00:25:37,924 --> 00:25:40,354
It's for my mother, isn't it?

509
00:25:41,085 --> 00:25:42,845
You think she has cancer.

510
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:46,239
George needs your signature.

511
00:25:52,891 --> 00:25:54,880
Look Richard, I know
she's your friend.

512
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:58,128
But I'm not clearing
you for surgery.

513
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:00,534
What's her total bili?

514
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:02,745
It's actually only 4.

515
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:05,023
I mean, it's not great,
but it's not terrible.

516
00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:07,086
That's why I didn't
see the jaundice.

517
00:26:07,748 --> 00:26:10,375
No one could.
We just have to wait and see.

518
00:26:11,262 --> 00:26:12,876
What aren't you telling me?

519
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,830
It's Cristina.

520
00:26:19,635 --> 00:26:21,136
Have you notified the father?

521
00:26:21,654 --> 00:26:23,273
Cristina. Cristina.

522
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:26,500
Cristina. Cristina,
is there anyone we can call?

523
00:26:29,342 --> 00:26:30,238
We're losing her.

524
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:33,282
- Oh, man. You see that?
- It was an extrauterine pregnancy.

525
00:26:33,282 --> 00:26:35,232
The tube burst.
She's bleeding out.

526
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:43,502
Ah, good. You're finished.

527
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,838
I need you to do
a needle biopsy.

528
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,361
Um, I've gotta go check on--

529
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,755
there's someone I
need to see about.

530
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:51,848
I had an intern collapse on
me in the middle of surgery.

531
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:55,278
- So if this could wait--
- No, I need you to do a needle biopsy now.

532
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,327
Chief, now is not the time.

533
00:26:57,327 --> 00:27:00,715
I'm not in the mood for a debate.
You understand?

534
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:03,797
You'll do it because
I asked you to.

535
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:08,455
Because I need you to.

536
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,507
It's Ellis Grey.

537
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,223
She's gonna be okay, right?

538
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,065
How attached was she
to this pregnancy?

539
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:37,893
I don't know.

540
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:39,926
She's a pretty private person.

541
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:44,281
She's lost a lot of blood.
But I'm in control.

542
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:50,071
Dr. Bailey, you must have a
surgery or two of your own today.

543
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:51,597
I'm fine right here.

544
00:28:05,487 --> 00:28:07,389
Can you do the follow-up?
I wanna check on Cristina.

545
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,269
Yeah. You know what's
wrong with her?

546
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:12,019
- Don't.
- I'm sorry.

547
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:15,135
Don't be sorry.
I'm so tired of you being sorry.

548
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:16,889
- Don't do it.
- Dr. Grey--

549
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:18,831
Dr. Grey. Seriously?

550
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:21,629
Are you concerned about
Alex finding out about us?

551
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:23,269
Is that what matters to you?

552
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:25,185
Do you really think he cares?

553
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:30,186
Alex, do you care that I was the intern
stupid enough to screw the married attending?

554
00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:31,383
No.

555
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:34,204
- Meredith, it's okay.
- It's not okay.

556
00:28:34,204 --> 00:28:37,847
You have a wife who's
not easy to hate,

557
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:43,723
who's annoyingly kind and painfully
smart and currently saving my friend's life.

558
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:45,898
- Would you just--
- Don't.

559
00:28:46,252 --> 00:28:49,081
Stop talking to me like
you're my boyfriend.

560
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:51,585
Stop talking to me at all.

561
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:54,955
Dude--

562
00:28:54,955 --> 00:28:56,711
that was rough.

563
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,816
You need something?

564
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,547
- I'm coming in.
- No, you're not.

565
00:29:12,547 --> 00:29:14,795
- I am. I'm her friend.
- Exactly.

566
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:18,240
She's lying on the operating table,
naked, exposed.

567
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,554
She's sedated, but she's
probably scared out of her mind.

568
00:29:21,554 --> 00:29:24,750
And right now, she's not a doctor,
she's not your friend, she's a patient.

569
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,104
And she deserves to have all
the privacy I can give her.

570
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:28,819
You're not going in there.

571
00:29:32,718 --> 00:29:34,786
We went jogging this morning.

572
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:37,296
I made her go jogging.

573
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:40,254
- There's no way that could've--
- No, no.

574
00:29:40,254 --> 00:29:42,013
It started out this way.

575
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,079
Nothing caused it to happen.

576
00:29:47,236 --> 00:29:49,236
You have to let me in there.

577
00:29:49,575 --> 00:29:50,941
You can try.

578
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:52,722
I'll have to take you down.

579
00:29:53,498 --> 00:29:54,480
Hey--

580
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,911
I may be short,
but you're pretty tiny.

581
00:29:56,911 --> 00:29:58,095
I could do it.

582
00:29:58,095 --> 00:29:59,328
Right now,

583
00:29:59,328 --> 00:30:02,070
just in this moment,
I hate you.

584
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:04,530
Yeah, well--

585
00:30:04,692 --> 00:30:06,313
I can take it.

586
00:30:08,525 --> 00:30:09,955
All right, Dr. Grey.

587
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:11,970
We're going to put you to
sleep for a little while.

588
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,193
But I promise, we'll have you
back into surgery in no time.

589
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:18,286
Richard--

590
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,963
thank god you're here--

591
00:30:22,728 --> 00:30:24,451
you beautiful man.

592
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,005
That husband of mine has
been making me crazy.

593
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,669
Look at that.

594
00:31:09,903 --> 00:31:11,544
B.P.'s stabilizing.

595
00:31:11,544 --> 00:31:13,391
She's stronger
since this morning.

596
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:17,988
There's no reason in the world why she
should be stronger since this morning.

597
00:31:20,776 --> 00:31:23,383
She's really beautiful,
isn't she?

598
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:25,535
Tell you what.

599
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:30,438
If she makes it though the night and she
has a little bit more strength, I'll operate.

600
00:31:35,923 --> 00:31:37,151
You know--

601
00:31:37,948 --> 00:31:44,322
the way I see it, we could deal
with us in one of three ways.

602
00:31:44,322 --> 00:31:50,626
Option one, I could apologize,
you could forgive me and come home

603
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:54,482
and we could move on with
our lives like adults.

604
00:31:54,985 --> 00:32:01,286
Or option two, I could apologize,
you could forgive me, come home,

605
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,764
but you could still bring it up to
use against me whenever we argue.

606
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:06,881
Are you trying to be funny?

607
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:09,600
Satan has a sense of humor.

608
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:11,695
What's the third?

609
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:15,255
I don't know what
the third option is.

610
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:29,067
I just know I still love you.

611
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:42,400
Tell them the chief said to
put a rush on this biopsy

612
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,570
- and tell them it's Ellis Grey.
- Okay.

613
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:49,766
Oh, Dr. Burke, do you want the histologic
grade and staging or any specific stains?

614
00:32:49,766 --> 00:32:51,599
- Have them run all tests.
- Okay.

615
00:33:18,723 --> 00:33:19,963
What happened?

616
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,813
You had an
extrauterine pregnancy.

617
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,977
Your left fallopian tube burst.

618
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:30,983
Dr. Shepherd--

619
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:34,487
she did everything she could,

620
00:33:34,487 --> 00:33:36,462
but there was too much damage.

621
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:39,055
She couldn't save the tube.

622
00:33:52,354 --> 00:33:54,594
- Hey.
- Hey.

623
00:33:55,195 --> 00:33:57,383
- Is it over?
- Mm-hmm.

624
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:59,298
The surgery was successful.

625
00:33:59,512 --> 00:34:01,413
We're just doing a follow-up.

626
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,827
Dr. Shepherd will be in to
check on you in a while.

627
00:34:05,563 --> 00:34:08,251
- Say that again.
- What?

628
00:34:08,251 --> 00:34:11,727
Say his name, Dr. Shepher--

629
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,754
oh, my god, look at my face.

630
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,392
Dr. Shepherd.

631
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:22,581
Dr. Shepherd.

632
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:27,198
Guess it was worth the risk.

633
00:34:31,831 --> 00:34:36,381
I still think it's nuts, having major surgery
just so people can't tell how you're feelin'.

634
00:34:37,729 --> 00:34:39,639
Really? You do?

635
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:41,682
Nah, I guess not.

636
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,412
You could talk, you know.
I mean, if you need to.

637
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:47,509
I'm fine.

638
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,840
You've said that word
so many times today,

639
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,940
it doesn't even sound
like a word anymore.

640
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:53,987
I'm just sayin' you
could talk to me 'cause,

641
00:34:54,017 --> 00:34:56,700
you know, even if I repeat every word
you say, no one around here likes me.

642
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,470
They'll just calme
a liar and move on.

643
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,993
Izzie likes you.

644
00:35:02,127 --> 00:35:03,396
You're blushing.

645
00:35:03,873 --> 00:35:05,077
Shut up.

646
00:35:05,913 --> 00:35:10,442
Look, for what it's worth, I don't
know how you're still on your feet.

647
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,580
I mean, if I found out my mom might have
cancer, I'd be under the bar by now.

648
00:35:15,955 --> 00:35:17,786
You want the ugly truth?

649
00:35:17,786 --> 00:35:19,453
You have an ugly truth?

650
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,451
I never woulda pegged you
to have an ugly truth.

651
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:25,625
I'm more afraid she
doesn't have cancer.

652
00:35:25,738 --> 00:35:27,879
Well, liver cancer's fast.

653
00:35:28,016 --> 00:35:30,764
Painful, but it's fast,
and they give you morphine.

654
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:34,114
They don't give you
morphine for alzheimer's.

655
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,024
No, they don't.

656
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:41,221
What kind of person wishes
their mother had cancer?

657
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:50,444
It's hard.

658
00:35:53,866 --> 00:35:56,877
I know is hard being
the one who's gone.

659
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:06,746
But, man-- it isn't easy bein'
the one who's still around.

660
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:18,715
- Hey, did you get your mom's biopsy results back yet?
- Not yet.

661
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:20,499
How's Cristina?

662
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:22,293
She's, uh--

663
00:36:22,678 --> 00:36:26,682
she's gonna have a lot of pain for
a few days, but she'll be okay.

664
00:36:28,494 --> 00:36:30,116
I'm glad you were there.

665
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:32,295
Are you?

666
00:36:32,865 --> 00:36:34,879
Yes, I am.

667
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:37,732
It's just--

668
00:36:38,794 --> 00:36:39,962
it's just that a
lot of the time,

669
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:44,968
it feels like you and Cristina are
kinda over there, and I'm here.

670
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,043
So about Alex--

671
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:53,174
Yeah, I know, I know.
You guys hate him. Fine.

672
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,177
Yeah, we do.

673
00:36:56,177 --> 00:36:59,458
But I just wanna say
that I believe you,

674
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:02,363
that he's different once
you get to know him.

675
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:04,148
Here you go.

676
00:37:04,148 --> 00:37:05,216
Ellis Grey.

677
00:37:20,244 --> 00:37:21,756
Let her know.

678
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,329
Meredith, are you okay?

679
00:37:24,956 --> 00:37:26,165
No.

680
00:37:26,293 --> 00:37:28,178
I'm not okay.

681
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,337
Dr. Grey.

682
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:39,847
Oh, please, Thatcher.
I've had a long day. I'm tired. Go away.

683
00:37:42,025 --> 00:37:43,095
No.

684
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:47,281
- What?
- No.

685
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:53,367
I am Thatcher Grey.

686
00:37:53,975 --> 00:37:59,762
And I'm your husband, and, uh,
I know you don't like me very much, but

687
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:04,245
the fact is, I don't always
like you very much either.

688
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,762
I don't like the
way you speak to me.

689
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:13,376
And I really hate the way
you speak to Meredith.

690
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:15,285
She deserves better from you.

691
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,248
I'm sorry.

692
00:38:22,954 --> 00:38:24,072
You are?

693
00:38:24,465 --> 00:38:26,261
What's wrong with me, Thatch?

694
00:38:27,564 --> 00:38:31,977
- Uh-- the mass on your liver--
- Is it algebra?

695
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:36,278
I mean, is it algeb--

696
00:38:36,278 --> 00:38:37,390
damn it.

697
00:38:42,535 --> 00:38:44,068
Is it malignant?

698
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:47,336
No.

699
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,162
It's benign.

700
00:38:59,924 --> 00:39:00,887
Meredith.

701
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:07,504
- Meredith.
- Don't.

702
00:39:09,505 --> 00:39:13,552
Please, please,
just don't say anything.

703
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:16,427
Okay.

704
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:32,151
I'm just exhausted.

705
00:39:32,442 --> 00:39:37,215
My mother is exhausting,
what happened to Cristina--

706
00:39:37,716 --> 00:39:43,491
and you--
hating you is the most exhausting.

707
00:39:50,294 --> 00:39:52,446
I don't wanna do it anymore.

708
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,824
No one likes to loose control,

709
00:40:02,085 --> 00:40:04,927
but as a surgeon,
there's nothing worse.

710
00:40:19,665 --> 00:40:21,528
It's a sign of weakness--

711
00:40:22,595 --> 00:40:24,602
of not being up to the task.

712
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:28,584
How can someone be so offensive and
yet so charming all at the same time?

713
00:40:29,236 --> 00:40:30,376
It's an art form.

714
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:42,158
And still, there are times when
it just gets away from you--

715
00:40:44,606 --> 00:40:50,896
when the world stops spinning and you realize
that your shiny little scalpel isn't gonna save you.

716
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:54,316
We went in expecting to
simply remove the tumor.

717
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:57,555
Instead, it was a little
more complicated.

718
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,566
The tumor infiltrated
into the pericardium,

719
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:03,022
causing a tear in the
outer muscle of the heart.

720
00:41:04,016 --> 00:41:05,274
Um--

721
00:41:05,991 --> 00:41:07,784
that's a lot of medical talk.

722
00:41:09,555 --> 00:41:12,004
It means, uh, ahem--

723
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,293
it means--

724
00:41:16,796 --> 00:41:17,772
that you had--

725
00:41:17,772 --> 00:41:19,652
you had a broken
heart, literally.

726
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,637
Um--

727
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:27,071
but now I'm, um--

728
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:29,975
but now you're
going to be fine.

729
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:37,305
And no matter how hard
you fight it--

730
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:39,784
You fall.

731
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,684
And it's scary as hell.

732
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:51,343
Except, if there's an
upside to free-falling,

733
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,281
it's the chance you give
your friends to catch you.
