1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,058
Previously on
"Grey's Anatomy..."

2
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:04,127
- Divorce papers.
- The ball's in your court.

3
00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:06,650
If you sign, I'll sign and be
on the first plane out of here.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,112
Would you like to go
out with me tonight?

5
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:11,348
The hospital grants you four months
to retake the medical board exam.

6
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,153
What happens if I don't
pass the second time?

7
00:00:13,183 --> 00:00:15,784
You will no longer be a surgical
resident at Seattle Grace.

8
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:17,530
- You look great.
- Thanks.

9
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,251
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. You ready to go?

10
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:20,876
- I didn't lie.
- You withheld the truth.

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,822
How did I know you were--

12
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,293
I distinctly remember you
breaking things off with me.

13
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:25,557
- Dr. Yang.
- Cristina.

14
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:27,041
It was an
extrauterine pregnancy.

15
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:28,180
She's bleeding out.

16
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:29,860
I don't think I'm
supposed to be here.

17
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,386
No. No, you're not.

18
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:33,800
I don't want someone who
doesn't want me, Meredith,

19
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,530
but if there's the slightest chance
that he does, I'm not leaving Seattle.

20
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:44,782
Pain comes in all forms...

21
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:47,128
I had a good time. Really.

22
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,547
Thank you.
It was just the perfect evening.

23
00:00:49,547 --> 00:00:50,762
Best date ever.

24
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:51,924
- Ever.
- Izzie.

25
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:56,307
You know, I especially liked the part where
you treated me like crap the entire night.

26
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:56,961
That was fun.

27
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:58,056
I had a good time.

28
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:00,423
- Really?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:04,517
The small twinge, 
a bit of soreness, the random pain,

30
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:07,405
the normal pains 
we live with every day...

31
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:08,671
I gotta go.

32
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:13,588
Seriously?

33
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:15,934
Seriously?

34
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:18,672
Then there's the kind of
pain you can't ignore.

35
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:20,108
Seriously?

36
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:22,163
- A level of pain so great--
- Move over.

37
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:24,198
that it blocks out
everything else...

38
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:25,651
Oh, I was sleeping.

39
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:26,698
Oh, shut up.

40
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,722
Makes the rest of the
world fade away...

41
00:01:30,722 --> 00:01:33,368
- I don't want to have this conversation again.
- Meredith.

42
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:35,148
You didn't sign
the divorce papers.

43
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:35,990
Fine. I get it.

44
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,644
- End of discussion.
- Meredith.

45
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,221
What?!

46
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,276
Until all we can think about...

47
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:43,315
is how much we hurt...

48
00:01:43,387 --> 00:01:45,645
I usually just say "Meredith,"
and then you yell at me.

49
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:47,536
I haven't thought
past that point.

50
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:49,768
I actually didn't have
anything planned.

51
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:53,370
- How we manage our pain is up to us.
- What is that? Hey, stop it!

52
00:01:54,174 --> 00:01:56,617
Seriously?! Seriously?

53
00:01:56,743 --> 00:01:58,102
Seriously?

54
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,655
This is a very small bed.

55
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:03,435
He's a brain surgeon.

56
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:05,830
I look fantastic.

57
00:02:05,923 --> 00:02:07,159
I shaved my legs.

58
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:08,415
He's a brain surgeon.

59
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:09,981
How can he be so brainless?

60
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:12,089
Hello? Seriously.

61
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,365
Seriously.

62
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:14,919
Shh.

63
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,498
Pain...

64
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:25,455
We anesthetize, ride it out,
embrace it, ignore it...

65
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:36,992
and for some of us, the best way to
manage pain is just to push through it.

66
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,782
You're drippin'.

67
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:46,344
I'm back.
I just wanna make that clear.

68
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,920
I'm back. I'm ready to work.

69
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:49,750
Has anyone seen
Dr. Shepherd this morning?

70
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,984
His name's on the O.R. board.

71
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:52,414
He should be here somewhere.

72
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:53,212
I'm good.

73
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,259
I'm ready to scrub in.

74
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:55,639
I'm 100% on top of my game.

75
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,853
You just got discharged.

76
00:02:56,883 --> 00:02:58,505
- Pace yourself.
- I'm paced. I'm paced.

77
00:02:58,535 --> 00:03:00,516
Mm-hmm. Rounds, people.

78
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:05,755
What? You're not
talkin' to me anymore?

79
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:07,296
Okay, what happened last night?

80
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:08,626
What is going on with you?

81
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:10,237
I'm fine.

82
00:03:10,964 --> 00:03:12,022
What's your problem?

83
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:14,426
Fine.

84
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,430
You know what, Alex?

85
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,210
No, I'm not talking
to you anymore.

86
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:21,731
Ahem. Dr. Bailey?

87
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:26,576
Henry Lamott, age 42, is scheduled
with Dr. Shepherd for a spinal implant

88
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,554
to control the pain of his herniated disc, 
is allergic to all pain medication.

89
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:32,733
Is that...

90
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:33,809
porn.

91
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:34,942
Porn?

92
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:37,217
- As in "porn"?
- All right.

93
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:38,340
What are we watching?

94
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,360
Karev, go stand in the hall.

95
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:45,546
Uh, Mr. And Mrs. Lamott, 
I'm sure you are really nice people,

96
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:47,383
and what you do in 
the privacy of your own--

97
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,785
look, we can't have porn in here.
This is a hospital.

98
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:52,163
It's for my pain.

99
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,644
My doc says it releases 
endorphins in the brain,

100
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:57,247
and it helps keep my 
pain at a manageable level.

101
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:59,283
- Really?
- George-- hall.

102
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,907
- What is this?
- "Nasty, naughty nurses..."

103
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:09,659
Um, "4."

104
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:15,102
That does not look comfortable.

105
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:17,047
Trust me, it's not.

106
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:20,585
Get in the hall.

107
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:32,935
Nobody knows where they
might end up nobody knows.

108
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,755
Oh, oh

109
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,908
Suppose you'll never know.

110
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:53,344
O'Malley, Karev,
you're in the pit today.

111
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,042
Stevens, there's a cardiac
patient waiting for you up on two.

112
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:57,897
Yang, keep an eye
on the Lamotts.

113
00:04:57,995 --> 00:04:59,515
I don't want any problems. Go.

114
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:02,577
Grey, your mother's being
discharged this evening.

115
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,402
You've made arrangements,
or do you need more time?

116
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:05,764
The nursing home
is coming at 8.

117
00:05:05,794 --> 00:05:08,744
All right. Then you're with
Shepherd--Derek Shepherd today.

118
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:10,629
Hey, life is short.

119
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,563
Times are hard.

120
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:13,820
The road is long with
many a winding turn.

121
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,720
He asked for you.
Take it up with him.

122
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,725
Okay.

123
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:25,121
Pete Willoughby, 25-year-old G.S.W.
to the chest.

124
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:29,274
- Immediate return of 860 C.Cs of blood...
- Oh, man, this hurts.

125
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:31,706
He's put out more than 200
C.Cs over the past hour.

126
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:34,077
They never tell you in movies
how much it hurts to get shot.

127
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:35,530
Push morphine, 2 milligrams.

128
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:36,785
Alex, this is my case.

129
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:38,216
Morphine, 5 milligrams.

130
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:40,025
- You didn't even call him.
- I don't have to call him.

131
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:42,734
- I was here first.
- You got here first because I let you.

132
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:44,024
Where's the chest films?

133
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:45,547
I got 'em.

134
00:05:45,648 --> 00:05:46,652
You always get the surgery.

135
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:48,055
Today, I'm getting a surgery.

136
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:49,179
Guys, knock it off.

137
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:50,635
He's one of Seattle's finest.

138
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:53,123
You've got an entire
police force watching you.

139
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:58,166
Page Dr. Burke.

140
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,600
- Let him know I'm bringin' up a G.S.W.
- That we are bringing up a G.S.W.

141
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,875
Looks like you'll be able
to go home today, Ellis.

142
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:09,206
But I still have
patients to see.

143
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,014
No. No more patients.

144
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,972
I'll be back to check
on you later, okay?

145
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,703
You should know I'm thinking
of leaving Thatcher.

146
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:20,237
I should never
have married him.

147
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,131
I'll leave him,
you leave Adele.

148
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:26,091
Then when our residency's over, we can
both get jobs at the same hospital.

149
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:28,821
Why don't you get her meds
ready for discharge, nurse?

150
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,674
Thank you.

151
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,895
<i>Dr. Chin, two west.<i>

152
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:33,315
<i>Dr. Chin, two west.<i>

153
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,190
Ellis... that was a long
time ago, remember?

154
00:06:39,884 --> 00:06:42,272
We had this discussion
21 years ago.

155
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:43,578
Think about it, Richard.

156
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:45,053
We should make the break now.

157
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:46,971
If we wait until 
residency's over,

158
00:06:46,995 --> 00:06:49,073
you'll be at one hospital, 
and I'll be at another.

159
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,370
We could end up at opposite
ends of the country.

160
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,544
It'll be too late.

161
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,883
- Meredith.
- Your wife is looking for you.

162
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:02,117
Oh, my god.

163
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:03,503
This is hard for me, 
Meredith.

164
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:04,757
Well, let me make
it easy, then.

165
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:06,120
I'm not gonna be that woman--

166
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,899
the one who breaks up a marriage
or begs you to want me.

167
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,016
You can sign the papers or you cannot.
The choice is yours.

168
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:14,942
Either way, when it comes to
this relationship, I'm out.

169
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,088
Now where's this patient I'm
supposed to be helping you with?

170
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:19,373
Down there.

171
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:23,826
You shouldn't have tried to
walk the dog in the rain.

172
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:25,411
Oh, Lou, it wasn't the rain.

173
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,999
I just passed out.

174
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:29,017
- Actually, Mrs. Bradley--
- Verna.

175
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:32,191
Verna, you presented with
lateral S.T. elevations

176
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,875
and reciprocal inferior changes
consistent with an M.I.--

177
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:36,872
- A heart attack.
- Oh, my god.

178
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,206
Lou, don't worry. Come on.

179
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:42,206
I've had these little chest pains
before, and it turned out to be nothing.

180
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:43,338
This is nothing.

181
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:47,633
Lou, not in front
of the doctor.

182
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:50,508
I've had a twinge in
my back for awhile.

183
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,001
I thought it would go away, 
but then last night,

184
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:56,496
my legs went numb, 
and this morning, my back--

185
00:07:56,697 --> 00:07:58,516
the pain is just too much.

186
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,283
Ms. Chue, let me put 
you on a P.C.A. pump,

187
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,961
give you some morphine, 
which should help control the pain.

188
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:04,744
Thank you.

189
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,298
But there's a
greater problem here.

190
00:08:06,328 --> 00:08:08,878
- I've just taken a look at your M.R.I.--
- Anna...

191
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:13,654
- Why didn't you call us before coming down here?
- I'm sorry.

192
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:14,964
These are my parents.

193
00:08:15,808 --> 00:08:17,165
- Hi.
- What's going on?

194
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,325
I was just about to 
explain that Anna's M.R.I.

195
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:21,743
has shown that she has 
a myxopapillary ependymoma--

196
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:26,358
it's a tumor in her spinal canal, but
the good news is that we can operate.

197
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:28,685
You have a 95% 
chance of fully recovering

198
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:30,869
if we get you into 
surgery as soon as possible.

199
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,223
We can't wait another moment.

200
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:34,359
With a tumor this aggressive, 
even waiting another day

201
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:36,220
puts you at risk for 
permanent paralysis.

202
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:38,987
Father?

203
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:41,933
N o.

204
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,760
No surgery.

205
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:48,593
Mr. Chue, without surgery, Anna will be
paralyzed probably within the next 24 hours.

206
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:50,085
There'll be no surgery today.

207
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:52,615
- We're taking her home.
- Anna needs the surgery.

208
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,016
Then she can have
it at another time.

209
00:08:54,046 --> 00:08:56,820
- Look, Mr. Chue--
- We are taking our daughter home.

210
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:01,614
Anna, you've over 18.

211
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:04,028
You don't need your
father's consent.

212
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:10,030
I'm Hmong,
and my father is the elder.

213
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:13,122
If he says I go home,
I go home.

214
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:19,634
Hmong? Let's find
out what that means.

215
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:23,355
Contact social services. See if we can
get somebody down here to talk to him.

216
00:09:23,385 --> 00:09:25,793
- Do I continue to process her discharge?
- Yeah, we have to.

217
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:26,875
It's insane, but we have to.

218
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:29,538
It reminds me of this case I had in New York
one time where this woman came to the office--

219
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:32,168
Look, do you need me for
anything else work related?

220
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:38,592
Look, I was married
for 11 years.

221
00:09:38,686 --> 00:09:39,736
Addison is my family.

222
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:43,552
That is 11 Thanksgivings, 11 birthdays
and 11 christmases, and in one day,

223
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:46,203
I'm supposed to sign a piece
of paper and end my family?

224
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:47,533
A person doesn't do that--

225
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:48,882
not without a
little hesitation.

226
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:51,044
I'm entitled to a little
uncertainty here.

227
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:55,459
Just a moment to understand the magnitude
of what it means to cut somebody out of my life.

228
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:57,389
I'm entitled to at
least one moment...

229
00:09:57,855 --> 00:10:00,354
of painful doubt.

230
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:03,301
And a little understanding
from you would be nice.

231
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,014
- Dr. Shepherd, still here, I see.
- I couldn't leave you.

232
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:11,878
Have you seen the
other Dr. Shepherd?

233
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:13,758
I'll tell him you're
lookin' for him.

234
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:18,209
So thanks for,
you know, being there.

235
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:19,403
No thanks needed.

236
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:20,732
Okay.

237
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:21,924
So where are we?

238
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,172
Uh, the northeast
corner of the hospital.

239
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,646
Oh, I-I'm getting
back on my feet.

240
00:10:26,817 --> 00:10:27,621
Fine.

241
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,709
- But that doesn't mean that--
- Cristina.

242
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:31,089
It's my first day back.

243
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:32,378
I'm not waiting forever.

244
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,383
Hey, Karev and O'Malley
are bringing up a G.S.W.

245
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:40,690
- You want to scrub in?
- No can do. No extra work.

246
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,586
I'm trying to get out of here
at a decent hour tonight.

247
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:43,585
What, you got a date?

248
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:45,215
Yes. Yes, I do.

249
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:49,665
A handsome man is whisking me away
to a love nest for the weekend.

250
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:53,524
You got shot in
the line of duty?

251
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:55,371
First month on the job.

252
00:10:55,462 --> 00:10:56,662
Can you believe my luck?

253
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,659
Guy pulls a gun, and I freeze up
the rookie let himself get shot.

254
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:03,152
I'm never gonna live this down.

255
00:11:03,182 --> 00:11:04,242
Sure, you will.

256
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:05,488
You think?

257
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:07,563
Absolutely.

258
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,585
Hey, I got Verna
Bradley's tests back.

259
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,524
I don't think she
had a heart attack.

260
00:11:14,993 --> 00:11:17,821
Yeah, but look at the changes in
her E.K.G. she had somethin'.

261
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,787
Yeah, but her serial enzymes and
dobutamine stress echo came back negative.

262
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:22,659
I actually think she's fine.

263
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:23,999
Get a cardiac cath.

264
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:25,243
Izzie, be thorough.

265
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:27,881
I am thorough.

266
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,204
So, dude,
what's the deal with Izzie?

267
00:11:30,234 --> 00:11:31,895
She shaved her legs for you.

268
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,691
- And?
- And you didn't even kiss her good night.

269
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:36,727
She shaved her legs for you,
and you didn't follow through?

270
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:37,752
Hey, I follow through.

271
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:39,049
I always follow through.

272
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:40,158
You didn't last night.

273
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:41,338
Mind your own business.

274
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:42,328
Mind--

275
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:45,409
she had expectations.

276
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:48,439
Women have expectations,
and you didn't meet them.

277
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:52,567
Hey, I live with these women, and every
time you guys don't meet their expectations,

278
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:55,499
I have to hear about it.
I didn't get any sleep last night.

279
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:57,257
So, you know,
it is my business.

280
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,934
Dude, we're not moving.

281
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:11,705
Really? Ya think?

282
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,870
<i>Dr. Cole, 2-6-2-1.</i>

283
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:23,195
<i>Dr. Cole, 2-6-2-1.</i>

284
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:33,871
You know how long a surgical
scar takes to heal.

285
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:35,697
You must be in pain.

286
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:37,075
You should take something.

287
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:38,500
Drugs are for babies.

288
00:12:38,562 --> 00:12:39,308
I hate Alex.

289
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:42,884
- And the non sequitur award goes to...
- I'm sorry.

290
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,116
I hate Alex.

291
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,213
I broke up with Derek.

292
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:51,087
Burke wants to have
a relationship.

293
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:52,514
Boys are stupid.

294
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,205
"If elevator should stop,
do not become alarmed."

295
00:13:02,305 --> 00:13:05,297
"Press the button marked
"alarm" to summon assistance."

296
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:08,340
If they don't want us to be alarmed,
then why call the button "alarm?"

297
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,827
That didn't work the last
five times you did it.

298
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:11,401
Get it through your head.
We've lost power.

299
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:12,533
We're stuck here.

300
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:14,534
You okay?

301
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,226
His pressure's falling.

302
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:20,429
Alex, there's a lot more of
his blood in the pleurovac.

303
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,589
We need to get him to the O.R.

304
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:22,753
Okay, you're whispering.

305
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:23,635
Don't whisper.

306
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:26,445
I mean, look, I don't wanna complain
here, but I got a bullet in my chest,

307
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:29,775
and whispering isn't a sign that
I'm going to be a-okay, you know?

308
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:31,230
Damn it, it's out.

309
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:33,784
It's bad. It's bad, right?

310
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:36,266
Someone's gonna get us out of here.
Don't worry.

311
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:40,013
How are we doing?

312
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:41,717
Oh, can you move me
to another room?

313
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:43,483
The lights and the tv went out.

314
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:46,643
Power outage in the east wing.
They'll have it back on soon.

315
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,615
You're not a critical patient.
You'll be fine here.

316
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:50,440
Oh, god, well,
what am I gonna do?

317
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:53,013
- You mean...
- Without my porn?

318
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:55,284
Read a book.

319
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,302
Talk to your wife.

320
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:58,253
No, school closed early
because of the storm.

321
00:13:58,283 --> 00:13:59,484
She had to pick up the kids.

322
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:01,561
She won't be back
until after dinner.

323
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:06,740
Well, I'm sure you can find some
normal way of amusing yourself.

324
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:09,314
I need my porn!

325
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,648
Lightning hit a substation.

326
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:13,456
We're running on
backup generators.

327
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,523
One of them's down.

328
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:15,891
Richard, breathe.

329
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:18,248
The only direct means of transporting patients

330
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:20,514
from the E.R. to the O.R. isn't working.

331
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:21,695
Don't tell me to breathe.

332
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:23,325
I'll breathe if
I wanna breathe.

333
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,139
The car's between floors.

334
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:28,136
How bad is it?

335
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,333
Two interns are on a
G.S.W to the chest.

336
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:31,556
Good air in.

337
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,018
Bad air out.

338
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:36,438
Come on, people.
Get those doors open.

339
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,984
It's jammed up.
I won't open anymore.

340
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,219
- Move, move.
- This is as wide as it goes.

341
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,243
What did you two do?

342
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,311
- Nothing!
- Nothing!

343
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:51,468
How's the patient?

344
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,000
He's not looking so good.

345
00:15:00,511 --> 00:15:02,032
Why do the lights
keep flickering?

346
00:15:02,062 --> 00:15:04,000
Something about a
backup generator.

347
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:08,534
This pump will provide you with a morphine
drip, and it should stop your pain.

348
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:12,205
I-I told you I don't need it.
I'm going home.

349
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:18,067
You realize you'll have to sign an A.M.A. form
stating that you're leaving against medical advice.

350
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:18,907
Fine.

351
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,697
I know this is
new and confusing.

352
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,122
I called a social worker, and she's
willing to come down and talk to you.

353
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:31,607
Spare me your white girl
cultural divide love.

354
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:34,070
I grew up down the street from here.
I play in a band.

355
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,551
I went to U-Dub. I get it.

356
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:37,335
But my father doesn't.

357
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:40,131
He says no, it's no.

358
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:44,260
Anna, we're talking about your
ability to ever walk again.

359
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:46,279
That's what you're
talking about.

360
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:47,902
I'm talking about my family.

361
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:50,232
Have you ever even heard
of the Hmong people?

362
00:15:50,262 --> 00:15:53,747
Our religion has got rules that 
are way old and way set in stone

363
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,141
and way spiritual, 
and you don't mess with them.

364
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,307
You don't anger
the ancestors...

365
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:03,078
even if you pierce your
tongue and play in a band.

366
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,197
What are the rules exactly?

367
00:16:08,757 --> 00:16:11,260
All I.C.U. patients are
goin' to the south wing.

368
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:13,657
All telemetry and step-down patients,
north wing.

369
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:16,535
- You paged me.
- Porn as pain management?

370
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,386
You met Henry.

371
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:19,724
Yeah, there are a lot of different
theories as to how to treat pain.

372
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:21,566
Porn as pain management?

373
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:24,343
Look, it's possible that pornography,
like art and music,

374
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:27,354
can stimulate the brain to produce
endorphins that minimize pain.

375
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:31,144
- Porn as pain management.
- I didn't prescribe it. It wasn't me.

376
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,901
Take it up with the
treating physician.

377
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:36,044
If that man turns out to be some
sort of sex weirdo, it's on you.

378
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:36,917
That's all I'm sayin'.

379
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:39,347
- Oh, and your wife's lookin' for you.
- I know.

380
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:41,868
- Derek.
- Yes.

381
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:43,261
You need to talk
to Anna's father.

382
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,179
I'd do it myself, but I guess
having testicles is a requirement.

383
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:47,859
What happened to
social services?

384
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,982
According to Anna,
they can't help us.

385
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,667
Apparently, Anna's father believes she's
missing something that she needs for surgery.

386
00:16:53,697 --> 00:16:55,297
Missing something?
Missing what?

387
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,510
One of her souls.

388
00:16:57,671 --> 00:16:58,969
We don't need a social worker.

389
00:16:58,999 --> 00:16:59,986
We need a shaman.

390
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:02,125
A shaman?

391
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,505
Cardio tells me your
cath went just fine.

392
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:07,158
Is that much bruising normal?

393
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,870
Your wound looks good, Mrs. Bradley,
and so do the results on your cath,

394
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:12,720
you don't have any
blockage in your arteries.

395
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,561
Which means?

396
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:14,953
You definitely did not
have a heart attack.

397
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:16,094
Oh ho ho.

398
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:18,953
So I can go home?

399
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,209
Not yet.

400
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:22,510
Your E.K.G. shows significant changes,

401
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:25,381
and I'm going to find out why 
before you leave the hospital.

402
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,009
Hey, Pete, what are you doin'?

403
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:32,639
I have to get home.

404
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:34,179
Pete, you're in the hospital.

405
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:35,691
I need to get home.

406
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:37,688
I need to get home.

407
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,946
What's his blood pressure?

408
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,776
It's not reading.
He's too agitated.

409
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:41,964
How's his pulse?

410
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:42,940
It's thready,
but it's still there.

411
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,938
- Do you have any instruments in there?
- Just the code box and some gloves.

412
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:47,443
You didn't bring an
open chest tray?

413
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:49,345
- No, we thought--
- You don't have time for excuses.

414
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,439
O'Malley, blood pressure.

415
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,320
- I've taken it three times.
- And?

416
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:54,312
I can't hear a
systolic over 50.

417
00:17:57,824 --> 00:17:58,868
He's gonna die.

418
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:06,483
Intubate him.
I'll be right back.

419
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:07,813
Wait. Where are you going?

420
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:09,333
To get an instrument tray.

421
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:11,857
You guys are going to have
to open up his chest.

422
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:16,689
Are you sure about that?

423
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:17,877
No.

424
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:38,387
When's Burke coming back?

425
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:44,803
When is Dr. Burke coming back?

426
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:47,678
- Alex?
- Oh, would you shut up?

427
00:18:54,695 --> 00:18:55,821
Mr. Chue...

428
00:18:56,687 --> 00:18:59,087
you want to take Anna home
for a healing ritual?

429
00:18:59,128 --> 00:19:02,493
When sickness comes, it means
that one of our souls is missing.

430
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:05,979
Anna needs to have her souls
intact before she has surgery.

431
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:07,182
She needs a shaman.

432
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:09,302
Well, you could
have told me that.

433
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:11,935
Why, so you could
call me a fool?

434
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:15,003
I respect that you have traditions
that I can't understand,

435
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:19,668
but you're standin' beside me in a $3,000
suit, so I also know that you respect the fact

436
00:19:19,698 --> 00:19:24,698
that I'm telling you Anna needs the surgery in the
next 24 hours if she's going to continue to walk.

437
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,375
She can't leave this hospital.

438
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:29,218
She can't undergo surgery
without her soul. She'd die.

439
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:34,932
All right, then.

440
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:39,361
We're just gonna have to get a
shaman--today--in the hospital.

441
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:42,025
Shamans aren't listed
in the yellow pages.

442
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,050
Our shaman is 500
miles from here.

443
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:45,575
You are an arrogant man.

444
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:48,481
No. I'm just a guy with
access to a helicopter.

445
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:54,697
Thank you.

446
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:58,392
Finding her soul won't be easy.

447
00:19:58,643 --> 00:19:59,573
It never is.

448
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:02,395
This is unconscionable.

449
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:04,388
There's not enough power
to move those elevators?

450
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:07,794
They're doin' what they can to replace the backup
generator now. Fire department's is standing by.

451
00:20:07,824 --> 00:20:09,827
- All critical patients?
- Moved to the south wing.

452
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:11,938
- Incoming trauma?
- Rerouted to Mercy West.

453
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:15,150
- That backup generator should've been replaced last year.
- Yes, sir.

454
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,230
Why didn't it happen?

455
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:20,080
Chief, you'd...
have to ask maintenance.

456
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:21,866
I wouldn't know.

457
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:24,469
Dr. Bailey,
you know everything.

458
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:26,110
Tell me whose butt to kick.

459
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:29,129
That would be your butt, chief.

460
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:33,736
You didn't authorize the replacement generator,
saving money for the new M.R.I. machine.

461
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,054
Um... I need to get on back
on down to the... O.R.

462
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:50,940
Hey.

463
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:53,943
This isn't gonna be too sterile,
but we can still try.

464
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:55,323
Prep and drape the patient.

465
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,506
Hey, can you get me copies of all
Verna Bradley's medical records?

466
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:33,486
And page me.
I'll be on the O.R. floor.

467
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:37,239
Hey, where, um, hey,
where are you two going so fast?

468
00:21:37,345 --> 00:21:40,498
Burke is talking George and Alex
through heart surgery in the elevator.

469
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:42,944
Shepherd's setting up a
shaman healing ritual.

470
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,969
Rock on.

471
00:21:45,702 --> 00:21:47,250
I have porn guy.

472
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:51,515
Help, please.

473
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:54,305
Mr. Lamott, what's wrong?

474
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:56,825
Your pressure's elevated.

475
00:21:58,449 --> 00:21:59,613
Your pulse is racing.

476
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,100
- You're really in pain.
- What'd you think?

477
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:06,238
Are you telling me the
porn actually sedated you?

478
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:09,476
What do you think, I'm some kind of
pervert, watching that stuff in front of you?

479
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:11,199
Well, yes.

480
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,857
Oh, okay. Okay.

481
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:20,232
You're allergic to most
narcotics and nsaids.

482
00:22:20,587 --> 00:22:24,756
I-I suppose, uh, we could try
droperidol and diphenhydramine.

483
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:26,852
That put me into
a coma last year.

484
00:22:27,617 --> 00:22:30,753
Well, um,
I can get an anesthesiologist down here.

485
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,957
Oh, no, but with your surgery tomorrow,
I don't think he'll give you an epidural block.

486
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,223
What am I gonna do?

487
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:37,540
Uh, hold on.

488
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,058
We're really gonna do this?

489
00:22:56,746 --> 00:22:57,658
Take these.

490
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:04,488
Karev, take the scalpel.

491
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,070
Alex, come on.

492
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,180
Alex.

493
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:30,895
Ventilate.

494
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,224
I got it.

495
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:43,977
What do I do?

496
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:50,108
Make a large anterolateral midaxillary
incision in the fifth intercostal space.

497
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,588
How--how large?

498
00:23:56,072 --> 00:23:57,185
As long as possible.

499
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:58,706
You need to get
two hands in there.

500
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:00,558
It needs to be long and deep.

501
00:24:00,657 --> 00:24:02,201
Use the scissors
if you have to.

502
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:03,203
Okay.

503
00:24:06,177 --> 00:24:08,020
But be sure you don't cut
into the lung or heart.

504
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,350
How can I be sure of that?

505
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:11,702
You just have to be sure.

506
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,677
We're not in Kansas anymore.

507
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:44,230
Your shaman's late.

508
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:46,916
My shaman is never late.

509
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,940
Can you guys see anything?

510
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:55,801
Poor George.
He doesn't have the steadiest hands.

511
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:57,276
- Izzie.
- Yeah.

512
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,848
He can hear you.

513
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:01,727
O'Malley...

514
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:03,117
how you doin' down there?

515
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:07,495
Uh, the fire department's here.

516
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:09,907
- They can get the doors open.
- No. Nobody moves.

517
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:11,387
Nobody works on the elevator.

518
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:13,782
I have an open chest and a
very nervous intern in there.

519
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,662
Keep them back until
I give the word.

520
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:17,758
- Okay, guys, we're not...
- O'Malley...

521
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,373
I didn't cut the
heart or the lungs.

522
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:24,481
- Dr. Burke, I didn't cut the heart or the lungs.
- Okay, good, good.

523
00:25:24,511 --> 00:25:25,911
Good, O'Malley. Really good.

524
00:25:25,949 --> 00:25:28,966
Now check for injuries
and do a pericardiotomy.

525
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:33,158
I'll need some lap pads, forceps,
metzenbaums and satinsky clamps.

526
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:37,714
Yes, you will.

527
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:42,960
You tell anyone I did this for you, 
not only will I kill you,

528
00:25:42,983 --> 00:25:45,301
I will sell your body parts for cash.

529
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:49,073
Okay. So...

530
00:25:50,697 --> 00:25:51,897
there were these women--

531
00:25:52,591 --> 00:25:53,598
nurses--

532
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:54,811
three nurses--

533
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:56,347
And they were...

534
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:58,308
naughty.

535
00:25:58,894 --> 00:26:00,860
They're really, really naughty.

536
00:26:00,972 --> 00:26:02,645
They were three naughty nurses.

537
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,190
Saucy even--

538
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,391
they were saucy and
bad and naughty.

539
00:26:07,552 --> 00:26:09,332
Three saucy, bad,
naughty nurses--

540
00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:12,069
they were taking
a shower together.

541
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:16,263
Soaping each other up, 
and then this Doctor walks in,

542
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:21,705
and he sees these three naughty, 
bad nurses with these great big...

543
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:25,492
Mrs. Bradley, do you realize 
that you've been admitted

544
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:28,104
to the hospital on this date 
for the past seven years?

545
00:26:28,158 --> 00:26:29,595
Oh, that can't be.

546
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:32,261
I don't remember the
date exactly, but--

547
00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:33,729
I have the medical records.

548
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:37,763
On this date for the past seven years,
you have what looks like a heart attack.

549
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:40,241
No. No.

550
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:42,331
I know I've had some scares,
but I don't--

551
00:26:42,331 --> 00:26:44,332
Every year on this date?

552
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:48,031
Is there some significance to
this date for you personally?

553
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:49,760
No. Nothin'.

554
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:53,422
What were you doing the first year, the
first time you had a cardiac episode?

555
00:26:53,452 --> 00:26:56,109
Oh, who can remember
back that far?

556
00:26:56,222 --> 00:26:59,045
We were in the yard.
I remember because our neighbor--

557
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,072
what was his name?

558
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:01,713
Ted.

559
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:03,184
That's right. He died.

560
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:05,290
Of an aneurysm, I think.

561
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:08,420
And we watched as the funeral 
home people took him away,

562
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:10,769
and you had your first attack.

563
00:27:10,822 --> 00:27:12,122
And you were close to Ted?

564
00:27:12,193 --> 00:27:15,501
No. Oh, we barely knew Ted.

565
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:19,535
Well, that was all very sad, but what
does that have to do with Verna's heart?

566
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,443
I removed a small clot
from the pericardium.

567
00:27:28,117 --> 00:27:29,862
No obvious cardiac injuries.

568
00:27:29,957 --> 00:27:31,091
Any change in the vitals?

569
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:33,181
B.P.is still too low to
register on the monitor.

570
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:34,861
We need to
cross-clamp the aorta.

571
00:27:40,314 --> 00:27:45,445
Stick your hand in and bluntly dissect
down until you feel two tube-like structures.

572
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:48,558
The esophagus will be
more medial and anterior.

573
00:27:49,455 --> 00:27:52,302
Um, I feel one tube 
that's easily collapsible,

574
00:27:52,372 --> 00:27:56,329
and the other's, uh, 
more muscular and spongy.

575
00:27:56,648 --> 00:27:59,703
I can feel the spine
just underneath it.

576
00:27:59,829 --> 00:28:01,508
Yes! You're touching the aorta.

577
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,144
I'm touching the aorta.

578
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:07,119
Wrap the index finger of 
your left hand around it and apply

579
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,503
a satinsky clamp 
with your right hand.

580
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:17,250
Got it.

581
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:20,996
Wait, I-I think I can
localize the bleeding.

582
00:28:21,163 --> 00:28:23,460
I think it's coming from
the inferior vena cava.

583
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,690
Can you find the lesion?

584
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:26,369
Yeah.

585
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:28,125
Yeah, I think I can feel it.

586
00:28:29,828 --> 00:28:31,372
It's too far in to repair.

587
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:32,377
How big is it?

588
00:28:32,472 --> 00:28:33,249
Small.

589
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:35,043
Maybe smaller than a dime.

590
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:38,727
Okay, O'Malley, I want you to take
your finger and plug the hole.

591
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,366
I think I can feel his
heart starting to fill more.

592
00:28:46,796 --> 00:28:49,096
- It's beating a little stronger.
- Excellent.

593
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,343
Keep your finger there.

594
00:28:50,456 --> 00:28:51,982
Okay. Now what?

595
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:54,056
That's it.

596
00:28:54,908 --> 00:28:55,958
That's it?

597
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:03,148
I just stand here with my
finger plugging the hole?

598
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:06,402
Until we can get you out of
that elevator and into the O.R.

599
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,360
Dr. Bailey, you can tell the
firemen to get my guys outta there.

600
00:29:10,573 --> 00:29:11,437
Will do.

601
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,692
Okay, we're ready.

602
00:29:15,476 --> 00:29:16,351
O'Malley.

603
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:17,555
Yes, sir.

604
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:19,205
You just flew solo.

605
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,126
Thank you, sir.

606
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:39,250
Okay, Anna, we're gonna shut off the P.C.A
pump now, which means you'll be in a lot of pain

607
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:41,815
- for the duration of the--
- The healing ritual.

608
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:43,213
Are you okay with that?

609
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:47,198
Yeah. I can't find my
soul if I'm medicated.

610
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:49,304
No pain, no gain, right?

611
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,802
It's not just for your father.

612
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,182
You believe it, too, right?

613
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:56,910
I know it sounds like a load of crap,
but watch the ritual, you'll see.

614
00:29:57,207 --> 00:29:58,332
See what?

615
00:29:58,827 --> 00:30:00,273
The moment it happens.

616
00:30:27,024 --> 00:30:31,198
"Oh, yes, I'm so very,
very naughty,"

617
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:35,619
Bianca said as she, uh,
dropped her stethoscope.

618
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:40,756
"Me, too," said Crystal as she 
snapped on her surgical glove,

619
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:43,410
and then there was Marta...

620
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:56,007
- Where was I?
- Marta.

621
00:30:56,199 --> 00:31:02,118
Oh, yes. Marta was the naughtiest
nurse of all because she knew how to--

622
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:04,236
Oh, thank god.

623
00:31:04,894 --> 00:31:05,730
We're back up.

624
00:31:18,483 --> 00:31:21,233
How long do you think it
takes to retrieve a lost soul?

625
00:31:27,074 --> 00:31:28,111
I don't know.

626
00:31:30,046 --> 00:31:31,223
Way to go, George.

627
00:31:31,524 --> 00:31:32,833
I have my finger in a heart.

628
00:31:32,863 --> 00:31:33,850
Very cool.

629
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:51,096
You have stress cardiomyopathy.

630
00:31:51,335 --> 00:31:54,313
Cardiomyopathy? What--can
you tell me what that is?

631
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,477
It's Ted.

632
00:31:57,698 --> 00:31:58,546
Ted?

633
00:31:59,146 --> 00:31:59,875
Ted.

634
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,619
Not just a neighbor you barely knew,
was he?

635
00:32:04,118 --> 00:32:06,068
I don't know what
you're talking about.

636
00:32:06,362 --> 00:32:10,664
Because every year on the day he died,
you get a rush of adrenaline caused by stress.

637
00:32:11,511 --> 00:32:14,556
Your pressure rises,
you have chest pains...

638
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:17,010
and you end up here.

639
00:32:19,377 --> 00:32:20,870
27 years...

640
00:32:22,688 --> 00:32:25,487
I loved the man next
door and he loved me.

641
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,252
I know how this
is gonna sound...

642
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,597
Ted was my soul mate.

643
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:36,724
And then he just died.

644
00:32:38,734 --> 00:32:39,723
It's grief.

645
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:43,344
Your heart stops because
you're grieving for Ted.

646
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,783
So...

647
00:32:47,774 --> 00:32:48,952
what do I do next?

648
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:50,758
I mean, how do you treat it?

649
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,287
I wish I knew.

650
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,890
I told Thatch I'm leaving him.

651
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:41,139
You left Thatcher, Ellis.

652
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:44,169
But I couldn't bring
myself to leave Adele.

653
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:46,068
Do you remember?

654
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,239
Painted horses...

655
00:33:51,873 --> 00:33:52,575
Yes.

656
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,583
We were on the
carousel in the park.

657
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:56,454
It was raining.

658
00:33:58,008 --> 00:33:59,808
I have an offer from
Boston General.

659
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:01,509
You took it to get away.

660
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,065
We swore we'd never talk again
about what we had together.

661
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:07,340
It was gonna always
be our secret.

662
00:34:08,954 --> 00:34:09,810
Richard...

663
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,801
Yes, Ellis.

664
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:14,769
Carousels give me the creeps.

665
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:19,991
How do you put up with it?

666
00:34:20,403 --> 00:34:25,368
I mean, "nasty, naughty nurses
4," and I'm assuming 1, 2 and 3?

667
00:34:25,645 --> 00:34:26,799
He's my Henry.

668
00:34:26,924 --> 00:34:30,474
I know, but don't you find it
misogynistic and degrading and kind of...

669
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:34,156
24 hours a day of porn?

670
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,754
Seriously, that's your life?

671
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,258
I'm grateful for it.

672
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:38,940
It takes away his pain.

673
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,729
And see, the thing is, Henry--

674
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:43,950
Henry takes away my pain.

675
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:53,621
I lied.

676
00:35:54,512 --> 00:35:57,065
I'm not out of
this relationship.

677
00:35:57,367 --> 00:36:01,773
I'm in. I'm so in it's humiliating
because here I am begging--

678
00:36:01,773 --> 00:36:03,223
- Meredith, just--
- Shut up.

679
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,962
You say "Meredith,"
and I yell, remember?

680
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:09,533
Okay... here it is.

681
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:12,261
Your choice, it's simple--

682
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,180
her or me.

683
00:36:15,097 --> 00:36:16,697
And I'm sure she's
really great.

684
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:20,567
But, Derek, I love you...

685
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,791
in a really, really big...

686
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:30,083
pretend to like your taste in music, let
you eat the last piece of cheesecake,

687
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,012
hold a radio over my head
outside your window,

688
00:36:33,326 --> 00:36:36,311
unfortunate way that makes
me hate you love you.

689
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,396
So pick me.

690
00:36:39,078 --> 00:36:40,213
Choose me.

691
00:36:41,128 --> 00:36:42,277
Love me.

692
00:36:47,645 --> 00:36:52,320
I'll be at Joe's tonight, so if
you do decide to sign the papers...

693
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:54,294
meet me there.

694
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:22,239
Good-bye, Ellis.

695
00:37:27,876 --> 00:37:30,598
I am gonna come see
you tomorrow. Okay?

696
00:37:32,704 --> 00:37:33,704
He doesn't love her.

697
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:36,376
He can't.

698
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,279
But he'll stay with her anyway.

699
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:40,247
She's his wife.

700
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:43,402
Mom?

701
00:37:46,962 --> 00:37:47,791
Mommy?

702
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:49,025
Meredith...

703
00:37:51,576 --> 00:37:52,460
you grew up.

704
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:53,704
I did.

705
00:37:54,443 --> 00:37:55,801
Hmm. It's a shame.

706
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,574
It's awful being a grown-up.

707
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:01,847
But the carousel
never stops turning.

708
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:04,849
You can't get off.

709
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,662
Okay.

710
00:38:24,811 --> 00:38:25,861
You think he'll show?

711
00:38:26,811 --> 00:38:27,713
He'll show.

712
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:35,861
Hey.

713
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:46,694
How's your patient?

714
00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:48,358
The one that got her soul back?

715
00:38:48,446 --> 00:38:49,446
She's gonna be fine.

716
00:38:50,864 --> 00:38:51,698
Gotta go.

717
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:52,568
Look at you.

718
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:53,886
You look like a girl.

719
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,485
Is that your date?

720
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,979
It's my husband.

721
00:38:57,081 --> 00:38:57,892
You're married?

722
00:38:57,989 --> 00:38:59,137
Ten years today.

723
00:39:01,095 --> 00:39:02,807
How come I didn't know
you were married.

724
00:39:02,837 --> 00:39:04,076
You never asked.

725
00:39:06,876 --> 00:39:09,576
You haven't signed those
divorce papers yet, have you?

726
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,803
Bailey...

727
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:14,119
tell me what to do.

728
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:19,493
God. Why does this
have to be so hard?

729
00:39:19,535 --> 00:39:20,365
It's not hard.

730
00:39:20,482 --> 00:39:22,534
It's painful,
but it's not hard.

731
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:25,968
Come on,
you know what to do already.

732
00:39:26,298 --> 00:39:28,989
If you didn't,
you wouldn't be in so much pain.

733
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:38,618
Pain--

734
00:39:39,315 --> 00:39:43,159
you just have to ride it out, 
hope it goes away on its own,

735
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:46,024
hope the wound 
that caused it heals.

736
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:47,429
So...

737
00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:48,622
here's where we are.

738
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:51,381
I work too much, I'm competitive,
I'm always right.

739
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:53,269
And I snore.

740
00:39:53,807 --> 00:39:54,722
What?

741
00:39:56,267 --> 00:39:57,649
I'm trying here.

742
00:39:58,706 --> 00:39:59,827
Oh. Oh.

743
00:40:00,418 --> 00:40:02,130
Oh! Oh.

744
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:03,749
Yeah.

745
00:40:04,966 --> 00:40:05,864
So?

746
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:09,320
Okay. We're a couple.

747
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:11,908
Whatever. Don't make
a big deal about it.

748
00:40:23,944 --> 00:40:28,328
There are no solutions,
no easy answers.

749
00:40:29,432 --> 00:40:30,965
You just breathe deep

750
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:33,500
- and wait for it to subside.
- Oh, man!

751
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:34,788
I can't!

752
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:42,713
He's not coming.

753
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:46,159
You don't think he's coming.

754
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:47,839
He might come.

755
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:51,865
Yeah. You never know.

756
00:40:52,094 --> 00:40:53,494
He's definitely coming.

757
00:40:54,766 --> 00:40:56,606
You want her doing
tequila shots all night?

758
00:40:56,636 --> 00:40:58,536
I'll be the one
cleaning up the vomit.

759
00:40:58,772 --> 00:41:00,536
Besides, I touched
a heart today...

760
00:41:00,994 --> 00:41:01,947
porny.

761
00:41:12,955 --> 00:41:16,143
Most of the time,
pain can be managed.

762
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:20,044
Pour me another one.

763
00:41:20,696 --> 00:41:24,418
But sometimes, the pain gets
you when you least expect it...

764
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:26,529
I'm tellin' you, in any second.

765
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:32,301
Hits way below the belt
and doesn't let up.

766
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:40,654
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

767
00:41:41,379 --> 00:41:42,469
Well...

768
00:41:45,028 --> 00:41:45,977
you found me.

769
00:41:46,082 --> 00:41:46,921
So...

770
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:49,306
you gonna sign those
divorce papers or not?

771
00:41:52,264 --> 00:41:53,229
Pain--

772
00:41:53,823 --> 00:41:57,543
you just have to fight
through because the truth is,

773
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:02,669
you can't outrun it and
life always makes more.
