1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:03,128
Last season on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,881
You have to go. I'm late.
Seriously. Good-bye...

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,593
- Derek.
- Yeah.

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,972
A month ago you were in med school being taught by doctors.

5
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:17,017
Today you are the doctors.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:21,104
You're interns, grunts, nobodies, bottom of the surgical food chain.

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,107
It's like candy, but with blood, which is so much better.

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,442
And Dr. Shepherd he's over there.

9
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,488
Who here feels like they have no idea what they're doing?

10
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,199
- Stop looking at me like that.
- Like what?

11
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,659
Like you've seen me naked.

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,245
I don't get picked for surgeries 'cause I slept with my boss,

13
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,455
and I didn't get into med school 'cause I have a famous mother.

14
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,874
I used to be a doctor, I think.

15
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,502
Fine, George and Izzie, you can move into the house.

16
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,213
So you blew me off for a bottle of tequila.

17
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,549
That's not nearly as much fun to wake up to.

18
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,135
You mind moving this tail wagon?

19
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,055
The next time I see you favoring Meredith Grey in any way,

20
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,267
I'll make sure she doesn't see the inside of an O.R. for a month.

21
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,601
You know, I'm your boss.

22
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:00,811
You don't scare me.

23
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,355
You should know that Richard promised chief to both of us.

24
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,232
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

25
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,233
Morning, Dr. Model.

26
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:07,818
Dr. Evil spawn.

27
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:08,819
You're not the enemy.

28
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,571
You're just the competition.

29
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,532
What is this that we're doing here?

30
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,158
You need a definition?

31
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,078
There are over options.

32
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,959
It's a tumor, and it's pressing against your optic nerve.

33
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,501
You've got syphilis.

34
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,461
I don't know how this happened.

35
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,796
You and Alex?

36
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,090
You gave me syphilis?!

37
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,093
You know, some people would call this a relationship.

38
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,678
- Who?
- Me.

39
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,847
Oh, my God.

40
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,265
You're falling for him.

41
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,726
What makes a hotshot doc leave the big apple for seattle?

42
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,062
- Hi, I'm Addison Shepherd.
- Shepherd?

43
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,982
And you must be the woman who's been screwing my husband.

44
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,822
To be a good surgeon, you have to think like a surgeon.

45
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,033
Emotions are messy.

46
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,703
Tuck them neatly away and step into a clean, sterile room,

47
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,413
where the procedure is simple...

48
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,833
cut, suture and close.

49
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,421
You look familiar.

50
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,297
You been in here before?

51
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,548
Once.

52
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,300
That worked out really well.

53
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,762
I know that look. Can only be one of two things.

54
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:20,224
Either your boss is giving you hell, or your boyfriend is.
Which is it?

55
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,308
Both.

56
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,603
But sometimes you're faced with a cut that won't heal...

57
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,274
My boyfriend is my boss, which was a problem.

58
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:33,737
But not as big a problem as the fact that my boyfriend has a wife.

59
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,155
Tell you what,

60
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,907
this one is on the house.

61
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,827
A cut that rips its stitches wide open.

62
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,372
Addison, what are you doing here?

63
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,540
Your hair's different.

64
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,499
- A lot of things are different.

65
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,377
- It's longer. I like it. It's very Russell Crowe.

66
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,003
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

67
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,255
You just pick up and leave everything

68
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,549
your house, your practice, your friends?

69
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,592
- You had a life in Manhattan.
- Had.

70
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,096
And now you have a girlfriend in Seattle.

71
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,014
She seems... sweet.

72
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,100
The ice you're on... thin.

73
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,518
She's young.

74
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,646
That whole wide-eyed, "ooh,
he's a brain surgeon" thing happening,

75
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,982
but still sweet, which is what you were going for, right?

76
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,066
The anti-Addison?

77
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,569
If you came out here to try to win me back, you can forget about it.

78
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,655
I did. I flew all the way across the country to reminisce over

79
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,490
wedding photos, get drunk, fall into bed,

80
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,909
make you realize you can't live without me.

81
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,745
Relax, Derek.

82
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,621
I'm here for work.

83
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,791
I'm helming the T.T.T.S. case you guys admitted last week.

84
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,128
- And from Richard's briefing, I should be...
- Richard knew you were coming out here?

85
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,171
He asked me to come.

86
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,547
- Didn't he tell you?
- No, he didn't.

87
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:34,965
Hmm. Well, surprise.

88
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,010
The hair, though...

89
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,679
you know I've always had a thing for Russell Crowe.

90
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,019
Let me see it.

91
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,064
No lacerations, normal swelling.

92
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,774
George really knocked you around.

93
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,775
The guy's a lightweight.

94
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,444
I coulda pinned him in a second if I wanted.

95
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,570
Yeah, so why didn't you?

96
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,613
Are you kidding?

97
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,865
I'm riding a career in plastics all the way to the bank.

98
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,992
I can't afford to injure these babies.

99
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,245
Especially over someone like O'Malley.

100
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,121
You had it coming.

101
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,956
The dude punches like my sister.

102
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,752
Oh, so by your definition, then, you got beat up by a girl?

103
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,340
All hail the champ!

104
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,052
So my guy Alex finally got what was comin' to him?

105
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,012
George knocked him down in one punch.

106
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:22,804
You shoulda seen it.

107
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:23,931
I don't wanna talk about it.

108
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,016
Brag, champ, brag. You've earned it.

109
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,351
Can I have a beer?

110
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,563
Let's play a game of whose life sucks the most.

111
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,148
I'll win.

112
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,817
- I always win.
- Well, you don't wanna play with me.

113
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,152
Oh, I do.

114
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,987
I'll even go first.

115
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,406
Derek's married.

116
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,703
George, beer is dripping from your nostrils.

117
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,915
Told you I'd win.

118
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,543
No, you don't win.

119
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,128
Did you hear me?

120
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,089
I said Derek is married.

121
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,260
As in pigheaded, adulterous, liar married.

122
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,387
Nothing you could say could top that.

123
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,888
I'm pregnant.

124
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:07,599
I win.

125
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:09,810
Joe, you all right?

126
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,064
Okay, maybe Joe wins.

127
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,285
Joe, lie down.

128
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,203
You called the gurney patrol?

129
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,538
Sit back and relax.

130
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,582
We have to take you to the hospital to run some tests.

131
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,292
Tests? No. I don't need any tests. I'm fine.

132
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,294
Dude, you collapsed on the floor.

133
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,421
This is your bar. You know how filthy this floor is.

134
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,590
- Radial pulse is strong.
- Minor skull contusion.

135
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,592
- You're sleeping with someone?
- What? Who?

136
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,136
Why is that such a shock?
Even george managed to get some action.

137
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,596
Correction. George got some syphilis.

138
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,639
How could I not know you were sleeping with someone?

139
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,559
Forget this. The hospital is right across the street.

140
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,353
I can sure as hell walk across the street by myself.

141
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,981
- Oh, I think we should...
- No, I got it. Joe!

142
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,654
All right, details.

143
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:03,739
You're pregnant?

144
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,948
What are you gonna do?

145
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,285
You know what happens with pregnant interns.

146
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:12,956
I'm not switching to the vagina squad or spending my life popping zits.

147
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:13,957
I'm too talented.

148
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,375
Surgery's my life.

149
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,462
- Which begs the question, who are you sleeping with?
- Just a guy.

150
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,588
That's all I get?

151
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,634
You can't just bring something like this up and expect me to drop it.

152
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,635
Watch me.

153
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,013
Why are you back here tonight?

154
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,516
- Don't you have a date with McDreamy?
- More like McMarried.

155
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,475
Mcwhat?

156
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,185
I came to check on Joe.

157
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,478
Do you think he's gonna be okay?

158
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,063
You think he's gonna need an operation?

159
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,314
Operation... yes.

160
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,899
Okay... hard to tell.

161
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,693
The basilar artery is blown up like a balloon, subarachnoid bleeding

162
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,487
and an aneurysm the size of a golf ball.

163
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,614
No way to clip something like that.

164
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,032
Not without magic fingers.

165
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,283
Or a standstill operation.

166
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,913
You're doing the standstill opera...
he's doing the standstill operation.

167
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,789
I'd like to try.

168
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:58,627
But first I need some additional patient history,
overnight labs and a cerebral angio.

169
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,629
I'm drunk.

170
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:01,505
Meredith...

171
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,220
McBastard.

172
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,355
What are you doing?

173
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:23,610
Uh, I am on her side,
but we're talking a possible standstill here.

174
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:24,653
Recognize.

175
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,116
Meredith.

176
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,450
- Go away.
- Just wait.

177
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,035
We should discuss this.

178
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:32,786
Here's a thought.

179
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,621
No. Quit following me.

180
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,206
At least let me explain.

181
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,126
Explain? You know when you should've explained?

182
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,129
The night we met in the bar, before any of the rest of it.

183
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,381
Yeah, that would've been a good time to discuss this.

184
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,591
Look, I know how you feel.

185
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:46,884
Do you?

186
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,135
Somehow I doubt that.

187
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:53,140
Because if you did, you would shut up
and you would turn around and go back inside,

188
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,977
because you would realize that
I am this close to getting in my car

189
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,104
and running you down in the parking lot!

190
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,192
Give me the keys.

191
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,152
- I'm fine.
- Meredith, give me the keys.

192
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,446
Let's go, okay?

193
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,453
And the husband was the worst.

194
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:29,259
Well, I will be back in the morning to report for duty.

195
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,222
And you...get some rest.

196
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,187
What is she doing here?

197
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,941
You and I both know she's the best in the field.

198
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,070
Bringing Addie out was a business decision, nothing personal.

199
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,322
Oh, well. What a relief.

200
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,532
It's not personal.

201
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,450
It is personal to me.

202
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,452
The workings of my surgical unit

203
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,995
- don't have anything...
- Don't include my wife!

204
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,414
Don't include your private life.

205
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,715
Burke will act as chief of surgery until I'm back on my feet.

206
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,967
You gave chief to Burke?

207
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,845
Like I said, there's no room for personal in being chief.

208
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:13,971
What is that supposed to mean?

209
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,764
How long have you been sleeping with an intern?

210
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,522
So I guess part of being chief is personal.

211
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,275
Close the door on your way out.

212
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,625
Allis.

213
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,130
Babcock.

214
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,676
Right angle clamp.

215
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,763
I'm gonna sterilize everything when I'm done.

216
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,432
The scrub nurses won't even know I was here.

217
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,517
My lips are sealed.

218
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,942
So, um, I have a question to ask.

219
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,698
I checked the schedule, and I noticed
that you and I are both off tonight.

220
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,158
I made reservations.

221
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,744
I have a favorite restaurant.

222
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,748
None of those were questions.

223
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,212
Would you like to go out to dinner with me tonight?

224
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:39,348
You know, the O.R. is the one place where I can come and think...

225
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,810
and I was thinking right now, okay?

226
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,355
Of course.

227
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:50,526
I get it.

228
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,824
I'm not a violent person.

229
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,786
I'm a pacifist, but, you know, he just

230
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,330
he kept pushing and push

231
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,249
he pushed me, and I pushed back.

232
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,252
I was pushed, you know, and now he

233
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,004
You know what? Alex tries to lay a hand on you, just tell me.

234
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:11,839
I'll take care of it.

235
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,259
I don't need you to...

236
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,510
to take care of it.

237
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,720
If Alex starts something, I-I'll handle it myself.

238
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,639
I can handle it.

239
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,350
Okay, people, assignments.

240
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,852
Yang, you're on discharges.

241
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,562
O'Malley, report to room E19.

242
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:30,440
Grey, come see me, and who was on call last night?

243
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,651
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.

244
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:36,029
- Redo these and return them to me before lunch, understood?
- Understood.

245
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,531
Karev, don't tempt me.

246
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,533
Somebody's popular.

247
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:40,868
Meaning?

248
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,120
There's been a special request just for you.

249
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,539
The chief runs through all of this?

250
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,373
Before lunch.

251
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,085
After, you've got calls to return, a budget to approve,

252
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:54,464
two staff meetings, and four of Richard's surgeries, including your own.

253
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,133
Absolutely. No problem.

254
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,676
Virgins...

255
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,470
So congratulations are in order.

256
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,681
Don't sweat it, Shepherd.
I'll only be your boss for a few days.

257
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,474
I'm well aware of Richard's recovery time.

258
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,310
I'm the one who operated on him, remember?

259
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,144
I do.

260
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:10,439
You operated, he survived and chose me
to take over while recruiting your wife.

261
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:11,899
Clearly, he has brain damage.

262
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,483
Or is it your ex-wife?

263
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,735
I'm a little fuzzy on that.

264
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,111
Ahh, we're separated.

265
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,572
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Burke.

266
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,365
- You're never interrupting.
- She's always interrupting.

267
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,533
I was just checking to see

268
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,620
- if Dr. Burke secured the in...
- Intern you requested.

269
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,079
He did.

270
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,514
Define T.T.T.S.

271
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:46,308
Twin-twin transfusion syndrome, conjoined fetal twins.

272
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,309
Connected by?

273
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,394
Blood vessels in the placenta.

274
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,312
Meaning?

275
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:55,776
One twin gets too much blood, the other too little,
endangering the lives of both.

276
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,069
I'd expect you to know that, Grey.

277
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:59,363
You told me there wasn't much chance that anything could be done, but...

278
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:03,951
T.T.T.S. is usually impossible to correct,
unless you happen to be one of the handful of surgeons

279
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:09,164
in the world who knows how to separate
fetal blood vessels, which, luckily for you, I am.

280
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,458
So we're gonna get you into surgery tomorrow.

281
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,670
If you have any questions at all, please ask Dr. Grey.

282
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:20,384
From what I have seen,
she is one of the hospital's most popular interns.

283
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,011
I could've answered your question had you given me the chance.

284
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:23,887
Chin up, Grey.

285
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,682
I'm this tough on everyone,
not just the women my husband sleeps with.

286
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,392
Order an ultrasound...

287
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,188
Hi. Can I have the chart for E19, please?

288
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:34,314
Thank you.

289
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,948
Oh, good. You're here.

290
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,700
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

291
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,330
- O'Malley?
- Yeah.

292
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,416
- You're touching me.
- Well, yeah.

293
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,584
No.

294
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,210
Carmen...

295
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,675
I want you to listen to me very carefully.

296
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,553
As long as I'm in here, I don't know what's

297
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:09,183
happening out there with my doctors, my patients, my hospital.

298
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:12,311
You are my eyes today, my ears.

299
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,563
I want you to be a sponge.

300
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:15,689
A sponge?

301
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:19,193
You report any and everything happening in this hospital to me.

302
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,069
I'm an investigative sponge.

303
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,446
I'm not foolin' around, O'Malley.

304
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,781
There's too much been happenin' lately under my radar.

305
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,784
It stops today.

306
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,179
Uh, Burke, you gave Grey to Addison?

307
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,972
Are you sure about that?

308
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,474
That's not your call, Shepherd.

309
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,184
And for the record, I'm always sure.

310
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:55,812
Did you need me for something?

311
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,689
- Because as the new chief, I'm...
- Interim chief.

312
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,982
Chief nonetheless.

313
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:00,901
Ever attempt a standstill surgery?

314
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,696
It's the location of the aneurysm that makes it tricky.

315
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,157
Your body temperature will be lowered cool enough

316
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,159
to protect you from any damage and stop the heart.

317
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,120
Which stops the blood flow to the brain,
which reduces the risk of rupture.

318
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:14,498
I'll have 45 minutes to clip the aneurysm

319
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,208
before I step in and get the heart started again.

320
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:20,254
You wanna freeze my body, drain my blood and stop my heart?

321
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,129
And bring you back.

322
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,214
In under 45 minutes.

323
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,174
If you go over, is it free?

324
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:24,883
No.

325
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:29,012
Dr. Yang, you can go and handle the pre-op labs.

326
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:31,932
How much?

327
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,060
How much does something like this cost?

328
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,812
I don't think you should worry about that right now.

329
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:40,941
Hey, look, you guys say that you can kill me and bring me back.

330
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,401
I believe you. You're doctors.

331
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,485
But I own a bar.

332
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:47,072
I don't got any insurance,
so I'm not that concerned about the surgery

333
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,825
so much as what I'm gonna do when I survive it.

334
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:50,951
I need a number.

335
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,453
10 grand? 20?

336
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:56,623
30?

337
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,125
It's a couple hundred at least.

338
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,543
At least.

339
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,424
Who's Halloran?

340
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,968
Patient in 4115.

341
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,137
Red hair?

342
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,471
Wife knits all the time?

343
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,182
He had the colectomy?

344
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,516
Oh, colon dude, that's right.

345
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,059
Who's Monterosso?

346
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,604
4238. The mom with the really cute kids.

347
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,564
She spiked a post-op fever last night.

348
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,983
- You spent two hours monitoring her.
- Hernia chick, that's right.

349
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,152
You have been treating these people for the last week.

350
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,403
How can you not know their names?

351
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:29,781
Surgery's the only specialty where
we don't waste time getting to know the patients.

352
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,075
- They're slabs of meat, and we're butchers.
- They're human beings.

353
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,452
You do know what a human being is,

354
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,037
- don't you, evil spawn?
- I'm not evil.

355
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,455
Unless evil turns you on.

356
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:42,878
Do you ever wake up in the morning
and realize nobody likes you and, I don't know, care?

357
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:43,795
Oh.

358
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,423
I think somebody likes me.

359
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:53,931
Hey.

360
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,184
What, you don't speak now that you're chief? Hey, Burke!

361
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,477
What do you want?

362
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,354
What?

363
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,313
What do you want?

364
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,856
You don't want to go out to dinner.

365
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:06,068
You don't want to meet me in the on call room,
and you sure as hell don't want to talk to me.

366
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:09,863
I could pretend I know, but, hey,
I don't even have your home phone number.

367
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,907
So tell me, what do you want?!

368
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:13,534
Don't yell at me.

369
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,329
- Hey, we're having a conversation here.
- Well, what do you want?

370
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,413
I don't know!

371
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,547
Figure it out.

372
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,526
What's the report?

373
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,236
No report.

374
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,113
It's very quiet today, sir.

375
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:54,032
There's no news, gossip, surgeries I should know about?

376
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,409
Come on, what's the buzz, O'Malley?

377
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:59,329
You know, not in the halls or not in the O.R., not in the stairwells.

378
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:03,000
Especially, you know, nothing happening in the...

379
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,210
they're just stairwells.

380
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:16,096
They told me you were in a nightgown,
but I thought I'd come and see it for myself.

381
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,097
Very nice. Huh?

382
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,600
Heard O'Malley laid you out cold. Nice eye.

383
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,186
Whoa, who sent that?

384
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,145
We all pitched in.

385
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,146
The whole floor.

386
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:27,274
Well, please tell the whole floor a big thank you.

387
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,275
Yeah, I will.

388
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,278
Alex, you gotta get me out of here, man.

389
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,197
Get me transferred to County Hospital or something.

390
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,615
Oh, you don't want to go to County.

391
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,283
I mean, here they know how to kill you and bring you back.

392
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,619
But at county, they just know how to kill you. No joke.

393
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,329
I can't afford this place, man.

394
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,538
I'm gonna lose the bar.

395
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:42,581
Hey, Joe, how you doing?

396
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:43,790
Hey, Scooter.

397
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,252
Okay. That's mine.

398
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,629
Well, first things first.

399
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,214
We're gonna start by trying to save your life, man.

400
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,381
The bar is my life.

401
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:54,551
You know that. You've been at last call with me
practically every night since you moved here.

402
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:58,013
I'm gonna have to shut it down or sell it.

403
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,723
You can't do that.

404
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,225
The place is an institution.

405
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,560
You know, I've owned the bar across the street for 14 years,

406
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,896
and I have never been inside this hospital till now.

407
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,314
Look, I'll pay my tab, right?

408
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,315
Gotta be good for something.

409
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,191
How much is it?

410
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,651
Close to a grand.

411
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:15,739
Um, how about I pay, like, 60...

412
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:17,741
That's good.

413
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,243
And I'll pay you back later.

414
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,161
Hey, champ!

415
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,798
What does it take to go after another woman's husband?

416
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:34,758
Excuse me?

417
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:35,592
Happened to me.

418
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:40,556
Jeff moved in with the long-legged miniskirt
who answers his phones three weeks into my pregnancy.

419
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,057
By the way, that gel is really cold.

420
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,935
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about your husband.

421
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,855
Are you sorry about Dr. Montgomery Shepherd's husband?

422
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:52,359
I'm going to be checking a few things today.

423
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,611
I bet she asked to work with you.

424
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,071
It's what I would have done.

425
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,615
I'm gonna go check on your labs.

426
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,594
Hey, sunshine.

427
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,222
Deep breath.

428
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,604
Morning sickness must suck.

429
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:31,481
Just so we're clear

430
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:35,194
do not breathe a word of what you heard last night to anyone

431
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:39,031
not about me, not about Meredith,
not about Meredith and Dr. McDreamy.

432
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,324
Hey, Dr. Burke.

433
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,241
Joe.

434
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,996
Um, vital signs stable overnight.

435
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,748
Today's C.T. shows no rebleeding.

436
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:49,291
The E.K.G...

437
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,252
shows...

438
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,506
normal sinus rhythm.

439
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,385
No ischemia, no disrhythmias.

440
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:03,305
Looking good.

441
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:04,848
Page me if there are any changes.

442
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,145
Oh, hi, chief.

443
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,606
No, not much going on

444
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:16,652
well, other than your interim chief making out with my friend in the stairwell.

445
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,987
But, hey, sponge duty sucks.

446
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:20,864
Talking to yourself now?

447
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:21,949
Yes. No!

448
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:27,246
Damn it. I'm a bad sponge, a leaky sponge.

449
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:30,332
I'm gonna leak all the wrong secrets, 'cause I'm a bad liar.

450
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,960
I can't even lie about talking to myself.

451
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,380
You look nice today.

452
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,591
Wore my new lip gloss.

453
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:46,765
'Cause my ex-boyfriend's wife looks like
Isabella freakin' Rossellini, and I'm like... me.

454
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:50,978
I'm trying to outdo her when she's the victim here.

455
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,938
How crazy is that?

456
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,107
Not crazy. Smart.

457
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:58,110
You know, gloss, you know, prevents chapped lips...

458
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:01,530
and... ex-boyfriend?

459
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,241
I'm an evil mistress.

460
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,327
Well, still, you look nice.

461
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,413
Thanks.

462
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,331
What are you doing here?

463
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:16,461
- Well...
- come on, O'Malley. Out with it.

464
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:22,718
Okay. Can you think of any reason, any reason at all,
really, why Cristina would be kissing Burke?

465
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,610
After all this time, all your warnings about me sleeping with my boss,

466
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,778
- and you're doing the same exact thing?
- It's not the same.

467
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,865
- It's exactly the same!
- You and McDreamy are in a relationship.

468
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:47,951
And you and Burke are in... Switzerland.

469
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,870
It's very neutral there. They make very nice watches.

470
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:52,664
Have you even bothered to tell Burke about the baby?

471
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,083
Are you going to?

472
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,544
Look, Meredith, can we not go there?

473
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,880
Can everyone just accept the fact that there are some things

474
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,341
that I like to keep to myself,
and I don't discuss everything to death?

475
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:07,012
Well, why even confide in me at all
if you're so intent on not discussing it?

476
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,139
Why even tell me?

477
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:21,151
When I found out about the miniskirt,
I called her up and took her to lunch.

478
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:23,862
It was perfectly civil.

479
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,657
I said I didn't hold it against her,
that these things happen.

480
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:32,996
But really, I just wanted to put a face on the bitch
that got my husband to throw away 15 years of marriage.

481
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:46,510
Got a second?

482
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:49,012
Depends on what you need.

483
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:51,056
Who the hell is dr. Mcdreamy?

484
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:59,106
Me. I'm Dr. Mcdreamy.

485
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:01,525
I'm tall and handsome.

486
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:05,779
I like to lean against things,
ponder the difficulties of dating beautiful women.

487
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,197
I'm trying to be a surgeon here.

488
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:12,035
- That took a lot of nerve, requesting Meredith.
- Oh, come on. She came highly recommended.

489
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,412
- Right.
- So you don't recommend her?

490
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:15,414
- No, I did not say that.
- Just not for her medical skills.

491
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:16,331
Oh, would you shut up?

492
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,332
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Yes.

493
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:20,878
Labs confirm what look like abnormalities on the ultrasound.

494
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:22,796
I think you should come and see for yourself.

495
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:24,298
Fine. Let's go.

496
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:26,800
- Meredith. Meredith.
- Don't.

497
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,606
Well, no report.

498
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:43,358
Yeah. Same nothing as earlier, chief.

499
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:44,985
I should go.

500
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,529
Oh, actually, there is something, sir.

501
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,199
Burke and Shepherd marking territory on the playground?

502
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,033
No, sir.

503
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,746
It's about Joe the bartender, their standstill patient.

504
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:58,373
See?

505
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:02,002
Bilateral pleural effusion with evidence of sub-q edema.

506
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:04,171
In english, please?

507
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:08,133
We've detected what looks like beginning heart failure in the twins.

508
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,134
Don't be alarmed.

509
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,220
Are my babies gonna be okay?

510
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,057
I'm gonna go ahead and take you into surgery now.
We're not gonna wait. Book the O.R. Move!

511
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:19,228
Tell Pete to wash out the taps every night,

512
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:20,812
not every other night, every night.

513
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:25,067
And remind him that the delivery truck
comes at 6 A.M. Kegs go in the back.

514
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:26,610
Oh, another thing,

515
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,155
there's petty cash on the top shelf of the storage closet.

516
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,451
We operate on our patients. That's it.

517
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:36,245
- I know, but...
- I sympathize. I do.

518
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,539
But solving Joe's finances is not my job.

519
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:42,751
It's not your job, and it's sure as hell not the job I assigned you today.

520
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:46,672
Just seems wrong to cut him open,
sew him up and just leave him, you know, left with nothing.

521
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:49,758
If we can save his life, we'll hardly be leaving him with nothing.

522
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:59,101
That's as far as I can go for now.

523
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:00,561
Let's start cooling him.

524
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:19,621
Can't see much from back here, O'Malley.

525
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:22,708
I know. I'm trying to find a loophole to help Joe.

526
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:25,210
You know Joe?

527
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,131
Oh, yeah. I was the only female intern my year.

528
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,551
I didn't know anybody, and nobody knew me except Joe.

529
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,886
He knew me.

530
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,931
So you and Joe...

531
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:41,643
All you people ever think about is how to get into somebody's pants.

532
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:42,769
You're nasty.

533
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,313
That's why you got syphilis.

534
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:49,151
Joe was the first person here to tell me I'd make
a good surgeon, not that he knew anything about it.

535
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,070
But it was something when I had nothing.

536
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,951
Oh, sure. I'm the guy with the heart of stone, and you brought snacks.

537
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,828
It's a working lunch.

538
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,163
Snacks to watch Joe die.

539
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:02,998
He's not gonna die-die. They'll bring him back.

540
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:05,584
He is going to die-die. No pulse-pulse.

541
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,044
He's gonna be dead-dead.

542
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:11,798
It's a granola bar, Alex, not a bag of
supersize popcorn and a box of chocolate movie mints.

543
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:12,591
That's it.

544
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:15,719
Dead.

545
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,555
Excuse me. Sorry.

546
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,684
Julie we're just going  to go in laparoscopically.

547
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,436
You're not going to feel anything.

548
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:25,938
Neither are the twins.

549
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,481
Okay, let's get going.

550
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:29,775
Thin blade.

551
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,278
Begin with a 3-millimeter incision.

552
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,247
Stop the blood flow?

553
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:47,584
To protect the brain, operate in a
bloodless field so the aneurysm won't rupture.

554
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:49,044
And cool the body?

555
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,379
To induce hypothermia.

556
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,048
Keeps the tissue viable until the blood is restored.

557
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:55,717
Body temp is at 60 degrees.

558
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:58,512
Okay, Joe. Time to die.

559
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:15,904
Flatline.

560
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,157
All right.

561
00:28:18,157 --> 00:28:20,200
- We've got 45 minutes, people.
- Start the clock.

562
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:33,964
So what's your Joe story?

563
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:35,966
Seems like everybody around here has one.

564
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,676
You first.

565
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:41,597
Okay. I went to Joe's place the night before I started working here.

566
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,974
I'd only been in town, you know, a few days.

567
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:47,227
I met this woman. I got drunk, and she took advantage of me.

568
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:49,104
Or she got drunk, and I took advantage of her.

569
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:50,689
I got drunk and she took no.

570
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:52,065
We were drunk, definitely.

571
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,609
Somebody took advantage.

572
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:56,612
Either way, I like to look at it as my initiation to Seattle.

573
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:57,613
What about you?

574
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,364
Oh, well, I don't have one.

575
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,241
I just wanted to hear yours.

576
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:11,793
So technically the paperwork just needs to be submitted

577
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,630
by midnight of the day of the surgery to be considered?

578
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,006
Oh, good.

579
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:17,341
Thank you very much.

580
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:18,592
Thanks.

581
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:23,096
How you doing there, Grey?

582
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:24,806
Good.

583
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:26,391
I'm good.

584
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:35,776
- You know, I'm very sweet once you get to know me.
- No, you're not.

585
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:38,779
- We could be good friends.
- Alex, never. Ever.

586
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:41,156
- Ever.
- Why not?

587
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:43,116
You give me one reason why we could.

588
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:45,327
What about you is even remotely human?

589
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,288
It's going too slowly.

590
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:50,582
I hope Joe can pull through this.

591
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:51,959
He can. He will.

592
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:53,335
He has to.

593
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,379
Ah, damn it.

594
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,756
I can't get the clamp to hold.

595
00:29:58,257 --> 00:30:00,843
Give me--all right, we're just gonna go in at a different angle.

596
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:03,387
Time remaining?

597
00:30:04,221 --> 00:30:06,223
- Irrigation, please. Irrigation.
- 17 minutes.

598
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:09,351
Shepherd, I'm gonna need 8 minutes to get him back, to warm him up.

599
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:12,104
Time to make the next 17 minutes count.

600
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:14,898
- Go in through there.
- You see it?

601
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:25,117
He's dead, technically, which is science, and this is a huge thing.

602
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,370
So I thought some research
foundation has gotta have an interest in that.

603
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,831
So in essence, you wanna donate Joe's body to science?

604
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,750
At least for the next 17 minutes.

605
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,461
- A privately funded grant.
- For educational purposes.

606
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:37,880
We're a teaching hospital.

607
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,590
The standstill surgery qualifies.

608
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:42,885
I didn't peg you for the type to ignore my instructions, O'Malley.

609
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:44,636
With all due respect, sir, it's worth a shot.

610
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:46,180
It's someone's life.

611
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,764
It's always someone's life, O'Malley.

612
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:56,690
You're hovering.

613
00:30:58,275 --> 00:30:59,318
You can leave now.

614
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:06,992
Eight minutes.

615
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:10,078
We need to start rewarming, Shepherd.

616
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:11,872
Take the bipolars, please. Thank you.

617
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:15,375
- Shepherd, we need to start warming him up now.
- Hang on.

618
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:18,295
- Now, I need him now, Shepherd.
- I can't seem to get it.

619
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:23,884
Ah, there it is.

620
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,303
Got it.

621
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,013
That's it.

622
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:29,014
Are you sure?

623
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,224
I'm always sure.

624
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:32,059
All right. Good work, everybody.

625
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:33,936
It's all yours there, chief.

626
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,981
Okay, people, let's grab Joe before he decides to go into the light.

627
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,149
Start warming him up.

628
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:41,693
Clamps are coming off.

629
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:43,821
Turn the pump on.

630
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,993
Watch cerebral perfusion pressures.

631
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:52,120
Keep M.A.P.
Greater than 60, please.

632
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,630
I know you're enjoying yourself, Preston.

633
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,340
It's a power kick to be the chief.

634
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,760
You're never more surrounded, never more alone.

635
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:10,514
You're everyone's father, everyone's boss and old friend.

636
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:14,476
The choices we make -- clean slices, neat stitches,

637
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:17,688
no emotions, no compromise, no personal life.

638
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:18,772
Richard--

639
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,440
I just had brain surgery.

640
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:24,570
I'm surrounded by fruit baskets.

641
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:28,365
The only people who've been in this room come to kiss my ass.

642
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:32,578
I gave you a shot for a reason, Preston.

643
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,621
You and I...

644
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:37,583
We're the same.

645
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:43,005
We put the job first.

646
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:56,143
That was the single most amazing surgery I have ever witnessed.

647
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:58,687
You--you killed a man and brought him back to life.

648
00:32:58,812 --> 00:32:59,938
You, like, raised the dead.

649
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:02,733
God, how does that feel? Are you rushing? Is it...

650
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:04,359
like you wouldn't believe.

651
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,698
Hey, um, do you still have those reservations? 'Cause I'm starving.

652
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:10,616
Cristina...

653
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,868
I think there's something we should discuss.

654
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:19,208
Yeah. Yeah, there is.

655
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:23,378
It's pretty clear.

656
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:25,964
It is?

657
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,258
We've been fooling ourselves,

658
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:31,887
to think that we can continue like this without consequences.

659
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,347
Consequences?

660
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:36,975
We have careers to think about, reputations.

661
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:38,894
We both put the job first.

662
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,523
And you are very focused. I respect that.

663
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:44,608
Thank you.

664
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:45,400
You're welcome.

665
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:52,199
Oh, you're ending this.

666
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,536
I think it's best to make a clean break.

667
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:57,871
Okay.

668
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,456
Before it gets too involved.

669
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:02,709
- Before it gets...
- Messy. Right, right.

670
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,044
That would be... that would be bad.

671
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,967
It's nothing personal.

672
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:45,544
Get in here, O'Malley.

673
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,222
Okay, I tried. I really tried.

674
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,349
But there's a lot of stuff happening out there,

675
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,477
stuff I can't tell you, stuff I won't tell you.

676
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,107
It's just crazy stuff

677
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:09,443
stuff I'm gonna have nightmares about.

678
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:14,990
But I'm not gonna tell you about any of it 'cause it doesn't matter.

679
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:17,951
Not when there's a guy out there who we all know and love

680
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:21,205
who's gonna be bankrupt because he needed a surgery to save his life.

681
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,373
- And I spent the whole day working on it.
- O'Malley!

682
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:24,458
Let me finish.

683
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:28,003
You're wrong, sir.

684
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:32,633
Now you can fire me, you know, 
or just bring me up on disciplinary action, or whatever.

685
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,595
- But I'm telling you, Joe deserves our...
- Deserves our help.

686
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,348
Couldn't help yourself, could you?

687
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:43,018
Whether or not it'd win you any points, even from me.

688
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,562
I signed your request.

689
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:47,981
Give it to Patricia. She'll know what to do with it.

690
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,943
- Looks like Joe might keep his bar after all.
- Thank you, sir.

691
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:52,486
- O'Malley.
- Yes.

692
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:56,448
Yell at me again, and I'll snap you like a twig.

693
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:57,449
Yes, sir.

694
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:03,747
See? Just a small scar.

695
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:05,999
And my babies?

696
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,586
Your babies are doing very well.

697
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:16,301
And Dr. Grey will be back to check on you a little bit later.

698
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:18,637
Actually, I'd prefer it if Dr. Grey were taken off the case.

699
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:20,764
Why? Is there a problem?

700
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:22,766
Just reminds me of someone I don't like very much

701
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:26,270
someone my husband likes a lot, particularly in lingerie.

702
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:27,896
You understand.

703
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:30,607
No, no, I don't understand.

704
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:32,734
Well, she's sleeping with your husband, right?

705
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:36,530
Ms. Phillips...

706
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:42,786
I lack Dr. Grey's class and patience, so let me set the record straight.

707
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:45,289
My husband didn't cheat on me. I cheated on him.

708
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:46,874
So the wronged woman here

709
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:47,958
Dr. Grey.

710
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:51,920
So I think you owe her one hell of an apology.

711
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:09,146
One night I park my car and unlock my front door 
to go inside my house, and something's different.

712
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:14,026
Nothing's different, everything's the same, but yet still...

713
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:16,904
something's different.

714
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:20,532
And I stand there for awhile...

715
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:25,496
and then I know.

716
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:32,836
See, there are moments for me, usually when I'm in the O.R.,

717
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:36,632
when I just know what's gonna happen next.

718
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:45,641
So I go upstairs.

719
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:50,437
As I'm walking down the hall, I'm trying to prepare myself.

720
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:53,106
I step on a man's jacket that doesn't belong to me.

721
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:56,777
And everything I think I know...

722
00:37:58,779 --> 00:37:59,988
just shifts.

723
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:04,993
Because the jacket that doesn't belong to me is a jacket that I recognize.

724
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:12,251
And what I know now is that when I go into my bedroom, 
I'm not just gonna see that my wife is cheating on me.

725
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:17,047
I'm gonna see that my wife is cheating on me with Mark, 
who happened to be my best friend.

726
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:25,931
It's just so pedestrian and common and dirty and cruel.

727
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:29,852
Mostly just cruel.

728
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,939
I left. I came out here.

729
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,360
- And you met me.
- And I met you.

730
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:50,122
Well, what was I to you?

731
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,792
The girl you screwed to get over being screwed?

732
00:38:57,212 --> 00:38:59,131
You were like coming up for fresh air.

733
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,384
It's like I was drowning, and you saved me.

734
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,222
That's all I know.

735
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:18,150
That's not enough.

736
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:26,325
They say "practice makes perfect."

737
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:43,342
Theory is, the more you think 
like a surgeon, the more you become one...

738
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:50,015
the better you get at remaining neutral, clinical

739
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:53,560
cut, suture, close...

740
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,071
and the harder it becomes to learn to turn it off...

741
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:08,992
I thought I might see your ugly mug in here tonight.

742
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:12,704
Did you hear the good news?

743
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:14,581
To stop thinking like a surgeon...

744
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,668
O'Malley!

745
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:31,515
I heard what you did, champ.

746
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:37,729
And remember what it means to think like a human being.

747
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,089
The clinic has a policy.

748
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:10,429
They wouldn't let me confirm my appointment 
unless I designated an emergency contact person

749
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:13,849
someone to be there just in case and...

750
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:17,644
to help me home, you know, after.

751
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:26,153
Anyway, I put your name down.

752
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:29,781
That's why I told you I'm pregnant.

753
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:31,575
- You're my person.
- I am?

754
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,828
Yeah, you are.

755
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:37,873
Whatever.

756
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:39,958
Whatever.

757
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:45,589
He dumped me.

758
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:00,312
You realize this constitutes hugging?

759
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:02,105
Shut up.

760
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:04,441
I'm your person.
