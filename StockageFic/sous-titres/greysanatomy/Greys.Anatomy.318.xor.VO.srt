1
00:00:00,532 --> 00:00:02,413
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:03,324 --> 00:00:04,610
I'm getting married to Burke.

3
00:00:05,765 --> 00:00:08,685
I went to the board this morning
and told them I was retiring.

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,170
One of us could be chief.

5
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:12,457
We were here long before
you two started fooling around.

6
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:13,286
He is my husband.

7
00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:14,761
Stop saying that like
it means something.

8
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:16,272
Jane Doe, about six months pregnant.

9
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:17,502
Found under a pile of rubble.

10
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,188
She can't remember anything
from before the accident.

11
00:00:20,197 --> 00:00:22,817
Go 60 days with no sex,
no other women.

12
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:24,568
My mother's dead, isn't she?

13
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:27,604
Why didn't you stay and fight for us?

14
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:29,181
I-I tried.

15
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:32,439
Alex, I'm sorry. I can't.

16
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:43,900
<i>People have scars in all sorts
of unexpected places,</i>

17
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:47,159
<i>like secret road maps
of their personal histories,</i>

18
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,295
<i>diagrams of all their old wounds.</i>

19
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:53,086
Alex! God.

20
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:55,875
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Seen it all before.

21
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:57,753
What the hell are you doing here?

22
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:59,415
- Moving in.
- What?

23
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:03,563
<i>Most of our old wounds heal,
leaving nothing behind, but a scar.</i>

24
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:04,935
<i>But some of them don't.</i>

25
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:06,306
Alex is moving in?

26
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,620
To this house?

27
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:09,893
- He's taking George's room.
- Why?

28
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:11,358
I was asleep just a minute ago.

29
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:13,844
And I was naked in the bathroom
when Alex walked in.

30
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:15,766
Lucky I didn't come out
of the shower to find him peeing

31
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:17,341
- all over the seat.
- And we're up.

32
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:19,373
What's wrong with
where he was living before?

33
00:01:19,374 --> 00:01:21,028
I don't know where
he was living before.

34
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:22,157
Probably a whorehouse.

35
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:25,175
I can't have him living in the room
right next door. It's weird.

36
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,725
People are what matters.

37
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:29,570
Alex is one of our people.
We can't leave him out in the cold.

38
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:31,959
"People are what matters"?
You don't like people.

39
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:33,349
Is this about your mother?

40
00:01:33,424 --> 00:01:36,025
No. I had a near death whatever, and...

41
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,654
I was dead.

42
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:39,325
And now I'm not, so...

43
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:41,489
I'd like to use this chance
I've been given

44
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:42,654
to be more positive.

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,297
People are what matters.

46
00:01:45,996 --> 00:01:48,062
Paint with all the colors of the wind.

47
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:52,010
You're crazy now.

48
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:54,339
- I'm alive.
- Yeah, okay.

49
00:01:54,996 --> 00:01:56,912
No, no.
Um, I'm not done in there yet.

50
00:01:57,823 --> 00:02:00,191
Oh, don't worry.
Not looking, not interested.

51
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:02,689
<i>Some wounds we carry
with us everywhere,</i>

52
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,736
<i>and though the cut's long gone...</i>

53
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:07,036
No, she's selfish, is Izzie's problem.

54
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,962
<i>The pain still lingers.</i>

55
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,084
She's not selfish.
She's generous. But...

56
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,244
She-She's self-absorbed.

57
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:14,483
I mean,

58
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,743
her problem is that she doesn't see
other people's perspectives.

59
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:19,377
Hey, give me a bite.

60
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:23,148
You know, it's weird because

61
00:02:23,149 --> 00:02:25,364
she's so ridiculously compassionate
with her patients.

62
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:27,479
You'd think she'd roll some
of that out for her friends, but...

63
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,251
How about we not talk
about her anymore?

64
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:33,231
That's a fine idea.

65
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,397
He is in George's room,

66
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:42,575
and when George's stupid
marriage crashes and burns,

67
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:44,998
he's gonna want to move back in,
and he won't be able to.

68
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,068
His life will be in a shambles, he'll
finally notice that his dad is dead

69
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,919
and he made a fool
out of himself by marrying

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,486
somebody he doesn't really love,
and he'll have no place to go.

71
00:02:52,487 --> 00:02:53,496
Is that what you want?

72
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:55,023
That's exactly what I want.

73
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:58,284
Hey, look who found some clothes.

74
00:02:58,302 --> 00:02:59,739
- Shut it.
- How you doing?

75
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:02,471
Okay, everybody, let's do this once.

76
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:04,246
I'm fine, she's cremated,

77
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:07,464
I picked out a beautiful urn, and she's
hanging out in the back of my closet.

78
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,339
Any more questions about my dead mother,
or can we get back to work?

79
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,425
Does anyone know who
the new chief candidate is?

80
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,729
The chief's bringing in a ringer

81
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,974
in case he doesn't want to give
the job to either of your boyfriends.

82
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:18,570
O'Malley, you're with Shepherd today.

83
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:21,236
Yang, Dr. Montgomery.
Stevens, to the clinic.

84
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:22,696
Karev, Jane Doe.

85
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:23,794
Grey, scut.

86
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:25,737
Once again, I am fine.

87
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,852
You can tell everybody you fine
till you're blue in your face.

88
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:30,110
Your mom died,
and you almost joined her.

89
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:31,331
You're taking it easy.

90
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:34,204
Anybody come looking for me yet?

91
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:36,458
Well, no match on your prints, no.

92
00:03:36,494 --> 00:03:38,290
No hits from missing persons,plus--

93
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:40,690
My face is hard to identify.

94
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:42,906
Well, the second
they find something out

95
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:44,819
about your identity,
I'm gonna come tell you.

96
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:48,655
Dr. Sloan says
I need surgery on my eye.

97
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:51,601
He just wants to make sure
you don't lose vision there completely.

98
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:54,618
But Dr. Montgomery says I should wait
a day or two 'cause of the baby.

99
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,137
I don't know
what I'm supposed to make of that.

100
00:03:57,232 --> 00:03:59,280
Yeah, well, I mean,
surgery can be hard on a baby,

101
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,491
but you're gonna be on a fetal
monitor the whole time,

102
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,223
so if anything goes wrong,
we'll catch it.

103
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:05,576
Thank you.

104
00:04:07,369 --> 00:04:10,197
I really-- I really appreciate
you taking the time to...

105
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:14,188
I mean, you're-- you're
all I've got in this place.

106
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,113
Does that hurt?

107
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:18,395
Of course it hurts.
Don't poke it like that.

108
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:19,954
Has the lump been there a long time?

109
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,681
I got shot 50 years ago.

110
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:23,531
It's been there a long time.

111
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,247
But it hasn't bothered
you till... recently?

112
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:28,566
It bothers me
there's a bullet in there.

113
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,082
It'd bother you, too,
but it didn't start hurting

114
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:32,664
till a couple of months ago.

115
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:34,841
- You think it's a bullet?
- I don't "think", lady.

116
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,925
I know. I wanted it out.

117
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:39,875
But the army doctors
didn't want to go get it.

118
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,556
So they let me keep it in
for half a lifetime.

119
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,985
Let's get some pictures,
see if you're right.

120
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,980
I know I'm right.
Save your film.

121
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,717
Just get me something for the pain.

122
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,541
Mr. Scofield,
I'm sure you are right,

123
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:59,109
but we're still gonna
do this my way.

124
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,608
- Derek.
- There she is.

125
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:04,773
How was your flight?

126
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,280
They didn't feed me,
which I don't understand.

127
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:08,925
Dr. O'Malley, Dr. Crawford.

128
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:10,659
- She's a big pain in the ass.
- Pleasure.

129
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,755
He says that because
we worked together in new york

130
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:15,050
and I was the only one
who never had a crush on him.

131
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:16,449
No, I-I don't buy that.

132
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,271
What do we know, O'Malley?

133
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:20,738
Dr. Crawford has
a parafalcine meningioma

134
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:22,336
along the superior sagittal sinus.

135
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:24,577
You've operated three times.
It keeps on coming back.

136
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:25,943
Yeah, it's in dangerous territory,

137
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:28,191
so we leave a little bit of
the tumor behind each time,

138
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:30,328
and we go back every couple
of years and tune it up.

139
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:31,887
But this is the last time.

140
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,850
- Sorry?
- This is it, Derek.

141
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:36,315
I'm done after this.

142
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:39,982
Helen...

143
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,273
the recovery takes forever,

144
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:44,921
and it's not like
when jake was around.

145
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,987
I go through this by myself now.

146
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,686
Don't throw in the towel.

147
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:51,494
I'm looking at the situation as it is.

148
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:53,880
I am going to do this now,

149
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:57,561
then I am going to spend
the next two years of my life

150
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,613
lying on a beach,
enjoying the sun.

151
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:03,547
Stop looking at me
like I killed your cat.

152
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:05,353
The decision is made.

153
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:13,683
You guys seen Bailey?

154
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,497
- What are we doing?
- Checking out the new chief candidate.

155
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:21,448
Chief's in with the ringer.
We're lurking

156
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:23,413
in a way that was subtle
when it was two of us,

157
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,605
but isn't now that it's 12.

158
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:26,295
I heard it was someone from Stanford.

159
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:28,110
All the professors there loved me.

160
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:29,330
They loved you?

161
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:30,845
I was a great student.

162
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:32,907
- How you doing, Grey?
- I'm fine, sir. Thank you.

163
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,282
- Move, move, move.
- She doesn't like it when people ask.

164
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:36,770
The ringer's in there with the chief.

165
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,416
And whoever it
is loves Cristina because

166
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:41,177
everyone at Stanford
just loved Cristina.

167
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:42,210
Shut up.

168
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:44,629
She's a motivated student.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

169
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,229
- Thank you.
- A bit of a kiss ass,

170
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:47,440
but that's hard to control.

171
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:49,492
They're coming out. Look away.

172
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:54,551
That's Colin Marlowe.

173
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:56,175
Like the Marlowe transplant?

174
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:59,609
Like the brightest thing in
cardiothoracic surgery in a generation.

175
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:01,745
Dr. Marlowe...

176
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,337
I'm, uh, Preston Burke.

177
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:05,882
I'm a great admirer of your work, sir.

178
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,985
- Uh, particularly the--
- Yes, thank you. I--

179
00:07:08,337 --> 00:07:09,912
Would you excuse me
for just a second?

180
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:17,290
Well...

181
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:19,496
you gonna give me a hug or what?

182
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,077
So what was that, exactly?

183
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,702
He was my professor.
We were close.

184
00:07:44,703 --> 00:07:46,728
"close" appears to be
something of an understatement.

185
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,204
It was a long time ago.

186
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:50,792
I talk about him all the time.
You never thought to mention it?

187
00:07:50,793 --> 00:07:53,984
Well, um, I didn't think you wanted to
hear about every guy I ever slept with.

188
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:56,196
I have a hysterectomy to prep.

189
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,234
Are we done with the curiosity?

190
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,074
Great.

191
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:02,356
What are you doing tonight?

192
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,205
'Cause I don't want to go home and
find Alex, and it's just the two of us,

193
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:06,857
You know?
It's weird and awkward, and...

194
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:09,616
And he doesn't know whether
he should talk to me or not talk to me.

195
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:11,679
It's just such an awkward situation.

196
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:13,932
I'd rather it be group
awkwardness, you know?

197
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:16,791
I don't want to just be
standing there staring at him.

198
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:19,907
- Meredith?
- Have you seen Montgomery?

199
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:22,942
Hey! What are you doing tonight?
You want to come over?

200
00:08:22,956 --> 00:08:25,453
'Cause you and I never really
get a chance to hang out and...

201
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:26,510
It might be kind of fun.

202
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,969
Alex just moved in,
which was meredith's brilliant idea.

203
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,746
And he still has a thing for me,
so it's...

204
00:08:32,435 --> 00:08:34,251
- What the hell?
- This is my hiding spot.

205
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:35,977
My father is out there.
Go somewhere else.

206
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:37,945
- I need this closet, Meredith.
- Colin Marlowe?

207
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,610
Yes, he was my professor.
We were close.

208
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:41,904
He had his hand on your ass.
I sure hope you were close.

209
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:43,517
Did you see somebody go in there?

210
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,423
I did. Someone's hiding from me.

211
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:47,333
Yes, I think
someone's hiding from me, too.

212
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:50,712
You were that girl, huh?
The girl who slept with the professor.

213
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:54,416
We had one in my class.
She only got to the radiologist, though.

214
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,214
No one got near the cardio god.

215
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,921
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I scored big. You know,

216
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,181
hide in the bathroom.

217
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:01,970
My awkwardness with my father
is well-established.

218
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:04,120
You and the cardio god,
on the other hand,

219
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:05,608
have loads to catch up on.

220
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:07,814
But I don't want to talk
to the cardio god.

221
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:09,541
You know we can hear you
in there, right?

222
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:10,702
Loud and clear.

223
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:18,649
- Hi.
- Hi.

224
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,494
- Excuse me. May I?
- Yeah.

225
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,139
Oh, I was just leaving, actually.

226
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,491
We heard about your mother.

227
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:27,669
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

228
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,425
There wasn't a funeral or anything?

229
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:31,124
Oh, she didn't want that.

230
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:34,121
I hope everything's okay with the baby.

231
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,353
We're not here with the baby.

232
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:38,042
We're here because we wanted
to make sure that you were all right.

233
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:39,987
That's sweet, but...

234
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:41,904
We don't have to do this.
I'm not in shock.

235
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:43,970
I'm not racked with grief.
I'm just moving on.

236
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,367
But you're hiding in a broom closet.

237
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:48,254
Well, if you could just move my father.

238
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:50,539
I sent him to go get some coffee,

239
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:51,891
but we'd really like to...

240
00:09:52,473 --> 00:09:54,241
You know, make dinner or something...

241
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:55,638
for you.

242
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,619
He's been really worried about you.

243
00:09:58,616 --> 00:10:00,476
And he's the family you have left,
Meredith.

244
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,569
I-I don't see it that way.

245
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,504
When is this gonna stop?

246
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:08,430
Yes, he made some mistakes,
but he's not a monster.

247
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,923
He's just...

248
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,693
an inarticulate person who spills
food on his shirt, a lot.

249
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:15,012
Have dinner with us,

250
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:16,845
tonight. I'll make some chili.

251
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,542
The whole thing will be over in an hour.

252
00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:20,357
You think you can do that?

253
00:10:21,502 --> 00:10:23,919
I can't believe you hid in a closet
when you saw me coming.

254
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:24,959
If it wasn't just tragic,

255
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,883
it might be the most adorable thing
I've ever seen.

256
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:28,584
You could've warned me.

257
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:30,432
I thought, Cristina Yang
wouldn't hide in a closet

258
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:31,737
'cause she doesn't
want to talk to me,

259
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:34,947
which clearly she doesn't because
she fled like a roach in sunlight

260
00:10:35,132 --> 00:10:37,578
- when she saw me coming.
- You know,I did not flee. I was--

261
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:40,360
I have work to do. I'm not
a professional note taker anymore.

262
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,839
- You grew your hair. It's lovely.
- Don't flirt with me.

263
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:44,083
I have a person.

264
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:45,285
Really? Who?

265
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:46,930
Preston Burke.

266
00:10:47,953 --> 00:10:49,024
You never change.

267
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:50,714
- Must be adorable.
- No. Shut up.

268
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,442
It is a real relationship.

269
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,160
- I bet it is.
- I'm marrying him.

270
00:10:56,107 --> 00:10:57,112
Good.

271
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,685
Congratulations.

272
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:03,140
No, I'm being genuine.

273
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:05,248
It's wonderful.

274
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:09,871
Can I give you a congratulatory hug?

275
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:13,307
Don't touch my ass.

276
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:16,077
My stomach is growling.

277
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,526
Sorry. We can't let you eat
before the surgery.

278
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,239
That's okay. I stayed
at the archfield last night.

279
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,577
I had them make me
breakfast at midnight.

280
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:26,324
You should try the French toast.

281
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,009
It'll blow your mind.

282
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:30,741
Breakfast at the archfield
on an intern's salary?

283
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:32,604
Yeah, I kinda live
there at the moment.

284
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:34,229
My wife has a deal there.

285
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,351
That's one hell of a deal.

286
00:11:37,384 --> 00:11:38,857
So our room service bill

287
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:40,680
at the archfield,
is that part of the deal?

288
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:43,452
Yeah, sure.

289
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,907
I mean, breakfast alone is,

290
00:11:45,113 --> 00:11:46,738
what, probably 50 bucks a day?

291
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:48,620
And they still only charge us
$400 a week?

292
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:50,487
Sometimes I pay them
more for room service.

293
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:54,400
OK. Then just tell me how much it is,
and we'll split it like we do the rest.

294
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:55,925
- Don't worry about it.
- No come on.

295
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:57,733
I'm not gonna have you
pay for all the food.

296
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:59,785
Just tell me how much
the room service bill is.

297
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:02,246
We pay about, 800 a week.

298
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:03,640
Dollars?

299
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:05,295
I told you not to worry about it.

300
00:12:05,332 --> 00:12:06,487
You can't afford that.

301
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,327
- Yes, I can.
- How?

302
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:11,967
I'm your husband now.
You're supposed to tell me this stuff.

303
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,578
Okay. Just come here.

304
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,757
All right, my parents
have a lot of money...

305
00:12:15,758 --> 00:12:16,805
- What?
- And so I...

306
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:18,542
have more money than I'm making.

307
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,301
And we don't... have
a special deal through family friends

308
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:24,003
at the archfield.
I just-- I pay for it.

309
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:25,160
How much?

310
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:28,478
$2,500 a week.

311
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,843
- You're an heiress.
- Okay.

312
00:12:30,844 --> 00:12:33,302
- See, this is why I don't tell people.
- You're an heiress.

313
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:34,632
Don't-- just don't,

314
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:36,355
okay? Stop talking. Stop talking.

315
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,013
I mean it.
I-I didn't tell you because

316
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:40,794
my parents' money has affected
every single relationship in my life,

317
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:42,530
and so I've stopped talking
about it and living--

318
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:43,661
No, wait, wait. So wait.

319
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,596
So I've been--
I've been paying you

320
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:47,990
$200 a week for what, fun?

321
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:50,865
No. I use it to tip housekeeping.

322
00:12:54,856 --> 00:12:56,351
Great! Oh!

323
00:12:56,548 --> 00:12:58,867
Oh, I'm-- you know,
I'm glad I could pitch in.

324
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:01,571
You know, is there anything else
that I should know about,

325
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,834
that's, I don't know,
huge like this?

326
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,984
Uh, I-I-I used to have
a pet ferret for nine years.

327
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:08,720
George...

328
00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:10,644
Great.

329
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,114
Stop distracting the staff.

330
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:15,293
You're pushy.
Anybody ever tell you that?

331
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:20,116
So what do you think
of a sagittal sinus bypass?

332
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,238
Have you ever scrubbed in on
a sagittal sinus bypass, Dr. O'Malley?

333
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:27,665
It is what they call
"big balls" surgery.

334
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:30,516
- Apparently I have a surgeon with--
- It's been very successful.

335
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,783
- When the patient doesn't stroke out.
- If it works,

336
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:34,998
the tumor's all gone. We never
have to go back in there again.

337
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,413
If it doesn't work, I'm dead.

338
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:38,480
If you refuse to come back
in 2 years, you're dead anyway.

339
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:40,007
That's a decision I can live with.

340
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:41,604
That isn't a decision I can live with.

341
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,463
O'Malley, go find her labs.

342
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:51,109
So what do you think, huh?

343
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,681
A few years on a beach,

344
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,325
and then what?

345
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,297
After you piss away your savings,

346
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,222
your memory goes,
motor skills deteriorate,

347
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:03,267
and you're dying a very slow,
miserable,

348
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:04,951
painful death...
You're gonna call me up

349
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:07,963
and you're gonna ask me why we didn't do
something when we had the chance.

350
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:09,874
Now that is not something
I can live with.

351
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:12,850
Not...

352
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,024
when we can do something
right now to prevent it.

353
00:14:19,302 --> 00:14:21,624
Well, it looks like the bullet
has damaged your scapula.

354
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,030
No wonder it hurts.

355
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:25,302
How did you get shot, sir?

356
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:28,157
Korea. Garden spot.
Makes a nice vacation.

357
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:29,833
Can I get a damn painkiller?

358
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:32,551
I think we'll do you one better.
We're gonna take it out.

359
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:33,875
My bullet?

360
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:36,226
There was no reason to remove it
when you first got hit,

361
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:39,295
but now it's infected.
It's working its way into your scapula,

362
00:14:39,323 --> 00:14:40,403
and we can't have that.

363
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:41,840
I need to see that bullet.

364
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,469
- You gonna frame it?
- No, smarty-pants.

365
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,018
I was fragged a couple
of weeks before it all ended.

366
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:49,844
- "Fragged"?
- Yeah, shot by one of his own men.

367
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:51,867
I made a decision,
and they didn't like it.

368
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:54,293
And then what do you know?
We're facing enemy fire,

369
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,735
and I take a hit
from the wrong side of the line.

370
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:58,293
I could never prove it,

371
00:14:58,702 --> 00:14:59,941
but we can prove it now,

372
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:02,025
when you pull the damn thing out of me.

373
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:03,663
Get me my bullet.

374
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:05,151
Let's calm down, Mr. Scofield.

375
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:06,352
Do you know what it's like,

376
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:08,456
when your own men turn on you?

377
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:11,309
It's not a good feeling.

378
00:15:17,308 --> 00:15:20,040
I just agreed to have dinner
at my father's house, tonight.

379
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:23,120
And Cristina slept with Colin Marlowe.

380
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:24,801
"Marlowe transplant" Marlowe?

381
00:15:24,838 --> 00:15:26,496
They had a thing
when she was a student.

382
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:27,894
How could I have
a meal at my father's house?

383
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:29,040
He slept with Cristina?

384
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,101
Derek.

385
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:31,659
Oh, right. Sorry. Okay.

386
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:33,612
Have dinner at your house.

387
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,841
It's your place. I'll come.

388
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:38,282
I'll be your wingman. It'll be fun.

389
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,591
Okay, it won't be fun.
But it'll be...

390
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:41,745
It'll be fine.

391
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:43,097
They're your family.

392
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:44,439
Why does everyone assume that?

393
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,792
You deserve to have a family,

394
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:47,181
whether you like them or not.

395
00:15:50,262 --> 00:15:51,380
I thought we had a deal.

396
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:53,715
We agreed I wouldn't sleep
with anybody for two months.

397
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:55,024
We never said I wouldn't look.

398
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:57,300
- You didn't think I'd hold out.
- No, I didn't.

399
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,394
You're worth it.

400
00:15:58,459 --> 00:15:59,671
You bet your ass I am.

401
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:02,980
She's rich, totally rich,

402
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:04,036
boatloads of money.

403
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,092
- George, that's fantastic.
- No,it's...

404
00:16:06,993 --> 00:16:08,261
it's not fantastic.

405
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:10,770
Cristina did Colin Marlowe.

406
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:12,554
Callie's rich.

407
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:14,356
Don't talk to her about it.

408
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,308
Her? I am sorry,
I don't have a name anymore?

409
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,295
Don't tell anyone.
Those were my words.

410
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:20,397
- So she's rich.
- Just shut up about it.

411
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,685
Do you think that's possible?

412
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:30,624
If you give me the "people is what
matters" thing again, I will kill you.

413
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:33,049
Colin Marlowe.

414
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,435
Was it good? Was he good?

415
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,141
Did he make you a better lover?

416
00:16:37,142 --> 00:16:39,627
Remember all the other times
I've talked to you about my sex life?

417
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:40,745
- No.
- Exactly.

418
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,505
Did I miss anything
about her doing the old guy?

419
00:16:42,506 --> 00:16:44,239
- She's not talking.
- Oh, she'll talk.

420
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,883
So I was supposed to be
back in the game today,

421
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:48,651
but instead I'm planning dinner
for my father in my dead mother's house.

422
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:50,353
I don't cook. How am I supposed
to cook for them?

423
00:16:50,354 --> 00:16:51,603
I will make your stupid dinner.

424
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:54,243
So were there any little
blue pills involved,

425
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:55,816
or is he untouched by time?

426
00:16:55,817 --> 00:16:57,585
Dude, that's just wrong.
Don't answer that.

427
00:16:57,586 --> 00:16:58,966
Because I am your friend,

428
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:02,774
I will show up at your house 45 minutes
into the dinner with a fake crisis.

429
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:05,339
So if it's, uh, unbearable,
you can abort.

430
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:06,409
Oh, thank you.

431
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:08,240
Come on. He's not a young man.

432
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,298
He wasn't getting a little help?

433
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,264
Poppin' the pill?
Dad's best friend?

434
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,481
Come on. You're gonna give me nothing
after everything we've been through?

435
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:17,894
Nothing?

436
00:17:20,703 --> 00:17:21,726
It's a miracle drug.

437
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:23,670
And someday, it'll save your life.

438
00:17:26,768 --> 00:17:28,569
Dr. Marlowe? Derek Shepherd.

439
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:31,634
I'm doing a sagittal sinuspass
today if you'd like to observe.

440
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:32,975
Really? That's quite a procedure.

441
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:34,779
It's a good trick,
but if you're really interested

442
00:17:34,793 --> 00:17:36,304
to see what this hospital can do,

443
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,168
I'm performing
an arterial switch operation

444
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:40,713
for a T.G.A. this afternoon.

445
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:43,152
If you gentlemen are trying
to intimidate the competition,

446
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:44,158
it's working.

447
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:47,000
- Good.
- I'll see both of you in surgery.

448
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,076
Colin Marlowe.

449
00:17:51,264 --> 00:17:52,353
The one and only.

450
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,621
- He...
- Yes.

451
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:54,982
- With...
- Yes.

452
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:57,536
- Indeed.
- Yeah.

453
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:00,346
Suction.

454
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:03,534
No, not like you're driving a tractor.
Slowly.

455
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:05,460
Better.

456
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:07,807
What's the chance she wakes up
and remembers everything?

457
00:18:07,902 --> 00:18:08,887
I wouldn't count on it.

458
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,922
Dr. Sloan, the baby's having decels.

459
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:13,953
Are you sure? Sometimes the monitor's
not on right. You get a false read.

460
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:15,919
She's got vaginal bleeding.
The baby's in distress.

461
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,390
Damn it. Page Dr. Montgomery. Now!

462
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,870
You're making an honest
woman of Cristina Yang.

463
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,064
That's-- That's impressive.

464
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:26,758
I always thought she was collecting us,
like baseball cards.

465
00:18:27,297 --> 00:18:28,365
Baseball cards?

466
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,605
Well, she likes an authority figure,
someone...

467
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:33,578
with something to teach her. I never
thought she would actually commit.

468
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:35,854
She use to say to me
that she thought that marriage

469
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:37,449
was for the weak and undirected.

470
00:18:38,324 --> 00:18:39,778
I made a number of

471
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,391
marriage proposals.

472
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:43,531
It seemed the polite thing to do

473
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,848
after such a long time together,
but, uh,

474
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:47,907
- she wouldn't have it.
- All what time?

475
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:49,725
You were just having
a fling with a student.

476
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:50,816
A fling?

477
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:53,625
Cristina and I were together
for three years.

478
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:00,503
Is the problem
that I slept with my professor,

479
00:19:00,504 --> 00:19:03,142
or that I was committed enough
to keep at it for three years?

480
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,011
You told him that you thought
marriage was an idiotic institution.

481
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,338
- It is.
- Then why did you say yes?

482
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:08,802
- Cause I wana make you happy.
- "Happy"?

483
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:10,797
You know, I'll do a lot of things
to make you happy.

484
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:13,972
Do I give a crap about a ceremony
with a dress and a flautist?

485
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:15,137
No.

486
00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:17,563
But I'm happy to do it
if it'll make you happy.

487
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,370
Heartwarming.

488
00:19:20,928 --> 00:19:21,933
Thanks.

489
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,535
You couldn't have waited one day?

490
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,083
She was 40% vision compromised
in her right eye.

491
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:33,525
- It would've been gone tomorrow.
- No, it wouldn't, actually,

492
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:36,465
but there's a snazzy new chief candidate
marching around the hall today,

493
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,976
and you needed to be a hero.
That's what needed to happen today.

494
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,612
The patient was fine, Addison.

495
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,081
The baby's still in her uterus,
and she's not losing an eye.

496
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,894
Every surgery is risky.

497
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,284
The patient chose this one.

498
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:48,933
Karev...
don't just stand there.

499
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:51,101
The patient's baby was in distress.

500
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:52,444
Go. Stay with her.

501
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:53,608
Somethin' happen with Jane Doe?

502
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,863
Yeah, she can see,
and Addison's got a problem with it.

503
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:58,624
He rushed her into surgery,
and she almost lost the baby.

504
00:19:58,642 --> 00:20:00,866
I had to sew  her cervix shut.

505
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,131
The complications had nothing
to do with the surgery.

506
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:05,093
Why? Why do you think
Mark moved so quickly, Derek?

507
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:07,278
Do you think it's because
a piece of the orbital bone

508
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:08,714
was floating towards the brain?

509
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,062
Well, I think it's because
Mark wants a promotion.

510
00:20:11,303 --> 00:20:13,726
You're not her husband.
This isn't your patient.

511
00:20:13,782 --> 00:20:14,711
Stay out of it!

512
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,678
What the hell
do you people think you're doing?

513
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:18,994
You're supposed to be
the leadership of this hospital.

514
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:20,981
Screaming about
a patient in the hallway?

515
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:22,680
Are you out of your minds?

516
00:20:29,504 --> 00:20:30,574
Tough procedure.

517
00:20:30,903 --> 00:20:32,077
It's a bold choice.

518
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:34,110
We've been fighting
this one for a while.

519
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,104
I'm hoping this will be
the end of it.

520
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:38,411
What happened?

521
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:41,232
End-tidal CO2 just dropped
from 30 to 16. Bagging manually.

522
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:42,776
Doppler's showing air
in the left ventricle.

523
00:20:42,777 --> 00:20:44,121
0-2 stat's down to 89.

524
00:20:44,135 --> 00:20:45,156
Aspirate the central line.

525
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:46,887
- She's bradycardic.
- Push 1 of atropine.

526
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:48,112
There's no air in the central line.

527
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,800
Level her out.
I'm gonna flood the field.

528
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,109
Asystole.
Push 1 milligram of epi.

529
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,508
Start compressions. Go.

530
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,386
Get in there.
Get in there! Do it!

531
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:59,478
That things been in there
since the korean war?

532
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,941
He's lucky it didn't travel
down to his aorta.

533
00:21:02,693 --> 00:21:03,886
Okay, a little suction there.

534
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,688
Almost...

535
00:21:06,324 --> 00:21:07,329
I got it.

536
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:12,258
Make sure we get that back.
The patient wants it.

537
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:13,897
He's got a warped sense of nostalgia.

538
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:16,594
I get it. If they pulled a bullet
out of me, I'd want it

539
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:18,191
cast in gold
and mounted on my wall.

540
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,617
Yeah, well, you can afford it.

541
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,518
Just a little more suction.
Let's get ready to close.

542
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,008
She's not responding.

543
00:21:30,975 --> 00:21:32,965
- I'm gonna open her up.
- Open cardiac massage?

544
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:34,093
You're a neurosurgeon.

545
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:36,615
You have no privileges in this hospital.
Get the glasses off.

546
00:21:36,616 --> 00:21:38,460
- Should we page Dr. Burke?
- No I've got it.

547
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:40,778
Cross clamp the hilum. You don't
want air in the cerebral arteries.

548
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,254
Yeah, I got it.
Give me a 10-blade.

549
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,389
10-blade quickly, please.
O'Malley, get over here.

550
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,054
Let's roll her. Ready?
One, two, three. Go.

551
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:50,710
Okay, rib spreader.

552
00:21:58,273 --> 00:21:59,334
Okay, scissors.

553
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:08,421
Massage her heart, O'Malley.

554
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:14,209
I need to aspirate.

555
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:17,830
Any air return?

556
00:22:18,196 --> 00:22:19,200
10 cc's.

557
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,324
End-tidal CO2 is going back up.

558
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:28,977
The heart's starting
to beat on its own.

559
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,456
Pressure's 60 over 40.
It's low, but it's there.

560
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:32,973
She's gonna make it.

561
00:22:40,617 --> 00:22:41,847
Should I start closing her up?

562
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:45,278
Dr. Shepherd?

563
00:22:46,914 --> 00:22:49,562
O'Malley, I just sliced my friend's
chest open. Give me a moment.

564
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,010
That was very well-handled,
Dr. Shepherd.

565
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,297
Very impressive, indeed.

566
00:22:56,298 --> 00:22:57,964
Not something I want to do
every day, but thanks.

567
00:22:57,965 --> 00:22:59,071
Doctors, what happened?

568
00:22:59,257 --> 00:23:02,219
Dr. Shepherd's patient
had a venous air embolism.

569
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,965
He had to split her chest open,
massage her heart

570
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:09,069
and manually aspirate right
in the middle of his procedure.

571
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:11,115
Why didn't you call me?

572
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,387
Uh, you were operating.

573
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,324
I was next door.
You could've pulled me out.

574
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:16,469
There was no time.
I handled it.

575
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,171
You think I crack people's heads open
if you're in the building

576
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:21,151
just because I think
I can handle a brain bleed?

577
00:23:21,152 --> 00:23:23,084
The patient is lucky,
and you were showboating.

578
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:25,386
Showboating?
What, are you out of your mind? I was--

579
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:28,482
We seem to be going out of
our way to impress Dr. Marlowe.

580
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:30,353
- I'll bet we are.
- Gentlemen...

581
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:35,810
Good day,

582
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:37,350
doctors.

583
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:46,742
How you feeling, Mr. Scofield?

584
00:23:48,432 --> 00:23:49,456
Where's my bullet?

585
00:23:58,234 --> 00:23:59,239
That it?

586
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:01,201
Where's the rest of it?

587
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:03,119
That was it.

588
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:04,846
Is that a letter?

589
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:06,640
Can you read that?

590
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:09,691
I-I don't think it's much of anything.
I-I think it's just a scratch.

591
00:24:10,702 --> 00:24:12,505
It's so small.

592
00:24:12,627 --> 00:24:14,655
It could just be anything.

593
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,157
It's been a long time.

594
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:17,727
They don't hold up that well.

595
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:21,605
Could you have your lab,
you know, analyze it?

596
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:23,807
Tell me if it's one of ours or--

597
00:24:24,016 --> 00:24:27,415
We're not set up for that kind
of investigation, Mr. Scofield.

598
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:29,646
You could try to send it
to a forensic lab,

599
00:24:29,647 --> 00:24:31,866
but I don't know
if they'll tell you much either.

600
00:24:37,508 --> 00:24:40,954
I've been stewing for 50 years.

601
00:24:42,653 --> 00:24:43,996
Maybe it's time to move on.

602
00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:45,388
To what?

603
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,979
I lost my whole unit over this.

604
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:50,432
I came home.

605
00:24:51,004 --> 00:24:53,192
My wife, she didn't get it.

606
00:24:53,685 --> 00:24:56,845
I've been blazing mad my whole life.

607
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:00,398
I got nothing left.

608
00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:07,374
It's not too late
to let it go and start over.

609
00:25:09,872 --> 00:25:11,196
You're a sweet kid,

610
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:14,747
but you don't know what it's like

611
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:17,808
to have something
change you in your soul.

612
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:21,491
I do.

613
00:25:22,975 --> 00:25:24,411
I wish I didn't, but I do.

614
00:25:26,355 --> 00:25:27,970
Don't let it turn you.

615
00:25:32,752 --> 00:25:34,583
You look like you had a long day.

616
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,325
You know what fragging is?

617
00:25:37,842 --> 00:25:39,813
We've got an epidemic of it today.

618
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:42,860
My esteemed attendings
are gonna be the death of me.

619
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,075
Is there a front-runner?

620
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:45,282
I don't know.

621
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,507
What I do know is
I don't want my attendings

622
00:25:48,526 --> 00:25:49,952
tearing each other's throats out

623
00:25:49,953 --> 00:25:51,830
because of some internal
power struggle.

624
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:53,965
It's too dangerous for the hospital.

625
00:25:54,397 --> 00:25:55,402
Does that mean...

626
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,723
is Colin Marlowe gonna be the new chief?

627
00:26:00,316 --> 00:26:01,396
Good night, Dr. Bailey.

628
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:10,963
This is ready.

629
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:13,930
Don't slosh it around.
It's all about the presentation.

630
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,494
Come in and eat with us.

631
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:17,333
You need to bond
with your people, Meredith.

632
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:18,787
People are what matters.

633
00:26:18,947 --> 00:26:21,200
- I hate people.
- Yeah, well, do your own talking.

634
00:26:21,201 --> 00:26:22,176
We talked.

635
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:25,380
We talked hospital, we talked
his research, we talked dead mother.

636
00:26:25,474 --> 00:26:26,929
- I'm out.
- Ask about the baby.

637
00:26:27,315 --> 00:26:29,663
Ask if it poos.
People can go on about that for hours.

638
00:26:33,353 --> 00:26:35,741
- The chicken looks delicious.
- Yeah.

639
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,375
It's from the store.

640
00:26:39,116 --> 00:26:40,975
Well, the green beans
look great as well.

641
00:26:41,097 --> 00:26:43,046
I... didn't do those either.

642
00:26:47,621 --> 00:26:48,795
It's beautifully presented.

643
00:26:48,935 --> 00:26:50,757
Izzie did that.

644
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,048
Alex!

645
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:55,666
Come, sit.

646
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,187
Oh. No, go ahead.

647
00:26:57,469 --> 00:26:58,816
Eat. We're eating.

648
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,995
This is Susan, and this is my father.

649
00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:02,962
Hi.

650
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:05,291
- Here, you can have this plate.
- Cool.

651
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,244
So how are you?
How was your day?

652
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:10,521
Okay. Hungry.

653
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:12,371
Good.

654
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:17,936
How's the baby?

655
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:21,175
- Great.
- She's smiling no, sometimes.

656
00:27:22,255 --> 00:27:25,504
She looks exactly like
molly wh-when she smiles.

657
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:29,094
I mean, it's amazing. I've got
this old picture of Molly and me

658
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:30,371
When Molly was...

659
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,709
I don't know, 5, and she's,

660
00:27:32,737 --> 00:27:35,409
sitting on this red sled in the snow,
this great, big fir tree...

661
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:37,536
- You know, I'm not sure that that--
- Yeah.

662
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:40,147
No, honey, it's a massive douglas fir.

663
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:41,632
And in the picture,

664
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:45,148
couldn't look more like the baby.
I mean, incredible.

665
00:27:45,552 --> 00:27:46,557
That's me.

666
00:27:49,844 --> 00:27:52,896
The red sled and the big fir tree in the

667
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:56,154
park at the middle school
in the ugly, yellow,

668
00:27:57,074 --> 00:27:58,313
plaid wool coat.

669
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,285
That isn't Molly.

670
00:28:01,872 --> 00:28:02,887
It's you and me.

671
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:12,726
- Oh, great.
- <i>Crap.</i>

672
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,040
- Sorry.
- <i>I think I blew a fuse.</i>

673
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:17,866
- I'll get it.
- No, you know, I can get it.

674
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:19,603
- It's--
- Oh, in the laundry room.

675
00:28:22,254 --> 00:28:24,075
- I keep forgetting.
- What?

676
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:25,793
It's his house.

677
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:31,850
I'm going home.

678
00:28:38,622 --> 00:28:39,805
Are you going home?

679
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,120
How did it end?

680
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:47,971
It ended.
School was ending, I was leaving.

681
00:28:48,047 --> 00:28:49,061
You were done.

682
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,505
I came here.
I fell in love with you.

683
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:53,904
A new mentor,

684
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,788
with a host of new things
to teach you.

685
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:58,908
If you think that I'm
in this for the education--

686
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:01,768
Do you or do you not find my knowledge
and my skill compelling?

687
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:03,938
God. You know what?
You are blowing this way out of--

688
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:05,500
A man three times your age,

689
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:08,171
believed that he was having
a substantial relationship with you...

690
00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:09,416
Well, yeah, he was.

691
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,745
And one day,
you're done just like that?

692
00:29:12,741 --> 00:29:14,112
Yes.

693
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:18,088
You don't open yourself up...
to anyone.

694
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,285
Sometimes...

695
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,222
I think it's charming-- She's different,
she's not like other women.

696
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,105
But the simple fact is--
is that you have never let me in.

697
00:29:27,668 --> 00:29:29,842
What, you think that
it's gonna make a good marriage?

698
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,485
Well, I don't.

699
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:34,865
I don't want you to marry me
because you're placating me.

700
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:37,090
That doesn't interest me.

701
00:29:38,348 --> 00:29:39,559
It doesn't interest me at all.

702
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:47,482
- Do you think he's okay?
- He'll find it.

703
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:51,839
He probably can't see.
Um, there's a flashlight in the closet.

704
00:29:51,886 --> 00:29:53,012
- I'll go get it.
- Thanks.

705
00:29:53,013 --> 00:29:54,017
Excuse me.

706
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,731
- I'm sorry.
- It's going fine.

707
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:02,486
I just...

708
00:30:02,947 --> 00:30:04,693
I don't know what to say to him.

709
00:30:05,397 --> 00:30:06,402
Well, it's not easy.

710
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,159
That's 'cause he's afraid of you.

711
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:11,214
I shouldn't have bit his head off.

712
00:30:12,065 --> 00:30:13,435
I wish I could've just...

713
00:30:14,365 --> 00:30:16,515
Meredith, it's okay to get angry.

714
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:19,275
It's you in the picture.

715
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:23,118
Izzie Stevens?

716
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:26,020
I share something with you that
I clearly feel uncomfortable about,

717
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:27,277
and you tell Izzie Stevens?

718
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:28,981
No, I didn't tell Izzie.
I told Meredith.

719
00:30:28,982 --> 00:30:30,822
Oh! Oh, so that's better?

720
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,344
No, it was an accident. I--

721
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,062
It was an accident.

722
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:35,358
I was pissed off--

723
00:30:35,425 --> 00:30:37,604
Why can't you give me
the benefit of the doubt that--

724
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:39,656
That maybe sometimes
I'm on your side?

725
00:30:39,657 --> 00:30:41,380
Because you choose
your friends over me

726
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,949
- every chance you get.
- No, I don't.

727
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,306
I married you, and I haven't talked
to my best friend in weeks.

728
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,056
Meanwhile you lied to me
about where we live and why.

729
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:52,030
You lied to me about your background.
You lied to me about your family!

730
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:53,966
And still I'm the dog
who gets whacked on the nose

731
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:55,509
with a newspaper all the time.

732
00:30:55,535 --> 00:30:56,497
When is this gonna stop?

733
00:30:56,498 --> 00:30:58,545
- Oh, so this is my problem?
- Yeah, maybe it is.

734
00:30:58,546 --> 00:31:01,319
Oh, oh, so the fact that your best
friend violently disses our marriage

735
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,980
every chance she gets,
publicly, repeatedly...

736
00:31:04,981 --> 00:31:07,308
Why do you think she does that?
Have you ever thought about that?

737
00:31:07,318 --> 00:31:09,801
She's having a problem with this.
I understand that.

738
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,306
She has feelings for you.

739
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:14,780
- What?
- She wants you.

740
00:31:16,731 --> 00:31:18,432
She wants you.
That's what this is about.

741
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:19,512
That's why she hates me.

742
00:31:22,873 --> 00:31:26,556
George, George, do not laugh at me.
Do not laugh at me.

743
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:28,725
No. No, I'm not. I'm not.

744
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:30,496
Oh, god.

745
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:32,928
I'm not. I--

746
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:36,035
It's just, come on, she's Izzie.
She's--

747
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:38,674
She's bl-- She's blonde,
she's stacked, she's--

748
00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:40,871
She's a supermodel.
I'm George.

749
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,189
- So what does that make me?
- No.

750
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,963
No, come on. You are gorgeous...

751
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,526
And you're curvy, and I never
thought you'd go for me.

752
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:52,586
Just shut up.

753
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,966
This is my hotel room that
I pay for with my huge piles of money.

754
00:31:58,773 --> 00:32:00,059
Get the hell out of it!

755
00:32:11,131 --> 00:32:12,464
I'm sorry about the lights.

756
00:32:13,012 --> 00:32:15,059
Eh, whatever. The food was good.

757
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:17,324
- You want some pie?
- Nah, I gotta go.

758
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:19,400
Oh, big plans. Got a hot date?

759
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,170
Well, good for you.

760
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:31,100
I guess "not interested"
really meant not interested.

761
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:32,490
Iz...

762
00:32:34,593 --> 00:32:36,640
- You didn't want me.
- Yeah.

763
00:32:38,102 --> 00:32:40,275
But that doesn't mean I want
you to want anyone else.

764
00:32:43,332 --> 00:32:46,160
Am I gonna be alone,
pining over a dead guy forever?

765
00:32:46,968 --> 00:32:48,846
I hope not.
It's kind of a waste.

766
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:52,843
Am I supposed to move on now?

767
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:55,125
Do people look at me and go,

768
00:32:55,472 --> 00:32:57,839
"she's gotta get over it already.
It's ruining her life"?

769
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:00,605
You'll move on when you're ready to.

770
00:33:11,395 --> 00:33:12,688
Why are you sitting in the dark?

771
00:33:12,813 --> 00:33:15,292
- Izzie blew a fuse.
- Okay, I'm having a crisis.

772
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:18,034
Oh, I don't need rescuing.

773
00:33:18,035 --> 00:33:21,284
Susan is very nice,
and we're getting through it.

774
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:23,062
Limping through, but we'll make it.

775
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,688
Okay, no, this isn't a fake crisis.

776
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:29,154
This is a real, "my ex is about to
ruin my impending marriage" crisis.

777
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:33,190
Hey. Hey. Where's Izzie?

778
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,275
Kitchen.

779
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:36,936
Sorry. It's not always like this.

780
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:39,831
Yeah, it-- it kinda is.

781
00:33:43,043 --> 00:33:44,142
They're in the other room.

782
00:33:44,178 --> 00:33:45,616
I need you to get over yourself.

783
00:33:45,663 --> 00:33:47,069
I need you to start liking my wife.

784
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,993
I need you to like her
because sometimes I don't,

785
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,653
and I need you to talk me
back into it.

786
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:51,917
You say you're my friend?
That's the job.

787
00:33:52,217 --> 00:33:54,045
I need to vent,
and I need it to be okay.

788
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:56,867
And I need to vent with alcohol.

789
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:06,579
I got married,
and I'm scared it was a bad idea.

790
00:34:09,182 --> 00:34:11,801
Nobody ever got married and
didn't think that at least once.

791
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:21,948
Did you find the fuse box?

792
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,179
Yeah. Yeah, I just needed to...

793
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:28,357
- Take a break?
- I don't know...

794
00:34:29,052 --> 00:34:32,453
how to--
Or what to talk to her about.

795
00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:34,566
Work's a good place to start.

796
00:34:35,316 --> 00:34:36,927
You know,
she's proud of what she does.

797
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:38,199
She's good at it, too.

798
00:34:38,998 --> 00:34:40,087
I'd start with that.

799
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:42,509
You get each other.
That's nice.

800
00:34:43,843 --> 00:34:45,261
Some days it's nice.

801
00:34:47,893 --> 00:34:48,992
Some days I'd like to...

802
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:51,463
come home to someone
who doesn't know a thing about it.

803
00:34:52,513 --> 00:34:53,518
Rough day?

804
00:34:56,996 --> 00:34:58,912
I almost lost a friend
in my own O.R.

805
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:01,212
Was it your fault?

806
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:04,179
I don't know.

807
00:35:08,403 --> 00:35:09,652
You were both nervous tonight.

808
00:35:10,788 --> 00:35:11,793
It'll get easier.

809
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:13,483
She was nervous?

810
00:35:15,721 --> 00:35:16,791
She's tough.

811
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,495
She tries to hide it.
She's difficult.

812
00:35:20,462 --> 00:35:21,572
But if you make an effort,

813
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,943
she's worth it.

814
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,267
You okay?

815
00:35:28,285 --> 00:35:29,290
Not entirely.

816
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,261
She's worth the effort.

817
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:39,618
All right.

818
00:35:42,948 --> 00:35:44,310
Ah, nice.

819
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:49,829
- Damn it.
- Gotta go back in, huh?

820
00:35:58,498 --> 00:36:01,572
Why is there an 11-inch
incision in my chest?

821
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:04,819
You coded on the table--
Air embolus.

822
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,980
I had to open you up and aspirate.

823
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:09,722
See, I'm sure you did a great job,

824
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:12,438
but that's why you're gonna have
some real trouble

825
00:36:12,682 --> 00:36:14,381
convincing me to do it again.

826
00:36:15,024 --> 00:36:15,991
Helen...

827
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:17,972
we got it all.

828
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:21,309
The tumor-- We never have to
go back in there again.

829
00:36:23,155 --> 00:36:24,761
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

830
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:28,629
You're gonna live a long,
long life.

831
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:32,516
And here I thought
you were just being an ass.

832
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:34,582
Ah, I was an ass.

833
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,370
I had no right to push you
like that.

834
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:45,205
No, you did not.

835
00:36:46,031 --> 00:36:48,268
I was going through
some stuff, and I just-- I...

836
00:36:49,347 --> 00:36:50,418
I was an ass.

837
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:56,692
But in this moment, you're the ass
who gave me my life back.

838
00:36:59,528 --> 00:37:01,096
I'm so glad we did this.

839
00:37:01,584 --> 00:37:04,046
I am, too.Thank you for suggesting it.
Because I--

840
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:06,488
You never would have
in a million years.

841
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,060
- God night, sweetie.
- Thank you. Good night.

842
00:37:12,653 --> 00:37:15,161
I'm-- I'm sorry
about your mother.

843
00:37:15,696 --> 00:37:16,700
Thank you.

844
00:37:17,273 --> 00:37:18,278
Thanks.

845
00:37:20,753 --> 00:37:21,786
Swing's still here.

846
00:37:22,415 --> 00:37:25,617
Yes, it, uh, doesn't swing.
Nobody uses it.

847
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:33,700
Here.

848
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:38,254
I put this in there.
You used to catch your fingers in it.

849
00:37:58,929 --> 00:37:59,929
Suck it up,

850
00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:04,601
go back with your tail between
your legs and just apologize.

851
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,447
- No!
- No, really. Look, you just--

852
00:38:06,448 --> 00:38:09,344
- I'm always apologizing.
- "I'm sorry. I'm an ass." blah.

853
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:11,523
And it's over.
And then it's all over.

854
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:15,010
No. Not real--
I can't be wrong all the time.

855
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:17,968
Is that really possible?
Don't-- Don't finish it.

856
00:38:17,977 --> 00:38:20,205
- Hey, don't be grabby.
- You-- I don't have any.

857
00:38:21,304 --> 00:38:22,309
Bogie.

858
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:26,398
Maybe you're wrong all the time,
maybe she's just really insecure.

859
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:28,211
It doesn't matter.
You still have to grovel.

860
00:38:28,644 --> 00:38:29,705
Don't you-- Fill...

861
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:32,410
Yeah, um, she's...

862
00:38:33,164 --> 00:38:34,582
She's insecure.

863
00:38:35,214 --> 00:38:36,572
Yeah. That is a fact.

864
00:38:37,486 --> 00:38:39,402
She's insecure.

865
00:38:40,645 --> 00:38:41,650
What?

866
00:38:42,913 --> 00:38:43,965
What?

867
00:38:44,294 --> 00:38:45,787
Just tell me.

868
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,237
- Come on.
- No.

869
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:50,347
Come on!

870
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:51,502
Shut up.

871
00:38:53,305 --> 00:38:55,549
No, it's, um, ju-- nothing.

872
00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:00,038
Just that she thinks you have feelings
for me, like that's the problem.

873
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:03,167
I love that.
That's fabulous.

874
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,518
- And-- and-- and...
- Oh, I need a tissue.

875
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:07,824
That, uh,
I-I-I desperately want you.

876
00:39:14,004 --> 00:39:15,281
I'm crying.

877
00:39:15,797 --> 00:39:16,877
I'm crying.

878
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:20,173
Is she crazy?

879
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,191
You know, I think--
I think she's maybe a little crazy.

880
00:39:25,257 --> 00:39:26,786
- Oh, can't breathe.
- Shut up.

881
00:39:26,806 --> 00:39:28,004
I can't breathe.

882
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:29,632
We gotta be quiet.

883
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:44,459
Scary day, huh?

884
00:39:45,576 --> 00:39:47,501
Well, your amniotic sac's intact,

885
00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:49,486
the placenta's in good position.

886
00:39:49,674 --> 00:39:52,726
Dr. Montgomery sewed your cervix up
so tight, nothing's coming outta there.

887
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:55,318
So the baby's gonna be okay?

888
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:58,923
We're gonna have to see how it goes.

889
00:40:00,595 --> 00:40:01,600
I'm sorry.

890
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,480
You asked me what I thought,
and I told you to go for it, and...

891
00:40:05,874 --> 00:40:06,878
I'm...

892
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:09,748
- I'm really sorry.
- It's not your fault.

893
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,460
No, see, when I pulled you out
of that water at the ferry, I...

894
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:13,964
You're...

895
00:40:15,274 --> 00:40:17,813
I talked to you like you were
my sister, and I shouldn't have.

896
00:40:18,705 --> 00:40:19,711
I'm an intern.

897
00:40:20,716 --> 00:40:22,864
You gotta get your medical
advice from an attending.

898
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:25,542
I asked you 'cause I trust you.

899
00:40:26,953 --> 00:40:29,957
Why don't you sit and tell me
a bedtime story or something?

900
00:40:30,868 --> 00:40:32,042
<i>What's worse,</i>

901
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:35,476
<i>new wounds,
which are so horribly painful...</i>

902
00:40:37,373 --> 00:40:39,373
Move over.
You're in the middle of the bed.

903
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:43,624
<i>Or old wounds that should've
healed years ago and never did?</i>

904
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:55,859
Am I gonna screw up this engagement?

905
00:40:58,404 --> 00:41:00,098
I don't know. Do you want to?

906
00:41:03,713 --> 00:41:04,745
I don't know.

907
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:09,386
My mom is dead.

908
00:41:12,184 --> 00:41:13,996
Yeah, she is.

909
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:18,522
<i>Maybe our old wounds teach us something.</i>

910
00:41:20,984 --> 00:41:22,838
<i>They remind us of where we've been</i>

911
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:25,147
<i>and what we've overcome.</i>

912
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:31,999
<i>They teach us lessons about
what to avoid in the future.</i>

913
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,975
<i>That's what we like to think.</i>

914
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,728
<i>But that's not the way it is, is it?</i>

915
00:41:41,728 --> 00:41:44,740
<i>Some things we just have to learn,</i>

916
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,896
<i>over and over,</i>

917
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:49,747
<i>and over again.</i>

918
00:42:07,712 --> 00:42:10,782
