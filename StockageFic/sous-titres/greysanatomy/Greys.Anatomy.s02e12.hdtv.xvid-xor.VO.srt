1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,700
Previouslyon "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,300
i'm really good in bed.
Mind-blowingly good in bed.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,300
Then he sleeps with oliviainstead of me.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm having a baby, too.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,200
Yes, i am, a little boy.

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,700
You lied to me.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,200
You'llbe a better doctor for it.

8
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,300
I'm lonely, derek.

9
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,300
I can't.

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,200
When derek broke with you,
i was there.

11
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,000
All i ever am is there for you guys,

12
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,600
and the one time i need you...

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,900
are you okay?

14
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,700
I failed the medical boards.

15
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,700
Karev, it's over, it's done.
You screwed up.

16
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,900
If i take the exam for a second time,
and i don't pass...

17
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,900
you will no longer be a surgical
resident at seattle grace.

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,100
it's an urban myth that suicide rates

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,600
spike at the holidays.

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,600
Turns out,they actually go down.

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,000
experts think

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,000
it's because people are less
inclined to off themselves

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,000
when surrounded by family.

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,200
looks like santa threw upin here.

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Just...

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,300
go with it.
We're being supportive.

27
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,600
Oh, hey!

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,700
What do you think?
Did i go too overboard?

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,500
Oh, i know. I know
sometimes i can go a little overboard.

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,900
- No, it's great.
- No, we love it.

31
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,200
I love christmas.

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,300
- We know.
- Clearly.

33
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,700
Ironically,
that same family togetherness

34
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,100
is thought to be
the reason that depression rates

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,900
actually do spikeat the holidays.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,800
yeah, okay,izzie doesn't count.

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,000
oh, i thought you might like
to help me decorate it tonight,

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,000
to mark our first christmas together.

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,200
I'm jewish.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,600
Seriously?

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
My stepfather...

42
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,700
saul rubenstein?

43
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,200
Oh. Right.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,700
Right.

45
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,200
Right.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Look at her belly.

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,200
She's almost as wideas she is tall.

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,600
Are her ankles swollen?
Is that why she's waddling?

49
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,400
What's gonna happen to us
when she goes on leave?

50
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,300
leave?
She's going on leave?

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,500
What do you think happens

52
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,500
when people push babies
out of their vaginas?

53
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,565
Do you think
we're gonna geta new resident?

54
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,500
Nah, they'll probably just
let us all wander around

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,500
unattended to see
how much damage we can do.

56
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Yeah, well,
you would know.

57
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,900
Hey, you guys,
we should all get together

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and get bailey a christmas gift
for the baby

59
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,700
or we could organize
some sort of secret santa thing.

60
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,300
Listen, tiny tim,
you cantake your...

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,900
- Secret santa sounds great, izzie.
- Okay.

62
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
We're being supportive.

63
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,500
- You okay? You seem...
- yeah.

64
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,200
You know...

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
holidays.

66
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,000
I do know.

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Tim epstein, 38,
fell offthe roof of his house.

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,100
I was stringinghannumas lights,
and a shingle came loose.

69
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,100
Hannumas?

70
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,100
Hannumas, chrismukkah.
We go all out.

71
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,000
Awesome.

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,500
He fell 12 feet.

73
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,600
The good news is,
my head broke my fall.

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,600
Uh, there areno visible deformities,

75
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,900
but he's definitely having
some focal left arm weakness.

76
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,300
He'll probably be fine.
He'salways been a little hardheaded.

77
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,600
does your head hurt when you laugh?

78
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,300
Is that a bad thing?

79
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,800
Follow my finger
with your eyes, please.

80
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,400
I know karate.

81
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,800
you know what?
Your husbandmight need a little quiet,

82
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,900
- so there's a cafeteriaright down...
- no, no, let 'em stay.

83
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,800
Pain or no,i don't wanna miss out
on the holidays with my kids.

84
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,400
Who'd like to take
mr. Epsteindown for a c. t.?

85
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,200
Stevens it is.

86
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,900
- should we have a dog?
- No dog. Come on, get a dog.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Nadia shelton, 41,
schedud for excision of her gastric ulcer.

88
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,300
Lot of good it's done us.
She's been scheduledfor three days.

89
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,600
- Mom, it's not his fault.
- Every day shegets rescheduled for some emergency.

90
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,600
We're very, very sorry
for the inconvenience.

91
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Inconvenience?

92
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
You watch your child
spend three days in pain,

93
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
and then come and
talk to me about inconvenience.

94
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,800
We get a lot of trauma
cases at the holidays.

95
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,300
Your daughter's ulcer isserious,
but it's non-emergent.

96
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,000
Is that the news?
Are you saying my wife's not important?

97
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,800
Is that what he's saying?
Is that what i'm hearing?

98
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,000
When are you taking her in?

99
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,300
Grandpa,it's not the remote.

100
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,300
We have reservations to
eat at the top of the space needle.

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,200
- We've had them for months.
- All right!

102
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,300
Dr. O'malley,prep mrs. Shelton
for her ulcer excision

103
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
- which will happen this morning.
- Thank you!

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,700
grey, karev, cover the pit.

105
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,300
You can expect
all sort sof holiday idiocy,

106
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
so that is my gift to you.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,700
Yang...

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,400
dr. Bailey,
u. n. o. s. Just called.

109
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,300
They have a donor heart
for a patient of mine.

110
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,800
Heart surgery.
I'm free. I'm totally free, right?

111
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,700
- I can do this.
- I'm free. I'm available.

112
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,900
No, you're not.
You're covering the pit.

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,500
- Yang, it's yours.
- Thank you.

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,900
Pit!

115
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,400
Damn! Heart transplant.

116
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,700
- Would've liked to have seen that
- There's always tomorrow.

117
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,400
- Yeah, maybe for you.
- Meaning?

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,300
I retake the boards tomorrow.
I'm pretty sure i'm gonna fail,

119
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,200
which makes today my last day here,

120
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,300
and i get to spend it
doing stitches in the pit.

121
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,000
So when does hanukkah fall this year?

122
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Uh, no idea.

123
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,600
Oh. Well,
if there are any more traditions

124
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,600
- you want me to be aware of...
- oh, no, burke, seriously,

125
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,400
i haven't observed religious holidays
since i was old enoughto know better.

126
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
good morning, justin.
Marion.

127
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,800
- Good morning.
- Hi, dr. Burke.

128
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
I'm here with good news,great news.

129
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,600
- You don't mean that...
- u. n. o. s. Called.

130
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,600
We have a heart.

131
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,000
Now i'll operate this morning.

132
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,500
You hear that, baby?

133
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,300
Santa claus is bringing
you a new heart for christmas.

134
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,700
Tell the fat-ass
to give it to someone else.

135
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,200
I don't want it.

136
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,700
I'm sorry, dr. Burke.
He's tired today.

137
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,900
I'm tired every day,
i hate christmas every day,

138
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,500
and i'm not having
another stupid operation.

139
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,200
Justin, i know
surgery can be frightening,

140
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
but you need this heart.

141
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,400
You've worn out your last one.

142
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,900
His last one?

143
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,500
Justin had
a heart transplant as a baby,

144
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,000
but his heart
hasn't aged as well as he has.

145
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
You understand that,justin?

146
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,900
Your heart just
can't keep up with you anymore.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,800
You need a new one.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,200
I don't care.
I don't want it.

149
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,200
Can you tell me why not?

150
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,500
Anxiety attacks,
aneurysms and ulcers.

151
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,900
Must be december.
Chief, adele just called.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,700
- Tell her i'm in...
- she knows you're notin surgery,

153
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,900
and she said to tell you,

154
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,200
we are going to
our niece's school pageant this morning.

155
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,000
You have known about it for months,

156
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,500
and after
what you pulled on thanksgiving...

157
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,300
and then she started
using a great many words

158
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,100
that i don't feel comfortable repeating.

159
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,900
- Look, i have seven surgeons on vacation.
- And there was omething about divorce.

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,700
you'll have to cover my ulcer excision.

161
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,500
Yes, sir.

162
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,500
The woman is unreasonable.

163
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,200
When did watching a 6-year-old dressed up
like a wise man become...

164
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,900
male, 44,had a gastric bypass.
Three weeks post-op.

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
Reported extreme pain
when we found him.

166
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,600
- Said something about fruitcake.
- He must have torn his abdomen wide open.

167
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,100
You're gonna have to
fight me for this one.

168
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,300
He's all yours.
My parting gift.

169
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,800
Okay, for your mom,
i got a lambswool blanket,

170
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,900
handmade in edinburgh.
It's soft, comfortable.

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,900
It says,
"don't hate mefor hurting your son,"

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,600
- except with fabric.
- Addie, you know my mom loves you.

173
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,200
No, she used to love me.

174
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,000
I've got a lot of ground
to make up for with these gifts.

175
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,900
So what do you think...
plain or plaidor both?

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,200
I don't know. Whatever, you know?

177
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,500
I thought
you love christmas shopping.

178
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm just really not in the mood
for it right now, okay?

179
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,200
Okay, well,how about french food
and scottish cataloguestonight, around 9?

180
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,000
Um, well, i guess that depends.

181
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,100
- What time do we get outta here?
- Dr. Shepherd?

182
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,700
- Yes?
- I have tim epstein'sc. t. Scans back.

183
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,600
Ah, good.

184
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,100
- What do you think?
- It's not great.

185
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,800
Honey, what do you
think of this scooter?

186
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,700
Excuse me, i need to takeher blood pressure.

187
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,700
Do you have
any questions about the surgery?

188
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,700
Apart from
when you'reactually gonna do it?

189
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,900
- We're doing it now.
- Good.

190
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,300
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

191
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,000
- Do you have any questions?
- No.

192
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,300
I've had tee bleeding
ulcersin the last five years.

193
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,600
Yeah. I hope you read the art.

194
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,000
- Yes.
- Good.

195
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,700
Dr. Bailey,
a gastricperforation just came in.

196
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,000
Damn. Uh, all right.

197
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,100
- Take mrs. Shelton backto her room.
- Seriously?

198
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,900
Do i look likei'm kidding?
Tell her we'll get to herthis afternoon.

199
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,100
Grey, call the e. r.
Tell them tosend him up, and then scrub in.

200
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,600
- Alex karev, um,failed his boards,
- and he's retaking themtomorrow.

201
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,700
He can't study
for a practicalby himself.

202
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,300
If he fails again,he's out.

203
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,200
Okay, go.

204
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,800
- O'malley.
- Yeah?

205
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,000
After you drop her off,
get backhere and scrub in.

206
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,200
All right.

207
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,500
- okay, justin...
- i told you,

208
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
i don't want the heart.
Why are you doing this?

209
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,600
'Cause you need it,
and until you're 18,

210
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,300
your mother calls all the shots.

211
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,200
My mother's a liar.
You heard her.

212
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,200
She said the heart
came from santa claus.

213
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,100
She shouldn't
get to decide anything.

214
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,500
Yeah, well,
you could make a run for it,

215
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,700
but the heart you
have won't get you very far.

216
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,400
- Are we ready?
- Just about.

217
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
How about you, buddy?
Are you ready?

218
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,300
If i die in the surgery,
can you give this heartto some other kid?

219
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,700
Not gonna happen, justin,
not on my watch.

220
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,500
Here we go.

221
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,900
- And it was only one day ofoil.
- And then what happened?

222
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,500
It lasted eight whole days andnights.
And it was a miracle.

223
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,100
- I wanted to say that part.
- Mr. Epstein, i'm sorry to interrupt.

224
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,600
You remember dr. Shepherd?

225
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,000
Um, should we talk more privately?

226
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,500
No, just tell us.
Is it bad?

227
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,700
The fall has caused
a subdural hematoma.

228
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,700
I don't even know
what that means.

229
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,800
That means your dad...
his brain is bleeding.

230
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,000
Great.

231
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,500
Look, there are
some risks to this surgery.

232
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,200
It has to happen
before the bleeding gets worse.

233
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,000
- What kind of risks?
- See, the bleed is, uh,

234
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,200
in an area of the brain that
controls the speechand the motor control.

235
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,500
We don't need an operation,okay?

236
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,700
you know, jake,i think we do.

237
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,300
- Hey, honey,you know something else?
- What?

238
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,200
We have a doctor named shepherd.

239
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,900
Shepherd.
Is that a sign from god or what?

240
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,500
Look at that.

241
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,600
Beautiful fit.

242
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Now all we have to do is
figure out why he's so angry.

243
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,000
If i had that mother,
i'd be angry, too.

244
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,400
Actually,i do have that mother.

245
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,300
Well, his mother
is not the problem here.

246
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,400
She loves him.
She never leaves.

247
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,700
She also never listens.
She doesn't know him.

248
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,000
Justin is depressed.
You heard him.

249
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,700
He doesn't wanna live.

250
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,700
I just hope he changes
his mind before it's too late.

251
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,300
Wait, what do you mean,too late?

252
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,800
With all medical realitiesbeing equal,

253
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,600
why does one patient live

254
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,200
and another dies?

255
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,500
I believe
there's a mind/body/spirit connection,

256
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,500
and if justin really
doesn't want this heart,

257
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,300
his body will reject it.

258
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,500
Okay, let me get this straight.

259
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You don't justcelebrate christmas...

260
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,900
you actually believein santa claus?

261
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,100
Dr. Yang, go and schedule
a psychiatric consult for our patient.

262
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,900
- We're... we're not done here.
- You are.

263
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,800
I don't know.
It hurts here and here and back here.

264
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,400
Any chance you
got hit by a truck and forgot about it?

265
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,000
You're judged on bedside manner,alex.

266
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,500
I wouldn't be surprised
if that's why you failedthe last time.

267
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,100
Could you be any more patronizing?

268
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,700
- I didn't ask for your help.
- Enough with the ego,you big baby.

269
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,600
I gave up a surgeryfor this.

270
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Now like i said,
it hurts here and hereand back here.

271
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,200
Oh, and this morning,
i noticed my poopwas a funny grayish color.

272
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,300
Wow. That's all
you can save of his stomach?

273
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,300
Yep. If eating is what this man lives for,

274
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,300
we should put himout of his misery.

275
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,100
- Paging dr. Karevian.
- What did you just say?

276
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,700
Just... it's a joke.

277
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,600
Kevorkian, karevian?
Alex karev?

278
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,200
I get the joke.
I just don't think it's funny.

279
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,500
You see this, o'malley?

280
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,200
I make one mistake with this scalpel,
and this man's dead.

281
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,400
My husband...
he makes mistakes at his job all the time.

282
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,300
As far as i know,
he's never killed anyone,

283
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,300
but i have,
and you will,and alex did.

284
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
He made a math mistake,
and a man died for it.

285
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,700
You run that past your accountant,

286
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,100
see how he'd feel
if every mistake he made,

287
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,400
someone ended up dead.

288
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,500
But you don't have tolike alex.

289
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,900
You don't haveto care about him.

290
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,100
But you damn well
have to be on his side.

291
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,400
Hold that.

292
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,600
what a great family.
Hannumas. Chrismukkah.

293
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,500
And how cute are those kids?

294
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,400
Really, dr. Stevens?
Chrismukkah?

295
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,900
I think it's sweet.

296
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,400
Do you happen to knowwhat time of year
neurosurgeons are the busiest,dr. Stevens?

297
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,100
No, there's a time of year?
Well,there's no hard or fast rule,

298
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,800
but brain injuries tend
to pile up around the holidays,

299
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,300
like our friend here.

300
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,300
Folks fall off their roofs
while they string up lights,

301
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,000
or they go skating for
the first time in a decade

302
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,100
and break their heads open.
And every year,people drive through blizzards

303
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,400
to get to parties where
they kiss germ-infected strangers

304
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,300
under poisonous mistletoe,

305
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,500
and then they get so drunk
that they smash their heads

306
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,400
through their windshield
on their way home.

307
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,900
Like i said,

308
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,800
there's nohard or fast rule.

309
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,900
- Does this hurt, mrs. Grey?
- Yes, doctor.

310
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,200
- How about here?Does it hurt here?
- Yes, it does.

311
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Okay, seriously,if you're that lonely,
there are excellent vibrators.

312
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,600
- I can give you catalog.
- He failed his boards. I'm helpinghim study.

313
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,900
- You failed your practical?
- Glad to knowyou keep a secret, grey.

314
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,700
I kept your secret.
It didn't do you any good.

315
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,100
- He needs our help.
- Oh, you're not serious.

316
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,300
- What if that were you?
- It wouldn't be.

317
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,700
Well, what if it were?

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
- It wouldn't be.
- I have to go.

319
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,900
- Be a patient. Do it for me.
- Fine, but when tiny tim

320
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,800
goes all norman bates on us,
i'm blaming you.

321
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,200
- Diagnosis?
- Gallstones. Yes.

322
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
i'm a 55-year-old man.
I'm nauseousand i can't stop throwing up.

323
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,900
Forget it, all right?
I didn'task for anybody's help.

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,200
Okay, evil spawn,
you can nurse your pride,

325
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,600
like you were being a nurse,
or you can pass your test

326
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,300
and be a doctor. Up to you.

327
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,000
- Any abdominal pain?
- Yes, from my giant

328
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,500
fat belly all the way to my back.

329
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,300
Oh, and i'm drunk. Hiccup, hiccup.

330
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,000
I got another one for you.

331
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,900
He tried to gift
wrapa 70-inch tv for his wife?

332
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,800
- Hernia?
- Strangulated. Pretty ugly.

333
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,600
Well, you just
know the wife hates tv.

334
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,600
- Grey, is that otherprojt covered?
- I think so.

335
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
Then scrub in.

336
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,700
O'malley, go tell nadia shelton

00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,600

344
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,900
- Sir, could you please tell yourson...
- don't talk to me about my son.

345
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,600
Who the hell do you think you are?

346
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,400
I'm really sorry.
I think that your wife should rest.

347
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,500
- I'm listening here!
- I can't gochristmas shopping with my daughter.

348
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,000
You people have ruinedeverything.

349
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
I hope you're happy.

350
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,200
I'm very sorry.

351
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,400
"I'm very sorry. "
that cutsit here, doc. Thanks a lot.

352
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,500
Yeah, okay, you're really grabbing me now.
That's assault.

353
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,100
This... is an exam pat.

354
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,500
What... what the hell?
Does izzie know?

355
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,000
Does burke know about this?

356
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,000
Unbunch your panties, george.
We're helping alex study. Do it.

357
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,900
I can't hear you
when his hand is on your boob.

358
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,000
Take your handoff my boob, alex.

359
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,700
Thank you.

360
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,000
- Study for what?
- Shut it, yang.

361
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,800
- Alex failed his boards.
- Seriously?

362
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,800
I failed one part of one board.
That's it.

363
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,100
Still,that's pretty embarrassing.

364
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,900
Eh! He's all yours, georgie.
Do your worst.

365
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,200
You're not giving me a rectal.

366
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,100
Do not ask me to cough.

367
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
You page me?

368
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,000
I didn't see
a psych consultscheduled here.

369
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,400
I couldn't get one.
I tried to,

370
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,700
but they told meto come back in january.

371
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,700
You disrespected me.

372
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,600
You mocked me in my o. r.
That can't happen.

373
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,400
I...

374
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,500
it won't happen again.
You equated my spirituality

375
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,100
- with a belief in santa claus.
- Burke, science isthe one thing, you know?

376
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
It's the one thingwe have in common.

377
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,900
I'm an intern. You're not.
I'm a slob,and you're not.

378
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,800
I say i wanna keep
our relationship private,

379
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,000
and you go and
tell the chief of surgery

380
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,200
and you ask meto move in with you,
and now you're religious.

381
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,600
Spiritual.
There's a difference.

382
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,500
Well, not to me.

383
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,100
I don't knowwhat we're doing.

384
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Well, right now we're working.

385
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,600
Page meif he spes a fever.

386
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,400
Tell mrs. Davison to
hire a private therapist or a priest

387
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,300
anyone justin would talk to.

388
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,100
Mrs. Epstein?

389
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,500
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

390
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,200
- He's stilla little groggy, but...
- my dad wants to see me now,okay?

391
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,700
- Okay. Come on in.
- Okay.

392
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
- We have to run, run, run fast.
- Yeah, let's run, run, run.

393
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,500
Let's run and see daddy.

394
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,800
It's okay, guys.
Daddy's okay.

395
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Daddy! Daddy!
I could kiss it better,daddy.

396
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,800
Jillian, i have a headache.

397
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,100
- I'll sing for you, daddy.
- No.

398
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,200
no, leah. Damn it, leah, shut up!

399
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
I can't standthat insipid song!

400
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,700
- Tim!
- Just get out! Get out!

401
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,000
Get the hell out of here,all of you!

402
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,100
You stupid shepherd,
you brokemy dad's brain!

403
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,100
how did that happen?
I mean, his personality...

404
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,900
you didn't go
any where nearthe frontal lobe.

405
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,500
Well, the c. t.
Might havemissed something,

406
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,600
or the personality change could be
a reactionfrom the anesthesiawearing off.

407
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,200
- It could be the pain.
- He was in painbefore the surgery.

408
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,000
Watch himfor a couple hours.
If he doesn't improve,get a new c. t. Okay.

409
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,300
Dr. Stevens?

410
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,700
You had his brain open,literally open.

411
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,600
He was laying there
unconscious and vulnerable...

412
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,100
and you think i poisoned him
with my antl-holiday venom?

413
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,400
Well, you're the one
that's always saying

414
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,000
there's a lot about the brain
that we don't know.

415
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,100
How do you know
that your words didn't speak to him

416
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,900
on some unconscious level?
I mean, he trusted youto be his shepherd.

417
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,400
Dr. Stevens,
you should be a little embarrassed.

418
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,300
- I am.
- Good.

419
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Oh, this is the c. c. u.
There are no trees allowedin the c. c. u.

420
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,800
I know, but it's
neverreally been enforced, so...

421
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,900
how's he doing?

422
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,400
Uh, surgery went smoothly,
but it's too soon to tell.

423
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,100
He's really a good boy,you know?

424
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,200
You just met himat a difficult time.

425
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,000
He's been down.
I don't know why,

426
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,800
but father michael
will be able to talk to him.

427
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,900
No offense,but

428
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,400
your son doesn't seem
to be a fan of the holidays.

429
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,800
He doesn't believe in santa.

430
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Yes, well,

431
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,100
a mother's job is to protec
ther child's innocence,

432
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,800
and this christmas
could be his last time, so...

433
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,700
that's what you said last year

434
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,700
and the year before that.

435
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,300
Baby, you're awake!

436
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,200
You look great!

437
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,100
My big, strong boy.
Santa ought you backto me.

438
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,600
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, c. c. u. Regulations.

439
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,700
- Are we using mesh?
- Yes, the conjoined tendonis...

440
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
Dr. Bailey?

441
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,300
Just wouldn't want to throw upin the body cavity.

442
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,400
Dr. Bailey, are you all right? Mnh.

443
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,200
- Do you need...
- i just... i need a minute, grey.

444
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,500
Oh, when you operate,
the rest of e worldgoes away...

445
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
hunger, thirst, pain.

446
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
You don't feel itin the o. r.,

447
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,500
but it's not that way

448
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,300
when you're sharing your body
with another person.

449
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Okay.

450
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,900
Deaver retractor.

451
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,200
Are you sureyou don't want me
to go find someoneto take over for you?

452
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,700
What i want you to find
meis a strawberry milkshake,extra thick.

453
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,800
- Seriously?
- Yeah, nausea comeswith the hunger, grey.

454
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,200
Go.

455
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,700
My throat... it's, like, wicked sore, yo!

456
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,000
Plus, i goall thesesick breakouts, right?

457
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,400
Dude, seriously...

458
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,000
all right, all right,
sit down, sit down.

459
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,400
Open up your mouth.
I'd like to inspectyour tonsils.

460
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,500
What's wrong with you?
Are you sick?

461
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
Fix it.

462
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,400
I failedmy practical board exam.

463
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,100
O'malley's helping me study.

464
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,600
You failed your...

465
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,500
- you're helping him?
- Just to study, nothing else! Izzie...

466
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,700
no, you don't getto say my name,
and you are unbelievable!

467
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,200
I was doing mono,
the wholefever and glands thing.

468
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,500
The acne was just part
of the whole teenager thing.

469
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,400
- Izzie, would you wait?
- I say i like the guy,

470
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,100
and you can't stop hating him.

471
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,100
- Izzie, you...
- and assoon as he screws me ov...

472
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,500
- izzie...
- you're his new best friend.

473
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,700
He failed his boards.
This is important.

474
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,500
- He cheated on me!
- Busted?

475
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,900
- Yeah, i'm busted.
- His exam is tomorrow.

476
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,400
You're in on this, too?
He cheated on me, god!

477
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,800
Told you she'd find out.
Oh,of course you're in on this.

478
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,400
She let him touch her boobs! Oh!

479
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,300
He cheated on me with
george's skanky syph nurse!

480
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,500
- That is just plain rude!
- We know he cheated on you.

481
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,100
That's why we let you turn the
living room into santa's freakin' village.

482
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
- What?
- We're not big on holidays!

483
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,700
You know that,
but we'retrying to be supportive,

484
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,400
because you're havinga hard time.

485
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,000
But right now, alex,
he's having a harder time.

486
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,100
Why does everybody care
whatkind of time alex is having?

487
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,000
Because he'sdirty uncle sal.

488
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,200
- You lost me.
- Sorry, what?

489
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,800
He's dirty uncle sal,

490
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,300
the one who embarrasses
everyoneat family reunions

491
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,600
and who can't be left alone
with the teenage girls,

492
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,900
but you invite him
to the picnic anyway.

493
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,900
- I'm still lost.
- Sorry, what?

494
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,900
I have a mother
who doesn't recognize me.

495
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,700
As far as family goes,
this hospital,you guys are it,

496
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,100
so i knowyou're pissed at alex,

497
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,400
but maybe you could try
to help him anyway,

498
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,700
sort of like in the spiritof this holiday
you keep shovingdown everybody's throats.

499
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
You...

500
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,100
- what?
- Boob?

501
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,800
- Somebody get in here!
- Doctor!Get in here now!

502
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,800
- Get in here! Where is he?
- Do something!

503
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,200
Do something, doctor!
I'm takingyou to surgery.

504
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,500
Prep her now.

505
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,200
- It's about time.
- Sorry. I got sidetracked.

506
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,900
Nadia shelton'sulcer perforated.
She's vomiting bloodby the pint.

507
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,000
- Is the chief back?
- Haven't seen him. -No.

508
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,900
All right, uh,both of you scrub in.
I'm gonna needall the help i can get.

509
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
well, there it is...

510
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,600
left side of his frontal lobe.

511
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,000
Now why didn'twe see that before?

512
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,100
Intracerebral bleeds
can havea delayed presentation.

513
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,000
Right.
You wantto get him out of there?

514
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,300
Uh, just prep an o. r.
I'm gonna talk to his wife.

515
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,900
Dr. Stevens.
Nice talking to you.

516
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
Think she'll ever talkto me again?

517
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,100
Okay, am i invisible?
I'm feeling strangely invisible.

518
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,700
- Also inaudible.
- What?

519
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,300
Another surgery?
So i guess dinner-shoppingis out?

520
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,100
Yeah, it's not gonnahappen tonight.

521
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
- Sorry.
- No, you're not.

522
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,500
I'm just trying to
figure out why you're not.

523
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,100
- It's christmas, derek.
- Yeah,

524
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,700
i know.
It's our season!What's going on?

525
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,400
Are you mad?
Are you depressed, what?

526
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,300
No. Mr. Epstein hereis depressed.
He's bleedingfrom his frontal lobe.

527
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,900
Everything's fine. We're fine, addie.
You know, just... i'll see you at home, okay?

528
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,600
You need a second surgery,mr. Epstein.

529
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,400
The frontal lobeis difficult.

530
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,000
We may be ableto improve things,but, uh,

531
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,700
you should be prepared for the possibility
that things could get worse.

532
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,600
That's great,that's just great.

533
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,400
I am so gladwe came to this hospital,
so i could be treatedby a bunch of quacks

534
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,100
who don't know their asses
from the inside of my skull!

535
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,300
This isn't my husband.
This is not my husband.

536
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,000
He doesn't speak to methis way.
He doesn't speak toanyonethis way.

537
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
I know this is difficult,mrs. Epstein,

538
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,300
but the important thingright now
is that we stop the bleeding.

539
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,600
Look,he's the love of my life.

540
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
And i know that you have
a lot of other patients

541
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,600
and you doa lot of other surgeries,

542
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,900
but he's the loveof my life.

543
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Just...

544
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,700
i just need your wordthat you'll
treat this changein my husband's personality

545
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,400
as seriouslyas you would fatal cancer,

546
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,700
because that's the waythis feels to me and my kids.

547
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,800
And we're happy.
We're a happy family.

548
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,800
It just...
if you could just fix it...

549
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,800
just fix it.

550
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,200
Mrs. Epstein,i'm gonna do
everythingin my power,all right?

551
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,700
Okay?

552
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,400
I didn't want it.
I already got one new heart.

553
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,900
I didn't deserve another one.

554
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,400
Justin, you don't haveto feel
guilty about having a new heart.

555
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,000
God wants you to live.
That's why he sent youthe heart.

556
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,200
I'm not stupid, okay?
God didn't send me the heart,

557
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,500
- and there's no suchthing as god.
- Justin!

558
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,900
Marion, marion.

559
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,100
It's all right.

560
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,200
The heart i have now...

561
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,100
my mom told me the heartcame from santa.

562
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,000
I thought elves made itin their factory

563
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,100
or whatever,
but that's not true,is it?

564
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,300
- No, it isn't.
- Yeah.

565
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,300
I heard the nurses talking.

566
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,000
Where it really came from
is some other kid.

567
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,600
Some other kid had to die
so i could live.

568
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,800
Justin... baby...

569
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,300
and theni outgrew that kid's heart.

570
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,700
So for the last two years
my mom has been praying

571
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,400
that another kidwould die for me.

572
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,400
That's what you pray forall the time,
isn't it, mom?

573
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,800
How does god feel about that?

574
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,700
- Justin, justin... justin?
- justin, baby?

575
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,500
Wake up, justin!

576
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,600
Nurse!
Move, please!No, no, no!

577
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,300
- Code blue!
- Please, justin!

578
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,300
Just stay back.

579
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,500
Dear god, please!
Justin, baby,i'm right here!

580
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,100
- Justin, i love you, baby!
- Please shut her up!

581
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
He's in v-fib.

582
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,100
Charge the paddles to 100.
- Charge. Clear.

583
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,500
can you get him back
on the donor's list?

584
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,200
- I mean, if it's a bad heart.
- It's not a bad heart.

585
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,500
Well, can you get him back on the list?

586
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,100
He's waited two yearsfor this heart.
He has to fight for it.

587
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,800
- He has to decide he wants tolive.
- Okay, medically speaking,

588
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,800
is there anything else
we haven't talked about?

589
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
The way you're feelingright now...

590
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
it's why i have to believe
in something bigger in me.

591
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,100
Because if i didn't,
that powerlessnesswould eat me alive.

592
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,900
Drill, please.

593
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,400
Any danger with two
craniotomiesin one day?

594
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,700
No more than with one.

595
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,000
- Is there any music?
- Any requests?

596
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,000
Christmas carolsor hanukkah.

597
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,300
Is there such a thing
as hanukkah carols

598
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,300
the brain is a my
sterious thing,dr. Stevens.

599
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,700
You ner know what
may penetrate the psyche.

600
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,500
- whoa, look at that.
- kissing ulcers. One's perf.

601
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,900
The other one is bleeding.

602
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,500
Two ulcers.
I'm not surprisedwith that family.

603
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,700
I should've thrown them out.
Why didn't i throw them out?

604
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,100
That's whati should have done.
I don't know why i didn't.

605
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,600
Stop whining, o'malley.
You had your chance.

606
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,200
You didn't take it. Move on.

607
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,900
Right, sorry.

608
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,600
- Do not kick me!
- Excuse me?

609
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,400
Are you kicking me
under the table, o'malley?

610
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,600
- No!
- Then clearlyi wasn't talking to you.

611
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,200
You cannot kick me
while i'm doing my job.

612
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,100
Thank you.

613
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,700
wake up!

614
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,100
God, no wonderyou failed your boards.
What, do you expect to learnthis stuff by osmosis?

615
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,600
What are you doing here?

616
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm a farmer, okay?
I've been drooling and pukingand crapping my pants.

617
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,900
- You came hereto help me study?
- Well, i'm not actuallycrapping my pants now, am i?

618
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,300
Well, why would you want
to help me after what i did?

619
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,200
Because it's what jesuswould freakin' do!

620
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,000
you know, i don't believe
in santa either, justin,or god.

621
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,000
I believe in medicine,

622
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,000
and it's a medical
miracleyou're alive.

623
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,200
With the heart you had,
you should have...

624
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,100
you should have died
about two weeksafter you were born,

625
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,900
except some surgeonfigured out
a way to give yousomeone else's heart,

626
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,500
which is so much coolerthan santa.

627
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,400
so i'm just saying

628
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
i think you should decideto live,

629
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
live so you can becomea doctor,

630
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,800
and you can find a way to do heart
transplantswithout someonehaving to die.

631
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,700
Or you know,live so you can grow up
and have kidsand u know what?

632
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,500
Raise them not to believein santa.

633
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,700
Now that would pissyour mom off.

634
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,700
just decide to live.

635
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,200
Because in your case,

636
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,900
dying really isn'tthe best revenge.

637
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,400
- How is she?
- Is she gonna be all right?

638
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,400
She lost a lot of blood,

639
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,000
but we were able to
replace itand repair the tear.

640
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,200
She's gonna require
several days' observation,

641
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,500
but she should havea full recovery.

642
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,800
- Oh, thank god.
- Thank god is right.

643
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,200
'Cause we're certainly not gonna thank you.

644
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,700
We should sue youfor all you're worth.

645
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,600
We sat here and sat here
ansat here and sat here...

646
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,000
you want to help me out?

647
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,100
- Really?
- And watched you takepatient after patient...

648
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,600
you got your second chan.
Just don't screw it up.

649
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,700
...while you made my daughter
wait for three whole daysfor her operation!

650
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,600
I should sue you
and this whole damn hospital!

651
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,900
Okay, yeah,you could sue us,
or you could just considerthe possibility

652
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,700
- of just shutting the hell up.
- What did you say to me?

653
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,400
- Did you hear what he said to me?
- I heard him!

654
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,400
- You can't talk to an old ladylike that.
- Where is my daughter?

655
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,200
- I'd like to see her.
- Well, you can't.

656
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,300
I'm her doctor.
She is my patient,and this is a hospital,

657
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,700
which is the kind of place
where people can generally use

658
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,100
a little peace and quiet,
so no, right nowyou can't see her.

659
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,000
And i am not saying this
because you just threatenedto sue dr. Bailey,

660
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,900
who spentthe last several hourssaving
your daughter's life,saving your wife's life.

661
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,100
I am saying this
because she is my patient,

662
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,900
and she isin the recovery wing
of this hospitaltrying to recover,

663
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:19,100
and visiting hours are over,
so good nightand merry christmas.

664
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Interns. Too emotional.

665
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,500
My apologies.

666
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,200
Um, is the nausea constant
or intermittent?

667
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,100
Constant.

668
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,000
When...

669
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,100
when did it first start?

670
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,100
After i workedin the fields all day.

671
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,200
Do you have any allergies
you're aware of?

672
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,800
No.

673
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,900
Izzie...

674
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,500
i never wanted to hurt you.

675
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,400
You didn't hurt me.

676
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,200
I don't even know you.
I'm a farmer.

677
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,800
You... you're still the patient?

678
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,000
What does it look like?

679
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,000
It's organophosphates,
pesticide poisoning.

680
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,800
Crying's a symptom.
That's it, right?

681
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,500
Right.

682
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,000
You okay?

683
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,900
Yeah, yeah.

684
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,700
- You know, holidays.
- Yeah.

685
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,600
I do know.

686
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,000
- Merry christmas.
- Merry christmas.

687
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Hey. Christmas double scotch,single malt.

688
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,200
You're a good man.

689
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,700
hey, dr. Shepherd.

690
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
Dr. Shepherd.

691
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,400
so...
how's mr. Epstein'sfrontal lobe?

692
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,700
He woke up smiling.

693
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,200
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

694
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,300
What are you drinking?

695
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,400
- It's hot buttered rum. It's delicious.
- It's dickensian.

696
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,200
Oh, well, yeah,it is christmas.

697
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,100
Christmas, derek. We love christmas.

698
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,000
At least we used to.

699
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,300
Christmas makes you want
to bewith people you love.

700
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,000
I'm not saying thisto hurt you

701
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,600
or because i want to leave you,
because i don't.

702
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,600
Meredith wasn't a fling.

703
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,700
She wasn't revenge.

704
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,400
I fell in love with her.

705
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,200
That doesn't go away because
i decided to stay with you.

706
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,500
There's an old proverb
that says you can't chooseyour family.

707
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,700
you take what the fateshand you.

708
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,700
and like them or not,love them or not

709
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,800
understand them or not...

710
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,500
justin took a turn.
His fever's down,and his b. p. Is up.

711
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,100
i wonder whatgot through to him.

712
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,800
i don't know.

713
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,200
...you cope.

714
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,100
Pretty.

715
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,200
Yeah.

716
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,800
Then there'sthe school of thought
that says the familyyou're born into

717
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,300
- is simply a starting point.
- What are we doing?

718
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,800
Lights.

719
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,500
they feed youand clothe you
and take care of you

720
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,300
until you're ready
to go out into the world...

721
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,600
...and find your tribe.
