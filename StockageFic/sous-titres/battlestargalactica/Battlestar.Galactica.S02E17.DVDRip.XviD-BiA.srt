You have to stay.

and run for President

I know it's hard,
but it's the only way.

Word of Fisk's murder
has spread out
through the entire fleet.

A crew can fall apart when
their commander is killed.

in a matter of weeks.

I'm putting Garner in command.

11
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:54,699
But he's an engineer,
not a command officer.

12
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:56,030
He's the best they got.

so much EMl, even the dradis
is barely working.

00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:37,227
Well, I'm gonna put
a little distance
between us and the fleet.

00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:41,095
Get us out of this soup,
see if we can get
a cleaner dradis picture.

But Cottle's given me
the thumbs-up,

00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:12,299
and it's been almost a month,
so I guess it's back to work.

one of the containers and then
one of the crates shifted.

something was moving.

perhaps if you were actually
down on the flight deck

and monitoring your Raptors,
the way any training officer
worth a damn would have done,

107
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,582

of our pilots were missing.

in a training mission,

when the Commander
throws it in my face?

that discussing
flight deck situations

That problem's name
is Kara Thrace.

I know how to handle her, sir.

128
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:22,205
And for the record, she is
one hell of a Viper pilot.

129
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:25,355
What, I should cut her
some slack because
she's good in the cockpit,

130
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:27,016
is that what you're saying?

131
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,251
Because nobody ever cut us
any slack in the engine room.

132
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:33,531
I can tell you that right now.

133
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:38,981
But then, I don't know, maybe
being a snipe is different
than being a Viper jockey.

134
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,225
No flashy stunts for us.

135
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:43,661
No flying by the seat
of our pants down there.

136
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:46,923
The engine room is like
a finely-tuned watch,

137
00:08:46,923 --> 00:08:49,611
and everything in it
needs to be monitored
and maintained

138
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:52,011
in a very precise fashion.

at the proper time,

in the proper order.

142
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:02,355
Or there'd be no power,
no lights,

00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:05,191
no hot showers
for your flyboys.

144
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:10,124
You know, Major, I think some
of the people around here

145
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:14,093
could learn a thing or two
from the snipes.

146
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:24,220
I'm sorry, Madam President,
but it's that time.

00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:25,704

putting it off for weeks.

election coming up,

not to run.

I'm gonna be perfectly
honest with you, Tory.

153
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,142
I've thought about it
a few times,

154
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:40,010
but, no, I'm still here.

155
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,739
There's so much to do, so

156
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:45,930

157
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,056
Great.

158
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,217
Here are the results from
our first fleet-wide poll.

159
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:54,091
How did you manage this?

160
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:57,194
I was precinct captain
for the Federalist Party

161
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:59,389
in Delphi for five years.

162
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:02,979
We did polls to see what the
mayor should have for lunch.

163
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:06,122
For what it's worth,
you've managed to walk
a very fine line.

164
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:09,706
Your presidential bid has the
support of both the military
and the civilian fleet,

165
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:11,690
and you've received
enthusiastic endorsements

166
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,317
from the Gemenese
religious leaders.

167
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:17,829
Well, it helps when
your only real rival
is a convicted terrorist.

168
00:10:20,363 --> 00:10:23,526
Am I capable
of leading this fleet?

169
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:26,320
Absolutely.

170
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,042
And for a time,
I almost had a chance,

171
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,510
until Laura Roslin ascended
from politician to prophet.

172
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:39,762
The truth is, I can't win.

173
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:42,651
But you could.

174
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:46,042
You flatter me,
Mr. Zarek, really,

175
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:48,203
but I'm not sure I'm cut out
for a life in politics,

176
00:10:48,203 --> 00:10:51,832
as I find the vice-presidency
and everything to do with it
very tedious.

177
00:10:53,162 --> 00:10:56,714
I would imagine carrying water
for Roslin would get
old after a time,

178
00:10:56,714 --> 00:11:00,445
but it's the office
that makes you
the perfect candidate, Doctor.

179
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,015
You're pre-sold.

180
00:11:03,755 --> 00:11:05,017
Really?

181
00:11:06,027 --> 00:11:07,187
To whom?

182
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:12,488
You'd be surprised how many
people crave the assurances
of cold science

183
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:17,046
as opposed to
the superstitious ravings
of the Gemenese.

184
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:20,450
As a scientist,
you offer hope.

185
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:23,118
Think about it.

186
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:26,565
And you, Tom?

187
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:30,726
You'll just step aside,
will you?

188
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:35,412
I'm just happy to back
a man of true conviction.

189
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:39,810
A man who remembers
his friends.

190
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:47,560
CASE: Attention on deck.

191
00:11:49,035 --> 00:11:50,229
APOLLO: At ease.

192
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:53,909
Where's Stinger?

193
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:56,330
He's in hack
for mouthing off to Garner.

194
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,186
Stepped on his
precious little toes.

195
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:59,346
Frakking Garner.

196
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,928
(ALL LAUGHlNG)

197
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:02,428
STARBUCK: He's such an idiot.
He's just...

198
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:04,201
All right, lock that up!

199
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:06,454
Get something straight.

200
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:10,346
We got two missing Raptor
crews who are gonna be
out of oxygen in 36 hours.

201
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:12,314
That's all that matters.

202
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:16,761
So everyone knock off
the schoolyard crap and start
doing your frakking jobs.

203
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:21,645
Now, we need to start
thinking outside the box.

204
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,357
Which is supposed to be
what you do best.

205
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:28,995
Sorry, Major.

206
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:30,163
All right.

207
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:31,414
I wanna know everything
there is to know

208
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:33,061
about these missing Raptors
and their crews.

209
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:36,194
I wanna know personal
quirks, aircraft squawks,
wireless transmissions,

210
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:38,647
anything that might help.

211
00:12:40,202 --> 00:12:41,863
Good. Get to it.

212
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:52,691
How is she?

213
00:12:52,747 --> 00:12:55,434
Rya's four months pregnant
and doesn't wanna be.

214
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:59,530
I understand the Gemenese have
a problem with women
terminating their pregnancies.

215
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,624
Tyrol said that she asked
for you by name.

216
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:06,796
Do you want to tell me
what that's really all about?

217
00:13:06,858 --> 00:13:09,834
Pretty straightforward,
really. I get a note that
a girl is on the way,

218
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:12,564
she arrives, I do my work,
and she leaves.

219
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:14,666
I don't ask
a lot of questions.

220
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,031
You're gonna start.

221
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:19,112
I wanna talk to her.

222
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,271
I'm Admiral Adama.

223
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:30,728
Don't worry,
I've just come to talk.

224
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:34,653
It doesn't matter
what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.

225
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,290
Your parents are a little
worried about you.

226
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:45,364
They've contacted me
through the Gemenon
representative.

227
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:47,484
My parents?

228
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:49,460
Oh, gods.

229
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:54,014
Do you have any idea
what they would do to me?

230
00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:58,885
Please, do not send me back.

231
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:05,489
You're a stowaway
aboard a military ship.

232
00:14:05,674 --> 00:14:09,405
COTTLE: Some people might say
she was a victim
of political persecution.

233
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,882
Hell, she could
apply for asylum.

234
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:25,332
Asylum.

235
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:29,569
That's it. I want asylum.

236
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,962
Under Gemenon law,
the girl is still
the property of her parents,

237
00:14:41,962 --> 00:14:44,746
and they can deal with her
once she's safely back
on her ship.

238
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:46,891
To be honest,
I'm more concerned

239
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:48,778
with the broader implications
of this matter.

240
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:49,767
Sarah.

241
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:51,722
I know you don't
wanna hear this,

242
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:54,698
but my people, my voters,
are demanding action
on this issue.

243
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:56,723
We have been through this.

244
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,658
Abortion was legal
under Colonial law
before the attacks,

245
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:01,819
and so it is still
legal today.

246
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,333
It's obscene.

247
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,626
The scriptures view abortion
as an abomination
in the eyes of the gods.

248
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:09,093
You cannot equivocate
on this point

249
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:11,589
if you want our support
in the coming election.

250
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:18,871
Rya Kibby's petition
for asylum is under review.

251
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:21,807
Thank you, Sarah,
very much, for coming in.

252
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:35,573
I'm not turning that girl
over. I'm certainly not
banning abortion.

253
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,055
TORY: Then don't.

254
00:15:37,514 --> 00:15:40,394
But we have to move
aggressively on this thing.

255
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:42,922
I'm gonna arrange a conference
call with you and the Quorum,

256
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:44,947
or this is gonna get
out of hand, fast.

257
00:15:49,194 --> 00:15:50,889
She's not Billy.

258
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:53,022
No, she's not.

259
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,907
(ADAMA SlGHS)

260
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:07,824
What?

261
00:16:08,714 --> 00:16:10,409
I hate to say this

262
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,197
because I know that
this is a political issue.

263
00:16:17,482 --> 00:16:21,782
The fact is, that number
doesn't go up very often.

264
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,539
I have fought for a woman's
right to control her body
my entire career.

265
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:42,087
No.

266
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,199
No.

267
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:48,428
I'm just remembering
what you said
right after the Cylon attack.

268
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:53,594
That if we really wanna
save the human race,

269
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:56,512
we better start having babies.

270
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:06,442
Nothing, nothing,
and more nothing.

271
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:13,996
Where is Shark's
last transmission?

272
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:16,780
Well, there's not much there.

273
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:25,450
"Eve, distress,
bearing, wreck,

00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,475
"shuns, emerge, read."

275
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:30,251
They're in distress.

276
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:33,537
They give a bearing
requesting instructions,

277
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:35,810
"It's an emergency.
Can you read?"

278
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:38,986
Maybe. But what's this
"eve" fragment here?

279
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:42,547
"Eve, distress."
"Eve, distress."

281
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:53,778

Received distress call.

283
00:18:00,874 --> 00:18:02,432
Okay. From who?

284
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:04,654
I don't know.

285
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,700
But maybe that's where
they went, to go find out.

286
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:13,002
APOLLO: Commander, Captain
Thrace has a theory about
our missing Raptors, sir.

287
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:15,498
That's good,
considering she lost them.

288
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:16,692
Excuse me?

289
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:18,890
Well, they were out
on one of your so-called
training missions,

290
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,914
weren't they, Captain?

291
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:21,706
My "so-called"
training missions.

292
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:22,968
Okay, let's just
take this easy.

293
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:25,514
That's when you're not
boozing or sowing mutiny
amongst the crew.

294
00:18:25,514 --> 00:18:26,606
Mutiny.

295
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:28,328
Commander, we should take this
to a private place.

296
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,197
Don't you think I know what's
happening on my own ship?

297
00:18:32,682 --> 00:18:35,048
"Barely competent
and paranoid."

298
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:39,579
That was off the record.
I was just venting.

299
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:41,546
Accurately.

300
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,512
I'll have you court-martialed.

301
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,602
Commander, I'm not defending
Captain Thrace's behavior...

302
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:47,660
Thanks, Major.

303
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,659
Captain Thrace,
you're restricted to quarters

304
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,970
until I can ship you back
to Galactica.

305
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,030
You're Adama's pet.
Let him deal with you.

306
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:01,543
Major?

307
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:02,567
Sir.

308
00:19:14,858 --> 00:19:18,026
You've been onboard less than
four days and you're
already facing charges.

309
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:19,493
You don't waste any time,
do you?

310
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:21,090
Neither do you, Lee.

311
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:23,191
How's it feel being
Garner's new playmate?

312
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,700
I'm here to do a job.

313
00:19:24,714 --> 00:19:29,014
Yeah, keep a loudmouth,
disobedient, frak-up
Kara Thrace in line.

314
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,648
Not doing such a good job,
are you?

315
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:33,148
Evidently not.

316
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,522
We don't have much time,
those guys are running
out of air.

317
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:38,490
Yeah, well, I tried,
all right?

318
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:41,802
All I have done since I got
to The Beast is try and help,

319
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:43,882
and all I've gotten is
Garner's foot in my ass.

320
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,873
Well, maybe you need
a kick in the ass!

321
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,720
All right.

322
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:53,133
Here we go, finally.

323
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:55,466
What is your problem, anyway?

324
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:58,731
What's my problem?
What's my problem?

325
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,378
Well, Kara, my problem is you.
You keep frakking up,

326
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:03,902
and I keep having
to clean it up,

327
00:20:03,914 --> 00:20:05,882
and I am officially
sick of it.

328
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:09,254
Poor Lee, your life
is so hard, isn't it?

329
00:20:09,322 --> 00:20:10,914
You mean since I got shot?

330
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,120
You wanna hear what I think
happened to Buster or not?

331
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:50,922
Pegasus, Red Devil.
I'm nearing
the last coordinates

332
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:52,583
where our Raptors
went missing.

333
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,713
SHARK: (ON RADlO)
Repeat, emer...

334
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:56,408
There are...

335
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:58,442
RED DEVlL:
Buster, is that you?

336
00:20:58,442 --> 00:21:01,878
This is Red Devil, man.
Is that you, buddy?
Come back to me.

337
00:21:02,282 --> 00:21:05,774
SHARK: (ON RADlO)
Out of power.
Oxygen almost out.

338
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:08,390
By the gods, help!

339
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:14,922
Sir, one of our search Raptors
just picked a possible
distress signal

340
00:21:14,922 --> 00:21:17,865
from near where Pegasus
lost communications
with Buster's ship.

341
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:18,854
Finally.

342
00:21:21,674 --> 00:21:26,077
A possible distress signal.
There's a theory that Buster
himself might have jumped away

343
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:29,247
to run down
a phony distress call.
It could be a trap.

344
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,362
A theory?
Is this your theory, Major?

345
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:34,728
This is Captain Thrace's
theory, is it not?

346
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:40,650
Mr. Thornton, can you give us
a fix on where this distress
signal is coming from?

347
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,922
Yes, sir, it's long range,
over 40 SU away.

348
00:21:42,922 --> 00:21:45,254
Then spin up the FTL drive
and prepare to jump the ship.

349
00:21:45,257 --> 00:21:46,451
Yes, sir.

350
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:52,595
Sir, this isn't just
Captain Thrace's theory.

351
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:54,823
I think this is a Cylon trap,
and...

352
00:21:54,826 --> 00:21:56,487
And I disagree.

353
00:21:57,546 --> 00:21:59,946
Now get Admiral Adama
on the line.

354
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:02,295
I'm going to get our men.

355
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:13,994
Admiral, we've finally got
the break we've been
looking for,

356
00:22:13,994 --> 00:22:15,427
a bearing on
the distress signal.

357
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,095
I can jump there
inside of two minutes.

358
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:19,589
Commander, believe me,
I understand how you feel.

359
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:22,826
The Cylons have been known
to lure our ships into traps

360
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:24,906
using fake distress calls.

361
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:26,168
Have you considered that?

362
00:22:26,185 --> 00:22:29,226
We have, sir. It's a scenario
we don't think likely.

363
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:30,318
We?

364
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:34,257
Major Adama, do you concur?

365
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:38,936
Sir,

366
00:22:39,786 --> 00:22:43,338
Captain Thrace and l
are of the opinion that
the first two Raptors

367
00:22:43,338 --> 00:22:45,737
may very well have been
lured away by just
such a trick.

368
00:22:45,737 --> 00:22:47,671
An opinion
I do not share, sir.

369
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:52,805
We'll send a recon mission
in full force.

370
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:54,459
Five Raptors.

371
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:56,850
Three escort, two rescue.

372
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:59,654
You have your orders,
Commander.

373
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:01,353
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

374
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:06,116
Thank you, Major.

375
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:09,468
I'm sure your expertise
is needed elsewhere.

376
00:23:10,953 --> 00:23:12,045
Yes, sir.

377
00:23:20,362 --> 00:23:22,262
Yes, I am curious.

378
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,434
Why the sudden interest
in the fleet's
demographic projections?

379
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:30,986
An issue has emerged
that may prove divisive
to our administration.

380
00:23:30,986 --> 00:23:34,345
I would like all the facts
in hand before making
my decision.

381
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:37,041
So now it's
our administration.

382
00:23:37,642 --> 00:23:39,439
She must be desperate.

383
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,066
Well, I'm a very busy man.

384
00:23:46,346 --> 00:23:49,418
Luckily, I made an initial
calculation on these figures
over seven months ago

385
00:23:49,418 --> 00:23:51,273
when nobody seemed interested
or concerned.

386
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:53,705
All I had to do was factor
in the numbers
from the Pegasus crew.

387
00:23:53,705 --> 00:23:56,333
It took me hardly any time
at all and I didn't mind.

388
00:23:56,362 --> 00:23:59,263
Look, I'll save you
the bother. You needn't
read the report.

389
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:02,797
If we continue
on our present course,

390
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:07,803
within the next 18 years,
the human race
will simply be extinct.

391
00:24:12,106 --> 00:24:15,306
ROSLlN: (ON PA) Since assuming
the Presidency, I've made it
my mission to maintain

392
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:19,003
the rights and freedoms
we so enjoyed
prior to the attack.

393
00:24:19,817 --> 00:24:22,911
One of these rights has now
come into direct conflict

394
00:24:23,401 --> 00:24:25,733
with the survival
of the species.

395
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:29,890
And I find myself
forced to make
a very difficult decision.

396
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:32,685
The issue is stark.

397
00:24:34,313 --> 00:24:38,613
The fact is that if
this civilization
is to survive, we must,

398
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:41,157
must repopulate this fleet.

399
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,025
Therefore, I am issuing
an executive order.

400
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:47,626

This is a rescue mission,

All due respect, sir,
but if this is a Cylon trap,

420
00:25:40,361 --> 00:25:43,049
then we are entering blind.
We should send
a force recon...

421
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:46,985

there, Major. I'm going in.
I'm not waiting on recon.

00:25:46,985 --> 00:25:49,545

this is in direct violation
of the Admiral's orders.

that you do not intend

to prosecute the Gemenese girl
on Galactica.

562

She has a name, Sarah.

And I think that Rya
has suffered enough.

She's just been through
an abortion.

565
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:01,035
I've granted her asylum
aboard Galactica.

566
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:03,556
This is in total violation
of the law.

567
00:37:04,169 --> 00:37:06,153
My order came after
she sought her procedure.

568
00:37:06,153 --> 00:37:07,347
No laws have been broken.

would've been sufficient.

Because you were doing
what you always did.

590

and get away with it.

on Pegasus and there you were,

I don't know.
It pissed me off.

a lot of sense, does it?

It is true, in the light
of recent events,

lost support in some quarters.

to understand that, if this
is an extreme decision,
