1
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,229
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,950
l demand my rights, as a Colonial citizen,
to legal representation and due process.

3
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,598
Do you?

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,672
- So what happens next?
- We give him his trial.

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,910
My father was a priest,
my mother an oracle.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,116
l've served on battlestars
since l was 18.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,557
When you elected me union president,
l promised l would keep us working.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,270
Throw your body on the gears, the levers,
on the machine itself and make it stop.

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,828
<i>(chanting)</i> Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief!

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,755
We try to pretend our lives are exactly like
they were before we went to New Caprica.

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,150
- But it <i>is</i> different.
- We're just going through a rough patch.

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,834
What if rough patches
are all we have left?

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,871
<i>(Chief)</i> Figurski, Pollux, Sanchez - you're
gonna be rehabbing mule engines tonight.

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,554
Set the hull SOL checks rigs
to SEC.

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,831
<i>(Figurski)</i> Thought we were
subbing out maintenance to civvies.

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,469
<i>(Chief)</i> Don't got enough mechanics
down there.

17
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,029
- Check flow rate.
- <i>(Pollux)</i> Flow rate steady at 2-9-0.

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,916
When are we getting some rec?
l did double watches for two weeks.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,629
- <i>(Chief)</i> l know, l know.
- Plus, l still got the ringing in my ears.

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,199
<i>(Figurski)</i> Whoo-hoo-hoo!

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,590
<i>(Chief)</i> Sorry, l can't hear you.
l've got ringing. What's that?

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,955
<i>(Pollux)</i> Real funny, guys.

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,550
- Fuse indicators are out.
- Set the wing tank switch to fuel.

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,108
Power off.
All right, tank off.

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,350
That's it.
Kill the fuelling station.

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,079
Pull the hose.
LT, you're tanked up and ready to roll.

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,991
Roger that, Chief.
Ready to roll.

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,233
Laundry call.

29
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,475
Figurski, Pollux, Redford - grab your crap
before l chuck it in the 'cycler.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,790
- Fold my undies the way l like?
- Frak off.

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,270
Nice mouth.
You think they let officers talk like that?

32
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,920
Gonna have to change
when you get them wings.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,991
l'm not getting wings.

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,152
They rejected my application
for flight training.

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,674
l thought you aced the exam.
Interview went well?

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,149
It turns out l'm
in a "critical position"

37
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,028
and my leaving would cause
"severe mission degradation".

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
- That sucks.
- Critical position, my ass!

39
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,672
They just don't want knuckle-draggers
stinking up the pilot ready room.

40
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,751
All right, that's enough.
Lock it up.

41
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,719
The CAG told me you got bounced
from flight training. l'm sorry - it sucks.

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,678
We need you here -
you're our best avionics specialist.

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,558
And she knows
how to fold a man's undies.

44
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,596
- Hey!
- You frak.

45
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,114
- Enough! Get off.
- l'll take you apart!

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,273
Shut up, Figurski, or l'll pump you in
the mouth myself. Now get back to work.

47
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,430
- Come here.
- Let go of me.

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,511
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.

49
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,594
Look, you do important work down here -
just as important as sitting in a cockpit.

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,551
Thanks, Chief.

51
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,552
l'm gonna deliver some more
"important" laundry.

52
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,477
Raptor away.
Readings nominal.

53
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,238
<i>Everything looks good.</i>

54
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,279
- Setting course heading 2-9-6-5...
- <i>(crash)</i>

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,716
- What the frak?
- It's a flameout! RCS thruster's jammed.

56
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,791
Restart.

57
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,995
No go!

58
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,473
<i>"Galactica", Skulls. Engine thruster stuck</i>
<i>in full position. Engine one won't start.</i>

59
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,514
There's a fire in engine two.
It's gonna blow. Get your ass up here.

60
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,436
Eject! Eject! Eject!

61
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,631
We got off lucky -
a dozen injuries, no fatalities.

62
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,312
Thank you.

63
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,030
You should've seen Tory's shoulder. l had
to help Cottle put it back into alignment.

64
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,079
You know, l am so busy, l hardly ever
make it down to this end of the ship.

65
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,472
And now l'm gonna be living here
until they repair the bulkheads.

66
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,429
If the quarters become cramped,
you're always welcome in one of my beds.

67
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,229
In a manner of speaking.

68
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,512
- Any idea what happened to your Raptor?
- We're still investigating.

69
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,116
But it seems that the tylium was
seriously contaminated with impurities.

70
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,919
Most likely it's a problem
with the refining process.

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,231
What's going on? The refinery
used to be our most reliable ship.

72
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,199
Now every day l start with
a stack of messages from that chief...

73
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,350
- Xeno Fenner.
- Fenner.

74
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,468
...complaining about working conditions
and deliveries and, uh...

75
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,552
spare parts and compensation -
if you can believe that.

76
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,998
We're on the run for our lives, and the guy
wants to talk about overtime bonuses.

77
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,631
We've been more than patient with Fenner
and his production problems -

78
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,678
two weeks of waiting for him
to get his act together.

79
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,834
l don't know about you, but l'm ready
to get back on the road to finding Earth.

80
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,312
<i>(whispers)</i> Is that a hint of hope l hear?

81
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,349
Is the sceptic suddenly decided
that we're on the road to Earth after all?

82
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,751
Have l ever doubted it?

83
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,551
l've had people working 18-hour shifts
for the past six months.

84
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,631
How long can a man
keep that up?

85
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,918
If the Cylons show up, we have enough
fuel to jump the entire fleet, what, once?

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,594
- Mm-hm.
- Maybe twice.

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,560
That's a margin
that's much too narrow for me.

88
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,074
How about for you and your men?

89
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,674
You have a problem, fix it.

90
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,390
Just get the gas flowing.
And then we'll talk, l promise you that.

91
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,675
"Then we'll talk."

92
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,512
It's always later.

93
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,833
You know, it's funny that when the gas
flows, my phone calls don't get returned,

94
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,070
but the minute there's
a glitch in supply,

95
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,197
l've got face time
with the president and the admiral.

96
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,798
Hmm. Maybe we should
just start having more glitches.

97
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,119
- Is that a threat?
- It's like the book says:

98
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,636
"If you hear the people,
you'll never have to fear the people."

99
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,154
- Did you say "the book"?
- Mm-hm.

100
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,912
Guards, arrest him -

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,437
for extortion and interrupting vital services
during a time of war.

102
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,034
Go ahead, take him away.
Go. Out of here. Guard.

103
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,111
Come with me, sir.

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,436
- What the hell was that?
- He was quoting from Baltar's book.

105
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,717
The ramblings that his lawyer
smuggled out of the brig?

106
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,031
He's having it reprinted
and passed out among the fleet,

107
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,955
and he's calling it <i>My Triumphs,</i>
<i>My Mistakes</i> by Gaius Baltar.

108
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,999
l am thinking of having
a good old-fashioned book-burning.

109
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,749
Algae meatloaf -
starting to be a favourite.

110
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,549
It's not for you.
Remember our little talk?

111
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,552
Oh, but today's my cheat day.

112
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,154
The last three days
have been your cheat day.

113
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,429
Really? Eugh.

114
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,317
You were moving better yesterday. Is that
how the bends are supposed to work?

115
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,915
l'm just upset about Seelix,
so l'm tensing up.

116
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,754
They should've told her right off the bat
what the fleet priorities are.

117
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,072
Should've said that they needed
knuckle-draggers more than pilots.

118
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,879
It isn't about fleet priorities.

119
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,430
We're not the ruling class,
so we're stuck doing the dirty work.

120
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,832
- "Ruling class"? Where'd you get that?
- Something l read.

121
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,150
By Baltar.

122
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,548
His frakking rag's going around? l can't
believe anybody'd read anything by him.

123
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,438
That's what l thought too, but...

124
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,077
Ever wonder why all the pilots and
the officers come from the rich colonies

125
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,754
like Caprica and Virgon
and Tauron,

126
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,037
while all the knuckle-draggers
come from the poor colonies

127
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,237
like Aerelon and Sagitarron
and Gemenon?

128
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,437
- Yeah, that's just trash talk on the deck.
- Really?

129
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,353
Name one officer
that comes from a poor colony.

130
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,874
Lieutenant Dualla's from Sagitarron.

131
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,714
Case in point!
How did she get promoted?

132
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,395
She married an officer from Caprica.

133
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,350
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

134
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,916
Tyrol.

135
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,390
<i>(Adama) The foreman at the fuel refinery's</i>
<i>just been arrested.</i>

136
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,277
- <i>Xeno Fenner?</i>
- Know him?

137
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,238
- Did something happen to Xeno?
- Arrested.

138
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,359
Yes, sir. He was in the union on
New Caprica. He seemed like a good guy.

139
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,592
- What'd he do?
- He pissed off the president.

140
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,114
The bigger problem
is the refining operation.

141
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,078
<i>l need someone</i>
<i>to get that fuel ship moving again.</i>

142
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,628
Pick a team
and be on the hangar deck in an hour.

143
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,789
Yes, sir.

144
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,149
- What happened to Xeno?
- He pissed off the president.

145
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,233
- You can get arrested for that now?
- l think the admiral was kidding.

146
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,629
- <i>(Nicky gargles)</i>
- Yeah!

147
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,999
- You ever think about the union?
- Sure, but that's gone now.

148
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,914
New Caprica's gone, but all
the people in the union are still here.

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,834
The only difference is, now they don't
have anyone to stand up for them.

150
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,593
l gotta go.

151
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,680
l do hope you're enjoying yourselves.

152
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,354
It's not enough that
you have to interrupt my sleep,

153
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,432
now you have to destroy my stuff as well.
You're pathetic!

154
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,590
You're utterly and totally...

155
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,671
Hello, Doctor.

156
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,356
Why don't you do yourself a favour? Hand
over the pages and stop all this nonsense.

157
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,714
- l don't know what you're talking about.
- Turn him around.

158
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,038
The pages to your book, <i>My Triumphs,</i>
<i>My Mistakes</i> by Gaius Baltar.

159
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,873
So you've read it.

160
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,793
The people are reading it,
and now you're sorry.

161
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,431
We knew your lawyer was smuggling
the pages out, so we intercepted them.

162
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,640
l'm the only one who's read the book,
and l am dying to see how it ends.

163
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,431
Really, what were you thinking,
casting yourself as a man of the people,

164
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,672
a son of a farmer,
a revolutionary?

165
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,796
Oh, please.

166
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,795
It may come as a surprise, but l wished
to strike a chord with the common man.

167
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,634
Hand over those pages, or l'll have
these guards search you. Make a choice.

168
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,991
Gentlemen, proceed.

169
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,035
Don't bend to her, Gaius.

170
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,429
Show her that she can't break you.

171
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,554
Keep your dignity.

172
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,198
Perhaps you'd consider
writing a blurb for the back cover.

173
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,031
Thank you, Doctor.

174
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,309
<i>(guard)</i> Close the cell.

175
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,280
It's all right, Gaius.

176
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,238
Everything will be OK.

177
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,759
- Tyrol.
- Cabott. Hey. How are you doing?

178
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,195
Good to see you.

179
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,192
- Sorry.
- Never mind. It's inevitable.

180
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,070
Listen, we all started feeling a lot better
when we heard they were sending you.

181
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,355
- Oh, yeah?
- You bet.

182
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,468
l've been telling everybody how the union
on New Caprica stood up for the little guy.

183
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,551
Yeah, well...

184
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,196
<i>(Cabott)</i> You're looking at
the fleet's entire supply of tylium.

185
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,319
- <i>(Chief)</i> How many jumps we got?
- We'll be lucky if we get outta the system.

186
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,116
<i>(Chief)</i> You'd better give us the nickel tour,
see where we stand.

187
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,231
<i>(woman on PA) Second shift,</i>
<i>report for duty at starboard bay five.</i>

188
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,032
- It's a big operation.
- You should see it when it's running.

189
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,954
Loud as an A-bomb,
and just about as safe.

190
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,234
Listen, we really need this downtime.
l mean, look around.

191
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,836
Next time some machine fraks up,
it might not just take out a Raptor.

192
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,674
This ship really is a big bomb
just waiting to go up.

193
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,399
l understand the risk,
but l need to see it working,

194
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,074
so pull your guys off,
and let's fire it up.

195
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,469
It ain't gonna work.

196
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,475
- You work here?
- This is Milo, the best grease jockey l got.

197
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,472
Milo, huh?
So why is it not gonna work?

198
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,789
Something you guys aren't telling me?
Come on.

199
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,590
OK. l guess l'm just gonna have
to have a look for myself.

200
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,354
Is that pressure relief?

201
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,592
- The seals are missing.
- They all are.

202
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,593
Without pressure seals,
the machinery won't run. Where are they?

203
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,910
Guess they got lost, huh?

204
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,072
You can't frak around.
The admiral won't stand for it.

205
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,835
- The admiral can kiss my ass!
- Hey! Hey!

206
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,275
Come on, Chief,
you know what this is about.

207
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,354
When working conditions improve and
they let Xeno out, we'll find those seals.

208
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,072
Until then, it looks like this ship isn't
gonna be refining another drop of tylium.

209
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,038
And that means
this fleet isn't going anywhere.

210
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,595
l've executed a search of the ship,
but the seals have not turned up.

211
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,071
You know that this is sabotage.
l'm inclined to have them locked up.

212
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,311
Please. They could've rigged
something to have me injured.

213
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,518
They could have contaminated the fuel
on purpose, left our ships dead in the air.

214
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,388
- Good gods!
- All they did do was buy some time.

215
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,679
The machinery needs overhauling.
There's a reason quality control is failing.

216
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,069
Do you realise
most of the workers on that ship

217
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,436
have not had a day off
since the original attack on the Colonies?

218
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,274
- It's like slave labour.
- Don't be absurd.

219
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,590
The people aboard that ship
are stuck there.

220
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,435
- They have no control over their lives.
- And the work is hard, we know that.

221
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,196
Do they think they're having a picnic on
the algae-processing plant, or munitions?

222
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,590
The fleet is full of people
working under horrific conditions.

223
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,639
- Nobody's having a good time.
- l think that if we at least release Xeno,

224
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,076
talk to them about improving
working and living conditions,

225
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,118
that the protest will go away,
they'll return the seals,

226
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,873
and we'll get the fuel problem
under control.

227
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,509
Extortion is not
an acceptable method of protest.

228
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,795
What are the names of the leaders?

229
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,512
- Just Cabott.
- l will issue a warrant for his arrest.

230
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,876
Put him in the brig,
let him sweat it out.

231
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,997
Admiral, Madam President,
they're just trying to...

232
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,799
Chief, uh-uh. We're done.

233
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,591
<i>(heavy sigh)</i>

234
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,392
l'm gonna go check on
Cabott and Xeno.

235
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,751
Chief.

236
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,268
- Hey.
- Hey.

237
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,238
You gotta get him outta here.

238
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,788
- What the hell happened to his hands?
- He was scratching the walls.

239
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,998
- He kept scratching until his fingers bled.
- <i>(Cabott)</i> l won't say.

240
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,595
He was in Cylon detention
on New Caprica, you remember?

241
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,435
He came out all squirrelly, and this is not
helping. You gotta get him outta here.

242
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,750
It doesn't matter.

243
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,796
l won't say.

244
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,348
- <i>(sobbing)</i>
- <i>(sighs)</i>

245
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,717
- Where are the seals?
- Oh, you son of a bitch.

246
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,475
- Come on.
- Galen, you gotta get him outta here.

247
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,118
- Cabott?
- No, l won't...

248
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,192
- Cabott, look at me!
- l won't...

249
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,271
Cabott, where are the seals?

250
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,989
- l won't say. It doesn't matter.
- l can get you outta here.

251
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,833
- Tell me where the seals are.
- l won't say.

252
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,198
- For gods' sake, get him out of here!
- Where... where are the seals?

253
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,113
- Where are they?
- It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter!

254
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,158
- Where are the seals?
- It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!

255
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,471
- Where are they?
- The air vent! All right?

256
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,678
- They're in the centre stern air vent!
- Tell the president to release them.

257
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,876
Frak!

258
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,349
<i>(Cabott hyperventilating)</i>

259
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,750
All right, that's the last one.
Let's fire this up, get back to work.

260
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,991
Yes, sir. Whatever you say, boss.

261
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,834
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Can l throw the switch?

262
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,238
- How old are you?
- 12.

263
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,992
Almost.

264
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,435
But l can run every machine we got.

265
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,956
Only thing l haven't done
is turn the whole thing on.

266
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,471
It's all yours.

267
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,278
<i>(machinery powering up)</i>

268
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,635
<i>(bell)</i>

269
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,318
<i>(PA) Workers to your stations.</i>

270
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,677
<i>All workers to your stations.</i>

271
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,156
- <i>(Chief)</i> There are kids down there.
- There's children on every ship.

272
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,708
These children work in the refinery.

273
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,553
They're 12, 15 years old.

274
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,030
There have been families aboard
the refinery since its beginning,

275
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,954
and others were picked up
after the Cylons attacked the Colonies.

276
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,793
Over the past two years,
parents have taught children

277
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,429
how to operate the machinery -
they have passed along their skills.

278
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,274
It is perfectly normal.
It is not ideal, l know that.

279
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,397
But there's nothing ideal
about this fleet!

280
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,112
Do you see what's happening?

281
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,078
Jobs are starting to be inherited,
Madam President.

282
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,118
We don't know how long we'll be here.
What if it's ten years?

283
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,670
So l train my son to be a deck hand
because that's what l am,

284
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,149
and that's all he can ever be?

285
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,954
Is that the future we want?

286
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,675
That's a really good point.

287
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,916
Make a list of everyone who has
a work history appropriate to the refinery -

288
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,833
factory workers, mechanics,
whatever you think.

289
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,957
Give it to the chief,
and l want you to hold a public lottery.

290
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,158
We will take people from other vessels
and put them on shifts in the refinery.

291
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,231
How's that, Chief?

292
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,072
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

293
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,596
<i>(Chief)</i> So that's our allotment
from Dogsville.

294
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,355
We'll get these people outta here
before they know where they're going.

295
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,908
- All right, people...
- Excuse me. Sir?

296
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,958
Hi. l don't know
who l'm supposed to talk to about this,

297
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,353
but l don't think l'm what you guys are
looking for. l don't really have the skills.

298
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,476
- What's your name?
- Daniel Noon.

299
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,596
Figurski. Noon?

300
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,435
Noon. Noon...
Noon, Daniel. Says you're a farmer.

301
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,080
We need people
to work with heavy machinery.

302
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,596
No, but l don't. Not really.
l worked on a farm for a summer

303
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,992
cos l was saving to go to college,
architecture, but then the Cylons attacked.

304
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,038
And now l'm a farmer?
How is that fair?

305
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,833
How is it in any way fair?

306
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,871
Just give me a second.

307
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,430
We make an exception for him,
there'll be 15 more right behind him.

308
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,114
Look at him, though.
He's a kid.

309
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,349
Fine. Put him on the ship.

310
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,829
Look, this is just
a temporary thing, OK?

311
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,911
Wait. Hold on.
l'm not a farmer.

312
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,833
- It's not permanent.
- Can you just check my record?

313
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,071
- Yeah.
- Who am l supposed to talk to about this?

314
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,835
Who am l supposed to talk to about this?
l'm not a farmer!

315
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,832
Hey, stop it!
l'm not a farmer!

316
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,792
- What are you doing here?
- Your book: fact or fiction?

317
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,677
So you read it?

318
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,673
Well, that proves that the president's
an accomplished liar.

319
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,958
She told me it hadn't gone out.
So, what do you make of it?

320
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,156
l think that it's a pile of crap.

321
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,074
Obviously, my analysis
of a bifurcated society scares you.

322
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,675
But everything in my book
happens to be true.

323
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,035
Oh, it's true? It's true
that you're a farm boy from Aerelon?

324
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,998
It is, as a matter of fact.
l was born and raised on a dairy

325
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,436
outside the town of
Cuttlesbreath Wash on Aerelon.

326
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,875
Why do l have such a hard time

327
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,080
picturing you milking cows
and shovelling manure?

328
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,993
Lack of imagination?

329
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,152
Or maybe that your little tale
is manure.

330
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,390
Hm?

331
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,314
l've known people from Aerelon.
You don't sound anything like them.

332
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,834
- l don't sound like l'm from Aerelon?
- No.

333
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,718
Well, l take that
as a particular compliment.

334
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,519
l don't know about you,
but l find the Aerelon dialect

335
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,558
to be particularly hard on the ears.

336
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,634
<i>(accent changes)</i> The consonants
scrape the back of the throat.

337
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,679
l know a lot about my native tongue.
l spent hours on end trying to overcome it.

338
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,399
Do you have any idea how hard it is

339
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,790
for a ten-year-old boy
to change the way he speaks?

340
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,271
To unlearn everything he ever learned,
so that one day...

341
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,432
one day there might be
the small hope...

342
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,750
that he might be considered
as not coming from Aerelon?

343
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,149
Maybe, l don't know, Caprica.

344
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,633
<i>(voice changes back)</i>
Caprica? Oh, to be Caprican.

345
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,833
The seat of politics, culture,
art, science, learning.

346
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,913
And what was Aerelon?
Just a drab, ugly rock

347
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,790
<i>(accent changes)</i> condemned to be
the food basket for the 12 worlds.

348
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,996
And that's how we were treated -

349
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,072
like servants, like labourers,
like working class.

350
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,833
You know, you would have
fitted right in there.

351
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,948
Lots of men who liked to work with their
hands, and grab a pint down the pub,

352
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,318
and finish off the evening
with a good old-fashioned fight.

353
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,197
<i>(voice changes)</i> Oh, yes...

354
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,439
l left Aerelon after my 18th birthday.

355
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,193
l turned my back on my family,

356
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,271
on my heritage...

357
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,311
All of them.

358
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,112
Of course, it doesn't matter,
they're all dead now.

359
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,872
You do realise
that none of that exists here?

360
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,474
<i>(laughs)</i>
Coming from the mouth of a mechanic!

361
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,313
We've kept democracy.

362
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,472
We have government, we have rights,
we have elections...

363
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,599
Well, then you should feel
perfectly happy, perfectly at ease!

364
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,559
Go home, leave me in peace.
That's what the aristocracy wants.

365
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,438
It wants the working class
to feel looked after,

366
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,035
while they scrabble around for scraps
from the master's table!

367
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,351
There's a question l ask at the end of my
book. l'll save you the trouble of reading it.

368
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,468
"Will the fleet ever be commanded by
somebody whose name is not Adama?"

369
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,715
There it is, Chief -

370
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,432
one set of rules for the aristocracy,
and one set of rules for the rest of us.

371
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,236
<i>(woman on PA) First shift of cleanup crew,</i>
<i>report for duty in starboard bay.</i>

372
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,633
We've assigned all the new workers
from the lottery.

373
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,553
- Looks like you put 'em right to work.
- They're OK.

374
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,200
They're a little skittish,
but they'll catch on.

375
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,238
Here's where we had
the problem last time.

376
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,869
We got all kinds of gear slippage,
temperature variations.

377
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,270
We didn't know the dross
wasn't getting burned off.

378
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,430
- That's the bad fuel?
- It's running now.

379
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,398
But we got other places on the line
that could frak us.

380
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,277
- <i>(rumbling)</i>
- What's that?

381
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,749
- Hit the switch!
- Not when it's jammed.

382
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,831
The system will seize up.
Gotta find it.

383
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,357
Otherwise, the ore still in the chambers
will superheat and blow us all to hell.

384
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,034
Hurry! We gotta get this going.

385
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,397
Right here. This is it.

386
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,675
- Got it? Get it out of there.
- Yeah.

387
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,320
- l can't get my hands around it.
- Give it a yank.

388
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,391
l can't get my hand on it!

389
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,948
- Argh!
- Careful. Careful!

390
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,998
- l can't get under it.
- We got some hot rocks up there.

391
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,355
You gotta get this thing started, fast!

392
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,477
- Give it a yank!
- l just can't get my hand around it.

393
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,790
l can't get my hand on it.

394
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,190
- l can try. l can try...
- <i>(Fenner)</i> Get in there.

395
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,271
- l can probably fit.
- <i>(Chief)</i> Come on.

396
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,715
If he clears it, the belt will jump.
Careful.

397
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,870
- Way in the back...
- There you go.

398
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,350
- <i>(Chief)</i> You got it, you got it. Attaboy.
- <i>(Fenner)</i> Be careful!

399
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,475
<i>(clanking)</i>

400
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,676
Come on, Danny, get ahold of it.
Attaboy!

401
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,796
Now grab it.
Pull it towards you.

402
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,997
Pull on it. Pull on it.
Pull on it, Danny.

403
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,230
<i>(machinery clanks into action)</i>

404
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,800
<i>(Fenner)</i> Yes! All right!

405
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,668
- Good work, Danny.
- <i>(Fenner)</i> Get out of there. Come on out.

406
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,990
<i>(screaming)</i>

407
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,674
Medic! Medic!

408
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,238
Medic! Now!

409
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,110
- <i>(screaming continues)</i>
- Take it easy, buddy. We got you.

410
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,956
<i>(Fenner)</i> It's OK.
You did a great job.

411
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,031
<i>(screaming continues)</i>

412
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,157
- <i>(woman)</i> You're gonna be OK.
- <i>(Seelix)</i> You're gonna be OK.

413
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,629
<i>(Fenner)</i> You're gonna be OK.

414
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,031
<i>(Danny groans)</i>

415
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,670
l need more gauze.
Just calm down.

416
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,035
That's it. Gimme some more.

417
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,148
This plant's offline!

418
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,275
We're on strike!

419
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,910
<i>(Figurski)</i> Action time.

420
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,958
- Need something, Captain?
- l frakking do: my Viper.

421
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:14,114
Sorry, Captain, vital missions only.
CAP's already up. We did our job.

422
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,953
- "Vital missions only"?
- Whose orders?

423
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,237
Cally relayed the orders
from Chief Tyrol.

424
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,358
We're on strike.

425
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,314
Admiral.

426
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,951
Are you aware that your deck gang
is participating in a work stoppage?

427
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,396
- It's called a general strike, sir.
- It's a mutiny.

428
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,749
And do you know
what we do with mutineers?

429
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,555
We shoot them, Chief.

430
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,476
We're leaving people behind.

431
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,439
People who are locked into their jobs,
have no control over their lives, no say.

432
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,640
- We're abandoning them to their fate.
- That is not the issue.

433
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,679
The men and women on this ship
are not allowed to disobey an order,

434
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,673
especially in support of
some kind of frakking labour dispute.

435
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,548
We launched the CAP. No one abandoned
their post, no one's in danger.

436
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,631
This is mutiny.

437
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,831
And it stops now.

438
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,796
Admiral, all l want
is a sit down with the president.

439
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,876
This is the admiral.

440
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,951
Arrest Cally Tyrol.

441
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,794
Take her under armed guard
directly to the starboard repair bay.

442
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,637
- What are you doing?
- l'm gonna put her against the bulkhead,

443
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,950
and l'm gonna shoot her
as a mutineer.

444
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,476
Are you outta your frakking mind?!
Cally was following my orders.

445
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,313
She's a ringleader,
so she goes first.

446
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,518
Then the rest of your deck gang:
Figurski, Seelix, Pollux.

447
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,750
<i>(slams bars)</i>

448
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,155
You won't do this.

449
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,437
- We have a son.
- Understand me:

450
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,433
the very survival of this ship may depend
on someone getting an order

451
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,193
that they don't wanna do.

452
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,998
And if they hesitate,

453
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,470
if they feel that orders
are sometimes optional,

454
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,835
then this ship will perish.

455
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,751
And so will your son.

456
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,076
And the entire human race.

457
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,431
l don't wanna do this, Chief.

458
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,274
But l will put ten Callys
up against the wall

459
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:03,037
to make sure that this ship and this fleet
are not destroyed.

460
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,990
Fine.

461
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,071
l'll call it off.

462
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,356
This is the admiral.

463
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,273
Do you have Cally in custody?

464
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,635
Put her on.
Open the door.

465
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,194
- You OK?
- <i>Don't worry. l've been in the brig before.</i>

466
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,238
<i>(Chief) Everything's OK.</i>
<i>Call off the strike.</i>

467
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,880
Did they cave?

468
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,918
Yeah. Call it off.

469
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,560
<i>l knew it.</i>
<i>l'll take care of it.</i>

470
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,555
Galen, l'm proud of you.

471
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,598
Give the phone to the marine.

472
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,191
Release her.

473
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,999
You can go now, Chief.

474
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:18,074
l thought you had something that
you wanted to discuss with the president.

475
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,509
- Would you like another drink?
- <i>(Chief)</i> l think l've had enough.

476
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,672
Madam President,
l've seen people drafted into service

477
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,751
based purely on
where they were born.

478
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,037
They've also been selected
based on their skills.

479
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,157
Which is a result of
where they were born.

480
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,915
Capricans are more likely to be
professionals. Aerelons, farmers.

481
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,878
- It's just a fact of life.
- It's a fact l can't change.

482
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,794
True. But l think
we can level the playing field.

483
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,759
There are a lot of dirty jobs that need
to be done every day in this fleet:

484
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,435
cleaning, hauling,
low-level maintenance, things like that.

485
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,390
These are the kind of jobs that l think
should be allocated to people...

486
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,230
Well, people like yourself -
no offence.

487
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,232
None taken. Go ahead.

488
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,552
Let some of the people on <i>Colonial One</i>
get their hands dirty for a change.

489
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,392
Done. What else?

490
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,837
People that are in dangerous
and high-stress jobs need R and R.

491
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,196
In order to do that,
we need a formal training programme.

492
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,794
We can talk about
a training programme later.

493
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,475
We need to focus on maintaining
the workforce that we have,

494
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,031
and this is gonna have to be an area
where the union gives ground.

495
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,429
- The union?
- Oh, l'm sorry.

496
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,991
l thought you were bargaining on behalf
of the Colonial Workers' Alliance.

497
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,833
- If that's not the case, then...
- Madam President,

498
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,388
that union died on New Caprica.

499
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,952
The workers in this fleet need someone
to represent them and their interests.

500
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,873
And if this society
is becoming truly polarised

501
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,748
between an entrenched political class
and a disenfranchised underclass,

502
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,353
we are doomed.

503
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,591
We won't need Cylons to destroy us,
we'll destroy ourselves.

504
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,879
The fleet that arrives at Earth
will not represent Colonial society at all.

505
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,870
l am willing to fight for that society
until my dying breath.

506
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,750
l would love it if
you would fight for that society as well.

507
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,231
l will.

508
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,716
l will, Madam President. l will.

509
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,236
Pollux and Herschel,
you are on fuelling, 43-72.

510
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,357
- Chief Tyrol?
- Hey, Captain.

511
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,352
A nugget failed to show up
for flight instruction.

512
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,718
- l'm sorry to hear that, Captain.
- Maybe you can tell me where Seelix is.

513
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,995
Seelix. Front and centre.

514
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,559
Flight instruction began 20 minutes ago,
Seelix. You wanna be a pilot or not?

515
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,269
- Yes, sir, but l thought that...
- Think when l tell you to think.

516
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,351
Look at the plan of the day -

517
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,514
then you'd know where you're supposed
to be and may actually get there on time.

518
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,750
And you're out of uniform to boot.

519
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,752
- l'm sorry. l think l can handle that.
- Thank you.

520
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,559
Hold this.

521
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,795
You have to be an officer
to fly Vipers.

522
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,871
You know that.

523
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,635
Detail, hand salute.

524
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,517
<i>(chuckling)</i>

525
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,916
Thank you, Chief.

526
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,672
Thank you.

527
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,275
- Congratulations, Ensign.
- Very touching.

528
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,716
But you were supposed to be
in ready room four 20 minutes ago,

529
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,634
which means that you are falling behind
on your first day.

530
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,915
So move it.

531
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,276
Don't look at him!
Move it! Move it!

532
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,476
- Be nice.
- Oh!

533
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,435
More religion.

534
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,556
Your soul is mine.
