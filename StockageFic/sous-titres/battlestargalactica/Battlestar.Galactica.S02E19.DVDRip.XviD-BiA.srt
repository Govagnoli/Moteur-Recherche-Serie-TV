is that the captured
Cylon Heavy Raider

is capable
of much longer jumps
than our Raptors.

71

72
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,899
that if we could install
the Heavy Raider
navigational system

74
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:02,741

00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,413
and you know
what it gets you?

178
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:10,926
Exactly nothing.

179
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:15,681
Are you sure
you're a priest?

180
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:19,685
I've been preaching
longer than you've been
sucking down oxygen.

181
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,378
And in that time,
I've learned enough to know

182
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:25,939
that the gods
don't answer prayers.

183
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:30,738
We're here on our own.
That's the way
they set things up.

184
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:35,826
We have to find
our own answers, our own way
out of the wilderness

185
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:39,882
without a nice
little sunny path all laid out
in front of us in advance.

186
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:41,440
That's what I'm trying to do.

187
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,111
I'm trying to find my way.

188
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,445
Now, it's not gonna get better

189
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,948
until you see
what the problem is.

190
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:50,194
And the problem is
you are screwed up,
heart and mind.

191
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:53,820
You, not the gods
or fate or the universe.

192
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,054
You.

193
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:58,529
Thanks for the pep talk.

194
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:08,522
Hey.

195
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:09,576
Hi.

196
00:14:13,258 --> 00:14:15,192
I just wanted to say,

197
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:19,327
well,

198
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:21,137
good hunting.

199
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:24,771
Thank you, sir.

200
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,654
Yeah, it's a good plan.

201
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,701
It's a good plan.

202
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,074
Sharon should be able to jump
you into the atmosphere

203
00:14:32,074 --> 00:14:34,282
a couple of clicks
above the surface.

204
00:14:34,282 --> 00:14:37,738
Down below the Cylon dradis.
I know the plan.

205
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:39,000
Lee, I wrote it.

206
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:41,991
Yeah.

207
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:48,901
I gotta go.

208
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,846
I hope you find him, Kara.

209
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:53,816
I really do.

210
00:14:57,578 --> 00:14:58,806
So do l.

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,718
From the Colonial dispatch,

212
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:11,499

only solidified
the perception..."

I'll do that later.

214

for all his charm,
is essentially an empty suit

of substantive policy."

216
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:22,090
It's nice to see the press
is getting it right
for a change.

217
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,683
Don't forget,
the radical religious charge
is dangerous.

218
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:26,570
It may be a low blow
from a desperate man,

219
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,194
but it's the only issue
he's managed to get
any traction on.

220
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,559
He will keep exploiting it.

221
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,002
He's gotta come up
with something much,
much bigger than that

222
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:35,338
if he wants to make it
the central issue
of his campaign.

223
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:36,327
It's not gonna work.

225
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,710
You gotta keep hitting her
on the religious thing.

226

Every time we go there,

227
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,074
you score points,
and we move the polls
in our direction.

228
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:54,201
Yes, I'm not sure
if you're aware, Tom,

229
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:57,994
but the mob
isn't usually in the habit
of electing ungodly apostates

230
00:15:57,994 --> 00:16:00,106
who denigrate people of faith.

231
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:02,602
Things are gonna
turn around. You'll see.

232
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:03,796
He's right.

233
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:05,985
Listen to him.

234
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,792
Of course.

235
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,594
Of course.
How blind I'm being.
Thank you, yes.

You know,
I'm so assured right now, Tom,

241
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:24,746
I'm just gonna sit right back
and wait for the hand of God

242
00:16:24,746 --> 00:16:26,890
to reach down and change
my political fortunes.

243
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:27,982

I'd like to speak with Actual.

254
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,317
Did I ever say thank you?

255
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:09,353
No, but then again,
that would be a first,
wouldn't it?

256

Thank you.

257

Just come back in one piece.
That'll be thank you enough.

a final check, people.

jump coordinates.

someone already.

just have to find
her way back to base.

to start, though.

that Cally...

how I could do that
to Cally.

to it, shall we?

the same dream

weren't you?

I don't know.
I don't remember. Maybe.

Maybe. It doesn't matter,
does it?

Back to the barn.

352
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:02,693
Hey, I'm picking up
a large planetary body.

353
00:24:03,882 --> 00:24:05,213
It's frakking close.

354
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,954
Where did that
come from?

355
00:24:10,954 --> 00:24:12,581
Hell if I know.

356
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:15,785
There's so much
dradis interference here,
it didn't even register.

357
00:24:15,785 --> 00:24:17,810
Let's check this out.

358
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,873
Atmosphere
is nitrogen-oxygen.

359
00:24:24,873 --> 00:24:28,969
Organic molecular spectra.
Fresh water.

360
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:35,754
Hey, you know what this is?
It's habitable.

361
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:41,281
We may have just found a world
that can support human life.

362
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:47,501
Maybe we're not
just a bunch of frakups
after all.

363
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:57,697
Now, the climate readings
overall are
within human norms.

364
00:24:59,562 --> 00:25:01,961
Oh, there's some extremes
at the poles
that we couldn't withstand,

365
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:03,485
but that's not unusual.

366
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,535
Well done.

367
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,365
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.

368
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:11,721
We got a mottled area here
at the river mouth,
so it's probably a delta,

369
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:14,601
and chances are
we've got significant
plant and animal life,

370
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:17,365
so I want a lot
of nice low passes
across here.

371
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,418
I heard
the Pegasus survey mission
found wildlife.

372
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:31,397
Fruit trees,
rivers of milk and honey.

373
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,790
Yeah, you forgot the lakes
of ambrosia.

374
00:25:34,986 --> 00:25:37,250
Most of the planet
is actually pretty barren.

375
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:41,195
Plant and animal life
located in a temperate belt
around the equator.

376
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:45,615
But the best part is,
with all the dradis
interference from the nebula,

377
00:25:46,537 --> 00:25:48,505
the Cylons will probably
never find it.

378
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,852
BALTAR: Who cares about
this stupid planet anyway?

379
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,577
All this song and dance
over nothing.

380
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:05,877
Less than 20% of that place
actually supports
human life, so...

381
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,341
You're not seeing
the big picture.

382
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:10,276
This is your new home,

383
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,297
the place where
you will lead a new life.

384
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:14,186
This is the future, Gaius.

385
00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:16,086
Now, there's
a depressing thought.

386
00:26:17,865 --> 00:26:18,854
What's that?

387
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,585
Oh, nothing, Tom.

388
00:26:21,322 --> 00:26:22,619
Just...

389
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,325
Can you imagine
if we actually had to live
on that thing?

390
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:37,028
You are a genius.

391
00:26:38,025 --> 00:26:39,185
And?

392
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,770
Pay attention.
You're about to win
the election.

393
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:45,481
I'm sorry.
What were you saying, Tom?

394
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:49,033
We needed an issue,
something to set us
apart from Roslin,

395
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:52,330
something to put her
clearly on the wrong side
of a major issue

396
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,298
our people
care passionately about.

397
00:26:55,274 --> 00:26:56,298
This is it.

398
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,319
(CHUCKLlNG)

399
00:26:57,961 --> 00:27:00,429
Permanent settlement
on this planet.

400
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:08,081
Permanent settlement, here?

401
00:27:09,322 --> 00:27:10,812
Have you lost your marbles?

402
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:13,385
It may look dreary.
It may be dreary.

403
00:27:13,385 --> 00:27:15,178
But it's solid ground
under your feet

404
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:16,907
and real sky
over your head.

405
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:20,330
You'd be surprised
what a powerful idea
that is to people

406
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,698
cooped up in metal boxes
for nine months.

407
00:27:22,698 --> 00:27:24,461
You should
listen to him, Gaius.

408
00:27:25,097 --> 00:27:27,657
He's a smart, sexy man,
just like you.

409
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:30,449
Oh, give up.

410
00:27:32,298 --> 00:27:33,458
What?

411
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:36,530
Give up on Earth.

412
00:27:39,434 --> 00:27:40,594
Yes.

413
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,155
So we'd settle here.

414
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:52,562
Yes.

415
00:27:52,745 --> 00:27:54,110
(CHUCKLlNG)

416
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:01,933
(CHUCKLlNG)

417
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:04,759
You know,
it's starting to look

418
00:28:04,777 --> 00:28:07,041
Iike a lovely little planet
after all.

419
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:19,754
This is a rest stop,
a place to load up
on food and water.

420
00:28:19,754 --> 00:28:21,609
We're not
settling here, obviously.

421
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:22,769
You've heard
the captains' reports.

422
00:28:22,793 --> 00:28:25,129
Every ship in the fleet
has people begging, pleading,

423
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:27,017
demanding they get time
down on the surface,

424
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:28,873
even if it's only
for a few hours.

425
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,135
Well, a few hours
is one thing,

426
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:32,553
but permanent settlement's
quite another.

427
00:28:32,553 --> 00:28:35,529
Suddenly, Baltar
is holding out hope
of breathing real air,

428
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:38,794
growing real food,
sleeping in a bed
instead of a bunk,

429
00:28:38,794 --> 00:28:40,874
Iiving in a house
instead of a ship.

430
00:28:40,874 --> 00:28:43,754
It's a fantasy.
Look at the mission reports.

431
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:46,538
All the data indicate
that life on this planet
would be hard.

432
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:49,577
It would be a struggle
to even eke a living out
for a few years.

433
00:28:49,577 --> 00:28:52,746
Today's polls show
that he's also making
headway with the idea

434
00:28:52,746 --> 00:28:55,978
that because the planet
is hidden in a nebula,

435
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:58,742
it will provide
a refuge from the Cylons.

436
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:02,633
What, are we now assuming
that Cylon technology

437
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:06,345
is not sufficient enough
to find this planet?
We just found it.

438
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,710
Madam President,
in my opinion,

439
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:10,622
people vote their hopes,
not their fears.

440
00:29:11,177 --> 00:29:13,097
Baltar is offering them
what they want to hear,

441
00:29:13,097 --> 00:29:14,985
and you're offering them
a bitter reality.

442
00:29:14,985 --> 00:29:16,282
I'm offering them
the truth.

443
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:20,667
They don't want
to hear the truth.
They're tired, exhausted.

444
00:29:21,513 --> 00:29:24,809
The idea of stopping,
laying down their burdens

445
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:26,602
and starting a new life
right now

446
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:28,763
is what is resonating
with the voters.

447
00:29:29,482 --> 00:29:30,949
How well is it resonating?

448
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:34,883
It could turn
the entire election around.

449
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:41,600
Why are you running?

450
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,378
I'm not.

451
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:46,506
How long
are you gonna do this?

452
00:29:46,506 --> 00:29:48,361
How long are you gonna
refuse to see

453
00:29:48,361 --> 00:29:50,386
what's right in front
of your face?

454
00:29:52,201 --> 00:29:55,762
How... Forget it. I'm done.

455
00:29:56,777 --> 00:29:58,953
What? You're leaving?

456
00:29:58,953 --> 00:30:00,545
That's right. I'm done.

457
00:30:00,554 --> 00:30:02,886
I'm done dancing
around the truth with you.

458
00:30:03,273 --> 00:30:04,968
You know what's going on,

459
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,427
but you can't
or you won't face it, so...

460
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:11,089
I'm not a therapist.

461
00:30:11,114 --> 00:30:13,386
I'm not gonna hold your hand
and help you along.

462
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:15,785
I'm just trying to get you
right with yourself
and with your gods,

463
00:30:15,785 --> 00:30:17,275
but you're not willing
to do it.

464
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:18,654
But...

465
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:20,360
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

466
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:22,853
Oh, for gods' sake,
Chief, come on!

467
00:30:23,913 --> 00:30:25,346
You think you're a Cylon.

468
00:30:29,225 --> 00:30:30,852
I am not a Cylon.

469
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,928
Well, of course you're not,

470
00:30:37,257 --> 00:30:39,452
but that's
what you're afraid of,
isn't it?

471
00:30:39,593 --> 00:30:43,996
That you might be a Cylon
and not even know it,
just like Boomer, right?

472
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,037
Right?

473
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:51,518
That's the thought
that's torturing your dreams
and crippling your soul.

474
00:30:51,593 --> 00:30:56,257
"I'm a Cylon,
just like Sharon,
and I deserve to die."

475
00:31:00,841 --> 00:31:06,006
Sharon didn't know
what she was.

476
00:31:08,425 --> 00:31:11,594
She just kept thinking...

477
00:31:11,594 --> 00:31:15,894
Feeling that she was gonna do
this terrible thing,

478
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:19,440
but she knew
that she had to stop herself
before she did.

479
00:31:21,065 --> 00:31:24,228
And you think that's
what you're going to do,
some terrible thing.

480
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:27,583
Well, the truth is,
you might,

481
00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:29,623
but not
because you're a Cylon,

482
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,588
because you're a human being

483
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:34,585
and human beings
do terrible things
all the time.

484
00:31:34,665 --> 00:31:37,156
Well, how do you know
I'm human?

485
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,977
Oh, well, maybe
because I'm a Cylon,

486
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:42,844
and I've never seen you
at any of the meetings.

487
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:49,577
There's not much more
I can do for you.

488
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:51,562
You're gonna have
to go back to work

489
00:31:51,562 --> 00:31:53,655
and try and leave all of this
behind you.

490
00:31:55,753 --> 00:31:57,482
No, l...

491
00:31:58,697 --> 00:32:00,028
I can't.

492
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:03,775
I can't go back and face
the deck people again.
Are you...

493
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:06,012
And Cally!

494
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:09,483
Well, you better.
That's the only family
you've got.

495
00:32:09,993 --> 00:32:12,962
Just know that
that's your family
and that they love you.

496
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:16,409
Even Cally.
Especially Cally.

497
00:32:17,577 --> 00:32:21,417
If you doubt your humanity
and your essential nature
as a human being,

498
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:23,337
all you need to do
is look to them

499
00:32:23,337 --> 00:32:25,897
for the salvation
you've been seeking
from the gods.

500
00:32:26,473 --> 00:32:31,501
The gods lift up those
who lift each other, Chief.

501
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:41,261
SAR Team, Starbuck.
We are set here.

502
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:43,145
Stand by
for final jump to Caprica.

503
00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:45,929
Remember, we are going
very low to the surface.

504
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:51,094
Be prepared for wind shear,
rain, storms, anything.

505
00:32:51,401 --> 00:32:52,766
Roger that, Starbuck.

506
00:32:52,777 --> 00:32:54,005
Ready?

507
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:55,795
Ready.

508
00:32:57,449 --> 00:32:59,644
Here we go. Jump.

509
00:33:15,465 --> 00:33:18,093
SAR Team, Starbuck.
Form up on me.

510
00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:19,443
Copy that, Skipper.

511
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:21,546
Any Cylons, Helo?

512
00:33:22,185 --> 00:33:23,914
Nothing on dradis.

513
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:26,906
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

514
00:33:26,953 --> 00:33:30,249
We're missing a Raptor.
I'm only reading 17 out there.

515
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:33,946
We're missing Raptor 61 2.

516
00:33:34,697 --> 00:33:36,457
That's Toughguy
and Carousel.

517
00:33:36,457 --> 00:33:38,377
What, they jumped
to the wrong coordinates?

518
00:33:38,377 --> 00:33:39,867
No, no, no.

519
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:41,961
I'm picking up
their transponder,
so they made it.

520
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:46,505
Bearing 827 carom 443,
about a half click from here.

521
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:48,268
That would put them...

522
00:33:50,473 --> 00:33:51,770
Oh, my gods.

523
00:33:51,785 --> 00:33:53,343
Where, Helo? Talk to me.

524
00:33:56,937 --> 00:33:58,928
They jumped
inside the mountain.

525
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:03,217
Damn.

526
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:08,873
SAR Team, Starbuck.
We've lost Raptor 612.

527
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:10,636
We are proceeding
without them.

528
00:34:11,721 --> 00:34:12,779
Follow me.

529
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:14,003
Roger that, Starbuck.

530
00:34:21,961 --> 00:34:24,041
BALTAR: So I would think
that my position

531
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,473
and the position
of my campaign
is abundantly clear.

532
00:34:26,473 --> 00:34:27,497
Thank you.

533
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:29,577
McMANUS: Madam President,
you have 30 seconds
to respond.

534
00:34:29,577 --> 00:34:33,001
Well, my initial response is,
there he goes again.

535
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:34,857
Once again,
ladies and gentlemen,

536
00:34:34,857 --> 00:34:38,729
Dr. Baltar is distorting
the real issues before us.

537
00:34:38,729 --> 00:34:41,865
The issue here,
the real question, is not

538
00:34:41,865 --> 00:34:44,937
allowing the scriptures
to dictate the policy
of this government.

539
00:34:44,937 --> 00:34:49,931
The question is,
do the scriptures
contain real-world relevance?

540
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:54,793
Do they contain
the information necessary
to guide us to a safer home

541
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:56,553
than some
completely unknown planet

542
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,145
that we've
just now discovered?

543
00:34:58,153 --> 00:35:00,553
Obviously, my answer
to that question is yes.

544
00:35:00,553 --> 00:35:03,017
I have always
and will continue to feel

545
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,815
the scriptures hold
real-world relevance.

546
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:09,353
Mr. Vice President,
the next question is for you.

547
00:35:09,353 --> 00:35:11,657
How do you respond
to the charges

548
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:13,897
that you've seized the idea
of permanent settlement
on this planet

549
00:35:13,897 --> 00:35:15,849
as an opportunistic gamble?

550
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,824
Some would say
it's to be construed
as a desperate move

551
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:21,833
from a campaign
that was falling behind
in every poll.

552
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,198
Well, you know,
that is...

553
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:25,865
That is an excellent question,
in fact, Jim. Thank you.

554
00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:29,097
And I am only too glad
to have the opportunity
to respond to it.

555
00:35:29,097 --> 00:35:32,585
You see,
I have long been a proponent
in the search for Earth.

556
00:35:32,585 --> 00:35:35,945
The promise of perhaps
finding not only a new home

557
00:35:35,945 --> 00:35:37,469
but also the prospect
of discovering

558
00:35:37,481 --> 00:35:41,609
our long lost brothers
and sisters of the 13th Colony
is a powerful one,

559
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:44,201
and one I have believed in
heart and soul,

560
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:48,194
but the trouble is, the Cylons
continue to follow us

561
00:35:48,937 --> 00:35:51,561
as they have done
every step of the way

562
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:53,865
since the destruction
of the Colonies.

563
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:59,064
And if we have a chance
to change this dynamic,
to stop this deadly chase,

564
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:02,953
shouldn't we take it?
My answer is yes.

565
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,079
MAN: Oh, yeah. Come on.

566
00:36:04,105 --> 00:36:06,217
Thank you.
Madam President, 30 seconds.

567
00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:08,879
There's no assurance,
none whatsoever,

568
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:11,624
that the Cylons
don't already know
about this planet,

569
00:36:11,624 --> 00:36:14,185
that they don't make
regular stops here
looking for us,

570
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:16,905
and that, in fact, they aren't
simply waiting for us

571
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:18,395
to settle on the surface
so they can attack us...

572
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,065
I have to respond to that.
I simply have to respond
to that.

573
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:22,792
I'll give you 15 seconds.

574
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:24,350
What you've seen right now,
ladies and gentlemen,

575
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,797
is another example
of the President using fear
to drive her campaign.

576
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:30,927
Fear.

577
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:33,075
Fear of the gods.

578
00:36:33,897 --> 00:36:36,297
Fear of the Cylon.
Fear of fear itself.

579
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:38,288
Is it not time
to stop being afraid?

580
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:41,022
I'm asking all of us

581
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:46,364
to stop running from our lives
and start living them.

582
00:36:47,113 --> 00:36:48,137
Thank you.

583
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:50,409
Thank you. That is all
we have time for today.

584
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:53,416
I'd like to thank
both the candidates
for their frankness today.

585
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:54,610
A very exciting debate.

586
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:57,898
And this concludes
the cycle of the debates
for the Presidency.

587
00:36:58,185 --> 00:37:01,321
The polls will open
in three days. Please vote.

588
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:03,050
Thank you and good night.

Not your night, I guess.

591

Why don't you go

is campaign manager
for Dr. Baltar, Mr. Tom Zarek.

593
00:37:16,104 --> 00:37:18,601
Tom, welcome. You were
in there with us today.

594
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:20,125
What was your impression?

595
00:37:20,553 --> 00:37:24,421
ZAREK: Well,
I thought Dr. Baltar
did exceptionally well.

596
00:37:24,905 --> 00:37:26,167
Laid out
his vision of the future

597
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:28,809
and offered the people
a way to end
the suffering and terror

598
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:30,367
that defines
so many of their lives.

599
00:37:30,377 --> 00:37:32,617
On the other hand,
I found myself wondering

600
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:36,553
how Roslin's arguments
against settlement
could possibly win.

601

Watch your footing over here.
On me. Let's go.

602
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,816
Get up to that line,
right there.

603
00:38:19,816 --> 00:38:20,805
Got it?

604
00:38:24,297 --> 00:38:25,491
All right, hold it.

605
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:32,217
Let's figure out
where we are, Karl.

606
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:50,520
Resistance base camp
was still another click ahead.

a Kara Thrace there?

If there is, you tell her
she took her good sweet time
getting here.

We got Marines and Raptors.

We're gonna get
you and your people
out of here, okay?

As good as your word, huh?

00:40:08,648 --> 00:40:10,728
Yeah, good as
my frakking word.

619
00:40:10,728 --> 00:40:12,744
What, did you think
I was gonna leave you here?

620
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,633
Now you feel
like a big frakking idiot,
don't you?

621
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:17,129
All right, just shut up
and save us already, okay?

622
00:40:17,129 --> 00:40:20,809
Okay, people, this is nice,
but we have toasters
on our ass.

Where are the rest
of your people?

This is it.

this morning.

are between us
