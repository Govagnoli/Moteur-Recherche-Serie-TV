from Pegasus, sir.

173
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,242
They got you doing
courier runs now, huh?

174
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,310
Well, l...

175
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,213
I volunteered for this one.

176
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,721
Kara told me
about her...

177
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,253
Her mission.

178
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,231
Come to change my mind?

179
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,404
I just wanted
to hear it from you.

180
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,106
Decision's been made.

182
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,795
That's your decision?

183
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:30,068
That's how you resolve
your differences
with your superior officers?

184
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,767
If you're gonna
have some problem
backing up Starbuck,

185
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,138
I can find somebody else.

It's not about me
watching her back.

I'm not going
to debate this
with you.

188
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,882
This was
a very hard decision.

189
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,553
But I think
the President's right.

190
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,555
This is the best way
to safeguard the fleet.

You and the President?
This is...

00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,056
Yes.

194
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,305
She's made of sterner stuff
than people give her
credit for.

didn't feel comfortable

with our Marines
under your command.

217
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,354
Yeah.
Sorry about
a lot of things.

Be sure your Marines
and our Marines
are aware

of responsibility in case
we're boarded by the Cylons.

is Colonials
shooting at each other.

I've asked you here
to find out why
the Cylons hate us so much.

I'm not sure
I know how
to answer that.

227
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,670
I mean, "hate" might not be
the right word.

I don't want to
fence with you.

I just want to know why.

It's what you said
at the ceremony.

00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,887
Before the attack,
when Galactica
was being decommissioned.

232
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,887
You gave a speech.
Sounded like it wasn't
the one you prepared.

233
00:18:55,668 --> 00:19:00,230
You said that humanity
was a flawed creation.

234
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,933
And that people still
kill one another

235
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,744
for petty jealousy
and greed.

236
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,319
You said that humanity
never asked itself
why it deserved to survive.

00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,625
Maybe you don't.

That's all.

343
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,379
I think that's very wise, sir.

344
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,547
Thank you.

345
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,032
Commander, I wonder if my XO
is standing close by?

346
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:49,565
Yes, he is.

347
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:02,913
FlSK: Yes, sir.

348
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,615
Congratulations, Jack.

349
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,551
Thank you, sir.

350
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,666
That's all.

351
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,232
Yes, sir.

352
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,812
You look like
you could use a drink.

353
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:30,870
(SlGHlNG)

354
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:45,957
Thank you.

355
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,063
Oh, by the way,
there was something
I wanted to tell you.

356
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,898
Last night, I was walking
down this corridor here,
when I saw...

357
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,306
(NECK SNAPPlNG)

358
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,887
No, no, no.

359
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,063
I can't...
I can't do this.

360
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:24,024
Suicide is a sin.
But I need to die.

361
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:28,963
What you need is justice.

362
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:45,387
I know a place
where you can stay,
where you will be safe,

363
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,050
where I can
look after you.

364
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,148
Why?

365
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,326
Why would you do that?

366
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,559
Because I love you.

367
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:37,605
(SlGHlNG)

368
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,667
Tell me, Admiral,

369
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,639
can you roll over?

370
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,970
Beg?

371
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,006
Frak you.

372
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:27,585
You're not my type.

373
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:59,613
FlSK: And she died knowing
that her ship and her crew
were safe,

374
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,753
and that her mission
had been accomplished.

375
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:08,130
Nothing was more important
to her than her ship,
her crew, and her mission.

376
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:14,404
And as I take command
of Pegasus, I pledge
to uphold those values

377
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,667
that made her
such an effective
and heroic leader.

378
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:33,454
I only knew
Adm. Cain
for a short time.

379
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,255
So what I have
to say about her
will be short.

380
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,958
She faced things.

381
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:43,631
She looked them
right in the eye
and she didn't flinch.

382
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:48,071
That's something
that we do a lot
around here.

383
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,233
We second guess.
We worry.

384
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:56,144
When I think about
what she went through
after the attack...

385
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,776
All alone,

386
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,042
one ship, no help,

387
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:03,816
no hope...

388
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:07,324
She didn't give up.

389
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,458
She didn't worry.

390
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,793
She didn't second guess.
She acted.

391
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,261
She did what she thought
needed to be done,

392
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,030
and the Pegasus survived.

393
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,208
It might be hard to admit,

394
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,501
or hard to hear,

395
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:31,545
but I think that
we were safer with her

396
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,079
than we are without.

397
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,960
STARBUCK: Lee.

398
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,568
Lee, you okay?

399
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,408
Are you okay?

400
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,604
No. Not really.

401
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,479
Hey...

402
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,990
I broke my word to you.

403
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,654
What are you
talking about?

404
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:16,989
I let you down.

405
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,324
I wasn't there
when you needed me.

406
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:20,753
Look,

407
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,634
a close call like that...

408
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,802
That'd mess
with anybody's head.

409
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,102
All right?

410
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,878
It turns out I didn't
need you anyway, so...

411
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,082
Let's just be glad
that we both came back
alive, all right?

412
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,221
That's just it, Kara.

413
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,027
I didn't want to
make it back alive.

414
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,135
(SOBBlNG) I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

415
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,880
Same here.

416
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,283
BOOMER: So,

417
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,950
where do we go from here?

418
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,401
ROSLlN: So, how did the Cylon

419
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,336
manage to get off
the Pegasus undetected?

420
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,679
No one really knows.

421
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,148
There was so much chaos
in the aftermath
of the attack.

422
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,890
Thank the gods
that you did not have
to do what I advised.

423
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,687
That makes me
very happy.

424
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,655
Yes. Thank the gods.

425
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,220
How are you feeling?

426
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,795
Well, I could sleep
for about a year, but...

427
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,702
But you, however,

428
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:46,833
do not have that luxury
because you have a new job.

429
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:49,035
Billy?

430
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,810
It took a little while
to find that jeweler.

431
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:54,874
Thank you.

432
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:04,626
Rumor has it
that I know very little
about military protocol,

433
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,493
but I do believe

434
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:11,001
that someone who commands
more than one ship

435
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,900
is called an Admiral.

436
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,644
Congratulations,
Adm. Adama.

437
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,720
Thank you, Madam President.

438
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,620
Thank you, Billy.

439
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,763
I never gave up hope.

440
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:46,270
I just stopped trying
to get these a long time ago.

441
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,797
Just goes to show you, Bill,

442
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,138
never give up hope.

443
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:55,102
Same goes for you, Laura.

444
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:56,902
Hmm.

445
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,011
All right.
