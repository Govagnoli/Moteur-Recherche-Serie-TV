170
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,298
But what I really need
to complete the project...

171
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,397
Is a nuclear warhead.
Is a nuclear

172
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,803
warhead.

173
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,368
You're totally insane.

174
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,911
I'm trying to help you,
you idiot.

175
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,447
If Adama remains committed
to the destruction
of our child,

176
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,555
it may be
our only hope.

177
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,729
There's no easy way
to say this.

178
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,862
It's about the Cylon.

179
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,471
The President has decided
that her pregnancy
will be terminated.

180
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:23,864
What?

181
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,234
Why?

182
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,372
Doc Cottle
discovered some anomalies

183
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,646
in the fetal blood work.

184
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,317
Isn't that expected?

185
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,610
Maybe.

186
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,287
But the President
believes

187
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,588
that to allow the baby
to come to full term,

188
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:45,119
it constitutes
an unacceptable risk
to the fleet.

189
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,223
I don't understand.

190
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,498
Sharon's only helped us
since she came back
from Caprica.

191
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,004
She even turned on her own.

192
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,505
To save her life.

193
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,905
Don't mistake
the will to live

194
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,274
for genuine compassion,
Lieutenant.

195
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,314
She's still the enemy.

196
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,782
Does she know?

197
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,579
Not yet.

198
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,680
Then I should be the one
to tell her.

199
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:14,653
If that's all, sir.

200

to agree to the decision,

but I need you
to accept it.

203
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,969
We're talking about
my child, sir.

204
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,570
Part of me.

205
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,632
But I guess
it's easier to kill
when you call it a Cylon.

207
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,212

someone's been tampering
with our ammunition?

208

unload themselves.

209
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,419
What's this I hear
about you ordering

210
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,427
both Galactica
and Pegasus fighters
to stand down?

211
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,463
The price you pay
for reinstating me as CAG,
sir.

212
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:52,862
Maybe that was a mistake.

213
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,524
Maybe I don't give a damn
what you think, sir.

214
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,329
Take it easy,
both of you.

215
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,172
The fact is
we've been sharing stores
between the ships.

216
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,071
And nobody flies combat
until our ammo supplies
check out.

217
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,407
Leaving us defenseless
if the Cylons
decide to pick a fight.

218
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,744
We were defenseless
before this.
We just didn't know about it.

they were this organized.

how she got aboard my ship.

The hangar deck's
short-staffed.

some of the grunt work.

sends a signal to the Cylon

hear out their grievances,

long enough,

00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,143

I was prepared to let you.

Doctor, get the hell
out of here!

491
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,192
I must talk to you
concerning the Cylon child.

492
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,286
It seems I may have been

493
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:07,620
wrong,

494
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:09,932
very wrong,

495
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:14,632
when I said that
Dr. Cottle misinterpreted
the fetal blood work.

496
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,978
BALTAR: You see,
I had another look
at those samples

497
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,044
and I discovered something
quite intriguing.

498
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:34,657
Understand, Cylon blood
is virtually impossible
to differentiate from our own.

499
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,990
That being said,
obviously it has to be
slightly different

500
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,859
because the Cylon
is not human.

501
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,029
If our blood

502
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,534
Iooks like this,

503
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,803
for example,

504
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:55,936
and the Cylon's blood
looks like this,

505
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:04,521
then it's fair to assume
that the Cylon-human
is carrying an amalgam.

506
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,522
Is this a theory or fact?

507
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,584
The Cylon's fetus
contains no antigens,

508
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:11,993
it has no blood type.

509
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,896
That's what Dr. Cottle
was talking about when he said
it was damned odd.

510
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,298
Except it's not damned odd,
it's astonishing.

511
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,426
Now, knowing, as we do,

512
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,735
that the Cylons are built
slightly better to endure
than their human counterparts,

513
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:26,868
I wondered, could the Cylon
blood also be blessed,
shall we say blessed,

514
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,774
with a heightened resistance
to disease?

515
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,206
So

516
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,787
I applied a sample

517
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,922
of Sharon's fetal blood

518

Nothing.

That's the whole point.

522
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:59,443
The cancer was gone
and it was gone
within a matter of hours.

523
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,407
Are you saying
you've found a cure
for the President's cancer?

524
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,947
Well, it's untried.

525
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,450
It's obviously untried
and therefore
extremely dangerous.

526
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,748
But, yes,

527
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,952
it's possible.

528
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,390
If you abort
Sharon's fetus now,
you'll never know.

Now, you may feel
a sharp pain.

Sharon, it's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

I don't like
what you're doing.

532
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,146
I think it's unnatural
and damned dangerous.

533
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,781
Yes, well,

534
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,243
given the patient's
current condition,

535
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,948
I am not sure
that I see the downside.

536
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,347
Maybe it's just her time.

the beacon of hope
around here.

your people have to disengage.
