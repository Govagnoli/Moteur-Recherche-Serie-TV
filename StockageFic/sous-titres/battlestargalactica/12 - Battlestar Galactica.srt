1
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:23,271
<i>Previously, on Battlestar Galactica</i>

2
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,095
I'm promoting you to Captain.

3
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:27,194
I'm making you commander
of the Pegasus Air Group.

4
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:28,539
You're promoting me ?

5
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:30,615
I need a CAG with guts.

6
00:00:30,854 --> 00:00:32,787
We are the leaders of this fleet.

7
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:35,012
As such, we need to set an example.

8
00:00:35,206 --> 00:00:38,271
Oh, let's just cut through
the handholding, shall we ?

9
00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:40,976
Two of his men murdered one of my officers,

10
00:00:41,276 --> 00:00:43,134
while protecting a Cylon.

11
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:45,647
They're guilty, they admitted it.

12
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:48,762
And under regulations,
I have complete authority

13
00:00:48,934 --> 00:00:50,788
to try, convict, and sentence them.

14
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:54,516
And you and I both know that the
penalty for that crime is death.

15
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,980
I'm afraid there is only one end to this.
We've got to kill her.

16
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,612
Well, I see that you got it to eat.

17
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:04,753
That's progress, I suppose.

18
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:08,586
Can you get it to roll over... beg ?

19
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:13,002
Admiral, please !

20
00:01:13,794 --> 00:01:16,130
I thought you might like
a fresh set of clothes.

21
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:19,920
You know what I miss ?

22
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:21,232
Sports.

23
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:24,138
I used to go the pyramid court
just before game time.

24
00:01:24,556 --> 00:01:25,983
Scalp two tickets.

25
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:27,467
One for me, and one for you.

26
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,824
I always liked to feel
that you were there with me.

27
00:01:31,998 --> 00:01:34,890
The Cylons call this
their Resurrection ship.

28
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,813
At the moment, we are too far away
from the cylon home world

29
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,278
for the normal downloading process to work,
which is why they built this ship.

30
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:45,278
It contains the entire apparatus
necessary for Cylon resurrection.

31
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:48,067
Then any Cylon who dies out here...

32
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,475
Would be dead.

33
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:51,763
As in, really dead.

34
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:54,862
Our primary objective is a
Cylon vessel called Resurrection

35
00:01:54,946 --> 00:01:58,064
Our plan is to jump in
in the Blackbird stealth fighter

36
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,995
and take out the FTL drives
on the Resurrection ship,

37
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:02,428
preventing it from jumping away.

38
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,845
When the FTL is destroyed,

39
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:06,911
our attack squadrons will go
after the resurrection ship itself.

40
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,179
How many squadrons ?

41
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:11,195
All of'em.

42
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:16,320
Jack, I want to transfer a detachment
of marines to Galactica.

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,319
I have a mission for you, Kara.

44
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:19,818
Anything for you, you know that.

45
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,645
Position marines in key areas
throughout the ship...

46
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,587
I will ask for you over the wireless.

47
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:28,375
I will call you directly, and
when I have you on the line

48
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,906
and you hear me give
the command "execute case orange"

49
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:35,646
You are to terminate Adama's command.
Started with Adama.

50
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:37,433
I want you to pull out your weapon

51
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:40,755
and shoot Admiral Cain in the head.

52
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,333
48 HOURS EARLIER

53
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:12,547
This is a fracked-up thing

54
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,038
that I've been asked to do.

55
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:16,930
But we kill people for a living.

56
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,456
They say shoot, we shoot.

57
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:22,643
So you're gonna do this ?

58
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,098
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

59
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,208
Kara.

60
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:31,945
I could use some backup.

61
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:34,941
I'll understand if you can't.

62
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,691
You know better than that.

63
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:44,645
Yeah, I guess so.

64
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,153
People have to have this, Kara.

65
00:04:55,883 --> 00:04:57,019
Trust.

66
00:04:58,363 --> 00:04:59,637
Your word

67
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:01,273
and my word.

68
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,399
We don't have this, then...

69
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,273
we really are no different than the Cylons.

70
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:17,605
Thank you.

71
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:38,821
Oh, looky here.

72
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,358
Sunshine boys are here.

73
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:54,153
You know, the man you killed saved
my life and the lives of 50 other men,

74
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:55,351
you miserable frack.

75
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,062
You,

76
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:00,102
You call me "sir".

77
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:02,450
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:06,394
So I guess you were both getting your poles
greased by that filthy little robot girl ?

79
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:11,502
I'm sorry. I don't think
I quite heard that right.

80
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:15,957
The glass. I can't hear you.

81
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,925
So, why don't you open the door, come in,

82
00:06:21,193 --> 00:06:23,052
and we'll talk about it in here.

83
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:27,006
That's a great idea, Chief.

84
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,433
They really want to do things.

85
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:31,143
Hands over your head.

86
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,714
- Hey, hey, hey, slow down !
- On your knees, on your fracking knees !

87
00:06:35,585 --> 00:06:36,648
Slow it down, slow it down

88
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:38,230
Just think about what you're doing here.

89
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,216
Just think about what we're doing here, guys.

90
00:06:40,294 --> 00:06:41,487
What the frack is this ?

91
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:42,905
Don't worry, sir.

92
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,515
We'll take it real slow, Sir !

97
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,596
See, the gut,

98
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:49,519
that's a vulnerable area.

99
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,559
Lieutenant Thorne told me that, once.

100
00:07:52,865 --> 00:07:56,705
He said if you really want to do some
damage without leaving a mark,

101
00:07:56,874 --> 00:07:58,245
go for the gut.

102
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,007
You'd be surprised what you can do
with the simplest things.

103
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,428
Bar of soap,

104
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,842
plain old towel.

105
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:09,722
How bad could it be, right ?

106
00:08:14,554 --> 00:08:15,653
You'd be surprised.

107
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:18,285
Cowards.

108
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:20,636
Cowards ?

109
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:22,820
Is that what you said ?

110
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:24,942
Now give me that.

111
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:27,150
You know what, I lied.

112
00:08:27,244 --> 00:08:28,938
I'm not going slow anymore.

113
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:33,337
Attention on deck !

114
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,457
Gage, Vireem !

115
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:41,543
Out of the cell, standing tall.

116
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:42,714
Right here !

117
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:47,313
Remove the restraints from the prisoners.

118
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:53,316
Specialist Gage, let me ask you something.

119
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:56,083
Those men in there,
are they wearing colonial uniforms ?

120
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:57,106
Yes, sir.

121
00:08:57,219 --> 00:09:00,034
Specialist Vireem, do you agree
with Specialist Gage here

122
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:02,644
that those are, in fact, colonial officers ?

123
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,536
Yes, sir.

124
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,684
- They killed lieutenant--
- Shut your frackin'mouth !

125
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:14,392
You see, I don't quite understand
what I just saw

126
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:17,654
because I think I saw you two
knuckledraggers

127
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:22,331
treating those men like they were cylons,
which of course, couldn't be right because,

128
00:09:23,153 --> 00:09:24,748
if in fact, that was the case,

129
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:28,903
then you're both subject to
charges of assaulting a chief

130
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,470
and a lieutenant under color
of authority in a time of war, which if

131
00:09:33,671 --> 00:09:35,249
I'm not mistaken,

132
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,571
carries a penalty on this ship
that is quite severe.

133
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,179
Now, get the hell out of here.

134
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,926
- Sir.
- Sir.

135
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,572
Get out.

136
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,802
Yes, sir.

137
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:04,753
Sir.

138
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:14,416
Thank you.

139
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:18,055
Thank you, Colonel.

140
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:20,430
I don't want your thanks.

141
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:24,719
I owe Lieutenant Thorne my life,

142
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,554
as do many people on this ship.

143
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:31,494
He was trying to rape a prisoner.

144
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:36,233
You can't rape a machine, Lieutenant.

145
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:54,012
- You drink, Thrace ?
- Only to excess, sir.

146
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:58,970
Only to excess ?

147
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,806
Learn that from Colonel Tigh, did you ?

148
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:04,222
Not exactly.

149
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:07,546
I understand you belted him once.

150
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:09,989
Yeah...

151
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:13,369
That was something that I did
without really thinking.

152
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:16,314
Don't apologize.

153
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:19,505
Some people get exactly
what they deserve.

154
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,594
From what I read about your XO,

155
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:24,672
maybe he needs to get popped
in the mouth every once in while, hmm ?

156
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,306
I know you're very close with Adama.

157
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:39,284
Yes, sir.

158
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:42,073
And I know he's a good man.

159
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:47,394
And I know he's had to make some very hard
choices over the last few months.

160
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:48,985
Lord knows I have.

161
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:51,909
Then maybe you can understand why he did
what he thought he had to do

162
00:11:51,947 --> 00:11:54,603
when you said you were going
to execute Helo and Tyrol.

163
00:11:57,172 --> 00:11:58,662
Let me tell you something.

164
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,380
I've had to watch a lot of kids
be put into body bags.

165
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,087
They're covered with flags
and they float out that airlock.

166
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:11,105
You think I don't understand
his feelings towards his men ?

167
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,071
Sometimes terrible things have to be done.

168
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,318
Inevitably,

169
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:28,957
each and every one of us
will have to face a moment

170
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,401
where we have to commit that horrible sin.

171
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:36,187
And if we flinch in that moment,
if we hesitate for one second,

172
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,936
if we let our conscience get in the way,
you know what happens ?

173
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,602
There are more kids in those body bags.

174
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:46,609
More kids floating out that airlock.

175
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:51,752
I don't know why...

176
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:56,044
but I have a lot of faith in you.

177
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:00,762
And I want you to promise me

178
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:04,972
that when that moment comes
you won't flinch.

179
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,488
Do not flinch.

180
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:26,758
Come in.

181
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:33,365
Courier run from Pegasus, sir.

182
00:13:36,512 --> 00:13:38,591
They got you doing courier runs now ?

183
00:13:38,964 --> 00:13:40,120
Well, I...

184
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:41,993
I volunteered for this one.

185
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:47,320
Kara told me about her...

186
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:49,986
her mission.

187
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:54,811
Come to change my mind ?

188
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:56,792
Just wanted to hear it from you.

189
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,724
Decision's been made.

190
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:18,124
Assassination.

191
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:21,324
That's your decision.

192
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:27,491
That's how you resolve your differences
with your superior officers.

193
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:31,093
If you're gonna have some problem

194
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:34,078
backing up Starbuck,
I can find somebody else.

195
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,361
It's not about me watching her back.

196
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:44,062
I'm not going to debate this with you.

197
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:46,645
This was a very hard decision.

198
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:49,498
But I think the President's right.

199
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:52,251
This is the best way to
safeguard the fleet.

200
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,732
The president ?

201
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:59,579
- So you and the president...
- Yes.

202
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:05,139
She's made of sterner stuff
than people give her credit for.

203
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:06,811
Is this all I have to sign ?

204
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:10,577
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

205
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:13,514
Thank you, sir.

206
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:17,164
Lieutenant.

207
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:21,465
It's good to see you.

208
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:37,849
<i>Attention Pegasus.</i>

209
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,521
<i>Jump prep underway.</i>

210
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:42,002
<i>Viper pilots report to ready room
in five minutes.</i>

211
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:44,752
<i>Decoy squadrons, check in with CIC.</i>

212
00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:58,729
<i>Fire control,
set parameters for cylon base ship.</i>

213
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,989
<i>Upon jump completion,
target cylon base ships.</i>

214
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,131
Let's go.

215
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:13,897
<i>All resurrection strike squadrons,</i>

216
00:16:13,952 --> 00:16:16,203
<i>report to mission briefing
in ready room four.</i>

217
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:35,561
<i>Make ship ready for combat jump.</i>

218
00:16:35,615 --> 00:16:37,388
<i>Set condition one throughout the ship.</i>

219
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:47,968
- Good hunting, Captain.
- You too, Colonel.

220
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,661
Sorry about this, Saul, but

221
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:02,429
the Admiral didn't feel

222
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:04,477
comfortable with our marines
under your command.

223
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:06,637
Yeah. Sorry about a lot of things.

224
00:17:07,246 --> 00:17:09,178
Be sure your marines
and our marines are aware

225
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:11,824
of their areas of responsibility
if we're boarded by the cylons.

226
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:15,000
The last thing we need is
Colonials shooting at each other.

227
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:17,360
Amen to that.

228
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,620
Wait outside.

229
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:33,816
Yes sir.

230
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,921
Sit down.

231
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:07,432
I've asked you here to find out why
the Cylons hate us so much.

232
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:17,460
I'm not sure I know
how to answer that.

233
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,583
I mean, hate might
not be the right word.

234
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,862
I don't want
to fence with you.

235
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,498
I just want to know why.

236
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,845
It's what you said
at the ceremony

237
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,072
before the attack

238
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:41,983
when Galactica
was being decommissioned.

239
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,580
You gave a speech
that sounded like

240
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,627
it wasn't the one you prepared.

241
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:52,381
You said

242
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,426
that humanity was
a flawed creation.

243
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,755
And that people still

244
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,074
kill one another

245
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:05,574
for petty jealousy and greed.

246
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:11,213
You said that humanity never asked itself
why it deserved to survive.

247
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:19,691
Maybe you don't.

248
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:37,833
Resurrection ships firing
up their FTL drives.

249
00:19:37,868 --> 00:19:39,509
They're getting ready to jump.

250
00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:50,118
Don't anyone look out of the window
right now, please.

251
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,651
Starbuck, Apollo.

252
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,062
Target's FTL is history.
She's all yours.

253
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:08,776
<i>Roger that, Apollo xxx</i>

254
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:21,199
Sir, I just received
an emergency transponder from the Blackbird.

255
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:23,822
It's the auto-distress beacon.

256
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:27,354
Alert the search and rescue Raptor.

257
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:29,823
See if he had time to eject.

258
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:34,111
Attention on Pegasus.
Prepare to launch attack squadrons.

259
00:20:34,754 --> 00:20:35,780
Copy to Galactica.

260
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:36,681
Aye, sir.

261
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:39,763
<i>Attention on Galactica.
Prepare to launch attack squadrons.</i>

262
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:43,172
<i>Starbuck, Pegasus.
Resurrection Ship Twelve low at fifteen.</i>

263
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:46,541
Watch your intervals.

264
00:20:57,929 --> 00:20:59,382
Take your posts.

265
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:09,389
<i>Engaging cylon Raiders</i>

266
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:12,640
<i>Fleece look down I got'em.</i>

267
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:14,525
<i>Nice work. Zero, one.</i>

268
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,217
<i>- Hang on ! Take a shot !
- Fraking toasters !</i>

269
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,083
<i>Cover me I can't shake him.</i>

270
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:27,867
- Mr. Gaeta.
- Sir ?

271
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:31,222
Order batteries Alpha through Echo

272
00:21:31,385 --> 00:21:33,292
to switch to salvo fire.

273
00:22:44,935 --> 00:22:46,532
<i>Set secondary battery.</i>

274
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:48,412
<i>Full attack mode. Fire at will.</i>

275
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,866
Tens of thousands of cylons
are about to die.

276
00:23:11,788 --> 00:23:15,372
Tens of thousands, Gaius.
God will not forgive this sin.

277
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:18,696
Do you think god will forgive us ?

278
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:22,362
God forgives all.

279
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:25,679
Don't listen to her.

280
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:27,237
You think she can help you ?

281
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:31,527
You think that that broken woman can
offer you even a fraction of what I can ?

282
00:23:32,232 --> 00:23:34,007
I know god's plan for you.

283
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,461
I know how to help you fulfill your destiny.

284
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:43,764
Do you know what I miss most ?

285
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,307
You're going to laugh when I tell you this.

286
00:23:49,355 --> 00:23:50,376
Sports.

287
00:23:50,885 --> 00:23:51,964
Don't do this.

288
00:23:52,043 --> 00:23:53,259
Yeah, that's right.

289
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,317
I used to love getting to
the pyramid game just before tip-off.

290
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,458
By timing it right,

291
00:23:59,827 --> 00:24:01,937
I could sit down right at the horn

292
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:07,337
and then let the emotion of the crowd
flood over me.

293
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:10,288
Waves and waves of it.

294
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:13,443
Like electric current.

295
00:24:15,124 --> 00:24:16,291
That's beautiful.

296
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:18,724
And I always had two tickets.

297
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:20,248
No.

298
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,823
One for me,

299
00:24:23,124 --> 00:24:24,124
Please.

300
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:28,034
and one for you.

301
00:24:54,215 --> 00:24:55,611
Apollo, Galactica,

302
00:24:56,191 --> 00:24:57,176
do you read ?

303
00:24:57,592 --> 00:24:59,602
Apollo, Galactica,
do you read ?

304
00:25:00,226 --> 00:25:02,092
Can you say your position ?

305
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,104
<i>Apollo, Galactica,
do you read ?</i>

306
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,463
<i>Can you say your position ?</i>

307
00:25:15,943 --> 00:25:17,863
<i>Apollo, Galactica,
do you read ?</i>

308
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:22,186
Apollo, Galactica,
do you read ?

309
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:24,758
Can you say your position ?

310
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:29,007
<i>Apollo, Galactica, are you reading this ?</i>

311
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:32,417
<i>Are you out there ?</i>

312
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:47,676
<i>Apollo, Galactica, do you read ?</i>

313
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,784
<i>Can you say your position ?</i>

314
00:25:54,268 --> 00:25:56,378
<i>Apollo, Galactica, do you read ?</i>

315
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,043
<i>Apollo, Galactica, are you reading this ?</i>

316
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:07,097
Are you out there ?

317
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,037
I'm sorry Kara.

318
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:38,470
Captain Thrace is reporting
massive detonations.

319
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:40,911
The resurrection ship has been destroyed.

320
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:41,903
Yes !

321
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:51,753
They've done it.

322
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:56,269
Clear.

323
00:28:02,287 --> 00:28:03,505
<i>He's all right.</i>

324
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:06,550
<i>He's a little shaken. But, I say again,</i>

325
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:08,501
<i>Apollo is all right.</i>

326
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:16,085
All the remaining cylons have jumped way.

327
00:28:16,123 --> 00:28:17,454
It's over, sir.

328
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,599
Congratulations, gentlemen.

329
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:40,035
I'm ready to die.

330
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,872
Send my soul to God.

331
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:47,043
Please.

332
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,940
I wish you were here, Lee.

333
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,203
Oh, what the hell.

334
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:51,559
I am so very proud of you.

335
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,989
Secure for condition one.
Set condition two throughout the ship.

336
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:02,141
Division officers, submit casualty
and damage report to combat.

337
00:30:04,997 --> 00:30:07,785
- Glad we didn't need your marines today.
- Yeah.

338
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:08,982
Yeah, me too.

339
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,403
Signal from the flagship, sir.

340
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:14,797
Admiral Cain on the line.

341
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,187
Put her through.

342
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:26,239
Congratulations, Commander.

343
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:29,002
Congratulations to you too, Admiral.

344
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:30,830
A significant victory.

345
00:30:34,537 --> 00:30:36,253
Is starbuck with you ?

346
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:38,031
Yes, she is.

347
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:48,791
This is starbuck.

348
00:30:48,828 --> 00:30:52,435
<i>I've been thinking about what
we talked about before.</i>

349
00:31:02,352 --> 00:31:04,395
It's not enough to survive.

350
00:31:07,113 --> 00:31:09,660
One has to be worthy of surviving.

351
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:14,077
That's all.

352
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:19,506
I think that's very wise, sir.

353
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:22,957
Thank you.

354
00:31:39,135 --> 00:31:42,275
Commander, I wonder if my XO
is standing close by.

355
00:31:42,324 --> 00:31:43,358
Yes, he is.

356
00:31:55,718 --> 00:31:56,676
<i>Yes, sir ?</i>

357
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,473
Congratulations, Jack.

358
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,401
Thank you, sir.

359
00:32:11,282 --> 00:32:12,278
That's all.

360
00:32:13,861 --> 00:32:14,803
Yes, sir.

361
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,499
You look like you could use a drink.

362
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,469
Thank you.

363
00:32:40,513 --> 00:32:42,871
Oh, by the way, there was something
i wanted to tell you.

364
00:32:42,908 --> 00:32:46,029
Last night, I was walking down
this corridor here when I saw--

365
00:33:09,426 --> 00:33:11,405
No ! No, no.

366
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:13,975
I can't--I can't do this.

367
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,778
Suicide is a sin.

368
00:33:16,157 --> 00:33:17,564
But I need to die.

369
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,494
What you need...

370
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:22,957
... is justice.

371
00:33:35,191 --> 00:33:37,236
I know a place where you can stay,

372
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:39,404
where you will be safe.

373
00:33:39,777 --> 00:33:41,582
Where I can look after you.

374
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:43,189
Why ?

375
00:33:44,176 --> 00:33:45,988
Why would you do that ?

376
00:33:46,497 --> 00:33:48,386
Because I love you.

377
00:34:58,982 --> 00:35:00,747
Tell me, Admiral...

378
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:03,757
Can you roll over ?

379
00:35:05,544 --> 00:35:06,480
Beg ?

380
00:35:11,973 --> 00:35:13,846
Frack you.

381
00:35:20,164 --> 00:35:21,712
You're not my type.

382
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:50,486
And she died knowing that her ship
and her crew were safe

383
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,451
and that her mission
had been accomplished.

384
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,003
Nothing was more important to her
than her ship,

385
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,866
her crew, and her mission.

386
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:04,885
And as I take command of Pegasus
I pledge to uphold those values

387
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,741
that made her such an effective

388
00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:09,304
and heroic leader.

389
00:36:20,748 --> 00:36:23,891
I only knew Admiral Cain
for a short time,

390
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,830
so what I have to say about her
will be short.

391
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:30,317
She faced things.

392
00:36:30,844 --> 00:36:33,977
She looked them right in the eye
and she didn't flinch.

393
00:36:36,032 --> 00:36:38,296
That's something that we do a lot
around here.

394
00:36:39,652 --> 00:36:41,143
We second-guess.

395
00:36:41,793 --> 00:36:43,115
We worry.

396
00:36:43,822 --> 00:36:46,930
When I think about what she went through
after the attack...

397
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:48,447
all alone,

398
00:36:49,466 --> 00:36:51,635
one ship, no help,

399
00:36:53,022 --> 00:36:54,312
no hope...

400
00:36:56,183 --> 00:36:57,836
She didn't give up.

401
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:00,988
She didn't worry.

402
00:37:01,036 --> 00:37:02,880
She didn't second-guess.

403
00:37:03,444 --> 00:37:04,819
She acted.

404
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:07,805
She did what she thought
needed to be done,

405
00:37:07,843 --> 00:37:09,563
and the Pegasus survived.

406
00:37:12,803 --> 00:37:14,590
Might be hard to admit,

407
00:37:16,586 --> 00:37:18,316
or hard to hear,

408
00:37:18,717 --> 00:37:21,279
but I think that we were safer
with her...

409
00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:24,851
than we are without.

410
00:37:42,565 --> 00:37:43,650
Lee.

411
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:47,194
Lee, you okay ?

412
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:50,978
Are you okay ?

413
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:54,298
No, not really.

414
00:37:59,762 --> 00:38:00,584
I...

415
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:04,372
I broke my word to you.

416
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,324
- What are you talking about ?
- I let you down.

417
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:09,847
I wasn't there when you needed me.

418
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,498
Look...

419
00:38:13,141 --> 00:38:14,746
A close call like that...

420
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,055
that would mess with anybody's head.

421
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:22,601
All right ?

422
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,269
It turns out I didn't need you anyway.

423
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:29,489
So...

424
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:36,267
Let's just be glad that we both
came back alive, all right ?

425
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,553
That's just it, Kara.

426
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:44,818
I didn't want to make it back alive.

427
00:39:29,072 --> 00:39:31,900
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

428
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:35,110
Same here.

429
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:44,696
So...

430
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:47,487
Where do we go from here ?

431
00:40:00,252 --> 00:40:02,930
So, how did the cylon

432
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:06,981
manage to get off the Pegasus
undetected ?

433
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:09,614
No one really knows.

434
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,862
There was so much chaos
in the aftermath of the attack.

435
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:17,383
Thank the Gods that you did not
have to do what I advised.

436
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:19,088
That makes me very happy.

437
00:40:19,907 --> 00:40:22,256
Yes, thank the Gods.

438
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:24,835
How are you feeling ?

439
00:40:26,673 --> 00:40:29,196
I could sleep for about a year.

440
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:33,304
But you, however,

441
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:37,468
do not have that luxury
because you have a new job.

442
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:39,493
Billy.

443
00:40:42,116 --> 00:40:44,199
It took a little while
to find that jeweler.

444
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:45,479
Thank you.

445
00:40:50,276 --> 00:40:51,971
Rumor has it

446
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:55,062
that I know very little
about military protocol

447
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,758
but I do believe

448
00:40:57,116 --> 00:40:58,453
that...

449
00:40:58,511 --> 00:41:01,382
someone who commands
more than one ship

450
00:41:01,697 --> 00:41:03,617
is called an admiral.

451
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:17,269
Congratulations, Admiral Adama.

452
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:25,220
Thank you, Madame President.

453
00:41:27,427 --> 00:41:28,880
Thank you, Billy.

454
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:34,139
I never gave up hope, I just

455
00:41:34,216 --> 00:41:37,282
stopped trying to get these
a long time ago.

456
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,375
Just goes to show you, Bill.

457
00:41:41,034 --> 00:41:42,592
Never give up hope.

458
00:41:43,557 --> 00:41:45,716
Same goes for you, Laura.

459
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:51,516
Right.
