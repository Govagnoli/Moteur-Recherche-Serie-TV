she was human.

Two Centurions
patrol out front.

The third bullet-head
walks the perimeter.

180
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:23,115
The bullet-head
walking perimeter makes
random changes to his patrol.

Be tough to get past him.

182

I met here. A man.

I loved him
and I think he could've
loved me eventually.

243
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:58,539
Half a cigarette should
give us two or three minutes
to get the frak out of there.

Any longer and we risk
them finding the charges
before they go off.

just to nail
a couple of dozen skin jobs.

You know, we can't kill them.

into a new body, and...

that when they download,
they remember everything,

00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:25,803
right up until the end.

255

are gonna remember being blown

of connection to him.

what do we do with it?

Do?

297
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:50,762
What are you suggesting?

298
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,286
That we throw it out
of an airlock?

299
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,698
I don't make
suggestions, Mr. Baltar.

300
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:57,642
If I want to toss a baby
out an airlock, I'd say so.

301
00:18:57,642 --> 00:19:00,490
Well, it's really gratifying
to know that infanticide
is not on the table.

302
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,730
Do I have to point out
that this is not a baby?

303
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,822
It's a machine.

304
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,512
No, it's half machine,
half human.

305
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:08,938
I suggest we all
keep that half in mind.

306
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:12,499
The Cylons went through
a great deal of trouble
to create this thing.

307
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:18,346
It should go without saying
that if it's good for them,
it's gonna be bad for us.

308
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:20,490
I completely agree.

309
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,306
And I take it as a given,
we can't turn it over
to Sharon to raise.

310
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:25,193

to consider here.

this thing's been born,

make a play for it.

to work with you,

knowing that you'd
tell me the truth?

335
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:24,264
She knew I had feelings
for Gaius.

336
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,641
Knew that I had trouble
letting go of him.

337

it would trigger
those feelings,

very interested in you.

524
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:41,954
Leave him alone.

525
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,247
Sharon,

526
00:34:45,161 --> 00:34:47,152
you're a hero of the Cylon.

527
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:51,194
Now you're just
a broken machine
who thinks she's a human.

528
00:34:58,089 --> 00:34:59,818
But you're not a human,
Sharon,

529
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:02,651
and you never will be.

530
00:35:02,889 --> 00:35:05,187
Yeah, well,
at least I'm not a murderer.

531
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:07,506
I have a conscience.

532
00:35:07,529 --> 00:35:10,657
And I know the difference
between right and wrong.

533
00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:16,683
A murderer is exactly
what you are.

534
00:35:22,345 --> 00:35:26,111
Life is short,
but the next one's not.

535
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:31,093
Let your heart adrift
and your soul will get caught.

536
00:35:31,177 --> 00:35:32,405
I love you, Gaius.

537
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:35,382
My heart and soul are yours.

(CRASHlNG)

539
00:35:42,377 --> 00:35:43,674
They're nearly here.

540
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:48,646
You know why they wanted you
to work with Sharon?

541
00:35:49,225 --> 00:35:50,852
So you'd lose your mind.

542
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:53,166
They're gonna box you,
darling.

543
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:55,321
Just like
they're gonna box Sharon.

544
00:35:57,769 --> 00:35:58,997
We're dangerous.

545
00:36:00,073 --> 00:36:01,062
What?

546
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:02,451
Sharon and l.

547
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:05,733
We're celebrities
in a culture based on unity.

548
00:36:06,057 --> 00:36:07,046
No.

549
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:13,379
Our voices count.
More than hers.
More than others'.

550
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:16,297
We're two heroes
of the Cylon, right?

551
00:36:16,297 --> 00:36:18,731
Two heroes
with different perspectives
on the war.

552
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:21,753
Perspectives based
on our love
of two human beings.

(SNlFFLlNG)

554
00:36:23,273 --> 00:36:25,129
That's why she wanted me
to work with you,

555
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:27,461
so that you'd tell me
that Gaius was still alive.

556
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:30,229
And she wanted me
to lose my mind.

557
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:36,454
No, you're corrupted
by your experiences.

558
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,939
D'ANNA: You're a waste.

559
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:46,252
Believe the lies,

560
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,597
ignore the truth.
Listen to me,
I will show you the proof.

561
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,832
Speak from your heart.

562
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:56,585
Say the things
that you know to be true.

563
00:36:56,713 --> 00:36:57,873
Genocide,

564
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,947
murder, vengeance,
they're all sins
in the eyes of God.

565
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:04,093
That's what you and I know.

566
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:06,441
That's what
they don't wanna hear.

567
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:09,501
Because then they'd have to
rethink what they're doing.

568
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:14,857
They'd have to consider
that maybe the slaughter
of mankind was a mistake!

570

571
00:37:37,064 --> 00:37:38,531
We'll see you again soon!

572
00:37:47,305 --> 00:37:48,294
Here.

573
00:37:51,913 --> 00:37:53,244
Looks like
they're almost here.

574
00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:55,519
You should get out
of here while you can.

575
00:37:55,529 --> 00:37:57,865
The fresh air coming in
might lead you out.

576
00:37:57,865 --> 00:37:59,423
Is this some kind of trick?

577
00:38:00,457 --> 00:38:02,516
You can stay and be tortured
if you want.

578
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:03,750
Your call.

What kind of people are you?

I don't know.

BOOMER: Hey, wait.

583
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,502
How long till she downloads
and tells them what happened?

584
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:41,721
We had a lot of people
in the cafe.

585
00:38:42,377 --> 00:38:45,210
At least 36 hours
till they get to her.

586
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:46,923
Long enough.

587
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:47,941
Long enough for what?

588
00:38:48,297 --> 00:38:49,889
To change things
for the better.

589
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:52,866
What are you talking about?

590
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:04,104

more in my life

than I love you now.

a new beginning.

A new way to live
in God's love.

595

Without hate.

596

Without all the lies.

597

All they need is
for someone to show
them the way.
