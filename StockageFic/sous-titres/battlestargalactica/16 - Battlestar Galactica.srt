<i>Previously
on Battlestar Galactica...</i>

2
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,400
Hi, um...

3
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:27,667
we're-we're kinda lost again.

4
00:00:27,701 --> 00:00:30,967
We're trying to get
to the CIC. Could you-

5
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:32,400
alking,
no talking, please.

6
00:00:32,434 --> 00:00:33,801
No cheating.
Hold it up a little higher.

7
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:38,534
Eight.
Sneaky.

8
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:39,901
Nine.

9
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:41,467
Uh... start again.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,867
You lost track.
Zero.

11
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:53,667
I've asked you here
to find out

12
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:56,467
why the Cylons
hate us so much.

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,068
It's what you said
at the ceremony.

14
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,867
<i>That humanity
was a flawed creation.</i>

15
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:05,600
And that people still
kill one another

16
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:07,734
<i>for petty jealousy
and greed.</i>

17
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,534
HmYosaid that humanity
never asked itself

18
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:13,634
why it deserved to survive.

19
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:15,134
Maybe you don't.

20
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:24,101
<i>Sleeper... agents...</i>

21
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:27,834

22
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:32,534
<i>Takeover by brute force...</i>

23

<i>Cylon impregnation...</i>

24
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:43,634

<i>suicide bombings...</i>

27
00:01:54,168 --> 00:02:04,134
assault on natural resources.

one of the known Cylon models</i>

29
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:08,000

30
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,868
<i>Admiral Adama
has made no comment</i>

31
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,900
<i>on this situation.</i>

32
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:11,900
<i>We will continue to-</i>

33
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:18,768
How the hell did this
get out to the press?

34
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:20,967
<i>I'm surpri
it didn't happen sooner.</i>

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
m told you've been meeting
with her regularly,

36
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:25,801
allowing her to interact
with members of your crew.

37
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:27,000
<i>She's a military asset,</i>

38
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:30,000
providing us with vital
strategic intelligence.

39
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,900
While we pray
that she's not somehow...

40
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,534
colluding
with other Cylons.

41
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:34,834
If I felt for one second

42
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:37,234
<i>that she posed some kind
of a threat to this fleet,</i>

43
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:38,900
I'd pull the trigger
on her myself.

44
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:39,900
<i>I think the fleet</i>

45
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,300
may need to hear that,
Admiral.

46
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,467
Even more,
they need ve it.

47
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:51,234
Someone took theto vitamins
this morning.

48
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:52,868
Yeah, I don't know
what got into me.

49
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,267
No, you're right.

50
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,501
Keeping Sharon Valerii alive,
allowing her pregnancy

51
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:57,501
to continue-

52
00:03:57,534 --> 00:03:59,100
There is no road map
for any of this.

53
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:00,267
Somebody,

54
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,267
somebody has got to keep
asking the hard questions.

55
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,768
I agree. I wanna stay ahead of this.

56
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:06,234
Acknowledge the Cylons'
existence, and then make...

57
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:08,434
some kind of case for her
to stay aboard Galactica.

58
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:09,933
I don't think
that's gonna work.

59
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,100
What?
Why?

60
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:12,634
I think you need
to trust the people.

61
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,834
Use the press,
tell them the truth.

62
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:16,967
I mean, we barely know
anything about the Cylons.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,401
And until we learn more,

64
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:20,534
we're not gonna destroy
the only source of information

65
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:22,033
that we have, period.

66
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:25,033
Period.
That simple, huh?

67
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,401
Uh... well...

68
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,367
Um, could I-
could I have a minute?

69
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:36,434
Sure.
Important? Mm-hmm.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
You were saying
about the hard questions...

71
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,267
I know it's just my

72
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,900
debate team ring,
but it's the best I could do.

73
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,167
This... this really isn't
how I planned it.

74
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,367
Anyway, um...

75
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,067
Billy...

76
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,567
I love you.

77
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:14,334
I've loved you since-
since the first day I met you.

78
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,868
I mean, you were half naked,
granted...

79
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,601
I know that I kind of
blindsided you with this.

80
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:27,768
Okay? I mean, it doesn't have
to be tomorrow.

81
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:30,234
We can take our time.

82
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,900
Billy, I can't marry you.

83
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:46,501
I don't know how else
to say it.

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,667
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,100
<i>He pulled out that ring...</i>

86
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:16,634
and it was like
an electric shock.

87
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,801
I could barely say anything.

88
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:21,567
Well, maybe you're regretting

89
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:23,801
that you didn't say yes.

90
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:27,834
No.

91
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:30,967
I don't know what to make
of me and Billy, but...

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,401
I know I can't marry him.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,467
Then again, I don't know what
to make of you and me either.

94
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:51,534
'Scuse me.

95
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,001
Hey, two more.

96
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:17,300
<i>Coming right up.</i>

97
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,034
Ellen.

98
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,667
<i>It's, uh...
it's... good to see you.</i>

99
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:24,600
It's good to see you,
Captain.

100
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:40,701
Dee.

101
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:42,168
Billy.

102
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,034
I didn't know
you were coming down here.

103
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:47,034
I, um... I grabbed
a two-day rotation.

104
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,001
I thought I'd grab
some R & R.

105
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:51,734
I'm on business,
as usual.

106
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Captain Adama.

107
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:11,500
Oh...

108
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:13,233
I really am an idiot,
aren't I?

109
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:15,134
No, Billy-
Don't.

110
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,200
Don't bother. Can you give us a minute?

111
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,534
<i>No, you know what?
Have a seat, Captain.</i>

112
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,400
Be my guest.

113
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:25,534
Billy, I'm sorry.

114
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,734
I thought if anything,

115
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:42,001
we were honest
with each other.

116
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,200
But you knew you were gonna
be here with him today,

117
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:45,734
and you let me propose
to you. I didn't-

118
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,634
I know that giving you
that ring was stupid.

119
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,467
That's fine.

120
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,534
And maybe this wasn't
gonna work out between us.

121
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,801
But this...

122
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,134
You should've told me
about this.

123
00:09:57,168 --> 00:10:00,101
Well, it's hard, you know?

124
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:03,233
To choose the people
we fall in love with.

125
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:06,101
To love only one person
at a time.

126
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:09,034
People like us...

127
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,434
<i>are more complicated.</i>

128
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:13,001
Us?

129
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:15,867
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:18,634
I'm here with friends.

131
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:26,200
Ellen, you're a regular
here, right?

132
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:27,367
<i>You ever see
that woman before?</i>

133
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,634
<i>In the corner?</i>

134
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:33,434
Oh... only when I came in
and wondered

135
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,333
when they were gonna start
enforcing a dress code.

136
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,134
Ellen, the bathroom's
over here.

137
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:52,068
Are you serious?

138
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:54,901
Let's go.

139
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,300
Lee Adama,
you amaze me.

140
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,300
Shh.

141
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:28,034
This is it now.

142
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:29,867
You ready?

143
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,001
Yes.

144
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:40,567
We're with you.

145
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,701
Do it.

146
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:05,767
Everybody by the bar!

147
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:07,001
Now! Move!

148
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:10,701
You, you-t up against the bar

149
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:11,967
Oh, my gods.

150
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,867
Three men, one wan,
all armed.

151
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:18,834
<i>Is it true</i>

152
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,367
the Fleet knows
I'm on Galactica?

153
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,367
I'm interested
in navigational weaknesses.

154
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,567
<i>Worm holes, dark matter
blind spots.</i>

155
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,767
Likely ambushes.

156
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:30,134
I would avoid
these pulsar pointers

157
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:32,767
because of dradis
interference.

158
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:34,734
<i>If I was gonna plan
an ambush, I'd do it there.</i>

159
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:37,233
<i>It depends, Admiral.</i>

160
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:39,701
They adapt to your every move.

161
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:41,701
Every move
triggers a counter-move.

162
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:43,534
Adapt.

163
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:45,667
That's what
you're good at, right?

164
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:49,068
Why won't you
answer my question?

165
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,101
Does the Fleet know

166
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:52,801
<i>I'm on Galactica?</i>

167
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:56,701
<i>Mm.</i>

168
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:01,168
It's the baby.
She's kicking.

169
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,634
The Fleet knows.

170
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,867
That'll be all
for today.

171
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:06,967
Guards.

172
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:27,901
You know, if people knew
how much you've relied

173
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:29,834
on that thing's
so-called intelligence,

174
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:31,600
they'd be scared
out of their wits.

175
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:33,367
What about you, Saul?

176
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,034
Are you afraid of her?

177
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:38,701
You know,
the truth is...

178
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,600
I don't like the way
it gotten under your skin.

179
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,034
What are you doing?

180
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:01,534
What are you doing?

181
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:05,134
The pressure hatch can withstand
explosive decompression.

182
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:07,400
The only way help's getting in

183
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:09,534
<i>is with a raft
of high explosives.</i>

184
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:16,200
Or we could just let
these clowns

185
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,134
open the pressure door for us.

186
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:20,300
There's bound to be a security
force on its way soon.

187
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,500
Open the door for us?

188
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:22,901
Why would they do that?

189
00:14:22,934 --> 00:14:23,034
Gimme your drink.

190
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:25,267
Let me talk to them.

191
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,767
The ice-
I need the dry ice.

192
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,801
Okay, stay calm.

193
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:36,634
<i>Ellen!</i>

194
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,600
<i>Please don't shoot.</i>

195
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:39,801
Who are you?

196
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:40,801
Ellen Tigh.

197
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,233
<i>Get over here. Now.</i>

198
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,034
<i>Move.</i>

199
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:49,500
<i>We are not criminals.</i>

200
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:51,967
We are members of the Fleet,
just like you.

201
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:54,600
My husband's XO of Galactica.

202
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:59,734
<i>You've just made the worst
mistakes of your life.</i>

203
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,334
Colonel Tigh, Admiral-

204
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:06,834
you need to hear this.

205
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:13,134
<i>Saul-</i>

206
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,834
Ellen? What's wrong?

207
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:16,134
<i>They're holding us hostage.</i>

208
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,700
They're threatening
to kill us!

209
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:22,301
<i>My name is Sesha Abinell.</i>

210
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:25,900
<i>I have seized control
of the Cloud Nine lounge...</i>

211
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:27,334
<i>and held the people in it
hostage.</i>

212
00:15:27,368 --> 00:15:28,468
What do you want?

213
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,934
What I want...

214
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,967
<i>This is not about...
what I want.</i>

215
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:41,533
The Colonial Fleet

216
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,234
<i>has become
a Cylon-occupied territory.</i>

217
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:48,667
<i>You are working in collusion
with a Cylon agent-</i>

218
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,468
<i>The very same model
of a Cylon</i>

219
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,667
<i>who tried to murder you,
Admiral Adama,</i>

220
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,700
<i>on your own ship.</i>

221
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:57,600
We want Sharon Valerii.

222
00:15:57,633 --> 00:16:00,234
<i>You have two hours.</i>

223
00:16:04,468 --> 00:16:08,301
Get me everything you can
on Sesha Abinell.

224
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,334
Yes, sir.

225
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:18,567
<i>Sesha Abinell...</i>

226
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:20,401
<i>Fleet records indicate
she's the widow</i>

227
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:22,034
<i>of a Ray Abinell.</i>

228
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:24,034
He was a casualty aboard
the Greenleaf freighter

229
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,967
when the Cylons hit it
about ten weeks ago.

230
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,867
Widow.

231
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,668
Who do we have
aboard Cloud Nine?

232
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:33,833
Uh, rotation schedule shows...

233
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,833
Captain Adama,

234
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:37,100
<i>half a Marine squad,</i>

235
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:39,234
<i>and Starbuck's already there
on R & R.</i>

236
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:40,734
Get me Starbuck
right away.

237
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:41,933
Yes, sir.

238
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:47,800
Hell, one of you beauties has
got to be an O-2 sensor.

239
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,467
And I'm guessing it's you.

240
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,167
Take a sip
of carbon dioxide.

241
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,933
There was another guy
at the bar.

242
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:20,200
Check the back.
We don't want any more mistakes.

243
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:22,967
Kern, ere's anawful lot
of military types here.

244
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,367
<i>And that's why we're here.</i>

245
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:26,067
To get Galactica's
attention, remember?

246
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,267
Page.

247
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,634
You go.

248
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:34,301
No problem.

249
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:46,267
Good to see ya, Gunny.

250
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:47,467
I'm gonna need
some of those gorillas

251
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,800
you call Marines.

252
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,100
Most of my gorillas
are already here, sir.

253
00:18:51,134 --> 00:18:52,933
<i>Just trying to cop
a little R & R.</i>

254
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,134
Tell me about it.

255
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,100
All right,
here's what we know.

256
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,434
We got an unknown number
of shooters

257
00:18:57,467 --> 00:18:59,034
at least 20 hostages.

258
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,234
And about a 90-minute window

259
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:01,900
before they start
throwing out bodies.

260
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,601
You got a plan, sir?

261
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:05,034
Lock and load.

262
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,933
Let's figure out the rest
as we go along.

263
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,234
Put your weapon down.

264
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:20,501
Tell them.

265
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,534
He says he's Captain Adama
from the Galactica.

266
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:26,100
<i>He just wants to talk.</i>

267
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:28,567
Talk, that's it.
Just talk.

268
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,434
<i>They're together.</i>

269
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:50,867
Put it down.

270
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,933
Or she dies.

271
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:55,501
Hey, she dies, he dies,
you get it?

272
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:58,534
Difference is,
you won't do it.

273
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:00,100
He will.

274
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,668
Okay?

275
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:42,067
We all have someone
we care about.

276
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,067
It's his son.

277
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:48,000
He's not gonna choose the Cylon
over his son.

278
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:50,301
<i>Get in line with the others.</i>

279
00:21:16,334 --> 00:21:18,701
CO-2 is through the roof.

280
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:20,634
They're trying
to suffocate us.

281
00:21:20,668 --> 00:21:23,601
What is this, a trap?

282
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:25,933
<i>There's a reason
you don't just start shooting</i>

283
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,501
on a spaceship.

284
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:28,833
You probably nicked a line.

285
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:31,768
<i>Why don't you let me
talk to the Admiral,</i>

286
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,067
see if we can't
find a way out of this?

287
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,234
<i>I've got</i>

288
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:38,867
two strike teams
inbound to you.

289
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,267
ETA ten minutes.

290
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:42,267
We'll have plenty of fire power,
so that's good.

291
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,467
But I'm concerned
with limited accesedints.

292
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,167
<i>Admiral.</i>

293
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,768
<i>It's Abinell.</i>

294
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,267
<i>Keep Starbuck
on the line with us.</i>

295
00:21:53,301 --> 00:21:55,434
Adama.

296
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:57,634
We're losing oxygen.

297
00:21:57,668 --> 00:22:00,301
If it's not restored,
the hostages die.

298
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:06,701
Then you'll all die.

299
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:08,034
Because this is over.

300
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:12,501
Not until the Cylon's dead.

301
00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:15,634
I'm willing to die
to see this through.

302
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,534
You willing to risk
your son's life?

303
00:22:21,668 --> 00:22:23,067
Son of a bitch.

304
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,668
Suddenly you're listening.

305
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:26,701
<i>Gods damn it,</i>

306
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:27,768
give her what she wants!

307
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,267
<i>Give her the Cylon!</i>

308
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:33,234
You're all alone
on this, Admiral.

309
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:36,100
<i>I'm not gonna sacrifice
a military asset</i>

310
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:37,833
on your altar of revenge.

311
00:22:37,867 --> 00:22:39,768
What are you talking about?

312
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,200
This isn't a-

313
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,701
<i>You said this was about us
being played by the Cylons.</i>

314
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:46,234
<i>But it isn't.</i>

315
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:49,100
<i>It's about the loss of your
husband, and I understand that.</i>

316
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:53,200
<i>It's about you wanting
to strike back,</i>

317
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:54,634
<i>and I understand that too.</i>

318
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:57,567
But we've all lost people
that we care about.

319
00:22:57,601 --> 00:22:59,067
An learn to live with it.

320
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,601
<i>I am sure
you are aware, Admiral,</i>

321
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:04,367
of the concrete evidence...

322
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:07,668
that Caprica's defenses
were compromised

323
00:23:07,701 --> 00:23:09,301
by a Cylon agent

324
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:11,501
who infiltrated
the Ministry of Defense

325
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:12,933
on the eve of the attacks.

326
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:16,334
People look
for complicated answers

327
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,567
when something terrible
happens.

328
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:21,701
<i>Maybe we were just
caught by surprise</i>

329
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,501
and were beaten.

330
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:26,000
And maybe we have to learn
to live with that.

331
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:28,334
<i>And maybe you are
just missing the point.</i>

332
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,900
You were infiltrated.

333
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:33,000
You.
The military.

334
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:36,200
And you are being infiltrated
again right now.

335
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:38,334
You can sit there and pretend
you know what you're doing,

336
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:40,100
but you do not.

337
00:23:40,134 --> 00:23:41,833
You are being played.

338
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:44,267
And the rest of us do not want
to go down with your ship.

339
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:47,034
<i>I want this air system
restored right now.</i>

340
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:50,567
<i>One person comes in alone,
fixes it, leaves.</i>

341
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,034
Anything goes wrong,

342
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,534
somebody gets hurt,

343
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:54,768
it's on your head.

344
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:04,234
Keep a direct line open
to Cloud Nine.

345
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:06,134
What do we do?

346
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:08,967
We repair the air system.

347
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,601
Saul, we can't
give her Sharon.

348
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:20,900
I hope you
know that, right?

349
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:23,100
I know that.

350
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:25,867
We can't start dealing
with the terrorists.

351
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,668
We start now,
it'll open the floodgates,

352
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:30,301
and it'll never stop.

353
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,367
But by the way,

354
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:36,000
it's not "Sharon".

355
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:37,534
It's a frakkin' Cylon.

356
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:42,000
You don't think I know that?

357
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:45,401
I think there's part of you that
looks into that thing's eyes

358
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:47,301
and still sees that yo trl

359
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:51,434
that reported aboard two years
ago as a rook pilot.

360
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:53,067
Well, it's not.

361
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,334
<i>It never was.</i>

362
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:57,933
Bill, it's a machine.

363
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:00,401
<i>Admiral?</i>

364
00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:01,467
It's Captain Thrace.

365
00:25:05,334 --> 00:25:06,567
Sitrep.

366
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:08,234
<i>I had one
of the Cloud Nine techs</i>

367
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:10,234
double-check the oxygen feed
in there.

368
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:11,833
There's nothing wrong
with the air.

369
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:13,100
<i>Could be a glitch.</i>

370
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:14,067
Or maybe someone screwed

371
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,800
with one of the CO-2 censors
inrs bar.

372
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,567
Lee.

373
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,067
Why?

374
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,567
<i>Maybe he's giving us
an opening.</i>

375
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:22,800
If I can get someone inside,

376
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:24,267
get a clear idea
of what we're dealing with-

377
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:26,768
<i>Kara, this is a recon mission.</i>

378
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,134
<i>Get someone to volunteer.</i>

379
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:30,167
Then you assess the situation.

380
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,401
<i>And then get the hell out of
there. Do you understand?</i>

381
00:25:32,434 --> 00:25:33,734
Yes, sir.

382
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,701
<i>I'm here to repair
the O-2 line.</i>

383
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,334
Captain, what
are you doing?

384
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:48,534
Volunteering.

385
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:50,100
Let me see that.

386
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:05,134
<i>Close the hatch.</i>

387
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:06,734
<i>Search her.</i>

388
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:08,000
You might not want
to do that.

389
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:10,000
You're running out
of air in here.

390
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:38,134
Looks clean.

391
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:40,334
Do your job.

392
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,067
Cover her.

393
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:58,134
<i>Wait a minute.
Turn around slowly.</i>

394
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:01,701
Check the box again.

395
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
We're hot.
Let's go.

396
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,367
Get down!
Get down!

397
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:39,100
We gotta get out!

398
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:40,768
Now!
Come on!

399
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,967
Billy.

400
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
<i>Billy.</i>

401
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,434
I need shirts, towels-

402
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:26,567
anything I can use as a bandage.

403
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:32,200
Billy!

404
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:38,100
<i>Nobody said you could move.</i>

405
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,634
You still want the Cylon?

406
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:43,267
<i>Do you?</i>

407
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:44,501
Because if
the admiral's son dies,

408
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:46,701
you're not gonna get a deal,
you get that?

409
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:49,434
If he dies, you're not
gonna get what you want.

410
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,601
He's right.

411
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:55,501
Let him go.

412
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:11,401
Sir, it's Starbuck.

413
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:14,734
We got a report of gunshots.
What's happening?

414
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:17,100
My cover was blown.
I had to move.

415
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:18,668
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:20,234
<i>Any casualties?</i>

417
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:21,701
<i>Two marines.</i>

418
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:26,267
<i>Probably KIA...</i>

419
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:28,301
At least one of the gunmen...

420
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:32,567
And Lee.

421
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,034
It was crazy in there,
confused.

422
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:42,534
<i>He got hit.</i>

423
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:43,800
How bad?

424
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:46,367
I don't know.

425
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:47,467
<i>Stand by.</i>

426
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:49,167
Hold your position.

427
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,933
Make no move unless
you hear from me.

428
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:52,634
<i>It was friendly fire.</i>

429
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:55,833
Lee got hit
by friendly fire.

430
00:29:57,601 --> 00:30:00,067
I think it was me.

431
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:21,474
I gotta stop
the bleeding.

432
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:23,407
I can't tell
if it hit an artery,

433
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:24,974
or...

434
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:26,740
Lee?

435
00:30:26,773 --> 00:30:28,141
Don't leave me.

436
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:29,474
Lee, Lee.

437
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:30,807
Don't leave me, okay?

438
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,640
Please.

439
00:30:32,673 --> 00:30:33,640
Hey.

440
00:30:33,673 --> 00:30:35,640
<i>He's gonna be okay.</i>

441
00:30:35,673 --> 00:30:40,807
He's gonna be okay.

442
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,207
<i>Just hang in there, come on.</i>

443
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,307
Stay with me.

444
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:48,407
Please, stay with me.

445
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:09,541
<i>Are you playing with us?</i>

446
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:12,407
Are you playing with me?

447
00:31:12,441 --> 00:31:15,074
I've saved the ship.

448
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,508
Saved you.

449
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,107
How many times now?

450
00:31:19,141 --> 00:31:22,174
<i>Five? Six?</i>

451
00:31:22,207 --> 00:31:24,940
You just can't believe
I'm not plotting against you.

452
00:31:24,974 --> 00:31:28,207
<i>You know that there are Cylons
within this Fleet.</i>

453
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:29,773
You know what they look like.

454
00:31:29,807 --> 00:31:31,307
<i>You know where
to find them.</i>

455
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:32,541
<i>If I were to ask you,</i>

456
00:31:32,574 --> 00:31:35,673
would you tell me
who they are?

457
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
No.

458
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:45,007
That I believe.

459
00:31:57,341 --> 00:31:58,574
He'll be all right.

460
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,940
Thanks for the concern.

461
00:32:04,974 --> 00:32:06,541
<i>She loses a husband,
and suddenly the world</i>

462
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:08,773
<i>owes her an explanation.</i>

463
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:11,673
He was a good man.

464
00:32:11,707 --> 00:32:14,773
And he wasn't just her husband.
He was my brother.

465
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:18,241
My brother died on Picon.
He was a good man too.

466
00:32:19,974 --> 00:32:23,074
They're all good men.

467
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,441
<i>The Abinell woman sent over
a manifesto to the press</i>

468
00:32:29,474 --> 00:32:31,474
before they took over
the bar.

469
00:32:31,508 --> 00:32:34,307
It's mostly a collection
of rumor and conspiracy theories

470
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:36,441
about Cylons in the military
and the government.

471
00:32:36,474 --> 00:32:37,974
Bunch of crap.

472
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:39,307
It's getting
a lot of attention.

473
00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:40,574
We gotta get our people
out of there.

474
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:42,074
You have Marines
on Cloud Nine.

475
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:43,241
<i>Pressure door</i>

476
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:46,007
to the room has been resealed.

477
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,141
If we try blowing it open,
we'll need so much G-4,

478
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,174
<i>we'd risk killing
everyone inside.</i>

479
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:51,207
<i>There are no options</i>

480
00:32:51,241 --> 00:32:53,107
left except for one.

481
00:32:53,141 --> 00:32:54,740
<i>No.</i>

482
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:57,040
We don't strike deals with
terrorists. We can't.

483
00:32:57,074 --> 00:32:58,074
We give them Sharon Valerii,

484
00:32:58,107 --> 00:32:59,907
<i>we're inviting terrorism</i>

485
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,474
and we weaken our position
permanently, you know that.

486
00:33:02,508 --> 00:33:05,074
<i>Gentlemen, everyone in that
room is someone's son,</i>

487
00:33:05,107 --> 00:33:07,374
<i>someone's wife,
someone's mother.</i>

488
00:33:07,407 --> 00:33:08,907
Billy is the closest thing

489
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,040
that I have to family
left in this world.

490
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,807
And if you don't think
that that...

491
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,807
confuses things emotionally
for me-

492
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,940
<i>Let's not be naive.</i>

493
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:18,608
What if they're right?

494
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,707
What if Sharon
has been playing us all,

495
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,007
plotting our destruction
with every passing day?

496
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,907
<i>What if the terrorists
are right?</i>

497
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,773
This isn't about Sharon.

498
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:28,608
<i>It's about something
much bigger than that.</i>

499
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,773
<i>It's about the long-term
survival, it's about the way</i>

500
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:34,107
we conduct ourselves
in all of this.

501
00:33:34,141 --> 00:33:35,107
<i>Sir?</i>

502
00:33:35,141 --> 00:33:39,940
It's Abinell on the line.

503
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:41,174
How's my son?

504
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:42,907
<i>Alive.</i>

505
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,040
<i>But my friend is dead.</i>

506
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:47,274
<i>So are two of your soldiers.</i>

507
00:33:47,307 --> 00:33:49,040
<i>And your son's dying.</i>

508
00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:51,541
You know, I thought
a long time about this.

509
00:33:51,574 --> 00:33:54,307
About what I'd do...

510
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:56,740
about how far I'd go...

511
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:59,107
<i>And I honestly did not know</i>

512
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:01,840
<i>until this moment...</i>

513
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,074
Chu.

514
00:34:04,107 --> 00:34:07,274
What?

515
00:34:07,307 --> 00:34:08,541
What?
Get on your feet.

516
00:34:08,574 --> 00:34:09,874
What are you gonna do?

517
00:34:09,907 --> 00:34:13,640
Saul, give them
what they want!

518
00:34:13,673 --> 00:34:15,773
<i>It's just a machine!</i>

519
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:21,474
They're gonna kill her.

520
00:34:23,474 --> 00:34:25,673
Hold your fire.

521
00:34:27,907 --> 00:34:31,274
I'm giving you the Cylon.

522
00:34:31,307 --> 00:34:32,773
But you won't be alive.

523
00:34:32,807 --> 00:34:33,773
<i>What does that mean?</i>

524
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:35,441
That is not the deal.

525
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:37,307
<i>It means
that you've convinced me</i>

526
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,274
that wy
have been played.

527
00:34:39,307 --> 00:34:42,407
And if that be the case,
and she's been playing with me,

528
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:44,508
<i>then I can't take
any more chances.</i>

529
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,441
So you make up your mind.

530
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:48,640
<i>If you wanShon Valerii,</i>

531
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:50,107
<i>you can have her.</i>

532
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:52,541
But on my terms.

533
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:54,608
<i>I give you the body,</i>

534
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,673
<i>you give me the hostages.</i>

535
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,274
Done.

536
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:06,773
Cut the wire.

537
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:51,241
Admiral.

538
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,408
Let me help.

539
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,907
Please.

540
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:57,141
Let me take it
from here.

541
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:01,341
Let's go.

542
00:36:10,707 --> 00:36:12,774
<i>Stop looking at him, Billy.</i>

543
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,341
I can see you watching him.

544
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:19,440
I know you think
you can get that gun.

545
00:36:19,473 --> 00:36:22,440
<i>I'm only thinking in case
something happens. No.</i>

546
00:36:22,473 --> 00:36:25,374
You're not a soldier.

547
00:36:25,408 --> 00:36:27,774
You're not trained for that.

548
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:29,141
<i>You've got nothing
to prove.</i>

549
00:36:29,174 --> 00:36:30,674
I know.

550
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:40,440
They're right outside.

551
00:36:40,473 --> 00:36:42,740
We open up,
they'll give us the body.

552
00:36:42,774 --> 00:36:43,974
Okay.

553
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:46,607
<i>We're opening the door.</i>

554
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,007
<i>But if anything goes wrong...</i>

555
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,374
we start killing
hostages.

556
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:51,573
Do it.

557
00:37:30,774 --> 00:37:32,141
It's over.

558
00:37:32,174 --> 00:37:33,840
Wait-

559
00:37:35,941 --> 00:37:38,074
<i>This isn't right.</i>

560
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,573
This one's been dead
for weeks.

561
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,540
Their Cylon is still alive.

562
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,141
Kill the girlfriend.

563
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:26,740
Down, report.

564
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,107
All clear.

565
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,840
I need help over here!

566
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:44,041
Medic!

567
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:45,174
Lee.

568
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:46,274
Lee, can you hear me?

569
00:38:46,308 --> 00:38:49,274
Lee!

570
00:38:49,308 --> 00:38:51,074
Can you hear me, Lee?

571
00:38:51,107 --> 00:38:52,674
Come on, son.

572
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:54,740
Come on, hurry up.

573
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:01,974
That's good.

574
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:07,740
Billy.

575
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,540
No.

576
00:39:17,573 --> 00:39:21,408
Billy.

577
00:39:59,974 --> 00:40:01,840
<i>Is this what you gave 'em?</i>

578
00:40:01,874 --> 00:40:05,774
It was a calculated risk.

579
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:08,840
It wasn't worth it.

580
00:40:48,507 --> 00:40:50,174
Oh, dear.

581
00:40:55,473 --> 00:40:58,207
Well, that's better.
That's better.

582
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,774
He was so young.

583
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,507
Hey.

584
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,374
Hey...

585
00:41:23,408 --> 00:41:25,408
<i>What is it?</i>

586
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,074
Nothing.

587
00:41:28,107 --> 00:41:31,107
When you're feeling better,
we can talk.

588
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:34,141
This was a hell
of a vacation.

589
00:41:34,174 --> 00:41:37,740
Yeah.

590
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:45,408
Lee?

591
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,507
Lee, you can't leave.

592
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,707
You have to stay.

593
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,674
You have to really stay.

594
00:41:55,707 --> 00:41:57,440
You understand?

595
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:08,707
It's okay.

596
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,807
I'll be here when you wake up.

597
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,840
I'll be right here.
