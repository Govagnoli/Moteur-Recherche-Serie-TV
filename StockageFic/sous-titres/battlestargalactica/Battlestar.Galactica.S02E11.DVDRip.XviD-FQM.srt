MAN:
This is the Battlestar Pegasus

3
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,293
to the ship claiming to be
the Galactica.

4
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,385
Please respond.

5
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:29,622
TlGH: Pegasus?

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,960
How can that be?
The entire fleet
was destroyed.

7
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,602
Adm. Cain.

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,764
On behalf of the officers
and the crew of the Pegasus,

9
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,407
welcome back
to the Colonial Fleet.

10
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,507
The Cylon fleet is composed
of two base ships,

11
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:49,447
about a dozen
or so support ships
and one large vessel

12
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,007
that we are still
unable to identify.

13
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,016
It's this large ship here
that I'm interested in.

14
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,488
I'm going to integrate
the crews.

15
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:01,551
I thought you said
you had no desire
to interfere with my command.

16
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,428
I'm Laird, Pegasus Deck Chief.

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,491
You're an
aeronautical engineer?

18
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,661
Yeah, I was.

19
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,567
So you're really a civilian?

20
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:15,206
I was on the Scylla
and we got picked up
by the Pegasus.

21
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,301
Things happen.

22
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,309
How much time do I have?

23
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,711
Weeks, a month at the outside.

24
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,947
Will I be able to work?

25
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,651
Unless the cancer
goes to your brain.
If that happens, you...

26
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,456
CAlN: We have
our own Cylon prisoner.

27
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,655
NO. 6: She's obviously been
abused. Tortured.

28
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,288
Will you help her, Gaius?

29
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,266
You really want to get close,

30
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:44,327
you got to use
the stealth ship we
constructed aboard Galactica.

31

It's gonna be hard as hell
to see on dradis.

Starbuck,
you're off this mission.

33
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,776
A surveillance package?

34
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:56,407
Go get the Blackbird,
take some pretty pictures
of our Cylon ship.

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,910
Who the hell's this Thorne?

36
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,350
GAGE: Lt. Thorne, sir.

37
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,319
Your little robot girl
is in for quite a ride.

38
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,258
TYROL: Get off her!

39
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,887
...either of you
frakking move! Don't move!

40
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,899
They've been found guilty
on all counts.

41
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,232
She's going to execute
them both for murder
and treason.

42
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,864
Galactica is launching Vipers
and a Raptor.

43
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,067
Why are you launching Vipers?

44
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,810
I'm getting my men.

45
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,348
Launch the alert Vipers.

46
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:57,475
KAT: Galactica, Kat. I've got
inbound Pegasus Vipers
coming right at me.

47
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,875
Request instructions.

48
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,380
We've gotta let 'em
defend themselves.

49
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,450
We should turn our main
batteries on Pegasus.

Admiral, sir,
she's gotta be a Raider.

Well, how the frak
did it get in so close
without being detected?

so let's just be friendly.

stealth ship of yours.

112

cleared to launch.

a passenger back here.

It's the Blackbird, Galactica.

it's the Blackbird.

116
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,893

is the Blackbird
doing out there?

00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,759
It's Starbuck.
She launched in the Blackbird
a couple hours ago,

119
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,133
said she was running
flight tests for Adm. Cain.

120
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,865

We're receiving a download,

130
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,841
That is the Cylon fleet.

131
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,401
Are these from our
recon mission?

132
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,136
No, sir. The recon mission
was aborted.

133
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,544
These are from Blackbird.

134
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,646
Thrace.

135
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,683
She took off
and did the whole
recon mission alone.

136

My gods,
look at these shots, Jack.

137
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:25,253
She put her nose
right up their backsides,
and they never even knew it.

138
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,857
Admiral, I still have
Commander Adama on the line,

139
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,494
and our fighters are still
requesting instructions.

140
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,037
Should they resume the attack?

141
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,686
All right. Joint recall.

142
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,417
Both ships stand-down
to Condition Two.

143
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,954
Then I want you to report
to me directly. In person.

144
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:57,354
I have no intention
of cooling my heels
in your brig.

145
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,126

Be there in 15 minutes.

148
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,103
Stand-down, Condition Two.

149
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:26,982
There you are.

150
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,182
ROSLlN: Let's start this
by admitting an ugly truth.

151
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,748
What happened out there today
was the result of failure
in leadership

152
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,852
of everyone in this room.

153
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,056
We are the leaders
of this fleet.

154
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,325
As such, we need
to set an example.

155
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,028
We cannot continue
to let the conflicts
between us...

156
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:46,004
Oh, let's cut through
the hand-holding, shall we?

157
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,939
Two of his men murdered
one of my officers

158
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,033
while protecting a Cylon.

159
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,102
They're guilty.
They admitted it.

160
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,606
And under regulations
I have complete authority

161
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,446
to try, convict
and sentence them.

162
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,511
And you and I both know
that the penalty
for that crime is death.

163
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,884
Admiral, surely
the spirit of the law

164
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:11,328
requires something more here
than summary executions.

165
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,231
Is this what the two of you
have been doing
for the past six months?

166
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,805
Debating the finer points
of Colonial law?
Well, guess what?

167
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,538
We're at war.

168
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:30,212
And we don't have the luxury
of academic debate
over these issues.

169
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,641
You want to cut through it,
fine.

170
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,049
You have Pegasus,
he has Galactica.

171
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,861
Two heavily armed,
very powerful warships.

172
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:45,089
Now, I am sure that Pegasus
would prevail in any fight.

173
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,099
I wouldn't count on that.

174
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,270
ROSLlN: But certainly
there'd be heavy damage,

175
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,932
and you'd take
significant casualties.

176
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:58,535
So you can go out there
and fight it out
with Galactica,

177
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,408
or you can compromise.

178
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:04,347
And those are
the only two options
on the table, period.

179
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:13,556
How the two of you
have survived this long,
I will never know.

180
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,198
All right. Lt. Thrace
has sent me detailed
recon information

181
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,757
on the Cylon fleet.
I want that fleet.

182
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,770
And I need Galactica
to get it. So I'm willing
to go this far.

183
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,704
I'll suspend the executions
until after the attack.

184
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,537
I want them back on Galactica.

185
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,943
I don't give a damn
what you want.

186
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,880
You're frakking lucky
you're not staring
at your own warrant.

187
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,859
The destruction
of the Cylon fleet
will take priority

188
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,093
over all other considerations.

189
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:59,104
After that, we will meet
back here and we will
resolve this issue.

190
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,400
Thank you.

191
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,705
Stand at ease, Lieutenant,
and come forward.

192
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,378
It seems you've had
quite a day.

193
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,344
I'm promoting you to Captain.

194
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,319
I'm making you Commander
of the Pegasus Air Group.

195
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,652
You're promoting me?

196
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,460
I need a CAG with guts
and initiative

197
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,393
to plan and lead
the attack on this fleet.

198
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,990
Now, I thought
Stinger was that man,

199
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,160
but he managed to let
Capt. Adama contact you

200
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,397
and pull off that fly-by stunt
right under his nose,

201
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,904
so he's out.

202
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,107
And Capt. Adama, sir?

203
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,942
Truth be told,
I came this close
to throwing him in the brig,

204
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,841
but I couldn't exactly
charge him and not you,

205
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,580
so I've just revoked
his flight status.

206
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,284
I want him on my team, sir.

207
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,098
And do you always
get what you want?

208
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,441
Most of the time, sir.

209
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,504
Good.

210
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,809
Me, too.

211
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,753
All right, you can have him.

212
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,017
I hear you want to return
to Caprica.

213
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,826
Yes, sir.

214
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,890
We have people
back there still alive.

215
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,799
Yes, and they deserve
to be saved.
I absolutely agree.

216
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,303
In fact, I will go
one step further

217
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,468
and I will say
that our ultimate goal

218
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,471
is that we should return
to the 12 Colonies

219
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,638
and kick the Cylons
the frak out of our homes.

220
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,183
What do you think
of that, Captain?

221
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,520
I think that's the best idea
I've heard all day, sir.

222
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,388
I'm afraid this can only
end one way.

223
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,562
You've gotta kill her.

224
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,176
What the hell
are you talking about?

225
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,644
Like she said,
let's cut through it.

226
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,544
The two of you

227
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,276
were willing to go
to war today.

228
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,716
Do you think she's going
to step down from that?

229
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,378
She's gonna bide her time

230
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,555
and hit you
the first chance she gets.
That's a given.

231
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:10,056
I hate to lay this on you,
Bill, but she is dangerous,

232
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,360
and the only thing
that you can do is to hit her
before she hits you.

233
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,563
I'm not an assassin.

234
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,363
No.

235
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,003
You're not an assassin.
You are a Colonial officer

236
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,979
who has taken an oath
to protect this fleet.

237
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:33,452
What do you think
that she is going to do
with the civilian fleet

238
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,282
once she has eliminated you?

239
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,119
You know I'm right.

240
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,356

You do have a cracked rib,
though,

245
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:19,627
a hairline fracture,
which means it's gonna hurt
like hell for a while.

246
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,464
But I'm not seeing
any signs of permanent damage
from the attack.

247
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,873
The attack.
Is that what we're
calling it now?

248
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,107
They were not
from the Galactica.

249
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,649
They were from the Pegasus.
So what?

250
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,583
What about Helo and the Chief?

251
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,431
I heard a rumor
they're gonna be executed.

252
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,234
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

253
00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:59,668
Well,
how're you gonna do that?

Isn't Adm. Cain in command?

00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:20,412
We found her
and a few other civies

343
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,709
about a week after the attack.

344
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,147
They were good ships.

345
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,254
FTL drives and weapons, even.

346
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:37,126
A lot of potential
spare parts that we
could use on Pegasus.

347
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,893
So the Admiral
made a decision.

348
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:47,138
Military needs are a priority.

349
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,633
You stripped them.

350
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,042
You stripped the ships
for parts.

351
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,583
Sweet mother of Artemis.

352
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,778
How much equipment
did you take?

353
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:06,851
You take their jump drives?

354
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,288
Left all those people
marooned out there?

355
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,389
No, not all.

356
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:21,935
Adm. Cain looked over
the passenger list
and she made a decision

357
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:25,408
about who was valuable
and who wasn't.

358
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,353
Scylla was the toughest.

359
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,653
Laird and 15
other men and women.

360
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,316
They were all...

361
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,059
All traveling
with their families,

362
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,289
wives, husbands, children.

363
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,325
The selectees

364
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:51,168
refused to go.
There was resistance.

365
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,097
So, the order came down

366
00:27:56,975 --> 00:28:01,469
to shoot the family
of anyone who refused to come.

367
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:05,714
So we did.

368
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,981
Two families. We put them
up against the bulkhead

369
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:15,219
and we shot them.

370
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,469
The CAG's work is never done.

371
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,042
Hi. How're you doing?

372
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,910
Oh, you mean
apart from being demoted,

373
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:43,387
finding myself working
for one of my pilots?

374
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,454
Great. Never better.

375
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,220
You know I had nothing
to do with that, right?

376
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,492
Never thought you did.

377
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:04,298
I just checked in
on Helo and Tyrol.

378
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,005
They're hanging tight for now.

379
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,038
Good.

380
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,347
Help me plan this op.

381
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,615
I've been staring
at this roster...

382
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:21,317
Do you want to just carry on
as if nothing's happened?

383
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:23,224
Lee, she's in command.
What do you wanna do?

384
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,356
There's nothing we can do.

385
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,798
I thought you might like
a fresh set of clothes.

386
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:25,612
Were you aware of your
true nature as a Cylon
when you boarded the ship

387
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,855
or would you describe
yourself as a sleeper agent?

388
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,059
I knew what I was.

389
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:40,098
I was a soldier.
I had a mission,
I carried it out.

390
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,305
I thought that when it was
done, I was going to die.

391
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,140
That you would kill me.

392
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:53,783
Then l... Then I would
download into a new body.

393
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,284
Be reborn.

394
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,822
But you didn't kill me.

395
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,619
The things you did to me...

396
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,026
What they did to you
was wrong, evil.

397
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:07,795
But I'm not one of them.

398
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,063
You have to believe me.

399
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:17,072
Things are going to get
better for you
from this moment on.

400
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:19,975
I promise.

401
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:23,080
I don't want things
to get better. I want to die.

402
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,343
But you know you can't die.

403
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,750
You do know that, don't you?

404
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:35,185
Your consciousness will merely
transfer, and you'll wake up
in another body.

405
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:37,985
Not if you destroy that.

406
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:41,996
What, this?

407
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:47,104
This ship? Tell me,

408
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,335
what's so important
about this ship?

409
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,815
The Cylons call this
their Resurrection ship.

410
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:04,617
At the moment,
we are too far away
from the Cylon home world

411
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,351
for the normal
downloading process to work.

412
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,825
Which is why
they built this ship.

413
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:12,997
It contains the entire
apparatus necessary
for Cylon resurrection.

414
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:16,460
Now, this ship has been
traveling with the fleet,

415
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:18,469
trailing Galactica
for the last several months.

416
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:20,764
So it's a safety net.

417
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,474
A place where they fall
back to when they die.

418
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,274
And if they lose
their safety net...

419
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,908
Then any Cylon
who dies out here...

420
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,472
Would be dead.

421
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:36,378
As in, really dead.

422
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,259
And I dare say
they won't like that.

423
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,121
No, sir.

424
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,820
They might even
stop chasing us.

425
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,428
Why risk getting killed
if you can't just wake up
all nice and cozy

426
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,798
in a brand-new body?

427
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,467
Doctor, I think
you've just identified

428
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,201
the most important ship
in the galaxy.

429
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,355
I have good days
and bad days,
but don't look so worried,

430
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,186
I'm not dying today.

431
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:16,754
I wasn't worried.

432
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,228
What can I do for you?

433
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,792
You were right about Cain.

434
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,205
Pegasus had a civilian fleet
with her.

435
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,530
Fifteen ships.

436
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:37,107
Cain stripped them
for parts, supplies,

437
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,944
people.

438
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:45,612
I wish I could say
I was surprised,
but it's who she is.

439
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:48,491
She's playing for keeps.
You gotta do the same.

440
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:51,123
What's gotten into you?

441
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,185
What?

442
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:55,328
You've become
so bloody-minded.

443
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:59,562
I know that as long
as Cain lives,

444
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,037
your survival is at risk.
I know that.

445
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:04,439
(COUGHlNG)

446
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,389
What can I get you?

447
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,261
A new body.

448
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,997
Perhaps one of those
young Cylon models

449
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,163
from the Resurrection ship?

450
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,766
I can't see you as a blonde.

451
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,408
You'd be surprised.

452
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:50,451
I'll see you tomorrow?

453
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:51,614
Mmm-hmm.

454
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:03,298
Commander,

455
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,400
she won't hesitate
to kill you.

456
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,196
Don't let her.

457
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,027
You know,
when we get out of here,

458
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,493
I'm gonna make some changes.

459
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,862
Yeah?

460
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,636
Like what?

461
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,664
Me and Sharon.

462
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:49,444
It's done.

463
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,952
I mean, really done.
I can't do it anymore.

464
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,123
I mean, don't get me wrong.

465
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:02,055
LT, what we did,

466
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,455
I would do again
in a heartbeat.

467
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,429
I gotta let it go.

468
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,698
I so thought I'd let go.

469
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,133
Yeah,

470
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,173
I know what you mean.

471
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:22,804
You?

472
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,376
Yeah, me.

473
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:29,217
What, you think I don't have
second thoughts sometimes?

474
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:34,749
You think I don't wonder if
I'm losing my frakking mind?

475
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,185
I'm in love with a woman
I know isn't a woman.

476
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,360
I'm having a baby that's...

477
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:48,169
That's what, half machine?

478
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,815
You really do love her,
don't you?

479
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,976
Yeah.

480
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:03,952
Yes, I do.

481
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,449
And I can't let go of it.

482
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:15,323
But if you can, let her go.

483
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:20,330
Our primary objective
is a vessel named
Resurrection by the Cylons.

484
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,025
It's guarded by
two Base Stars,

485
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,568
which have been following us
throughout this sector.

486
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,935
Our plan, simply put,
is to let them find us.

487
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:31,239
We will wait
in this system here,

488
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,335
and appear to be conducting
mining operations.

489
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,039
STARBUCK: When the Cylons
launch their Raiders,

490
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,810
Galactica and most
of the civilians
will jump away.

491
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,317
A small group of civilians
will be left behind.

492
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,616
To the Cylons,
they'll appear
to be having trouble

493
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:47,647
with their FTL drives
and attempting to escape
at sub-light speed.

494
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,893
The Cylon Raiders
pursue the civilian decoys,

495
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,923
pulling the Raiders
farther away from the Cylon
Base Stars as they can.

496
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,059
APOLLO: Once the Raiders have
been drawn off by the decoys,

497
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:02,499
Galactica and Pegasus
will jump in and attack
the Base Stars,

498
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:08,001
while I jump in
in the Blackbird
stealth fighter

499
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:09,943
and take out the FTL drives

500
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,482
on the Resurrection ship,
preventing it
from jumping away.

501
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:16,381
Why not have the stealth ship
carry nukes and destroy it
right at the start?

502
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:19,753
We ran simulations on that.
We determined
that the Cylons would detect

503
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,883
the nuclear warheads
and destroy the stealth ship

504
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,394
before it got
within weapons range.

505
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:29,229
When the FTL is destroyed,
Galactica and Pegasus

506
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,063
will take on the Base Stars,

507
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:34,628
and our attack squadrons
will go after the Resurrection
ship itself.

508
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,901
How many squadrons?

509
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,001
All of them.

510
00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:53,947
Is there a problem,
Commander?

511
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:59,121
I need time to study
the operational details.

512
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:04,327
Suit yourself.
I've gone over the details
and I'm satisfied.

513
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:09,264
I want your CAG to stay
and help me answer
some of my questions.

514
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,101
One hour, Thrace.

515
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:14,440
Yes, sir.

516
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,681
Stay focused, son.

517
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:45,207
Jack, I want to transfer
a detachment of Marines
to Galactica.

518
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,842
And I want you
to hand-pick them.

519
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,212
Completely reliable.
Completely loyal.

520
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:56,876
Razors.

521
00:40:57,722 --> 00:40:59,952
I have a mission for you,
Kara.

522
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:02,158
Anything for you.
You know that.

523
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,452
Don't accept too quickly.

524
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,864
You won't like this one.

525
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:11,192
I don't like it.

526
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:15,800
But I've decided
that it has to be done.

527
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,667
I'm transferring you
to Galactica as well.

528
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,612
I'll tell Adama that
you're there to be
my eyes and ears.

529
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:27,579
He'll hate it,
he'll think you're my spy

530
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,950
and try to freeze you out
of decision-making,

531
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:32,750
but he'll accept it.

532
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:36,616
Now, I want you to stay
in ClC throughout the attack.

533
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:39,060
Stay with Adama.

534
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,564
ADAMA: After the attack
is completed,

535
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,626
and you've accounted
for your pilots,

536
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:48,504
I want you to land your bird
on the Pegasus to report

537
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,198
directly to ClC.

538
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,401
You'll take Lee with you.

539
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,336
He'll watch your back.

540
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:59,508
Position Marines
in key areas throughout
the ship and keep a squad

541
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:01,518
posted just outside ClC.

542
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:04,817
Now, there will be the normal
chaos and emotional high
after the attack.

543
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:07,949
They'll be slapping
each other on the back,
celebrating the victory.

544
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,050
That'll keep their guard down.

545
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:10,924
Security will be lax.

546
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:16,700
I will ask for you
over the wireless.

547
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,763
I will call you directly.
And when I have you
on the line

548
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:23,534
and you hear me
give the command "Execute
case orange"...

549
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,809
When you hear me
say "Downfall"...

550
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:32,315
...you are to signal
the Marines to terminate
Adama's command.

551
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,515
Start it with Adama.

552
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,781
...I want you
to pull out your weapon

553
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:44,861
and shoot Adm. Cain
in the head.
