347
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:48,148
Two Marines, probably KlA,

348
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,786
at least one of the gunmen,

349
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,422

in the military
and the government.

392

get our people out of there.

our position permanently.

playing us all,

are right?

411

This isn't about Sharon.
It's about something
much bigger than that.

412

It's about
the long-term survival.

413

we conduct ourselves
in all of this.

What does that mean?
That is not the deal.

433
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:59,401
It means that
you've convinced me
that we may have been played.
