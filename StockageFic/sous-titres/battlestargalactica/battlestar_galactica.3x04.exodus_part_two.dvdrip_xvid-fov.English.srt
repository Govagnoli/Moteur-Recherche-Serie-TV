1
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,194
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,157
l have a message for you.

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,198
The fruit borne of two peoples

4
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,998
is alive.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,474
A child named after the wife and sister
of the all-knowing Zeus.

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,358
Hera lives.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,396
That's not true.

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,917
l don't suppose you'll tell me what this is
about. What's so important about this kid?

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,231
She may very well
be the shape of things to come.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,356
The Cylons knew
where we were gonna be.

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,429
<i>(both talk at once)</i>

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,229
This is the map that l drew for you.
l gave this to you in your tent.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,074
You were gonna burn it.
She offered to do it for you.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,674
I... l want to explain.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,954
He said he'd kill you.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,669
- Who said it?
- One of the Brother Cavils.

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,354
This is Kacey.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,359
Kacey, this is Kara.

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,355
Your mother.

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,593
Our people attack the air base,
detention centre, power station.

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,389
The plan is to sow chaos
the moment <i>Galactica</i> and <i>Pegasus</i> arrive.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,914
No <i>Pegasus,</i> just <i>Galactica.</i>

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,028
These are your orders. Take the civilian
fleet and wait for me for 18 hours.

24
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,078
If l'm not back in 18 hours
then find Earth.

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,438
You know the mission. You should also
know there's only one way that it ends,

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,755
and that's with the successful rescue
of our people off of New Caprica.

27
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,796
Good hunting.

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,551
Hoshi's working on updating our map
coordinates for the search for Earth.

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,715
Civilian captains want to meet with you.
They have questions, problems.

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,671
Talk to me, Lee.

31
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,475
l'm having trouble...

32
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,198
accepting this.

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,952
l know.

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,713
But we have to push forward,

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,349
keep the fleet together,
find Earth.

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,031
- That's our duty.
- There's still a chance they'll come back.

37
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,477
Your father has pulled off
more than a few miracles in his day.

38
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,551
l know that.

39
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,635
And l haven't given up hope.

40
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,031
Yes, you have.

41
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,997
l saw the look on your face
when you came back from <i>Galactica,</i>

42
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,356
like you were
never gonna see him again.

43
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,829
Am l that easy to read?

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,991
Just to me.

45
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,276
He's taking on too much
for one half-strength battlestar to handle.

46
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,318
That's not opinion,
that's military fact.

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,954
He's not coming back from this.
None of them are.

48
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,237
All we can do
is make plans for the future.

49
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,390
We have to survive.

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,596
We have to find Earth. If we don't, there'll
be no one to remember William Adama,

51
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,148
or a battlestar named <i>Galactica.</i>

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,589
That is our charge to keep.

53
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,269
To keep humanity going,

54
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,273
no matter what the cost, no matter...
no matter who we leave behind.

55
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,909
You can do this.
You can get us there.

56
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,639
You are commander of this fleet
and you will guide us to safety.

57
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,359
And you will do it,
no matter the cost,

58
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,356
because you're an Adama.

59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,790
Did l say how proud l am
to serve with you?

60
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,792
Not in so many words, no.

61
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,836
Well, l am proud to serve with you,
Lieutenant.

62
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,229
And to call you my wife.

63
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,635
Now, let's talk about map coordinates,
meeting with ships' captains.

64
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,157
l lost three men. If that sergeant wasn't
on her game, they'd have killed us all.

65
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,756
l know, godsdammit! You don't have to
keep running your mouth about it. l get it.

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,958
Get this. If Sharon had been killed, not
only would we not get the launch keys,

67
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,589
but the Cylons would know
we were in direct contact with <i>Galactica.</i>

68
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,468
This whole plan - the fate of
this whole city - would have fallen apart.

69
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,235
- Do you understand that, Colonel?
- l get it.

70
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,436
Good.

71
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,636
Hey.

72
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,439
You know
what has to be done here.

73
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,231
You don't want to do it. l understand.
But believe me, someone is gonna do this.

74
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,313
Now, it would be better
for her sake if it was you.

75
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,511
l had to do it, Saul.

76
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,315
l had to.

77
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,436
It was all for you.

78
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,832
And l want you to know
that l would've done anything to save you.

79
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,912
l know. It's all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,195
No, you don't understand.

81
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,997
l got you out of detention, Saul.

82
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,071
It was me.

83
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,391
l got you out.

84
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,870
l went to see them - the Cylons.

85
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,998
l finally got to the one in charge.

86
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,431
And l got him to notice me

87
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,035
the way men notice me.

88
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,909
l slept with him.

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,993
l felt like puking every time
he put his filthy hands on me,

90
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,677
but l smiled and l faked it
to save you, Saul.

91
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,194
But you listen to me.

92
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,316
l'd do it again.

93
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,039
Frak anybody, do anything.

94
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,319
Even give them the map.

95
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,198
l didn't want anybody to be killed.

96
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,310
l could use a drink.

97
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,439
You've always been there for me
when l need you.

98
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,995
Oh, l'm exhausted.

99
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,230
l feel like l could just curl up here.

100
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,277
l should have listened to you, Saul.

101
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,635
l should have stayed on <i>Galactica.</i>

102
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,314
Don't worry about any of that now.

103
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,197
You just...

104
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,195
- You just go to sleep.
- l'm sleepy.

105
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,715
l love you,

106
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,870
do you hear me?

107
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,991
<i>(sobs)</i>

108
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,434
l mean, l've told you and l've told you,
but to what end?

109
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,478
Too secure
in your smug superiority to listen.

110
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,633
Too comfortable
in your predictions of success

111
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,316
to even consider
the possibility of defeat.

112
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,198
And where are we now?

113
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,714
More to the point,

114
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,916
where's Laura Roslin?

115
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,633
Where's Tom Zarek?

116
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,991
At large.

117
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,594
Whereabouts unknown.
Free, at any rate.

118
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,471
Probably with Colonel Tigh, solidifying
the insurgency's hold over the public.

119
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,790
What would you have us do, Gaius?

120
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,034
Leave.

121
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,475
Pack up your Centurions...

122
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,510
and go.

123
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,672
Please. Go.

124
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,231
And then what? What would you do
if we really just left you here?

125
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,632
Live your lives in peace and never trouble
yourself with thoughts of us again?

126
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,871
Or would you raise your children
with stories of the Cylon?

127
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,748
Mechanical slaves who once
did your bidding, only to turn against you.

128
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,718
Killers who committed genocide
against your race.

129
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,315
And occupiers of this city
until we just ran away.

130
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,711
Would you tell them to tell the story
to their children?

131
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,950
And to their children's children?

132
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,429
Nurse a dream of vengeance
through the years,

133
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:51,709
so that one day they could just go out into
the stars and hunt the Cylon once more.

134
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,914
Blood for blood.

135
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,753
It has to stop one day.

136
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,035
<i>(distant explosions)</i>

137
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,631
Oh, my gods.

138
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,429
Nice job, Anders.

139
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,988
Come on. Come on.

140
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,116
<i>(siren wails)</i>

141
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,236
OK, that's our cue.
You know what to do.

142
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,959
Rally your people
and get them to the evac points.

143
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,672
Remember the drills and you'll do fine.
Go with the gods. Go! Go! Go!

144
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,390
- Tory, tell Laura l can't thank her...
- Tell her yourself when this is all over.

145
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,755
l wish we were all
as calm as she is.

146
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,513
- Get them to their ship. Go!
- <i>(man)</i> Yes, ma'am.

147
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,031
Come on!
Quick, quick!

148
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,478
Let's move!
Let's move! Let's move!

149
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,554
This is it. We get to the detention centre
and we do not stop until everybody is free.

150
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,633
Everybody knows the rescue points.
Let's load up and we move, right now.

151
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,711
Let's move! Let's go!

152
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,115
Decoy squadron
approaching launch point.

153
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,075
<i>(Kat) OK, this is it, guys.</i>
<i>Stand by.</i>

154
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,436
All Vipers, break...
now, now, now!

155
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,230
Deploy drones on my mark.

156
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,869
Three, two, one.

157
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,871
Mark!

158
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,869
The drone signatures match.

159
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,078
The Cylons should pick up their drones on
DRADIS and read them as two battlestars.

160
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,037
Hey.

161
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,751
For nothing.

162
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,350
- All for nothing.
- We'll start over, Gaius.

163
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,238
A new city
to rise out of the ashes.

164
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,511
It'll be buried.

165
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,760
Buried like the cities of old,
consumed by the wrath of God.

166
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,355
Two battlestars
just jumped into orbit.

167
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,755
Adama's back.

168
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,356
Kat, Racetrack. Two baseships
on DRADIS, bearing 002, carom 015.

169
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,115
- They're launching Raiders.
- <i>Red squadron, Kat. We've done our part.</i>

170
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,909
<i>Kick in the turbos</i>
<i>and let's get the hell out of here!</i>

171
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,792
- <i>(Starbuck)</i> What's going on?
- Insurgents. l'll be back.

172
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,269
- You cannot leave us here.
- It's safest here.

173
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,793
No!

174
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,920
Let's go! Let's go!

175
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,029
- Tom, head to the shipyard.
- You're coming?

176
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,873
My ship's up there.

177
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,839
You sure have a sense of the dramatic.
Hey, wait. Laura. Wait.

178
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,392
You're on <i>Galactica,</i> right? Keep an eye
on her. Don't let her out of your sight. Go!

179
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,472
- See you up there.
- See you up there.

180
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,636
<i>(man)</i> Jump preparation complete.

181
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,393
My board is green.
Ready to jump, sir.

182
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,075
- Stand by to launch blue squadron.
- This is the admiral.

183
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,799
All hands,
brace for turbulence.

184
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:21,314
Baseships just closed on the battlestar
targets. There's no <i>Galactica,</i> no <i>Pegasus.</i>

185
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,311
Drones.

186
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,870
Decoys.

187
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,033
- The whole thing's a trick.
- Where's <i>Galactica?</i>

188
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,429
Altitude 99,000,
falling like a rock.

189
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,034
- Launch! Launch them all!
- Stand by, FTL.

190
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,398
- <i>(man) Clear for launch.</i>
- Well, this ought to be different.

191
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,556
- They're clear!
- Stand by!

192
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,549
Jump!

193
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,750
Vipers!
Everybody, hold! Hold!

194
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,956
Hotdog, Redwing, l see friendlies
pinned outside the shipyard.

195
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,919
Roger. Redwing, target the tower.
l've got the gate. Pulling in hard.

196
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,592
<i>(Chief)</i> Incoming!

00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,356

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,749

Godsdammit.
Come on! Move! Move, move!

201
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,519
Move! Let's go! Come on!
Move! Move, move, move!

202
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,871
- Fire in the hole!
- <i>(woman)</i> Fire in the hole!

203
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,515
Everybody, let's move!

204
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,070
To the shipyard!
Move! Move! Hustle!

205
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,748
Kara. Oh, gods!

206
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,912
No, no!

207
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,073
l'm gonna get you out of here.
l'm gonna get you out of here.

208
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,629
Make damage report to Combat.
Batteries, report weapons status.

209
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,199
DRADIS?

210
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,596
Back online.

211
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,040
Cylon baseships
are coming out of the nebula.

212
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,236
Just as we expected.

213
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,834
Cylon Raiders are still scattered.

214
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,833
They're coming after us
without fighter cover.

215
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,708
If we draw the basestars away from
the planet, the Colonists may escape.

216
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,712
Hang on. Two more baseships
just jumped into orbit.

217
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,315
We got four baseships out there,
Admiral.

218
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,516
We can't hold off four.

219
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,309
Pass up the cord!

220
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,596
- Hold still.
- Connect the other side right away.

221
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,433
We lost thrusters.
We can't take more hits to port

222
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,637
or we're looking at decompressions
in sections 36 to 48.

223
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,597
Jump drives?

224
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,034
Then that's it.

225
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,151
It's been an honour.

226
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,199
<i>Galactica, Pegasus.</i> Let us take
some of this work off your hands.

227
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,919
Get your FTL ready
and we'll take care of the rest.

228
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,434
- Fire up that main battery!
- <i>(man)</i> Roger that!

229
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,272
Damn you, Lee.

230
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,591
Keep working on those FTLs.
Get 'em online!

231
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,151
The Cylons will redeploy
as soon as they recover.

232
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,958
Thank you, Lee.

233
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,077
<i>(Dualla)</i> They're coming about
to bracket us.

234
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,755
Steady as she goes.
Take us right into the centre.

235
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,513
- We won't last long in there.
- No.

236

Put me down!

238
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,790
Kara, shh.

239
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,837
- Is it really you?
- It's really me, but we don't have time.

240
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,754
We're going to the ships and we're
gonna get off this frakking planet.

241
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,400
- Where's Kacey?
- Who's Kacey?

242
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,756
- Kacey. She's my daughter.
- Kara, who's Kacey?

243
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,354
- She's my daughter!
- Kara, no! Kara!

244
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,398
Godsdammit! Kara, no!
Out of the way!

245
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,074
Come on!
Godsdammit, Kara, no!

246
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,913
We've lost control of the situation
on the surface.

247
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,992
There's a Heavy Raider standing by
ready to evacuate us.

248
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,629
We're agreed.
Evacuate the entire facility.

249
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,075
l'll stay behind
and set off the nuke.

250
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,754
<i>(explosions continue outside)</i>

251
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,240
You should go as well, Caprica.

252
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,356
And you.

253
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,514
l don't think you'll want to be here after
we've gone. There's a place for you too.

254
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,352
For me?

255
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:27,512
Well, you were right and we were wrong.
There should be some reward for that.

256
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,191
Gaius, we should go.

257
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,554
l just want to sit here and die.

258
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,318
You're gonna get your wish, Gaius.

259
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,469
The ships are getting off the ground.

260
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,031
They're jumping away.
Only a few left now. FTL's back online.

261
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,352
<i>Pegasus</i> is taking a hell of a pounding.
l don't think she has a plane in the air.

262
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,159
Lee left all his planes
to guard the civilian ships.

263
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,233
He knew this was a one-way trip.
He'll evac before the end.

264
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,153
- You sure?
- Land our birds!

265
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,390
Let's get the hell out of here.

266
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,191
<i>(Helo) All wings, Galactica. Come home.</i>
<i>Landings authorised. Repeat, come home.</i>

00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,999
All hands, all hands,
get ready to jump.

268
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,993
- l believed in you.
- Whoa, whoa. Gaeta.

269
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,435
l believed in the dream
of New Caprica.

270
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,910
- Gaeta, we all did.
- No! No.

271
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,118
Not him. He believed in
the dream of Gaius Baltar.

272
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,876
The good life - booze, pills,
hot and cold running interns.

273
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,235
He led us to the apocalypse and...

274
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,159
and l turned out to be...

275
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,231
<i>(Baltar)</i> An idealist.

276
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,631
There's no sin in that.

277
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,509
Everything you say about me is true.

278
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,591
Every word.

279
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,795
But you have to listen to me.

280
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,197
The Cylons have a nuke
in this complex.

281
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,629
Nobody, and l mean nobody, is getting off
this planet alive unless l stop D'Anna.

282
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,836
- She'll kill you.
- Then she'll kill me.

283
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,798
Or it can be down to Mr Gaeta.

284
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,589
Either way,
the human race dies with me.

285
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,351

You have one chance to put things right,
do you understand me?

292
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,600
Get the frak out of here!
Stop that nuke!

293
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,956

Come here, Kacey.

- What words?

310
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,991
You know what l want. l want to hear you
say them. And l want the rest of it.

311
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,071
Just like l told you.

312
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,508

Let's move.

not any more.

339
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,952
Come on, Gaius.
We have to go.

340
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,190
Let's go.

341
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,395
- <i>(man #1)</i> All aboard.
- <i>(man #2)</i> Check up front.

342
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,679
All right.

343
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,876

344
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:24,518
People, let's go. This way. Stand on the
deck until we can get you to new ships.

345
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:30,277
Come on, people, all the way down.
All the way down, people. Let's go!

346
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,758
Oh, my gods.

347
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,070
Captain?

348
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,472
- l thought you were dead.
- Yeah, so did I.

349
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,836
- Who is this?
- Yeah, l was gonna ask that myself.

350
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,753
- <i>(Starbuck)</i> This is...
- Kacey?

351
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,196
Kacey!
Oh, my little girl!

352
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,317
Mommy missed you so much.

353
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,755
Thank you.

354
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,752
Thank you. Thank you.

355
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,116
When the Cylons took her,
I... l thought...

356
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,110
But you saved her.

357
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,311
Gods bless you.

358
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,156
- <i>(man)</i> Thank you, sir.
- Welcome aboard. Welcome.

359
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,915
Welcome aboard.

360
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,274
- l guess you didn't understand my orders.
- Never could read your handwriting.

361
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,752
<i>(Tigh)</i> Permission
to come aboard, sir?

362
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,431
Hey.

363
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,110
Permission granted.

364
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,475
You did it.

365
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,120
You brought 'em home, Saul.

366
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,191
Not all of them.

367
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,232
- l'm sorry.
- <i>(crowd chants "Adama")</i>

368
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,030
<i>(crowd continues to chant)</i>

369
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,788
We're still double-checking
the fleet's manifests, but...

370
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,317
it doesn't look like Maya
made it off of New Caprica.

371
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,635
What about the baby?

372
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,796
l was there when the two guards left
to take them to their ship.

373
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,755
l don't know what happened.

374
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,914
l'm so sorry.
l let you down and l know that.

375
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,200
No, you didn't.

376
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,839
It's not your fault.

377
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,229
This is bigger than us.

378
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,831
This is life.

379
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,759
<i>(PA) All procedure support teams,</i>
<i>stand by for ship assignments.</i>

380
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:47,039
<i>All procedure support teams,</i>
<i>stand by for ship assignments.</i>

381
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,830
More religion.

382
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,150
Your soul is mine.
