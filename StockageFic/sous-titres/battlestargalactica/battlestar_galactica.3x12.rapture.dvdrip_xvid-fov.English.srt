00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,671
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,757
There's enough algae on this planet
to feed the entire fleet,

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,115
but the star in this system
is highly unstable -

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,589
on the verge of going supernova.

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,717
We just picked up four baseships
inbound at high speed.

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,874
It's just a matter of time until the Cylons
find out what we're up to on this planet.

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,272
<i>(screams)</i>

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,759
<i>Starbuck is going down.</i>

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,035
- l am going after my wife!
- l can't let you...

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,554
l am not asking you for permission.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,835
Sergeant Mathias...

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,990
What if l told you
your daughter was alive?

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,593
l'd say you were a liar.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,513
She's on our baseship.
She's ill, and we don't know why.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,751
<i>l don't know how l found this place. l got</i>
<i>this urge to start walking, then suddenly...</i>

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,955
Here it is.

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,192
<i>The scriptures say that this temple is the</i>
<i>final resting place of the Eye of Jupiter.</i>

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,714
- What exactly are we talking about?
- It's a marker

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,759
left behind by the thirteenth tribe.
It's supposed to point the way to Earth.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,637
We want the Eye of Jupiter.

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,998
Make any attempt to attack this ship
or the people on the planet's surface,

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,469
l'll launch every nuke l've got.

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,030
<i>You've got to hold off the Cylons</i>
<i>until the chief finds the Eye of Jupiter.</i>

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,157
<i>If it looks like they're going to</i>
<i>get into the temple, blow it.</i>

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,030
We have to go to the planet. l am so close
to seeing the faces of the last five Cylons.

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,274
The Final Five, revealed only to those who
enter the temple. Only to the Chosen One.

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,272
We just picked up six heavy Raiders
heading for the planet.

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,112
Order ground-strike missiles.

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,998
<i>l'm not gonna let the Cylons</i>
<i>get their hands on the Eye.</i>

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,674
Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee?

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,149
Missiles are loaded, Admiral.

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,471
Release of nuclear weapons
is now authorised.

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,476
Mr Gaeta, disable launch
and warhead safeties

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,518
on tubes four through ten.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,270
Safeties disabled, warheads...

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,635
- <i>(bleeping)</i>
- <i>...are</i> armed.

37
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,153
XO, please input your firing code.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,029
These nukes will obliterate anything
or anyone within 20 clicks of the temple.

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,315
l know.

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,119
He's going to do it.
Recall the Raiders immediately.

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,031
We agree. Bring them back.

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,033
We agree. After all this time,
we can't afford to lose everything.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,156
We agree. Bring them back.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,078
If Kara dies out there,
l swear to gods l will kill you myself.

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,038
If she dies out there, l'll let you.

46
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,029
What will you do now?
Follow me around with a gun?

47
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,910
Because that is the only way
that l am not going after Kara.

48
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,311
- Private Sykes.
- Sir.

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,039
- Get Lieutenant Dualla on the line.
- Yes, sir.

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,080
- l'm here.
- Do you have eyeballs on Starbuck?

51
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,914
Negative. No visual on her Raptor,
but l can see smoke from the crash site.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,309
She went down behind a hill
a couple of clicks away.

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,551
- Can you get to the Raptor?
<i>- l don't know. It's pretty far away.</i>

54
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,631
<i>- There's minimal cover.</i>
- Is it doable?

55
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,711
l don't know.

56
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,311
The key.

57
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,112
- Standing by.
- <i>(bleeping)</i>

58
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,589
Launch sequence set to auto.

59
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,475
They want the key to finding Earth
as much as we do.

60
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,032
- He won't just destroy it.
- We spoke and the decision's been made.

61
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,075
Fire on my mark.

62
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,552
Sir! The Raiders are turning back.

63
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,916
- Not all of them.
- Correction. Five have turned back.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,117
One is still en route back to the planet.

65
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,469
- What are you doing?
- They won't launch against just one ship.

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,953
That's not the issue. We made a decision.
D'Anna has to turn back.

67
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,150
- No.
- <i>(Number Six)</i> Call D'Anna and Baltar.

68
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,515
- Turn them around now.
- No.

69
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,716
What do you mean, "No"?

70
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,079
This is something that we have to do.
He won't launch over one ship. You'll see.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,629
You want me... you want me
to rescue Captain Thrace?

72
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,555
Attempt the rescue.

73
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,951
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,031
Foxfire One out.

75
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,349
We go.

76
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,078
<i>(Gaeta)</i> Weapons are still hot, Admiral.

77
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,400
Safe all missiles. Close outer doors.

78
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,515
There. You see?

79
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,517
Never over just one ship.

80
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,951
That is not a good sign, my friends.

81
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,594
She defied us, defied the group.

82
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,717
It's not about the Eye of Jupiter,
it's about her.

83
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,031
It's like we don't even
know them any more.

84
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,157
We may have to do something about this.

85
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,590
We may have to do it sooner than later.

86
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,559
If Hera's alive, l'm her mother
and l'm going to get her.

87
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,359
Sharon, baby, listen to me, OK?

88
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,629
We can take a Raptor and fly to the
baseship ourselves. l don't care any more.

89
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,756
We can't.

90
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,190
We'll find another way.

91
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,396
We will.

92
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,791
There is no other way.

93
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,154
Don't ask me to do this, Sharon.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,991
Listen to me.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,116
You have always been the strong one.

96
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,590
You believed in us
when no one else would.

97
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,196
l'm begging you to do this.

98
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,795
Find the courage to do this
for both of us, OK?

99
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,995
l love you.

100
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,391
l love you too.

101
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,031
Ohh.

102
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,548
<i>(drops weapon)</i>

103
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,870
<i>(weeps)</i>

104
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,838
<i>(yells)</i>

105
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,835
Good to close her.

106
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,995
- Wait outside.
- Yes, sir.

107
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,749
Sharon's downloading into another body
aboard a Cylon ship right now, isn't she?

108
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,831
She begged me.

109
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,788
She begged me to do it.

110
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,198
Gods, if you'd...
seen the look in her eyes when I...

111
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,479
She has important information
on our defences. Codes, procedures.

112
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,396
The tactical situation
down on the planet surface.

113
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,677
The Cylons have access
to all of that as well.

114
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,035
She won't betray us.

115
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,112
You know that.
It's why you gave her the uniform.

116
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,273
She may not have a choice.
Did you consider that?

117
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,114
She said she could resist,
that she wouldn't let it happen.

118
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,395
She'll get Hera...

119
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,593
and she'll come back.

120
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,389
That's quite a leap of faith
you've made there, Captain.

121
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,156
And if it involved your family only,
l'd say it was brave.

122
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,272
But you've put the entire fleet in jeopardy.
Are you aware of that?

123
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,591
If you hadn't lied...

124
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,112
and stolen our baby in the first place,

125
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,075
we wouldn't be here at all.

126
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,912
l've certainly played my part
in bringing us to this moment.

127
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,793
And there is plenty of blame
to throw around, and l accept it.

128
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,589
And now all of our lives
are in the hands of Sharon Agathon.

129
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,036
All we can do is hope
that your wife is worthy

130
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,591
of the unconditional trust
you place in her, Captain.

131
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,989
And you as well, Admiral.

132
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,311
<i>(Sharon gasps)</i>

133
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,229
<i>(coughing and spluttering)</i>

134
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,439
Can you tell me what happened?

135
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,594
They wouldn't let me see my daughter...
so my husband shot me.

136
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,831
It was the only way.

137
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,231
Well, it's over now.
The important thing is that you're here.

138
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,952
How's my daughter?

139
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,150
- She's getting worse.
- l wanna see her.

140
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,437
And then what?

141
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,511
What they did to me.

142
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,074
Stealing my baby...
and telling me she was dead.

143
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,471
It proved it.

144
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,514
Hera's safer here.

145
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,831
And so am I.

146
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,239
Before she went down, Starbuck
spotted about 15-plus chrome-jobs

147
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,518
advancing on us from here. To get to us,
they have to come through this canyon.

148
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,469
This is a natural choke point. That's
where we'll ambush them, guerrilla-style.

149
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,189
Our mission is to hold the temple, here.
If we fail we blow it up.

150
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,748
We fall back to these rendezvous points,

151
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,435
and then we head into the mountains,
and we wait for rescue.

152
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,399
It's as good a place as any
to die, l suppose.

153
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,151
What do you think?

154
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,030
It's a nice day for a walk.

155
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,471
<i>- (gunshots)</i>
- Sniper!

156
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,715
Hey, take it easy, Fischer.

157
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,151
Sarge?

158
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,511
Sarge?

159
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,831
<i>(gunfire)</i>

160
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,710
Oh, this is crazy. Come on.
Think. Think!

161
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,790
Galen, it's Major Adama.

162
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,113
- Sir.
<i>- Chief, we're in position.</i>

163
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,430
<i>Any luck finding the Eye of Jupiter?</i>

164
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,750
No. Major, l need more time.

165
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,356
<i>Get on it. The Cylons are on the move.</i>
<i>We'll hold them off as long as we can.</i>

166
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,351
Apollo out.

167
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,318
All right, listen up! Pack your gear
and get ready to move.

168
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,913
<i>(man)</i> Let's get out of here.

169
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,151
- It's so close.
- l know.

170
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,869
The answers to all your questions
are down there in that temple.

171
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,951
What's wrong?

172
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,591
l'm worried, Gaius.

173
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,959
This is what we've been waiting for.
You are the anointed one,

174
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,114
chosen by God to look on the faces
of the Final Five Cylons.

175
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,909
It's already written. You will succeed.

176
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,195
That's what l'm afraid of.

177
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,190
To know the face of God
is to know madness.

178
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,470
The hybrid has looked into the space
between life and death,

179
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,836
and she's seen things
that we cannot conceive of.

180
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,992
But she's been driven mad as a result.

181
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,718
Have faith in God.
Put your life in his hands.

182
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,633
He will guide you to your destiny.

183
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,791
l'm grateful to you.

184
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,550
For everything.

185
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,950
Her destiny will part company
from yours, Gaius.

186
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,838
She's not the Chosen One. You are.

187
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,431
Yes, l know.

188
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,993
l know.

189
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,235
Right here. Got it?

190
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,872
<i>(Apollo)</i> OK, we're set. And now we wait.

191
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,430
What happens if the Cylons
don't dance to the major's tune?

192
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,670
We get splattered
all over these rocks.

193
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,035
Shut up. This is his game, not ours.

194
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,671
We just do what we're told,
and maybe we get outta here.

195
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,069
You really think
these civvies can stop 'em?

196
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,598
They stopped plenty of 'em on Caprica
while we were running for our lives.

197
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,034
OK. Three clankers
just entered our kill zone.

198
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,396
- Gotta be their recon element.
- Sykes, give 'em the signal.

199
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,553
All right, show time. Show time.

200
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,395
All right, they're headed our way.

201
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,755
Don't detonate till they're all the way in.

202
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,109
Wait for it.
Come on, you sons of bitches.

203
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,838
Come on.

204
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,759
Now, now, now.

205
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,311
<i>(Hope)</i> Godsdammit!

206
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,318
Cease fire! They're pulling back!
They're pulling back!

207
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,391
Godsdammit!

208
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,996
Come on!

209
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,592
He's dead. We gotta pull him back.

210
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,875
Sam! Pull it together.

211
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,790
We bought ourselves a little time.
But they'll be back, and with force.

212
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,873
So, dig in. We need to hold 'em off
until Chief finds the Eye.

213
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,350
And keep your eyes out on those ridges.

214
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,552
Have you had any word
from Kara or Dee?

215
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,675
No.

216
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,231
<i>(thud)</i>

217
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,038
Starbuck? Starbuck!

218
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,114
Dee, why the hell didn't you sing out?
l almost blew you away.

219
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,869
Glad to see you, too.

220
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,837
OK, OK.

221
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,148
It's OK.

222
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,513
- Lee sent you?
- Yup.

223
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,912
My husband... ordered me
to risk my life for yours.

224
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,392
That's what l'm gonna do.
l'm gonna bring Starbuck back to Apollo.

225
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,031
<i>(baby crying)</i>

226
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,471
She's here.

227
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,958
<i>(crying continues)</i>

228
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,795
It's me.

229
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,871
It's Mommy.

230
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,711
What's wrong?

231
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,313
<i>(crying stops)</i>

232
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,790
We tried everything. She didn't respond.

233
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,553
Look at that. Hera knows her.

234
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,350
That's amazing. You and she
are biologically identical.

235
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,518
Hera recognises her mother.

236
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,911
Good. Because you can have her.
l'm done with her.

237
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,358
You don't mean that. l know
you still care about Tyrol, and Adama.

238
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,389
No. l'm done with that part of my life.

239
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,196
l learned that on New Caprica.

240
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,238
Humans and Cylons,
we're not meant to be together.

241
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,710
We should just go our separate ways.

242
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,509
Now lie down.

243
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,799
Her belly is as hard as a rock.
Have you noticed that before?

244
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,871
<i>(Hera cries)</i>

245
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,599
- What do you think that means?
- Blocked intestine, maybe.

246
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,591
Our doctors examined her.

247
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,150
Your doctors
have never examined a child.

248
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,390
<i>(crying continues)</i>

249
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,713
Hera needs to be seen by a human doctor.
l need to take her back to <i>Galactica.</i>

250
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,509
You know that can't happen -
what this child means to us,

251
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,239
- what she means to every Cylon.
- l should have known.

252
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,312
She's been planning this all along.

253
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,233
Feel her.

254
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,956
She's right.

255
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,953
- Her belly's as hard as a gourd.
- If you don't let me take her,

256
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,589
the first of the new generation will die.

257
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,673
- God will never forgive you.
- Maybe Cavil's right.

258
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,638
Maybe God never wanted us
to have children in the first place.

259
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,748
Maybe it'd be better for you
if l just snapped your little neck!

260
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,951
Please...

261
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,718
Please don't kill my baby girl.

262
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,076
Honey!

263
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,835
l believe the future of the Cylon
rests with this child,

264
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,354
and the others
who are gonna come after her.

265
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,637
- So do I.
- There's a captured Raptor aboard.

266
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,392
Let's go. We've gotta
get you back to <i>Galactica.</i>

267
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,916
Here they come. Open fire!

268
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,840
Cover the wounded!
The Cylons are closing in!

269
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,870
- It's the major.
- Tyrol.

270
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,191
- Tell me you've found the Eye of Jupiter.
<i>- We're getting close.</i>

271
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,670
l deciphered some more of the glyphs.
l got a reference to an eye,

272
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,716
a star, and an explosion of some kind.

273
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,510
Cut to the chase, Chief. Do you have
the Eye of Jupiter in your hands or not?

274
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,431
No, Major.

275
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,477
That's it!

276
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,551
It's hot.

277
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,835
All right, Chief, listen to me. That's it.

278
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,038
Get your people to the rally point and
blow the temple. Repeat, blow the temple.

279
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,599
Yes, sir... Dammit.

280
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,879
All right, fall back! Sykes! Mathias!
Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!

281
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,955
All right, that's it. Everybody drop
what you're doing and get out.

282
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,318
- <i>(man)</i> Keep that one.
- That means you too, Cally. Come on!

283
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,868
- Leave the gear! Go!
- Come on.

284
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,951
<i>(Cally)</i> l've got it.

285
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,632
- If l only had a little more time.
- Galen!

286
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,397
It's in the hands of the gods now. Let's go,
There's nothing we can do.

287
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,309
The ship's structure's intact.

288
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,391
OK.

289
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,759
That means the only thing keeping
us grounded is a busted fly-by-wire, so...

290
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,753
you've gotta bypass those bundles
with data cord from the com system,

291
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,311
and then we... we may have a shot
at getting out of here.

292
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,798
<i>(groans)</i>

293
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,071
There's only one left.

294
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,633
Better save it
for when you fly us out of here.

295
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,836
l can't fly.

296
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:30,949
- Especially all whacked up on morpha.
- Well, that's just frakking great.

297
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,032
He won't cheat. He's too honourable.

298
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,758
Unlike you.

299
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,671
Yeah, unlike me.

300
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,793
l love Sam, l hate Sam.

301
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,871
l love Lee, l hate Lee.

302
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,280
The gods l have to cheat
just to keep the pieces all nice and neat.

303
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,791
Stay with it. You've still gotta
walk me through these avionics.

304
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,077
The Cylons have reached the temple.
Chief, what's your status?

305
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,390
l'm wiring the last detonator.

306
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,554
<i>(D'Anna)</i> The Eye of Jupiter has be
somewhere in this temple.

307
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,549
They've wired it with explosives.
Let's disconnect it.

308
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,877
Pull out the detonators. Quickly!

309
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,870
Chief, blow this thing!

310
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,676
Are you out of your frakkin' mind?!

311
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,596
l can't do it.

312
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,709
- Gaius!
- Yes?

313
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,791
Help us!

314
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,275
Here.

315
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,828
Give me that control!

316
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,110
This just about does it...

317
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,718
Frak!

318
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,800
What have you done?
What have you done?

319
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,194
Major, look.

320
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,073
<i>(Apollo)</i> What is that?

321
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:30,599
There it is, Gaius. It has the answers
to all of your questions.

322
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,995
That's the Eye?

323
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,469
- What is?
- Oh. Uh...

324
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,115
Something the hybrid said. Uh...

325
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,909
"Sapphire blue, shining like unto a star..."

326
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,516
D'Anna... You didn't come here
looking for Earth,

327
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,797
you came here
looking for something else.

328
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,711
<i>(explosion)</i>

329
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,755
l'm picking up a massive energy pulse.

330
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,628
Sir, it's a helium flash.
The star's going nova.

331
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,794
Novas can obliterate the entire planet
in less than an hour.

332
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,752
Major, look.
It's the mandala from the temple.

333
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,229
This is supposed to be happening.

334
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,869
That's it.
l was staring at it the whole time.

335
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,751
The sun is going nova.

336
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,955
The nova is the Eye of Jupiter.

337
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,238
All right. We can still blow it.
We can still blow it.

338
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,800
We just gotta make it into orbit and
<i>Galactica</i> will find us from there, OK?

339
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,631
This is my destiny.

340
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,953
To see what lies between life and death.

341
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,510
And to look upon
the faces of the Final Five.

342
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,909
That can't happen.

343
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,909
This is my destiny.

344
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,638
Sorry, D'Anna.

345
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,476
<i>(gunshot)</i>

346
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,557
The Final Five.

347
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,631
Is it really you?

348
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,511
You.

349
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,795
Forgive me. l had no idea.

350
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,638
No idea about what? What did you see?

351
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,711
What?

352
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,631
Who was it?

353
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,515
Oh, beautiful.

354
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,511
What was?

355
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,397
Tell me! Am l one of you?

356
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,755
You were right.

357
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,230
About what?
D'Anna, did you see my face?

358
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,314
l have to know. Please. Please,
stay with me. Stay! l have to know!

359
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,870
Tell me! l have to know!
Did you see my face?

360
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,916
Am l a Cylon?

361
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,069
Frak it.

362
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,478
God, tell me the truth before l die.

363
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,669
Welcome home, Mr President.

364
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,995
Admiral, the Cylon fleet just jumped away.

365
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,709
They don't want to be here when that
nova shock front gets here. Neither do we.

366
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,510
- Launch a rescue mission now.
- That nova will fry the whole system.

367
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,272
It's gonna be a photo finish.

368
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,196
- All rescue ships accounted for.
- Count us down.

369
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,589
- Commence FTL.
- Commencing FTL.

370
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,956
<i>(Gaeta)</i> Jump in three... two... one...

371
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,111
l got it.

372
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,870
- He's not dead?
- No, unfortunately.

373
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,511
Take him to the brig.

374
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,191
Sharon.

375
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,994
We have to get her to Doc Cottle
right away, OK?

376
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,071
- OK.
- <i>(guard)</i> Stick up!

377
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,954
Hold your fire, hold your fire.

378
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,235
- She helped us escape.
- Get out of the way!

379
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,070
Dammit.

380
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,515
Sharon.

381
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,515
l think the chief is right.

382
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,279
l think the nova does look like
the mandala inside this temple.

383
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:44,278
Do you think the thirteenth tribe
had a vision of what was to come?

384
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,558
- l don't know what else it could mean.
- They saw another nova and drew that?

385
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,953
- See one nova, you've seen them all.
- Well, there was another nova.

386
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,797
Seen 4,000 years ago, round about
when the temple might have been built.

387
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:06,149
It's 13,000 light years from here, a cloud
of gas known as the Ionian nebula.

388
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,115
Maybe it was a road sign...

389
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,433
showing the direction
that they headed to next.

390
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,870
So, Starbuck, is that what you gotta do
to get some actual rack time around here?

391
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,590
- Did you just come by to frak with me?
- l wanted to know if you had any, uh...

392
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,229
pictures of your old apartment on Caprica.

393
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,311
Um...

394
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,197
Yeah. Uh...

395
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,755
The locker. Top shelf, there's a cigar box.

396
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,752
- Why?
- l'm curious about something.

397
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,076
l hope you aren't planning
on redecorating.

398
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,391
You're not gonna get any bright ideas
from my old place.

399
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,674
Oh, l remember.

400
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,994
- l've seen better-Iooking train wrecks.
- Oh, thank you.

401
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,350
But l do remember
those paintings you did.

402
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,951
What about 'em?

403
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,399
This... was on the temple.

404
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,030
Where'd you get the idea to paint yours?

405
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:36,318
l don't know. It's just something
l've been doodling since l was a kid.

406
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,675
l liked the pattern.

407
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,995
Well...

408
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,277
They built the temple 4,000 years ago.

409
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,113
What is it?

410
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,117
It's just something Leoben said once.

411
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,275
That l had a destiny.

412
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,718
That it had already been written.

413
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,551
<i>(groans)</i>

414
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,836
You know the drill.
Long, deep, controlled breathing.

415
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,431
At least you'll never have to
go through this again.

416
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,911
The decision wasn't easy,
but the conclusion was inevitable.

417
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,909
Your model is fundamentally flawed.

418
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,471
No.

419
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,712
It's not a flaw
to question our purpose, is it?

420
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,395
To wonder who programmed us,
the way we think, and why.

421
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,357
That's the problem right there -

422
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,479
the messianic conviction that you're
on a special mission to enlighten us.

423
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,553
- Look at the damage it's caused.
- l would do it all again.

424
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:13,431
Yes, we know. That's why
we've decided to... box your entire line.

425
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,992
Your consciousness, memory,
every thought your model ever had,

426
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,200
- going into cold storage, indefinitely.
- One must die to know the truth.

427
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,352
There are five other Cylons, Brother.

428
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,431
l saw them.

429
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,552
One day you're going to see them too.

430
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,399
One day...

431
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,357
Goodbye.

432
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,071
Brother...

433
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,311
Brother...

434
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,475
Brother.

435
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,555
- l've got it.
- <i>(whistles)</i>

436
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,793
Make it stop!
