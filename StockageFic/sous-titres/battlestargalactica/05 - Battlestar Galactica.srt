Battlestar Galactica
Season 02 EP 05
The Farm

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,860
Previously
on Battlestar Galactica:

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,700
I have a few months to live.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,330
And in that time I will lead
the people to salvation.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,730
It is my sole purpose.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,660
Praise be to the gods.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,280
Here is our salvation.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,300
Laura Roslin's actions
in suborning mutiny

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,500
and sedition among the military
could not be tolerated.

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,060
Therefore Commander Adama
was left with no choice

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,830
other then to remove her
from office.

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,460
I've gotta get out of here now.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,030
I'm right with you.

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,900
I think these guys
might really be human.

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,900
Everyone on Caprica is dead.

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,900
You're not.

19
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,330
I just got here.

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,800
Not exactly an army.

21
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,000
A hell of a lot better
than the two of us

22
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,000
if we're gonna assault
an air base, steal heavy radar,

23
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,030
and get the frak
off this planet.

24
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,560
Nice to know installing
a regulation pyramid court

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,300
was one of the priorities
of the resistance.

26
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:08,560
Nice shot.

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,160
Thanks.

28
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,760
Stand aside,
or you can shoot me.

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,330
I intend to go through that
hatch and get off this ship.

30
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,430
The former president's
missing.

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,300
- Missing?
- Two men down. Cell's empty.

32
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,300
Damn it.

33
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,260
We're home free for now.

34
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,530
Glad to see you,
Madam President.

35
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,530
Zarek here is the only one
with enough shady friends around

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,030
who can possibly hide us.

37
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,630
Cally shot Boomer.

38
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,660
No, no, no.

39
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,900
I love you, Chief.

40
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,330
What's happening on my ship?

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,200
I frakked things up, and good.

42
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,160
I made some bad calls.

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,960
A lot of pieces to pick up.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,660
Then we'll pick 'em up together.

45
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,760
You've been awake
for an hour.

46
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,610
So what are you gonna do if you
can't make it back to your ship?

47
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,760
I'm getting back.

48
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,260
Well, I know we were able to
take your sorry ass by surprise.

49
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,400
Frak you.

50
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,000
Nice.
But the truth is...

51
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,970
we really don't know
what the hell we're doing.

52
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,000
A lot of our tactics and stuff
we just saw in the movies.

53
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,450
We could use
some professional advice.

54
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,800
You want some advice?

55
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,760
You're on the losing end
of this fight.

56
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,870
Give it up before you all die.

57
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,360
Head further up
in the mountains

58
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,750
above the ambient radiation
and just hole up.

59
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,720
And what?
Wait to die?

60
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,900
As soon as I get back
to Galactica

61
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,840
I'll send a rescue party.

62
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,860
Yeah, right.

63
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,240
If I say I'm gonna do something,
I do it.

64
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,290
You always such a bitch
in the morning?

65
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,430
Count on it.

66
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,030
My kinda woman.

67
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,260
We have a mission
to accomplish.

68
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,320
So what.

69
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,690
Mission.

70
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,660
Fine.
Whatever.

71
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,990
I'm sorry, okay?

72
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,960
I didn't mean to--

73
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:46,640
Gotcha.

74
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,410
So weak.
So, so very weak.

75
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,860
Lighten up a little bit.

76
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,110
It's only the end
of the world.

77
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,830
Sue-Shaun, I want them
to watch our perimeter,

78
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,130
especially on the flank.

79
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,970
Okay.

80
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,830
The Cylons have
a refueling airstrip

81
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,230
just on the side
of the ridge.

82
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,230
There's a heavy raider
makes a regular refueling stop

83
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,390
every afternoon like clockwork.

84
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,060
Machines like routine.

85
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,900
It's usually guarded
by less than three

86
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,230
of the mechanical varieties,

87
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,600
and we've left it alone
up until now.

88
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,500
So?
What's the plan?

89
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,000
Go through this gully.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,830
Approach the airstrip
from the south side.

91
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,030
Sprinkle our men
through the tree line

92
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,700
and wait for the Cylons
to land the raider.

93
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,900
Hook up the refueling hoses.

94
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,130
Once they hook up
the tylium hoses,

95
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,130
we take out the guards

96
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,260
and blow
the refueling station.

97
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,060
I thought you wanted
the raider intact.

98
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,900
They build 'em tough.
Believe me.

99
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,100
Blowing the fuel will barely
put a scratch in the hull,

100
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,960
but it might give us
enough time to board.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,700
Once I'm inside,

102
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,930
I'll blow the brain,

103
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,690
and I'll start working
on trying to get it to--

107
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,260
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

108
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,020
I'm glad to be back.

109
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,340
There are things
we don't say often enough.

110
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,390
Things like what we mean
to one another.

111
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,900
All of you

112
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,560
mean a lot to me.

113
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,700
I just want you to know that.

114
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,420
Let's get back to work.

115
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,070
Feel strange.

116
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,610
Like, closer to the ground.

117
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:56,900
You should check in
with the doctor.

118
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,270
Mr. Gaeta?

119
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,520
Where do you think
they are now?

120
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,230
The stolen Raptor with Captain
Adama, the former president--

121
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,960
The fugitives.

122
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,980
The fugitives docked
at Cloud Nine last week.

123
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,430
We effectively lost them
at that point

124
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,400
due to the large volume
of inter-fleet traffic

125
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,760
going to and from Cloud Nine.

126
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,600
Right now they could be holed up
anywhere in the fleet.

127
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,180
I want them found.

128
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,670
She was dangerous enough
as a symbol of resistance,

129
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,790
but now with Lee helping...

130
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,600
I want to search
every ship in the fleet.

131
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,010
Quarantine procedures.

132
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,900
Isolate the ship
out of the main body.

133
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,830
If it's clean,
we keep it quarantined

134
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,530
away from the rest
of the fleet.

135
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,480
She can hide,
but she can't run.

136
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,690
Start quarantine procedures.

137
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,610
Start with Cloud Nine.

138
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,730
How much longer are we meant

139
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,420
to stay hidden
in this meat locker?

140
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,160
I've communicated
your latest message

141
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,860
to the Quorum of Twelve.

142
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,230
And they've decided
that the question

143
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,890
of openly supporting you
needs more... deliberation.

144
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,710
I need to make an appeal
to the people.

145
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,900
Make a strong enough argument

146
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,690
and the Astral Queen
will be the first ship in line.

147
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,530
Like they do anything but roll
over and take orders from you.

148
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,550
One more bit of news
I should convey,

149
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,250
Zeus has returned to Olympus.

150
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,060
Adama's back in command.

151
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,250
My father?
He's back?

152
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,940
Word just came in
over the wireless.

153
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,920
He's a tough
old bird.

154
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,530
What we really need
is something heartfelt.

155
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,880
Something human
and personal

156
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,870
that will galvanize
the people.

157
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,260
Like a son
denouncing his father.

158
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,770
My name is Lee Adama.

159
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,100
Until recently
I was the commander

160
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,910
of Galactica's Air Group.

161
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,460
But when Commander Adama,
my father,

162
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,560
decided to stage a military
coup against the president,

163
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,040
I could no longer support him

164
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,060
or his actions.

165
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,200
I love my father.

166
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,290
I respect him.

167
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:56,780
But in this,

168
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,220
he is wrong.

169
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,020
He must be opposed.

170
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,490
I call on all free-thinking
people in the fleet--

171
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,130
I can't do this.
Sorry, everyone.

172
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,310
I thought I could, but I can't.

173
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,680
I'm playing
the religious card.

174
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,270
I know exactly
what I have to do.

175
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,000
How does this thing work?

176
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,310
Shhh.

177
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,570
You're okay.

178
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,500
You're in an aid hospital.

179
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,190
They brought you in
yesterday morning.

180
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:37,930
You got shot
in the abdomen.

181
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,690
I'm Simon.

182
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,190
Can you tell me your name?

183
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:44,990
Kara.

184
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,700
Kara Thrace.

185
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,400
Good.

186
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,860
You were in surgery
for about two hours.

187
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,830
I removed the bullet.

188
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,600
I didn't think you were gonna
make it there for a while.

189
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,490
Take it easy.

190
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,110
I know that hurts.

191
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,530
Who brought me in?

192
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,890
A big guy named Anders.

193
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,090
Used to be a pro pyramid player,
if you can believe that.

194
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,600
Yeah, I know him.

195
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,530
Where is he?

196
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,170
He died...

197
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,460
on the table.

198
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,860
I thought he was
only slightly wounded.

199
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,960
Turns out a piece of shrapnel
had nicked his aorta.

200
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,080
Massive internal bleeding.

201
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,790
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,760
We did everything we could do.

203
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,300
Morning.

204
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,250
I see you're sucking down
fluids at a rapid pace.

205
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:33,740
That's good.

206
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,270
Are you a Cylon?

207
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:39,740
What do you think?

208
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,450
I think you didn't answer
the question.

209
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,490
I am most definitely
not a Cylon.

210
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,310
Of course I don't know what
you'd expect me to say.

211
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,460
If I was a Cylon,
I certainly wouldn't admit it.

212
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:51,930
Can I leave?

213
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,370
There's the door.

214
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,050
Frakkin' doctors.

215
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,550
So I am a doctor.

216
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,400
Not a Cylon.

217
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,370
The jury's still out.

218
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,890
I would expect the Cylons
to have better digs

219
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,000
than this, though.

220
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,490
Where is this rat trap?

221
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,560
We're about 20 klicks
north of Delphi.

222
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,070
Used to be a mental institution.

223
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,840
It's not much, but it's one
of the few places

224
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,180
the Cylons haven't found yet.

225
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,300
Okay.

226
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,650
So, what,
I'm supposed to believe

227
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,000
there really is
a resistance out there?

228
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Shhh, don't tell anybody.

229
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,870
We're trying
to keep that quiet.

230
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,570
Time for your pain meds.

231
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,260
If I may speak on behalf
of Specialist Cally.

232
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,460
She was distraught, sir.
The experience on Kobol.

233
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,000
Being on the surface
fighting the Cylons,

234
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,190
it's shattering
for all of us.

235
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,220
I don't believe that she was
in her right mind

236
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,000
when she shot Boomer.

237
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,150
Did you love her, Chief?

238
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,000
Excuse me?

239
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,900
Boomer-- did you love her?

240
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,650
I thought I did.

241
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,350
When you think you
love somebody, you love them.

242
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,290
That's what love is-- thoughts.

243
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,510
She was a Cylon.

244
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,010
A machine.

245
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,180
Is that what Boomer was?
A machine?

246
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,570
A thing.

247
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,720
That's what she
turned out to be.

248
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,860
She was more
than that to us.

249
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,840
She was more than that to me.

250
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,880
She was a vital,
living person...

251
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:17,980
aboard my ship

252
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,380
for almost two years.

253
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,740
She couldn't have been
just a machine.

254
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,980
Could you love a machine?

255
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:36,760
No, sir.

256
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,640
I guess I couldn't have.

257
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,690
Cally discharged a firearm

258
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,980
with no permission,

259
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,940
endangering
her fellow shipmates.

260
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,190
30 days in the brig.

261
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:58,780
Dismissed.

262
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,320
Thank you, sir.

263
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,560
You'll see her again, Chief.

264
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,400
Excuse me?

265
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,000
There are many copies.

266
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,630
You'll see her again.

267
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,100
How many patients
do you have here?

268
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,380
Am I being
interrogated again?

269
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,180
I just think it's odd that
I've been here for two days,

270
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
and I haven't seen
anybody else.

271
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,440
Just you.

272
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,220
We have 223 patients
at the moment.

273
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,520
Two doctors and five teachers
masquerading as nurses.

274
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,740
I knew a teacher
masquerading as president.

275
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,360
What's that?

276
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,670
It's awfully quiet.

277
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,460
No screams, no moans.

278
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,340
No,"Doctor, Doctor,
please help me.

279
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:07,950
It hurts."

280
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,900
Most of our patients
are succumbing

281
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,760
to acute radiation
poisoning.

282
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:21,860
Symptoms include powerful
fatigue and immediate nausea.

283
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,440
This is followed by several days
of comparable well-being.

284
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,220
After that, cell death
in the gastric

285
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,880
and intestinal tissue
causes massive diarrhea,

286
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,310
intestinal bleeding,
and loss of water.

287
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,430
It's not pretty.

288
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,210
But it is... quiet.

289
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,240
The biggest killer
in this place is infection.

290
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,690
That's why we have you
under quarantine.

291
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,750
We don't know what you
brought in with you yet.

292
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,490
Your test results will be back
this afternoon.

293
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,230
Okay.
Almost done.

294
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,420
I think there may be a cyst
on one of your ovaries.

295
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,160
Is it serious?

296
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,210
Nah, it should be fine.

297
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,900
We'll keep an eye on it.

298
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,470
Gotta keep that reproductive
system in great shape.

299
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,650
It's your most valuable asset
these days.

300
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,360
Right.

301
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:17,510
I'm serious.

302
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,620
Finding healthy child-bearing
women your age

303
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,370
is a top priority
for the resistance.

304
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,830
And you'll be happy to know

305
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,190
that you are
a very precious commodity to us.

306
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,530
I am not a commodity.

307
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,110
I'm a viper pilot.

308
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,920
Do you see any vipers
around here?

309
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,960
I mean, you do realize that
you're one of the handful

310
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,160
of women left on this planet

311
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,050
actually capable
of having children.

312
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,240
Right? I mean, that is your
most valuable skill right now.

313
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,260
Well, I don't want a child.
So just drop it, okay?

314
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,740
Well, no one's forcing you.

315
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,320
Just take a moment
and think about...

316
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,090
where you are
and what's going on.

317
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,250
The human race
is on the verge of extinction.

318
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,500
And to be quite frank
with you, potential mothers

319
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,600
are a lot more valuable
right now

320
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,210
than a whole squadron
of viper pilots.

321
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,990
I shouldn't
have mentioned it.

322
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,450
I should have known
you'd be sensitive.

323
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,950
A lot of women

324
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,950
with your history
forego bearing children

325
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,770
of their own.

326
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:26,810
My history?

327
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,100
I saw the fractures
on your x-rays.

328
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,410
A lot of old fractures
from childhood.

329
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,500
It's interesting
how you managed to break

330
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,210
every finger on both hands.

331
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,550
Every break
in the exact same place,

332
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,010
between the first
and the second knuckle.

333
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,570
Did someone break
your fingers, Kara?

334
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,110
Get out.

335
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,760
Children of abusive parents

336
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,350
often fear passing along
that abuse

337
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:16,720
to their own children.

338
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,420
Get out!

339
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,650
Is she kidding with this?

340
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,490
I know it's hard to believe,
but that message

341
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,780
has cropped up
all over the fleet.

342
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,540
It's religious crap.

343
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,990
"It seems I have been chosen
to help lead you

344
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,020
"to the promised land
of Earth.

345
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,350
"I will not question
this choice,

346
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,550
"I will simply try
to play my part in the plan.

347
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,790
"Therefore,
at the appointed hour,

348
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,290
"I will give a signal
to the fleet.

349
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,240
"All those wishing
to honor the gods

350
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,710
"and walk the path of destiny

351
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,260
"will follow me back to Kobol.

352
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,320
"It is there that we will meet
the gods' servant

353
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,620
with the Arrow of Apollo."

354
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,200
We've got five Raptors with
marine fire teams standing by

355
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,800
to board the Astral Queen.

356
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,400
No one's gonna follow her.

357
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,750
No one's going
to believe this crap.

358
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,110
No one's this stupid.

359
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,660
And anyone that is,

360
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,020
that wants to make
a suicide run to Kobol...

361
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,840
please let them.

362
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,480
Two minutes.

363
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,170
Any other ships declared
themselves for us?

364
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,430
Not yet.

365
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,950
Oh, no, that-- no.

366
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,850
Please, this isn't necessary.

367
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,700
Give them your blessing.

368
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,740
Oh, no.

369
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,860
It's not right.
This isn't who I am.

370
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,010
Laura, this is your path.

371
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,480
The one the gods picked
for you.

372
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,610
The one you picked
for yourself.

373
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,740
Anders, we musta been over
this line ten times already.

374
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,890
She must have taken
a bullet.

375
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,650
She was right here
by the vehicles.

376
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,450
Okay, she would have got up and
crawled the frak out of here.

377
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,650
Hey, we have to search
the entire area again.

378
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,420
I told you we shouldn't have
pulled back so fast.

379
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,690
I thought she was with us.

380
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,580
Anders, we got ambushed.

381
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,120
Okay, we all got separated.

382
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:29,890
There's nothing we could
have done about it.

383
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,160
Kara, of all people,
would understand.

384
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:32,870
Let's just find her.

385
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,340
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

386
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,100
I know where Starbuck is.

387
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,320
Sharon?

388
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,530
Where have you been?

389
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,220
Tracking you.

390
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,310
Who is she?

391
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:55,490
She's with us.

392
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,840
You're the father
of my child, Helo,

393
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
I'm not gonna lose you.

394
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,100
Where is she?

395
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,470
We're ready.

396
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,590
Send the signal and Jump.

397
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,060
Astral Queen has jumped away.

398
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,650
Now see how many follow.

399
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,670
To sit around
and wait for Starbuck to show up

400
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,210
with that stupid arrow?

401
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,090
Two.
Three at the most.

402
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,230
Good morning.

403
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,390
You look better.

404
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,740
What's this new scar?

405
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,320
They had to go
back in last night

406
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,260
while you were asleep.

407
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,460
Some internal bleeding
to tie up.

408
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,100
Nothing to worry about.
Everything's gonna be fine.

409
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,900
Just about done
with you, Starbuck.

410
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,290
Nice way of puttin' it.

411
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,720
Just a few more tests.

412
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,190
And--

413
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,500
I almost said we'll
be sending you back home.

414
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,640
I guess we'll be sending you
back into the fight.

415
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,680
Sounds good to me.

416
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,770
Hey, I just woke up.

417
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,520
Now you're going
back to sleep.

418
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,040
You're the doc.

419
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,270
Ahhh.

420
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,830
Pending lab test results
on sample ovaries,

421
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,890
complete removal
will proceed tomorrow.

422
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,420
If lab tests are positive,
then subject will be removed

423
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,990
to processing facility
for final disposition.

424
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,330
Is that regret I hear
in your voice, Simon?

425
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,400
If it is, it certainly
is none of your concern.

426
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,630
Lords of Kobol,
please help me.

427
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,060
Morning.

428
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,610
Are you sure
you're feeling okay?

429
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,280
You know, something actually
has been bothering me lately.

430
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,990
Ahhh!

431
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,550
I never told you
my call sign was Starbuck.

432
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,940
You can't kill me.

433
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,830
Just die!

434
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,310
Sue-Shaun.

435
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,730
Sue-Shaun,
it's me-- Kara.

436
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,490
Hold on, okay?
I'm gonna get you outta here.

437
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,710
No.
No time.

438
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,150
Cut the power.

439
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,450
It'll kill you.

440
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,590
Can't live like this.

441
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,800
The baby machines.

442
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,320
Please.

443
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,190
Please.

444
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,510
Ahh!

445
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,190
Kara, come on!
Let's go!
Let's go!

446
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,280
Go! Go! Go!

447
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,040
Get down!
Kara, get down!

448
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,210
Let's go!
Let's go!

449
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,210
We gotta go!

450
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,270
Hey.

451
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,820
Come on!

452
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,800
Move like you have
a purpose, people.

453
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,150
Let's go, go, go, go!

454
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,180
24 ships, sir.

455
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,300
That's almost a third
of the fleet.

456
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,710
Why?

457
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,530
Why?

458
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,540
They were conducting research

459
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,320
into Human/Cylon
breeding programs.

460
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,290
Human/Cylon?

461
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,760
They call them farms.

462
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,150
Your gunshot wound
looks fine.

463
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,010
So farms, that's great.

464
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,220
What were they gonna do?
Knock me up with some Cylon kid?

465
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:33,900
They were gonna try to.

466
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,060
We haven't been
very successful so far.

467
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,300
Supposedly they can't reproduce.

468
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,920
You know, biologically.

469
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,300
So they've been trying every
which way to produce offspring.

470
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,350
Why?

471
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:52,970
Procreation, it's one of God's
commandments, be fruitful.

472
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,710
We can't fulfill it.
We've tried.

473
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,060
So we decided to--

474
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,700
To rape human women.

475
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,970
You know, if you agreed
to bear children,

476
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,630
it'd be voluntary,
maybe even set you up

477
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,400
with someone you like.

478
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,660
Like you two kids?

479
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,550
We're different.

480
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,820
What the frak
is that supposed to mean?

481
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:15,800
They have this theory.

482
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,740
Maybe the one thing
they were missing was love.

483
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:23,700
So Sharon and I...

484
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:27,550
we were set up to--

485
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,640
To fall in love?

486
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,730
They didn't ask Sue-Shaun if she
wanted to fall in love, right?

487
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,370
They put a tube in her!

488
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,140
And they hooked her up
to a machine!

489
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,430
They know who you are, Kara.

490
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,020
You're special.

491
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:48,850
Leoben told you that.

492
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,190
You have a destiny.

493
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,440
Starbuck, what's
this second scar?

494
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,220
I don't know.

495
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,410
I'm not sure I wanna know now.

496
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,690
You know?

497
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,550
No.

498
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,490
How many women do they have
at these farms?

499
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,180
Hundreds...

500
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,930
Maybe thousands.

501
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,790
I don't know.
I haven't accessed that data.

502
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,650
Here's what we do.

503
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,620
Take the Heavy Raider,
cram it full of ground troops,

504
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,580
find out where the next farm is,
liberate it,

505
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,850
then the next
and the next and the next.

506
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,200
No, no, no, no, that's not why
you came to Caprica.

507
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,570
Go find Earth.

508
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,570
What about you?

509
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,190
You said you needed
professional advice.

510
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,000
We'll muddle through.

511
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,210
We've managed so far.

512
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,760
They'll kill you.

513
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,640
You'll die here.

514
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:37,500
You know that.

515
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,820
A lot of people died here.

516
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,090
I tell you this.

517
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,020
If I'm gonna die here,

518
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,470
I'm gonna take out
every last one

519
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,040
of those frakkin' farms
before I do.

520
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,630
I'm not gonna leave you here.

521
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,150
Well...

522
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,920
you said you were gonna
come back, remember?

523
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,520
I'm gonna hold you to it.

524
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,570
I'm coming back.

525
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,200
I said it.
I meant it.

526
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,460
Yeah, okay.

527
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,440
Hey...

528
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,790
Be safe.

529
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,630
Let's go home.
