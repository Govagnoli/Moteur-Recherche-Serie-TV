1
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,436
I'm afraid the tests are positive. 

2
00:01:20,437 --> 00:01:25,437
The mass is malignant. It's advanced 
well beyond the left breast.

3
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:32,876
I'm afraid the test is positive. 

4
00:01:34,576 --> 00:01:39,576
Ms. Roslin... the surgery, 
of course, to remove the mass...

5
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:04,113
Secretary Roslin?

6
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:05,482
Yes?

7
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:10,483
Naylin Stans from the education 
alliance. You said you wanted to talk?

8
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:14,698
Yes. I'm sorry, Mr. Stans...

9
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,907
I have to admit, I was 
surprised to get your message.

10
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:20,394
The President was surprised I sent it.

11
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:22,461
Once our chief negotiator 
got a billy-club to the head, 

12
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:27,462
we figured Adar's government 
had written us off as a lost cause.

13
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,895
I was a teacher long before
 I was secretary of education, 

14
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:35,896
and causes are only lost when we give up.

15
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:04,232
Madame President? 
Can you hear me? 

16
00:03:08,061 --> 00:03:12,906
Let's make her as 
comfortable as we can.

17
00:03:12,907 --> 00:03:17,907
Oh, gods...

18
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:22,062
Starbuck zero four niner- cap is away.

19
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:27,030
Galactica, roger that. 
Zero four niner. Safe flight.

20
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:31,817
Safe and 20 frakkin' minutes late. 
Did you have a rough night, starbuck?

21
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:34,163
You're way out of line. 

22
00:04:34,164 --> 00:04:38,002
Just follow my lead and save
 the attitude for someone who cares.

23
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:41,415
Kat six seven zero- roger that. 

24
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,137
Request permission to clear guns.

25
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:48,138
Roger that, Kat. 
Clear your throat.

26
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:53,813
Damn it!

27
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:56,859
Weapons malfunction! Weapons 
malfunction! Galactica!

28
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,335
Kat, you good?

29
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:01,332
I'm good, I'm good. What 
the hell just happened?

30
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,767
Your wing gun's out. 

31
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,223
Just keep it steady, we're going home. 

32
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:07,958
Galactica, this is Starbuck. 
I'm declaring an emergency. 

33
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,292
We've got two bent birds. 
Requesting priority clearance to land.

34
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:16,293
Starbuck, Galactica. Flight deck is yours.

35
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:33,427
Why don't you just shoot 
us in the locker room, chief? 

36
00:05:33,428 --> 00:05:35,223
Save the wear and tear on the ships.

37
00:05:35,224 --> 00:05:37,255
Kat's guns are clean,
 I checked 'em myself.

38
00:05:37,256 --> 00:05:41,548
Yeah, well I don't 
believe in accidents.

39
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:46,549
Chief. Something's not right.

40
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:53,294
The weight's off, it's too light.

41
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:57,756
I found three more just like it. 
Mixed in with the regular rounds.

42
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:01,517
Casing's been weakened. 
Falls apart in the barrel.

43
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:05,138
Next one hits it- bang, she's lucky 
she didn't lose her whole wing. 

44
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,945
One bad round's a fluke. 
More than one, sabotage. 

45
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:09,445
Pull 'em all!

46
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:14,446
Alright you heard the
 chief, lets pull 'em all! Go!

47
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:19,053
How's the President doing, Doc?

48
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:22,006
She's dying... and she knows it.

49
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:27,007
I offered her a shot of morpha to ease 
the pain, but... she wouldn't hear of it.

50
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:40,941
Tests are positive.

51
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:44,881
Mr. President... the terrorists...

52
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:49,454
Mr. President, we should at least speak
with the strikers before sending in the troops. 

53
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:51,833
They're teachers, not terrorists.

54
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,271
They're acting like thugs. 

55
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:55,792
They're last demonstration 
put two policemen in the hospital. 

56
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:58,384
Six of them have chained themselves 
outside the hall of education. 

57
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,801
As far as I'm concerned,
 they're criminals.

58
00:07:00,802 --> 00:07:03,303
Their pay is substandard,
 their schools are falling apart, 

59
00:07:03,304 --> 00:07:06,943
and the strike action has been gaining 
momentum for months, and you know that. 

60
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:10,003
I don't understand why we're 
not at least talking to them.

61
00:07:10,004 --> 00:07:11,759
One of the most interesting
 things about being president

62
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,760
is that you don't have to
 explain yourself...to anyone. 

63
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:24,733
You've already set a meeting 
with Stans, haven't you?

64
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:30,661
Obviously, only if you 
approve, Mr. President.

65
00:07:31,254 --> 00:07:33,868
She's really not in a 
fit state to do anything... 

66
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:35,542
let alone conduct 
any government business.

67
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:38,640
Don't talk about 
me as if I'm not here.

68
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:43,420
There'll be plenty of 
time for that soon enough. 

69
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,735
Billy, could you-

70
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:51,736
Gentlemen, I called you
 here to discuss the Cylon. 

71
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:57,141
Dr. Cottle... would you please tell
 them what you told me this morning?

72
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,197
I'm no expert in genetics, 
but I can read a blood test. 

73
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:07,198
That Cylon fetus is showing some 
very peculiar genetic abnormalities.

74
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:10,297
I haven't seen any of 
this on your report, Doctor.

75
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:15,298
No, um. Well, as Dr. Cottle says, 
he's- he's not an expert, and I am. 

76
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:18,060
Um, I've been through
 the tests and I-I 

77
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:21,201
wouldn't say that there
 was anything conclusive.

78
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:24,707
Didn't say conclusive, 
just damned odd.

79
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:29,708
Right. Madame President. 

80
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:33,621
As you know, the Sharon Cylon 

81
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:36,891
is of considerable tactical 
value to the fleet.

82
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:41,892
Perhaps you've gotten too
 close to your subject, Doctor. 

83
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:45,741
This is difficult, so I'm
 going to cut right to it. 

84
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:50,742
Allowing this thing to be born 
could have frightening consequences. 

85
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:55,409
For the security of this fleet,
 I believe the Cylon pregnancy 

86
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,413
must be terminated before it is too late.

87
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,726
Madame President, I'd like-

88
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:05,572
I thought you of all people
would understand, Admiral.

89
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:10,573
Madame President. I don't 
understand, this makes no sense.

90
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:12,971
One of the interesting things 
about being president is 

91
00:09:12,972 --> 00:09:15,430
you don't have to 
explain yourself to anyone. 

92
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:20,431
Thank you, gentlemen, 
I'm-I'm a little tired. 

93
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:24,330
Gentlemen.

94
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:27,608
I don't want to seem alarmist, 
um, but I am perturbed. 

95
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:31,272
I think that the, uh, the President's
 illness is affecting her judgment. 

96
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:32,605
Especially when it 
comes to the subject-

97
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,103
She seemed reasonably 
coherent to me.

98
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:37,442
Well, then I'll have to appeal
 to you on scientific grounds. 

99
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:41,039
Destroying this child would seriously
 impact my studies of the Cylon sub-species.

100
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,190
The President made the
 call and I'm backing her.

101
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:44,280
Look, with all due respect,
 the President made the call 

102
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,763
based on evidence presented 
by Dr. Cottle, and he's medicine's-

103
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:49,185
Pull yourself together. 

104
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:51,968
You're about to become 
President of the colonies. 

105
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:54,498
You're going to be asked to 
make some very hard decisions.

106
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:59,499
Act like you can handle it.

107
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:10,742
Gods- uh... 

108
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:17,023
where have you been?

109
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:20,361
Where have I been? 

110
00:10:20,362 --> 00:10:22,694
I never left you, Gaius.

111
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:25,079
Oh, right, yeah, um. 

112
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,440
Yeah, metaphorically speaking. 

113
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:32,441
It's just that it was 
weeks ago, and I, uh...

114
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:46,050
I'm sure you've suffered 
mightily in my absence.

115
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:50,084
You know, jealousy
 is a really ugly emotion. 

116
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:52,488
What is this lingering controversy 

117
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:55,645
over my affair with your
 three-dimensional duplicate.

118
00:10:55,646 --> 00:10:57,248
I'm not jealous, I'm concerned.

119
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:59,833
Oh yeah, concerned, about what?

120
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:02,043
Our child!

121
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:03,332
Oh-now you're concerned?

122
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,682
Well, for your information,
 the President wants to kill it. 

123
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:08,376
Once Roslin's gone, 
you'll be President. 

124
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:11,334
You can use your new 
authority to save our child.

125
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:13,767
Oh, like that's gonna- did you 
see the way Adama looked at me?

126
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:15,416
The contempt on his face? 

127
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,678
I will be the President, all right, 

128
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,594
but without the military support,
 I might as well be an anointed dog catcher.

129
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:25,498
Yes, well, you have your 
own resources if you'd use them. 

130
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:27,900
What, you don't 
know what I mean?

131
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,709
No, I don't know what you mean.

132
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,669
The nuclear device. 

133
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,578
The one Adama provided
 for your research.

134
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:36,829
There is one way.

135
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,922
I didn't want to have 
to ask you for this.

136
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:39,807
I didn't want to 
have to ask you for this.

137
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:40,869
But what I really need-

138
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,497
But what I really need

139
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:43,142
To complete the project...
- is a nuclear warhead.

140
00:11:43,143 --> 00:11:48,098
Is a nuclear- warhead.

141
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:50,547
You're totally insane.

142
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:54,787
I'm trying to help you, you idiot.

143
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:57,989
If Adama remains committed 
to the destruction of our child,

144
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,990
it may be our only hope.

145
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:10,587
There's no easy way to say this.

146
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:12,976
It's about the Cylon. 

147
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:17,977
The President has decided that 
her pregnancy will be terminated.

148
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:23,666
What? Why?

149
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:28,667
Doc Cottle discovered some 
anomalies in the fetal blood work.

150
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:31,921
Isn't that expected?

151
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:34,100
Maybe. 

152
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:38,088
But the President believes that
 to allow the baby to come to full term

153
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:41,954
constitutes an 
unacceptable risk to the fleet.

154
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:44,479
I don't understand. 

155
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,885
Sharon's only helped us 
since she came back from Caprica.

156
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:49,519
She even turned on her own.

157
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,408
To save her life.

158
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:54,414
Don't mistake the will the live 

159
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:58,271
for genuine compassion, 
Lieutenant. 

160
00:12:58,272 --> 00:13:00,792
She's still the enemy.

161
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:02,958
Does she know?

162
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,441
Not yet.

163
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:09,792
Then I should be 
the one to tell her. 

164
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:12,215
If that's all, sir.

165
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:16,137
Helo. I don't expect you
 to agree to the decision. 

166
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:19,000
But I need you to accept it.

167
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:22,454
We're talking about my child, sir. 

168
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:24,100
Part of me. 

169
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:27,878
But I guess it's easier 
to kill when you call it a Cylon.

170
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:32,879
Dismissed.

171
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:39,459
So you're saying someone's been
 tampering with our ammunition.

172
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,258
Shells don't unload themselves.

173
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:42,499
What's this I hear
 about you ordering

174
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,758
both Galactica and Pegasus
 fighters to stand down?

175
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,908
Price you pay for 
reinstating me as CAG, sir.

176
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:49,216
Maybe that was a mistake.

177
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:50,849
Maybe I don't give a 
damn what you think, sir.

178
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,680
Take it easy, both of you.

179
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:56,424
Fact is, we've been sharing
 stories between the ships. 

180
00:13:56,425 --> 00:13:59,513
And nobody flies combat until 
our ammo supplies check out.

181
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:02,850
Leaving us defenseless if
 the Cylons decide to pick a fight.

182
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:07,782
We were defenseless before
 this, we just didn't know about it. 

183
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:12,783
Lee, find out who did this.

184
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:21,975
All right. Excuse me, 
I'm looking for Asha Janik.

185
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:24,450
Asha, she's over there.

186
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:27,958
Let's do this quietly. 

187
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,959
Asha Janik? 
-Captain Adama.

188
00:14:33,864 --> 00:14:36,158
I have a message
 for your father. 

189
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,172
They may take me!

190
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:38,060
Okay, stop her!

191
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:40,691
But I am one of many! 

192
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:44,512
We have declared war against
 Galactica's armies of death! 

193
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:46,514
The Cylons aren't 
our true enemy! 

194
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:50,280
It's the military 
that refuses to negotiate! 

195
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:52,574
All we want is peace! 

196
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:54,853
Demand peace! Demand peace!

197
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:59,854
So much for being discreet, huh?

198
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:05,683
We found these pamphlets
 in Janik's quarters.

199
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:10,416
Some kind of a manifesto.

200
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:12,734
"Demand peace from the Cylons?" 

201
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:14,309
Who the hell are these people?

202
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,201
Cylon sympathizers. 

203
00:15:16,202 --> 00:15:19,377
Just had no idea they 
were this organized.

204
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:22,921
I want to know how 
she got aboard my ship.

205
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,762
The hangar deck's short-staffed. 

206
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:27,296
We've been forced to import 
civilians to handle some of the grunt work. 

207
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:30,636
Apparently she's, um, she's a Picon,
 worked maintenance on the Greenleaf, 

208
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:32,762
no known criminal affiliations.

209
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:35,410
 Huh, until now, now listen to this:

210
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:37,868
"Do not be afraid, we are not terrorists, 

211
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:40,422
but we will not sit back 
while Adama's war machine

212
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:45,423
continues to press us 
into cruel and futile conflict." 

213
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:47,222
"Our demonstrations worked. 

214
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:49,575
News is already spreading 
across the fleet."

215
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:53,464
I know. We were 
contacted by a person

216
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:55,818
claiming to speak
 for the subversives 

217
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:58,859
demanding a meeting 
on the Galactica.

218
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,934
They've got stones,
 I'll give them that.

219
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:02,586
Well, I've agreed.

220
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,225
What? 

221
00:16:04,226 --> 00:16:06,571
We're not negotiating. 

222
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:11,572
I just want to know 
what we're up against.

223
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,990
Madame secretary?

224
00:16:24,991 --> 00:16:29,719
Considering the stakes, you don't 
seem particularly engaged.

225
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,330
The stakes are what we 
decide to make them, Mr. Stans.

226
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:35,888
If the President uses troops
 to enforce us back to work order, 

227
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:39,198
people will get hurt. Even die.

228
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,199
Some causes are worth dying for.

229
00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:49,764
Not this one.

230
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,627
The mass is malignant.

231
00:16:56,628 --> 00:17:01,628
Doctor.

232
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:09,708
Admiral, I am Royan Jahee. 

233
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,222
You have a unique way of 
welcoming visitors to your ship.

234
00:17:12,223 --> 00:17:15,588
Visitor, my ass. We shoot
 people like you for treason.

235
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,635
Colonel, I'm only an interested
 party trying to prevent more bloodshed.

236
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:22,171
I deplore what happened 
aboard your vipers.

237
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:25,859
How many sympathizers do 
we have aboard this fleet?

238
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,725
If you're trying to crush an
 organization, you can stop now. 

239
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:33,679
The people in this movement
 are following an idea, not a leader.

240
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,117
What the hell do they want?

241
00:17:35,118 --> 00:17:38,018
Peace... with the Cylon.

242
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:43,019
You want us to surrender? 
They attacked us.

243
00:17:43,204 --> 00:17:45,915
Only after we'd enslaved them! 

244
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,095
You call yourselves 
military men, strategists. 

245
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:53,501
Explain to me how our current course
 of attack and retreat leads to victory?

246
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:56,831
You can play innocent bystander, but I
 think you know more than you're telling us. 

247
00:17:56,832 --> 00:17:59,082
Either way, you're 
a danger to this fleet.

248
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,711
Admiral, arresting me isn't
 going to stop any of this.

249
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:06,712
Maybe not. But it's 
a start. Take him away.

250
00:18:11,376 --> 00:18:12,901
All right, get your rubber gloves on. 

251
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:15,626
This is everything from
 the Janik woman's quarters. 

252
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,078
Somehow the Admiral thinks
 looking through this crap's 

253
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:23,079
gonna tell us something new 
about their so-called movement.

254
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:30,943
So, um... haven't seen much 
of you since your space walk.

255
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:38,102
Hold it, what is this?

256
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:44,129
What's a deckhand need with 
a portable library reader?

257
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:49,579
The Daru Mozu. A tylium refinery. 

258
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,177
And Janik's used to explosives. 

259
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:58,297
This is the CAG. Get me a
 tak team ready, right now.

260
00:18:58,298 --> 00:19:03,298
I don't understand, why
 are they doing this now?

261
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:07,474
I don't know. 

262
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:12,475
The Admiral said they found 
something in the baby's blood. 

263
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:16,176
Somehow, President Roslin 
considers it a threat to the fleet.

264
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:18,522
It can't just be that. 

265
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,924
I've done nothing but help
 them since I've come here.

266
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:23,147
I've held back my anger. 

267
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:25,652
I've tried to show them 
that Cylons are not all the same. 

268
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:26,543
That we're not all murderers.

269
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:31,171
Deep down, I think
 they're still afraid of you.

270
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:36,172
Yeah... afraid. 

271
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,057
They wanna be afraid of something? 

272
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:53,464
Yeah? Just let them come! 

273
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:58,465
Let 'em! Let them
 try to take my baby! 

274
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,803
Just let them try to take my baby!

275
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:07,804
Sharon, stop!

276
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:13,684
Sharon, please 
don't do this! Please!

277
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:18,685
Listen to me, listen
 to me! Listen to me.

278
00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:37,846
When we land, move fast. 

279
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:41,146
We're looking for explosive devices
 set near the Daru's FTL drive.

280
00:20:41,147 --> 00:20:42,393
Captain, I'm getting 
something on the wireless.

281
00:20:42,394 --> 00:20:47,092
I think it's coming
 from the Daru Mozu.

282
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:50,163
None of us want to die, 
but the fighting must end. 

283
00:20:50,164 --> 00:20:53,650
If my sacrifice sends a signal 
to the Cylon that brings peace,

284
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:56,253
then it was worth it. 
I do this for my children,

285
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:57,970
and for the children that will follow them. 

286
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:00,788
Gods willing, demand
 peace, demand peace.

287
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:05,789
Pull out, pull out! 
Pull out, pull out, pull out!

288
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,517
People are dead.

289
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:26,352
I grieve for them, Admiral. 

290
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:30,215
And I assure you, the tylium's 
ship's just a taste of what's in store, 

291
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:34,727
unless someone starts listening!

292
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,774
You listen and you listen well. 

293
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:42,027
I don't care if I have to interrogate 
every civilian on board this fleet. 

294
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:47,028
This is gonna stop. 
Do you understand?

295
00:21:47,062 --> 00:21:52,062
 Yes.

296
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:58,132
Mr. Vice President, President 
Roslin insisted on your taking the tour. 

297
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:03,133
She'd like the transition to
 go as smoothly as possible.

298
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:06,437
What are these?

299
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:11,438
Cylon agent suspects, sir.

300
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:22,018
That number means 
everything to her. 

301
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:27,019
Represents hope, that's our future.

302
00:22:27,527 --> 00:22:30,407
Yes, yes.

303
00:22:30,408 --> 00:22:35,210
Being the President is, 
uh, a lot of responsibility. 

304
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:39,406
It's tradition for outgoing Presidents
 to leave a letter for their successor.

305
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:43,394
It's usually opened on 
the first day of the new term, 

306
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:48,395
but the next few days are
 liable to prove... hectic, so...

307
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:57,407
Well, let's just pray
 that she gets better.

308
00:22:57,408 --> 00:22:59,643
Let's.

309
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:04,644
Excuse me.

310
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:11,921
Mr. Vice President?

311
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:17,431
Hello?

312
00:23:17,432 --> 00:23:22,417
Yes. Yes.

313
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:27,418
I understand. Thank you.

314
00:23:56,845 --> 00:24:00,579
I was told I might 
meet an old friend here.

315
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,580
It's good to see you, Gaius.

316
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:11,440
So you've become a member 
of the peace movement?

317
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,333
Well, despite what you may think, 

318
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:17,420
I've always abhorred violence. 

319
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:22,421
Would you excuse us? Please.

320
00:24:27,595 --> 00:24:29,332
Do they have any
 idea what you are?

321
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:34,333
Of course not, even
 their dedication has limits.

322
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:43,519
I miss you. 

323
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:50,676
You look amazing. 

324
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:57,899
I can't believe- 

325
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:05,870
how real you are.

326
00:25:06,216 --> 00:25:07,694
What're you doing?

327
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:12,520
I haven't stopped thinking about you
 since the second I left the Pegasus.

328
00:25:12,521 --> 00:25:13,097
No, no- 

329
00:25:13,098 --> 00:25:14,585
I can't get you out of my head.

330
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:17,185
Don't-do this, not yet.

331
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:22,186
I can't help myself, I can't.

332
00:25:27,148 --> 00:25:29,105
I'm sorry.

333
00:25:29,106 --> 00:25:34,106
No, I'm- I'm sorry.
 I'm just-I'm not ready.

334
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:38,103
So, is there any reason in 
particular for inviting me around here? 

335
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:43,104
Because you saved 
me. Let me save you.

336
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:48,239
Oh, here we go again.
 What are you talking about?

337
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:52,356
You must sense it. Gaius, 
the fleet's crumbling. 

338
00:25:52,357 --> 00:25:57,357
People are turning on each other. There 
are serious misgivings about the military. 

339
00:25:57,788 --> 00:26:01,794
When you're President, you can use 
the office to turn them against Adama, 

340
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:05,041
paving the way
 for the Cylons to save us.

341
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:07,128
I-I would love to be
 with you always, but-

342
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:12,129
I know it's hard, but it's the only way.

343
00:26:23,878 --> 00:26:28,878
No. No.

344
00:26:29,825 --> 00:26:32,545
I am not who you think I am. 

345
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:37,546
And I will not be responsible
 for the destruction of mankind.

346
00:26:42,597 --> 00:26:47,597
If you would have caught it sooner, 
maybe we could have done more.

347
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:53,219
Laura, come in.

348
00:26:54,236 --> 00:26:58,101
I didn't like the way 
we left things this morning.

349
00:26:58,102 --> 00:26:58,560
Richard, I-

350
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:03,561
I know. You've been thinking
 this is a mistake for a while now.

351
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:23,141
I just met with Stans. 

352
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,944
The education alliance
 is going to back off.

353
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:29,215
Back off?

354
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:32,865
Laura, what did you give them?

355
00:27:32,866 --> 00:27:37,866
I made them a promise that we would 
seriously hear out their grievances, Richard.

356
00:27:38,225 --> 00:27:42,717
I thought you'd be happy 
they're going back to work.

357
00:27:42,718 --> 00:27:45,972
Laura, you've put me
 in a very awkward position.

358
00:27:45,973 --> 00:27:50,016
I don't see how. 
Both sides gave ground.

359
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:51,777
It's not just about your teachers.

360
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:54,548
It's the next strike I'm worried about. 

361
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:58,723
You just showed them that if they hold 
out long enough, this administration will cave.

362
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:01,479
You expected me to fail.

363
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,579
I expected you to hold the line.

364
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,412
This doesn't have to 
be the end of the world. 

365
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:09,343
You can stay on in 
an advisory capacity.

366
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,781
Gods know we need your ideas.

367
00:28:11,782 --> 00:28:14,147
You're asking me to resign?

368
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:16,605
I don't have any choice. 

369
00:28:16,606 --> 00:28:18,745
This isn't about you 
and me anymore.

370
00:28:18,746 --> 00:28:20,466
You're right, it's not. 

371
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:23,631
You were willing to attack those
people and up until a few hours ago,

372
00:28:23,632 --> 00:28:25,280
I was prepared to let you.

373
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:29,373
I am on my way to the Galactica 
to represent this administration. 

374
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:33,138
When I return, if you still
want my job, be prepared to fight. 

375
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:38,139
When I return...

376
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:42,307
Notify the Admiral.

377
00:28:42,308 --> 00:28:44,274
This is Admiral Adama. 

378
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:49,275
As you know, President Roslin has 
been aboard Galactica for the last few days.

379
00:28:50,386 --> 00:28:55,386
She's a fighter. But as of 
this moment, her prognosis is grave. 

380
00:28:56,767 --> 00:29:00,137
I know that many of you 
believe in the power of prayer.

381
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:05,138
If that is your way, then I urge
 you to pray for our President.

382
00:29:07,124 --> 00:29:10,769
As for the others,
 I hope you will join me

383
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:15,770
in keeping her in our thoughts.

384
00:30:08,877 --> 00:30:13,877
Admiral, please don't do this.

385
00:30:17,717 --> 00:30:22,572
Stand down, everyone. 

386
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:27,573
Give me room. 

387
00:30:32,438 --> 00:30:37,329
Think about what you're 
doing Helo. You're a soldier.

388
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,515
I'm a father, like you. 

389
00:30:40,516 --> 00:30:43,952
Please, sir... give me a raptor, 

390
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:47,246
let me take her off the ship.
 I'll get her away from the fleet.

391
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:48,577
I can't do that, son.

392
00:30:48,578 --> 00:30:51,016
Admiral, Admiral!

393
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:53,609
Doctor, get the hell outta here.

394
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,178
Admiral, I must talk to 
you concerning the Cylon child.

395
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:01,179
It seems I may have been... wrong. 

396
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:03,986
Very wrong. 

397
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:08,987
When I said that Dr. Cottle 
misinterpreted the fetal blood work-

398
00:31:18,152 --> 00:31:23,152
See, I had another look at those samples
and I discovered something quite intriguing. 

399
00:31:23,227 --> 00:31:27,834
Understand, Cylon blood is virtually
 impossible to differentiate from our own. 

400
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:32,835
That being said, obviously it has to be slightly
different because the Cylon is not human, 

401
00:31:36,016 --> 00:31:41,016
If our blood looks like this... 

402
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:44,736
for example. 

403
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:49,737
And the Cylon's blood looks like this... 

404
00:31:53,451 --> 00:31:58,451
then it's fair to assume that the
 Cylon human is carrying an amalgam.

405
00:31:58,466 --> 00:32:00,707
Is this a theory or fact?

406
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:03,705
The Cylon's fetus contains no antigens. 

407
00:32:03,706 --> 00:32:06,695
It has no blood type. That's 
what Dr. Cottle was talking about 

408
00:32:06,696 --> 00:32:10,933
when he said it was damned odd. 
Except it's not damned odd, it's astonishing. 

409
00:32:10,934 --> 00:32:15,479
Now, knowing as we do that the Cylons are built
 slightly better to endure than their human counterparts, 

410
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,648
I wonder could the 
Cylon blood also be blessed, 

411
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:23,649
shall we say blessed, with a 
heightened resistance to disease? 

412
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:30,210
Huh...so. I applied a 
sample of Sharon's fetal blood 

413
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:37,287
to some cancer cells
 I took from the President.

414
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:46,521
What am I looking at?

415
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:49,215
Nothing. That's the whole point. 

416
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:52,706
The cancer was gone and it was
 gone within a matter of hours.

417
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:55,473
Are you saying you found a 
cure for the President's cancer?

418
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,184
Well, it's untried. 

419
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:01,595
It-it's obviously untried and 
therefore extremely dangerous. 

420
00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:04,882
But, yes, it's possible.

421
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:09,883
If you abort Sharon's fetus 
now, you'll never know.

422
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:31,699
Now you may feel a sharp pain.

423
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,700
Sharon, it's okay,
 it's gonna be all right.

424
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:58,816
I don't like what you're doing. 

425
00:33:58,817 --> 00:34:02,941
I think it's unnatural
 and damned dangerous.

426
00:34:02,942 --> 00:34:07,187
Yes, well, given the 
patient's current condition, 

427
00:34:07,188 --> 00:34:09,838
I am not sure that I 
see the downside.

428
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,839
Maybe it's just her time.

429
00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:20,213
Then for once... perhaps I am
 the beacon of hope around here.

430
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:36,420
If you want to settle this, 
your people have to disengage.

431
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:41,013
No more civil disobedience, 
no more acts of violence. 

432
00:34:41,014 --> 00:34:46,014
I want our students back in school.

433
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,398
Done. 

434
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,585
I'm glad you called, 
Madame secretary.

435
00:34:54,586 --> 00:34:59,586
Me too.

436
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:04,446
I'm afraid the tests are positive. 

437
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:08,067
The mass is malignant.

438
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:13,068
What's happening?

439
00:35:14,543 --> 00:35:18,300
Nurse! Help me get her on her side.

440
00:35:18,301 --> 00:35:23,301
Nurse, nurse!

441
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:28,987
No, hold it.

442
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:33,879
I'll be damned.

443
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,880
Madame President?

444
00:35:55,568 --> 00:35:57,797
Dr. Baltar? 

445
00:35:57,798 --> 00:36:00,162
It's so very good to see you. 

446
00:36:00,163 --> 00:36:05,163
No, no, don't-don't
 move. Don't move. 

447
00:36:10,947 --> 00:36:15,947
Madame President, very good.

448
00:36:21,695 --> 00:36:23,616
How's she doing, doctor?

449
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:27,457
I've never seen anything like it.

450
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:30,329
It'll be a while before 
she's a hundred percent, but...

451
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:35,330
her scans are clear. 
Cancer's gone.

452
00:36:36,522 --> 00:36:39,079
Are you sure?

453
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,976
It's gone.

454
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:45,969
Thank you.

455
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:50,970
Thank you. Admiral.

456
00:36:54,293 --> 00:36:56,286
You seem better.

457
00:36:56,287 --> 00:37:01,287
Much. Are you still holding the spokesman
 from the new faction in the brig?

458
00:37:04,048 --> 00:37:05,310
Yes.

459
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:08,534
Would you take me to him, please?

460
00:37:08,535 --> 00:37:09,734
Certainly.

461
00:37:09,735 --> 00:37:10,330
Thank you.

462
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:15,331
I'll wait for you to get dressed.

463
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:26,574
President Roslin.

464
00:37:26,575 --> 00:37:29,505
Mr. Yahee, isn't it? 

465
00:37:29,506 --> 00:37:31,296
I thought it was time we met. 

466
00:37:31,297 --> 00:37:33,059
Would you open the door, please?

467
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:38,060
Do it.

468
00:37:43,075 --> 00:37:45,291
All these people want is to be heard. 

469
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:48,862
A member of your group n
early destroyed our tylium refiner. 

470
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:52,743
Before we can even begin to 
talk I need your personal assurance 

471
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:54,860
that there will be no more attacks.

472
00:37:54,861 --> 00:37:56,457
As I told you the Admiral, 
I have had no direct contact-

473
00:37:56,458 --> 00:38:01,458
Genuine negotiations 
require trust. 

474
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:08,033
Do not lie to me.

475
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,671
I'll talk to my people.
Make them understand.

476
00:38:14,672 --> 00:38:18,914
Excellent. And I'll listen... 
maybe even act. 

477
00:38:18,915 --> 00:38:23,915
But if you renege, I'll insist the Admiral 
hunt you and your friends down, without mercy.

478
00:38:25,775 --> 00:38:28,892
You seem very content.

479
00:38:28,893 --> 00:38:30,784
Sharon's child is safe. 

480
00:38:30,785 --> 00:38:34,877
Adama and Roslin have agreed 
that more study is required 

481
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:39,441
before any drastic 
measures are taken.

482
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:44,442
Yes, but by saving Roslin, you've denied 
yourself your rightful place of leadership. 

483
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:49,601
There are many aspects of you, 
Gaius, I will never understand.

484
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:54,764
You wouldn't. 
Neither, would I suspect, 

485
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:59,765
your corporeal counterpart.

486
00:39:00,269 --> 00:39:05,269
Do you love her?

487
00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:11,740
What is that?

488
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:14,785
The letter Roslin wrote me.

489
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:19,786
To be opened upon
 the event of her death.

490
00:39:30,788 --> 00:39:35,061
"President Baltar. I offer my 
sincere congratulations-" -Thank you.

491
00:39:35,062 --> 00:39:37,049
 "I say that knowing 
we've had our differences 

492
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:41,870
and that you take office 
despite my many reservations. 

493
00:39:41,871 --> 00:39:44,155
You may be the most 
brilliant person I've ever met, 

494
00:39:44,156 --> 00:39:46,847
but your intelligence is 
unleavened by compassion. 

495
00:39:46,848 --> 00:39:50,217
You must be reminded 
of your ethical responsibilities

496
00:39:50,218 --> 00:39:54,934
and challenged to rise 
above your own selfish needs. 

497
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:57,042
I don't write this to hurt you, 

498
00:39:57,043 --> 00:39:59,389
but to beg you to open your heart. 

499
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:03,048
Understand that the people in the
 fleet look to you not just for leadership,

500
00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:07,471
but for solace... justice. 

501
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,304
Find a way to give them that, 

502
00:40:10,305 --> 00:40:15,305
and you will be a great 
leader. Laura Roslin."

503
00:40:15,669 --> 00:40:17,323
After all I've done for the fleet. 

504
00:40:17,324 --> 00:40:19,425
After all I've done for her. 

505
00:40:19,426 --> 00:40:21,858
Roslin's never trusted you.

506
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:26,859
She's undermined you 
at every turn, and now-

507
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:33,536
So now we know she's 
never gonna trust me.

508
00:40:33,537 --> 00:40:36,738
This is not a political 
struggle anymore, Gaius. 

509
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:41,739
This is quite literally life and death.

510
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:37,869
The President assured me that as long 
as there are no further acts of violence, 

511
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:42,870
she's willing to bring our concerns
 to the quorum and Admiral Adama.

512
00:41:43,407 --> 00:41:46,916
She's trying to buy time. 

513
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:49,427
She'll never be open to 
negotiating with the Cylons.

514
00:41:49,428 --> 00:41:51,053
I disagree.

515
00:41:51,054 --> 00:41:54,727
I think we've made real progress
 today, and so does the Vice President.

516
00:41:54,728 --> 00:41:55,698
Baltar?

517
00:41:55,699 --> 00:41:59,119
Yes. Just before I left, 
e asked to meet with me. 

518
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,636
He encouraged patience while 
he works with Roslin from within. 

519
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:08,022
And he offered the contents of
 this case as proof of his sincerity.

520
00:42:08,023 --> 00:42:09,336
What's in it?

521
00:42:09,337 --> 00:42:14,337
I don't know. He said that 
you should be the one to open it.

522
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,119
Frak!
