<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,716
<i>(Roslin)</i> Why don't you do yourself
a favour? Hand over your book.

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,476
<i>My Triumphs, My Mistakes</i>
by Gaius Baltar.

4
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,949
The people are reading it,
and now you're sorry.

5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,828
Baltar will get his trial.
And this is what you'll get - a hurricane.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,469
You will have sectarian violence,
assassination attempts.

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,836
You will have civil unrest
on a scale we've never seen.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,957
The president wants
to fast-track Baltar's trial.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,793
She wants someone
to take charge of the preliminaries,

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,396
help cobble together the legal framework.
She wants me to assign you.

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,159
- <i>(Apollo)</i> My grandfather's law books.
- <i>(Dualla)</i> It's from your father.

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,710
Starbuck, Apollo.
l've lost you on DRADIS.

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,273
No! No!

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,391
Lee. We're sending in the
search and rescue birds. We'll find her.

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,395
<i>No, Dad. It's no use.</i>
<i>Her ship's in pieces. We lost her.</i>

16
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,589
<i>(Roslin)</i> Here's every captain
from every ship in the fleet.

17
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,471
Captain Elias Meeker, <i>Gideon.</i>

18
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,674
And the last name for the tribunal is...

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,190
Ad...

20
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,631
Gods.

21
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,517
Yeah.

22
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,670
Yeah, l see the resemblance.

23
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,320
<i>(Anders)</i> One more for heads!

24
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,789
Watch.

25
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,668
Heads! You see that?
Four in a row. It's a frakking miracle.

26
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,320
Watch this one more time.
It's gonna be heads.

27
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,231
Watch.

28
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,312
Heads! Every time!
You see that? It's heads.

29
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,393
- Why don't you come down from there?
- l'm just fine right here.

30
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,349
Major?

31
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,919
Yeah.

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,958
Heads! You see that?

33
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,713
My girl's too lucky to check out.

34
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,519
Hey, Sam.

35
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,113
Lee.

36
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,273
Apollo.

37
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,749
You stay there, buddy.

38
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,156
You're flying.

39
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,912
- Let's get down and get some sleep.
- l'm just... l'm fine. l need to sit down.

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,115
Ow.

41
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,111
You all right?

42
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,876
She wasn't supposed to...

43
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,394
- Come on.
- No. l gotta go.

44
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,152
<i>(Apollo)</i> Frak!

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,839
Frak! Is he OK?

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,039
- Oh, l think l fell.
- Sam. Sam.

49
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,511
She's gone, Sam.
She's gone.

50
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,114
- l know.
- Yeah.

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,756
<i>(Hotdog) LSO, Viper six.</i>
<i>Request long approach.</i>

52
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,274
<i>(man)</i> Viper six, LSO.
Viper approved.

53
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,148
Never thought l'd miss
all of Starbuck's yakking.

54
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,231
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,754
Your Honour.

56
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,917
You haven't heard.
Where you been? They just announced it.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,199
You won the lottery. You now own
exactly 1/5 of Baltar's skinny ass.

58
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,149
You're one of five captains
picked to serve on the judges' tribunal.

59
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,470
<i>(Adama)</i> Hm.

60
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,996
- <i>(Sharon)</i> Here he comes.
- Frak.

61
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,312
It's a waste of my time flying Baltar's
lawyer back and forth from <i>Zephyr.</i>

62
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,914
- Tell me about it.
- Wanna know the worst part?

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,232
He sits there and tries to whisper into
my ear when he talks. l've got a helmet.

64
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,992
Sorry.

65
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,190
Mr Hughes.

66
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,030
If he takes his shoes off in my Raptor
again, l might have to kill him.

67
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,591
"Client." Everybody knows he's guilty.
He gave the Cylons our location.

68
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,990
- Why give the son of a bitch a trial?
- Because he's entitled.

69
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,470
- Even him. It's called justice.
- Yeah, right.

70
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,758
To see Baltar dead and Starbuck alive,
that'd be justice.

71
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,116
There's no justice.
As drunk as he was...

72
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,911
Racetrack!

73
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,399
<i>(Cally)</i> Racetrack!
Are you OK?

74
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,749
Yeah, yeah. l got him.
l got him. OK. OK.

75
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,637
<i>(Skulls)</i> You OK?

76
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,477
How do you intend to replace
Baltar's defence attorney?

77
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,314
- Will that be done by lottery as well?
- We'll replace him shortly.

78
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,190
There's a number of candidates. We're
working our way down the list. Next.

79
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,431
In the context of this explosion,
obviously no accident,

80
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,671
do you really think it's wise
to proceed with this trial?

81
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,470
This administration
will never bow to terrorism.

82
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,439
Wait. Let me say something to all of you.
Let me get this clear. All right?

83
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,150
As long as l am president,
this administration will not allow terrorism

84
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,031
to alter the framework of our legal system.
We will proceed with the trial. Rigorously.

85
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,237
- Thank you. All of you.
- One more question!

86
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,909
Helo. l need you to set up a DRADIS picket
with blue squadron at sector seven.

87
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,073
Uh... Excuse me, sir.
You mean sector nine, right?

88
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,957
Uh...

89
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,911
Right. Right. Nine. Um... Yeah.
We scrubbed eight on the last picket.

90
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,471
It's been so quiet,
one picket just flows into the next.

91
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,633
OK. Uh...
81 carom, 22 degrees.

92
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,713
Keep your ears open. Any Cylon contact,
just shut down, bug out.

93
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,791
Red squadron.

94
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,352
You'll be riding first CAP with me.
And from here on, double shifts.

95
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,910
Athena, l'm gonna need you
exclusively on shuttle runs.

96
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,595
Well, don't forget
to check under your back seat.

97
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,268
Hey. Hey. You got lucky, Starbuck.
If l were you, l would seriously consider...

98
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,351
Racetrack. l'm sorry.

99
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,273
Dismissed.

100
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,675
Dismissed.

101
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,275
Well, it's so comforting
to know that you're not afraid.

102
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,035
You're not afraid to represent
the most hated man alive.

103
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,839
The question is why?

104
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,036
For the fame, the glory.

105
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,554
You worked in
the public litigation office on Caprica.

106
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,509
You think you have the qualifications
to handle a case of this magnitude?

107
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,558
l was born for this.

108
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,235
That and the fact l have a pulse.

109
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,952
Lance belonged to my wife.

110
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,398
Don't worry.
He doesn't scratch or bite like she did.

111
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,511
If it's of any comfort, l despise him
as much as you do having to hire me.

112
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,239
So. There it is.

113
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,275
Shall we get started?

114
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,270
l'm gonna need you to handle
the security detail on the new attorney.

115
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,715
Me?

116
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,712
So that's it?
You're grounding me?

117
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,071
- You're the only one l can trust.
- Just say it. You're pulling me.

118
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,233
Keeping Lampkin alive
is an important job. l need your help.

119
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,039
Dad, l'm fine.

120
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,873
- No, you're not.
- Why?

121
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,838
Because l'm not.

122
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,117
Yeah? Well, then,
maybe you should take a rest.

123
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,634
Helo will be stepping in as CAG.

124
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,315
l want you on the ship,
not up there.

125
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,517
Not until you can...
work this out.

126
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,750
All right.

127
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,115
l understand.

128
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,156
Work it out.

129
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,151
OK.

130
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,670
l'll be handling security for you.
Where do you want your bags?

131
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,435
You'll have two marines
outside the door.

132
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,513
Ms Cassidy, the prosecuting attorney,
she's just down the hall.

133
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,751
Shower's that way.
Sorry, co-ed.

134
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,831
Now, if there's anything else...

135
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,070
l'd like to see my client.

136
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,116
Now?

137
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,509
- Pilot.
- Yeah.

138
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,114
King of the pilots.

139
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,352
We could stand around here and discuss
why you got stuck with me if you want.

140
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,991
- l'll take you to his cell.
- No. Half the ship's probably listening in.

141
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,196
Fine. We have an interrogation room.

142
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,158
Interrogation rooms
give me stage fright.

143
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,118
- l can't bring him here.
- l was thinking your quarters.

144
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,352
- What?
- Before it gets wired for sound.

145
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,749
What's the problem?
Forgot to make your bed?

146
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,469
Look, l don't care where you see him.
l just can't leave you alone.

147
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,791
Major.
It is Major, isn't it?

148
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,749
l have the right
to consult with my client in private,

149
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,435
without anybody eavesdropping
or looking in.

150
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,592
Whoever cares the most... wins.

151
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,274
Says so in there.

152
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,473
So?

153
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,348
l want to see my client.
You don't care. l win.

154
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,749
You know, you look like him.

155
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,755
You knew my grandfather?

156
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,594
Hated his guts.
He taught me everything l know.

157
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,713
<i>(beeps)</i>

158
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,318
- What are you doing here, anyway?
- You can speak freely.

159
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,755
He's signed confidentiality papers.

160
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,308
This whole charade's pathetic.

161
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,277
Pathetic.

162
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,832
Security? Security is already toasting
my other attorney's untimely demise.

163
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,835
About the only thing that bloke ever did
apart from napping was... manage to...

164
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,037
smuggle out my papers.

165
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,872
Papers!

166
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,554
Do you have any papers?

167
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,831
Thank you.

168
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,996
The nature...

169
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,958
of modern life...

170
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,952
is... obsession.

171
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,679
So, tell me...

172
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,355
do you honestly think
that l'm gonna get a fair trial?

173
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,192
- Doubtful.
- Yes.

174
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,717
But you haven't exactly
been helping yourself, now, have you?

175
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,509
- You object to my writing.
- On the contrary. Keep it coming.

176
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,957
This new manifesto of yours
shows great change in you.

177
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,229
This little, uh, operating manual of yours,
well... it keeps them all guessing.

178
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,875
OK. OK.

179
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,116
Caprica Six.
l'm worried about her. She's the key.

180
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,512
They can use her
to completely destroy me.

181
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,874
l need to get to her.
l need to know what she's thinking.

182
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,078
And you need to...
l mean, talk to her.

183
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,277
Tell her... uh...

184
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,189
Tell her l love her very much.
l'm thinking about her a lot.

185
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,748
l can sense that, yes.

186
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,400
You need to find out
where we're all standing.

187
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,669
"To listen requires a voice, for what
needs to be known requires us to ask."

188
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,599
<i>My Triumphs, My Mistakes</i>
by Gaius Baltar.

189
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,070
- But you say it very well.
- l've done my reading.

190
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,790
Once those papers arrive,
l suggest you do yours.

191
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,996
Fly me to <i>Colonial One.</i>

192
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,152
- Me?
- Yeah. You're a pilot, aren't you?

193
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,391
You can't just jump in a Raptor.
It has to be coordinated.

194
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,553
Where would you rather be, Major? Here?
As the parade float for the bereaved?

195
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:02,192
- What are you talking about?
- People look at you like you're bleeding.

196
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,431
You wanna to see some real blood?
Keep going.

197
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,637
Oh, there <i>is</i> someone home.

198
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,032
Look, l need those files. You come
with me, they might just give them to me.

199
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,319
l wait, they're gonna discover
that Baltar's pregnant before l get them.

200
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,316
What is your job, anyway? To keep me
alive? Or to keep me from doing mine?

201
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,998
Sorry, sir. You know your status. You're
to remain shipside. Admiral's orders.

202
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,071
The father factor.

203
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,915
Come on, Kelly.
Give me a break. l'm along for the ride.

204
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,391
Don't do this to me. All right?
l'm in enough dung already.

205
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,511
All right.

206
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,948
<i>(beeps)</i>

207
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,238
All right,
let's give the bird a tow.

208
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up!
Open the door!

209
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,758
What the frak was that thing?
Did you see that?

210
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,876
- What?
- l think it was a cat!

211
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,474
There's a cat in there!
Come out of there, Major!

212
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,111
- <i>(Kelly)</i> Who the hell let a cat in here?
- <i>(Chief)</i> On the other side. Push him here.

213
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,395
There it is.
It's over there.

214
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,031
There it is. There it is. Here it is.
Here, kitty, kitty. No, no, no. Come on.

215
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,238
- Come here, kitty. Come here.
- <i>(beeping)</i>

216
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,038
Bomb! Bomb!
Everybody out!

217
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,915
What the hell were you doing out there?
l gave you an order to do a job.

218
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,835
- Excuse me. l was doing my job.
- Yeah. Being led around by the nose?

219
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,718
This bastard yanks your chain
and you jump.

220
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,509
- He wanted files from <i>Colonial One.</i>
- It was the middle of the night.

221
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,478
- You assigned me to security.
- Yeah.

222
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,792
And there was a bomb on that ship
and you missed it.

223
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,231
Security.

224
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,148
l gave you explicit orders.

225
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,515
Athena was piloting.

226
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,154
You could have died.
Plain and simple.

227
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,037
You're a soldier.

228
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,157
Live like one.
Start acting like one.

229
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,516
She's been gone two weeks.
l didn't know the clock was running.

230
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,398
- Stop.
- Sorry. Maybe we're just built differently.

231
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,189
You stop.
Don't you dare quantify my loss.

232
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,158
You have no idea.
You have no frakking idea.

233
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,276
- You think yours is deeper?
- Wow.

234
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,555
Yours is greater?

235
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,029
In two weeks,
there's going to be a trial.

236
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,033
And l'm gonna do
what l was chosen to do, and so are you.

237
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,714
You build a frakking nest
around this man

238
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,678
and you protect his ass.

239
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,555
Frakker meant business this time.

240
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,030
If that had gone off, we'd be
picking up people parts with tweezers.

241
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,874
Every day l wave jocks out there.
A lot of them are my friends.

242
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,750
People l care for and love. It's hard
enough watching them die in battle.

243
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,230
But rickshawing Baltar's
frakking attorney around? Frak that.

244
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,791
l believe the Cylons want us to destroy
ourselves, and this is how they're doing it.

245
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,078
They're planting bombs,
making us suspicious of each other.

246
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,790
Know what? By the time the Cylons catch
up with us, they won't even have to attack.

247
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,317
They'll just clean up the mess we made.
I... l think they're here.

248
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,755
l think you're wrong.

249
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,150
l kissed Nicky this morning.
It could have been the last time.

250
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,038
- Cally. That's enough.
- What? l kissed you, too.

251
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,510
Some of us
don't get a second chance.

252
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,909
Or a third.

253
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,357
l'm going to the admiral.

254
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,877
Take a good look at this room.
Every time you leave, memorise it.

255
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,713
If anything changes,
don't touch it.

256
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,554
Uh... a book moves,
shoes in the wrong place,

257
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,279
something smells different,
you get the frak out.

258
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,989
Someone knocks, don't answer the door.
Don't open the door.

259
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,230
Look, you have to do what do l say.

260
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,959
If they wanna kill me,
they'll find a way.

261
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,953
Now, who do l have to bribe
to see the Cylon woman?

262
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,271
"The nature of modern life
is obsession."

263
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,070
l can't find my glasses.
It's like they've got feet.

264
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,393
The Six. Yes. OK.
Lampkin can interview Six immediately,

265
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,076
if it's conducted under the conditions
accorded to the chief prosecutor.

266
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,119
Meaning in the interrogation room,
not where you sleep.

267
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,318
Of course. But since you've been selected
to serve on the tribunal,

268
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,676
l'm assuming that you won't be present
at those interviews.

269
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,150
- The major has a point, Bill.
- The major is mistaken.

270
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,437
l monitored
the chief prosecutor's interview.

271
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,559
Therefore, the same conditions apply,
in the interests of fairness.

272
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,033
Mr Lampkin is entitled to the documents
he requested from <i>Colonial One.</i>

273
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,352
Yes. Right. l apologise.
We've had trouble locating the files.

274
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,000
We'll have them delivered to you
on the next run.

275
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,755
l'm sorry, Major. We'll get them to you
right away. Thank you.

276
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,831
Thank you.

277
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,439
<i>(Lampkin) l understand you had</i>
<i>a romantic relationship with my client.</i>

278
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,354
Gaius Baltar is a brilliant,
gifted human being.

279
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,195
In the time l've known him, he's made
a sport out of mendacity and deception.

280
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,718
He was narcissistic, self-centred, vain.
l'm the one who should have stabbed him.

281
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,394
- Things are looking up.
- <i>(Lampkin) Love.</i>

282
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,476
A precocious evolutionary move,
fashioning Cylons to experience it.

283
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,190
l don't know if it was engineered
as a tactical imperative, but...

284
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,113
- It's not for the faint-hearted, is it?
- No, it's not.

285
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,670
Maybe you should have been nicer
to your mechanic.

286
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:42,392
Well, perhaps Cylon love
is not the same as human love.

287
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,199
Perhaps it's designed
to hurt a little less.

288
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,273
- How would you know?
- l loved a woman.

289
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,079
Beautiful, beautiful woman.

290
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,913
But so serious.

291
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,913
This frowning face
trapped in the middle of a daisy.

292
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,594
She had a way of walking.

293
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,435
Processional, as if she were
on her way to her own execution.

294
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,080
We had ten years.

295
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,233
- Then it fell apart under its own weight.
- Is that what you wanted?

296
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,676
l thought if l could get over her,
l could get over anything.

297
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,356
l could endure,
conquer, be a man.

298
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,557
Stand up to any and all kind
of punishment.

299
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,349
l clung to an empty,
spinning bed for months.

300
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,749
And that...

301
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,515
that is when l finally realised
how much l loved her.

302
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:40,232
If l needed all that strength,
what was the point?

303
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,149
l needed to be with her.

304
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,632
Did he... ask about me?

305
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,119
Gaius?

306
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,520
He wanted to know
if you were well.

307
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,672
He wanted you to know
that he misses you,

308
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,955
loves you.

309
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,157
Because he can't be here to tell you,

310
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,834
he gave me this to give to you.

311
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,036
He uses that, at the risk of grave reprisal,
to express his feelings,

312
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,432
to put his world into
some kind of recognisable order.

313
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,556
To be heard.

314
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,190
<i>He's kept it hidden</i>
<i>because he knows he will not get another.</i>

315
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,990
He wants you to have it

316
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,358
because, without you,
it has no meaning.

317
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,319
He wants you to have it
because he would do anything -

318
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,551
<i>anything</i> -
to be with you again.

319
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,149
Well, that's a shame, isn't it?

320
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,874
Since they'll never let me keep it.

321
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,429
You understand that your days are owned
by these people, the ones watching us?

322
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,512
<i>l think you realise</i>
<i>what's likely to become of you.</i>

323
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,549
<i>l couldn't help you if they paid me</i>
<i>ten times what they offered me for Baltar.</i>

324
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,471
You won't get a trial,
not even a bad one.

325
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,357
So...

326
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,193
l have to ask you.

327
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,431
Does your love
hurt as much as mine?

328
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,237
Yes.

329
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,518
l feel like part of our world
just fell down.

330
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,834
- Hey, guys.
- Yes, sir.

331
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,270
Why encourage the man to write,
and then take his pen?

332
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,273
He'll curry more sympathy when we
get the word out that he's been silenced.

333
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,716
Tyranny.
Gag orders. Very sexy.

334
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,551
OK. All right.

335
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,950
So you steal his pen,
then you lie to him, then you lie to the Six.

336
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,350
The horror of the age.
The great, ugly material.

337
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,670
The cloak of deceit.

338
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,751
The truth.

339
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,634
Kind of overrated, l guess.

340
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,196
You know,
when l was nine, maybe ten,

341
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,475
my grandfather...

342
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,275
he would wave me over.

343
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,353
And he'd do this all the time.
And then he'd say:

344
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,837
"Lee, be a good boy."

345
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,994
"Just don't be too good."

346
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,235
Everybody has demons.

347
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,074
Them, Baltar, you, me.

348
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,549
Even the machines.

349
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,838
The law is just a way of exorcising them.

350
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,515
That's what your father's father taught me.

351
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,276
Wanna know why l hated him?
Because he was right.

352
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,148
You hated him because he was right.
l hated the law because it was wrong.

353
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,437
Because of what...
of what it put him through.

354
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,478
l mean, he defended
the worst of the worst.

355
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,790
l remember reading about him.

356
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,350
The outrage -
helping murderers go free.

357
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,356
What l don't understand is
why he put himself through all that abuse.

358
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,318
You think he gave a flying frak?

359
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,520
Joe Adama cared about one thing -

360
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,276
understanding
why people do what they do.

361
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,955
Why we cheat our friends.
Why we reward our enemies.

362
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:29,068
Why we go to war,
sacrificing our lives for lost causes.

363
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,314
Why we build machines in the hope of
correcting our flaws and shortcomings.

364
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,675
Why we forgive -

365
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,514
defying logic
and the laws of nature

366
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,196
with one stupid little act of compassion.

367
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,352
We're flawed.
All of us.

368
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,630
l wanted to know why.

369
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,632
So l did what he did.

370
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,158
l spend my life with the fallen,

371
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,471
the corrupt, the damaged.

372
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,440
You were ready to get on that Raptor
with me, be the bad boy, the prodigal son.

373
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,799
- l was just doing my job. Protecting you.
- What are you doing in my business?

374
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,509
Suddenly l'm handcuffed
to a serial contrarian.

375
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,036
No, l am not...

376
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,758
OK.

377
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,195
My bed is made.

378
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,352
l suggest you toil on your own.

379
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,671
Now, if this cross-examination is over,

380
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,228
l'd like to take a crap.

381
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,553
Romo, that story you told about the girl -
the woman - that you loved,

382
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,154
and getting over her, is it true?

383
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,470
Hey! Was it true?

384
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,070
Yes.

385
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,674
For him.
Files from <i>Colonial One.</i>

386
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,638
Finally. l thought l'd get all these
after the trial.

387
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,757
Hold it.
Put that on the floor, now.

388
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,834
Oh, for frak's sake. l was there
when Kelly X-rayed 'em. It's papers.

389
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,115
There you go.

390
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,031
Good?

391
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,473
Yeah.

392
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,077
No!

393
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,235
<i>(guard)</i> You have five minutes, Major.

394
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,997
Thank you.

395
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,039
Before the hounds got to it.
Open it.

396
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:21,400
The president's glasses.
She looks better without them.

397
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,316
Less serious.

398
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,029
Serious catches on
in the courtroom.

399
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,911
Your father's.

400
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,796
When?

401
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,193
From the deck. Right after you found
the bomb underneath the Raptor.

402
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,953
Here, kitty, kitty.

403
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,837
Ow.

404
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,992
- It was hanging by a thread.
- They tarnish so fast.

405
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,110
It was like that when l plucked it.
Everybody else - Tigh, the others, you -

406
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,269
all shiny.

407
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,830
The soldier in him
has had enough for a while.

408
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,197
He'll be glad to sit in that courtroom
and fire his missiles there.

409
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,829
Ms Prosecuting Attorney
down the hall.

410
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:24,675
It's not what you think. It was appropriated
with the noblest of intentions.

411
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,910
See, the soles...

412
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,719
See how the soles are worn.

413
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,791
She drags her feet.

414
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,440
You're catching on.

415
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,478
And the rest?
What's all this?

416
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,228
My demons.
l borrow things.

417
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,115
My parents disappeared
when l was nine years old.

418
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,430
They were kidnapped.

419
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,595
Murdered for... for the money
they had on them, which wasn't enough.

420
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,710
l went to live with an uncle.
Stole from him until l could run away.

421
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,360
So what did you take from me?

422
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,956
Hm. l was thinking,
the photograph that you carry.

423
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,919
Of the girl. The pilot.
The one you carry on you.

424
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,117
But... you've had enough
stolen from you already.

425
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,438
l'll try and get these back to her...
somehow.

426
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,795
The other pocket.
At the back.

427
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,912
The guards took it from her.
l borrowed it from them.

428
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,998
l still have a case...

429
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,071
pending.

430
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,637
If you want to help -

431
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,032
if you dare to help -
get this to my client.

432
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,032
- A case?
- l have a calling.

433
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,953
Yeah. So the ringing in my ears tells me.

434
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,273
OK. You better explain this.

435
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,512
- Don't even know what it is.
- Well, l do. Where did you get it?

436
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,275
The one who scolded you
like a schoolboy.

437
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,148
Frakking with your head.
Whatshisname, Mr Serious...

438
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,559
Uh...

439
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,631
Kelly.

440
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,149
- Kel... Kelly?
- Yeah.

441
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,515
l never would have let Athena go airborne
with you in the Raptor.

442
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,434
- l would have stopped it. You know that.
- Yeah, l know that.

443
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,193
You better lock me up.

444
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,352
And l don't want any trial.
l won't stop.

445
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,590
l will keep trying.

446
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,875
l'll keep at it. l will.

447
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,793
l did my job, sir.

448
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,872
And l have done my job
for two years now.

449
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,516
Every day,
l sent people out to fight.

450
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,795
l cleared them all to die.

451
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,999
So many people.

452
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,038
l just got tired of living with that.

453
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,192
If you asked that man
if he had to choose...

454
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,353
between giving his life up
for a Cylon or a human,

455
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,557
what do you think he would say?

456
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,870
l had to do something.

457
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,791
XO.

458
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,351
Reinstate Major Adama
as commander of the air group.

459
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,874
Effective immediately.

460
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,989
- It's good to have you back.
- Thank you.

461
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,359
l'm sorry. l guess l was wrong.
l made it worse.

462
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,670
- No.
- No, you should be in your bird.

463
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,718
l think l should be with Lampkin.

464
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,396
Well, now that we know that it was Kelly,
we can ease up a little bit on security.

465
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,678
In his condition, Lampkin needs help
preparing the trial, presenting his case.

466
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,991
The president has a few possibilities.
She's looking.

467
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,150
Dad, why not me?

468
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,111
l'm close to the case.
l've read the documents.

469
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,716
- l understand Lampkin's strategy.
- We have things under control.

470
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,394
Lampkin will have help.

471
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,074
- l wanna do this.
- You're a CAG.

472
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,550
You're not a lawyer.
Far from it.

473
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,551
And you're a judge?

474
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:51,556
No. But like the four other men picked,
l'm capable of listening to the evidence

475
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,029
and making an ethical decision.

476
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,588
And l'm capable of helping Lampkin.

477
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,797
Forget it.
l need you as CAG.

478
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,876
Why did you give me those books? Huh?

479
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,350
- You gave me your father's law books.
- l made a mistake.

480
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,718
- Why? Are you afraid that l'll be like him?
- You're a pilot.

481
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,349
With Zak gone and Kara gone,
you need someone to carry the flag?

482
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,956
You're a pilot and you're my son.
l will not look across that court

483
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,838
and see you sitting on the other side.

484
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,673
See me?
Or see someone else?

485
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,115
Report for duty.

486
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,668
Is that an order?

487
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,196
You're in way over your head.
Report for duty.

488
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,714
Is that an order?

489
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,158
l'm through giving you orders.

490
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,391
Remove Apollo from the board.
Inform Helo he's to remain at CAG.

491
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,075
My son has more important things
to tend to.

492
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,033
Hey, how's the leg?

493
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,588
You mean my lucky break?

494
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,798
It gave me a reason
not to come up here.

495
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,790
Sooner or later,
you run out of excuses.

496
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,990
<i>(Apollo)</i> It's hard to let her go.

497
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,117
Lee.

498
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,636
l'll see you around.

499
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,871
<i>(Lampkin) "There is no greater ally,</i>

500
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,316
<i>no force more powerful,</i>
