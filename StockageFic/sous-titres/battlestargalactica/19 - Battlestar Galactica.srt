1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
The Cylons Were
Created by Man

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,900
They Evolved

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,400
They Rebelled

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,400
There Are Many Copies

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,800
And They Have A Plan

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,800
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica...

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,900
The raiders are going to send a
signal to activate the virus.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,300
On my mark,

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,500
initiate the computer wipe.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,500
I'm connecting through the network now

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Congratulations, commander

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,500
I'm leaving Galactica...

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,500
not you.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,800
I'm coming back.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
I said it,...

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,000
I meant it. 

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,900
I understand what is like...

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,500
to lose someone that 
you care about deeply

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,600
They're not lost,...

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,200
not yet. 

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,300
We have to go back to Caprica. 

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,200
Given the current situation,...

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,900
I'm afraid that I have no alternative...

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,600
but to announce
that I am, as of now,...

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,600
a candidate for the presidency.

26
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,500
I'm going to lose.

27
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,800
Yes, come in, please.

28
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
One minute, Madam President.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you, Tory.

30
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,000
No one should be under any illusions
about what we're going to face here.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,700
Our final jump will take us
intra-atmospher...

32
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,700
less than two klicks
above the surface. 

33
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,400
We're also expecting
to take heavy fire.

34
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Simulations indicate losses
of up to 20% can be expected.

35
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,000
That's why this mission
has been designated...

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,700
as 2-alpha by the command authority. 

37
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,700
It's volunteer only.

38
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,200
You want out,...

39
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,800
now's the time.

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,100
I know it's hard to believe
right now, but if you have faith,...

41
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,100
everything will
turn out exactly as it should.

42
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,500
I don't like to lose.

43
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,700
Have faith.

44
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,600
I am about to face
public humiliation.

45
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,400
And you are singing
the same old song.

46
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I'm a little tired of the melody.

47
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Sorry about the mess. It's, um...

48
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,600
bit of a ritual...superstition, really.

49
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,800
I used to do this before
testifying at committee hearings.

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,900
This is what I do.
I take one,...

51
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,100
memorize a talking
point, then...

52
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,500
tear the card,...

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,900
and let the pieces fall
as they may. It helps.

54
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,200
Yeah, my father used to break
pencils before he went into court,...

55
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,500
then borrow one from the clerk.

56
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,800
Break preconceptions,
work with what you have.

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,600
You know, I like that.

58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Let me see.
I like it.

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,400
It's good.

60
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,100
Feel better?

61
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,300
Yeah. 

62
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,700
But what happens if the, uh,...

63
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,000
moderator doesn't
have a pencil?

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Then you're pretty screwed.

65
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,200
Oh, no.

66
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,500
I used to...

67
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,500
get the giggles before
debating in high school. 

68
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Oh, yes.

69
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,900
It's time, Madam President.

70
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Thank you, Tory.

71
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,300
What many of you don't know is
that the captured cylon heavy raider

72
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,800
is capable of much longer
jumps than our raptors.

73
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,900
In fact, we realized early on...

74
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,200
that if we could install a
heavy raider navigational system...

75
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,500
aboard one of our raptors,...

76
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,800
a strike team could make the
entire trip back to Caprica...

77
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,500
in less than ten jumps.

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,200
Now, the limiting factor up until
now has been our inability...

79
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,200
in install the cylon computer
with our computer.

80
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,800
That obstacle has
now been overcome.

81
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,000
She's here to help us.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,900
She's gonna lay out
our navigational markers...

83
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,900
and update our jump coordinates. Does
anyone have a problem with that?

84
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,500
You've been chosen to
lead these people...

85
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,500
by almighty god.

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It will happen.

87
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,600
Like the baby happened?

88
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,800
The one I was
destined to protect?

89
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Don't let your anger drive
you into blasphemy, Gaius.

90
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,900
The election's still
two weeks away.

91
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,900
Get your act together.

92
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,000
You ready?

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,400
Yeah, I was just
taking a little nap.

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Chief.

95
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,300
This is our mission. 

96
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,600
It's our duty to the
people we left behind.

97
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,600
And if we need to use a cylon to
get them back, then so be it.

98
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,500
This is about trying to get as many
survivors off Caprica as we can.

99
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,200
Even so, it's still 2-alpha.

100
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Anyone want to eject?

101
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,900
Commander on deck.

102
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,900
Don't worry.
I won't be long.

103
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,300
I want to hear it too.

104
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,700
You just have to really try to think
about something serious.

105
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,400
That always helps. 

106
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
- Right?
- Like what?

107
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Well, like, uh...

108
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,600
Great.

109
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400
No one has ever attempted...

110
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,700
a rescue mission
from this distance,...

111
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,500
much less behind enemy lines.

112
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,800
You'll be making history
just by making the attempt.

113
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,800
But bring these people
back from Caprica...

114
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,100
and you'll be making
part of the future. 

115
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,000
Questions.

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,700
If you guys find Earth
before we get back,...

117
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,400
will you save us a few seats?

118
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,000
Earth? Hell, if we find any rock
with food and water,...

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,900
I'll build you guys a bar. 

120
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,300
All right.

121
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,700
See, I told you
I wouldn't be long.

122
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,500
Mr. Gaeta, turn on the wireless.

123
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,300
Let's give these people a
chance to hear what kind of fun...

124
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,800
they'll be missing
for the next five days.

125
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,100
We are just minutes
from the start of the first...

126
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,000
presidential debate
between President...

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,900
- You okay?
- Laura Roslin and her oppenent...

128
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,400
Vice President Gaius Baltar...

129
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,300
Can I go now?

130
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,000
Coporal Masters

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,500
submitted by members of
the civilian fleet...

132
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,400
covering a wide range of topics.

133
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,600
So please stay tuned as we
get set for the first of two...

134
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,900
presidential debates.

135
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,800
The atmosphere in the
auditorium is tense...

136
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,000
as we await the arival of the
two candidates and their aides.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,600
The real pressure will be on
vice-president Baltar tonight.

138
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Chief.

139
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,700
Here comes Vice President...

140
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,000
Gaius Baltar into the room,...

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
uh, as we, uh, we
await Madam President.

142
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,700
Laura Roslin is very much
ahead in the polls at this point.

143
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,500
We believe that, uh...

144
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,200
she's entering the room shortly,...

145
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,200
but still...still,
of course, waiting for her.

146
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,300
blindsighted her by announcing
his candidacy a month ago. 

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,600
Dr. Baltar of course is
one of the most admired...

148
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
and brilliant scientistific
minds of our generation...

149
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,800
and played a critical
role in saving the human race...

150
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,000
from the cylon threat. 

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,800
Yes, here comes
the President now.

152
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Laura Roslin, the President,
has entered the room.

153
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,400
I'm going to wipe the floor
with you, Gaius.

154
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,800
You must be losing
your mind again.

155
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,300
If that's the best you
can come up with,...

156
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,800
you're in a lot of trouble.
Good luck.

157
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
How you doing?
You okay? 

158
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Sharon.

159
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't shut me out. 

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Not now.

161
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,900
Something dark
is coming, Helo.

162
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,000
I can feel it.

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,600
I can feel it
lurking out there,...

164
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,600
waiting.

165
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,400
What do you mean?

166
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,600
Back on Caprica?

167
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,800
No. 

168
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,600
Not on the mission.

169
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Not any specific thing.

170
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,900
It's more like a dark time.

171
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,000
Chief. 

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Chief...

173
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Help!

174
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,100
49.579 survivors

175
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,400
in search of a home

176
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Called Earth

177
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,300
Chief Tyrol,...

178
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,700
I am Brother Cavill.

179
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,700
I understand you've
asked for religious counseling.

180
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,000
I never really believed
in psych therapy. 

181
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,600
My father was a priest.

182
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,200
I see.

183
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,600
You thought you'd have an easier
time with a priest than a real doctor.

184
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,100
Okay. 

185
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,300
I pray to gods...

186
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,800
every night.

187
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,900
But I don't think
they listen to me.

188
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,900
Do you know how
useless prayer is?

189
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,400
Chanting and singing and...

190
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,400
mucking about with old
half-remembered lines of bad poetry.

191
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,800
And you know
what it gets you?

192
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Exactly nothing.

193
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,100
Are you sure you're a priest?

194
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,100
I've been preaching longer than
you've been sucking down oxygen.

195
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,200
And in that time, I've learned
enough to know that the gods...

196
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
don't answer prayers. 

197
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,700
We're here on our own.

198
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,800
That's the way they set things up.

199
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,800
We have to find our own answers,
our own way out of the wilderness...

200
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,400
without a nice
little sunny path...

201
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
all laid out in front
of us in advance.

202
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,900
That's what I'm trying to do.

203
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm trying to find my way.

204
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,800
Well, it's not going to get better
until you see what the problem is.

205
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,900
And the problem is,...

206
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,800
you're screwed up,...

207
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,500
heart and mind.

208
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,700
You. Not the...not the gods or
fate or the universe. 

209
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,300
You.

210
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Thanks for the pep talk.

211
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,300
- Hey.
- Hey.

212
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Um... 

213
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,300
I just wanted to say, um... 

214
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,200
well...

215
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,500
good hunting.

216
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,700
Thank you, sir.

217
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, it's a good plan.

218
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,700
It's a good plan.

219
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,000
Sharon should be able to jump you...

220
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
into the atmosphere a couple of...

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,200
klicks above the surface.

222
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,000
Down below the...

223
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
cylon dradis. I know the
plan, Lee. I wrote it.

224
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,000
I-I gotta go.

225
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,200
I hope you find him, Kara. 

226
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,200
I really do.

227
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,300
So do I.

228
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
From the Colonial Dispatch.

229
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,000
"Last night's debate only
solidified the perception..."

230
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
- I'll do that later.
- "That doctor baltar, for all his charm,..."

231
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,800
"is essentially an empty suit..."

232
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,400
"when it comes to matters of
substantial policy."

233
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,900
It's nice to see the press is
getting it right for a change.

234
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,800
Don't forget, the radical religious
charge is dangerous.

235
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,900
It may be a low blow
from a desperate man, but...

236
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,200
it's the only issue he's
managed to get any traction on.

237
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,800
He will keep exploiting it.

238
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,200
He's gotta come up with something
much, much bigger than that.

239
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,500
If he wants to make it the central
issue of his campaign,...

240
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,500
it's not going to work.

241
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,900
You gotta keep hitting her on
the religious thing.

242
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,200
Every time we go there,...

243
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,500
you score points and we
move the polls in our direction.

244
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,400
I'm not sure if
you're aware, Tom,...

245
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,200
but the mob isn't usually in
the habit of electing...

246
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,600
ungodly apostates who
denigrate people of faith.

247
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,200
Things are going to turn around.
You'll see.

248
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,200
He's right.
Listen to him.

249
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,100
Of course. 

250
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,600
Of course, how blind i'm being.
Thank you. Yes.

251
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Things are going to turn around,
you'll see. What is that, advice?

252
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,500
Well, thank you.
Thank for your keen insight,...

253
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,400
your astounding political acumen.

254
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,500
You know, I'm so
assured right now, Tom,...

255
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,200
I'm just going to sit right back
and wait for the hand of god...

256
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,700
to reach down and change
my political fortunes. 

257
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,700
How about that?

258
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,400
Galactica, Starbuck. 

259
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,200
SAR squadron
confirms readiness check.

260
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,200
And we are spun up out here and
ready for the first jump.

261
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,000
You are go for the jump, Starbuck.

262
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,600
Roger that.

263
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Jump in ten minutes. Mark.

264
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,500
Galactica,
I'd like to speak with actual.

265
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Sir.

266
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,200
Actual. Go.

267
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,400
Did I ever say "thank you"?

268
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,600
No. 

269
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Then again, that would be
a first, wouldn't it?

270
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,200
Thank you.

271
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Just come back
in one piece.

272
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
That'll be thank you enough.

273
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,400
Good hunting. 

274
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Actual out.

275
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,400
SAR team, Starbuck. Set navcon
inputs to coordinate recheck.

276
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,800
Standby for bounce
back and stabilization routines.

277
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Let's do a final check, people.

278
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,000
I still can't believe you
talked me into this.

279
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,900
It's important.

280
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,600
And I'll be with
you there and back.

281
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,900
It's you and me from
now on, no matter what. 

282
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,200
Just like we agreed.

283
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,100
I know. I know.

284
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,100
I really appreciate it,
Helo, I really do.

285
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,200
I just can't get her
out of my head.

286
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Our little girl.

287
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Is there a problem?

288
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,700
Racetrack, check.

289
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,200
Callon Chedk.

290
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,700
Wireless check complete.

291
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Board is green and we are set.

292
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,700
Sharon, you're on.

293
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,500
Ready.

294
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,700
SAR team, Starbuck.

295
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,400
Standby to jump on my mark.
Five...

296
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,200
Here we go.

297
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,200
Four, three, two, one.

298
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Commence the first jump.

299
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,600
This doesn't look right.

300
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,800
No other contacts on dradis.

301
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,700
What?

302
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Oh, man. We're at the wrong
jump coordinates.

303
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,300
Frak. 

304
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,700
Helo, we've lost
someone already. 

305
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,100
It's Racetrack.

306
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,700
So do we go back?

307
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,200
Mission rules say we keep going
unless we lose three.

308
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,000
So we keep going.

309
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,500
Racetrack will just
have to find her way back to base.

310
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,400
It's a hell of a way to start, though.

311
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,400
Let's, uh, let's talk
about what happened.

312
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,000
I can't really believe it. 

313
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,100
Cally.

314
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,100
I-I-I don't understand how I
could do that to Cally.

315
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,400
It's like it's a nightmare.

316
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,400
She said you were asleep
when she found you.

317
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Were you having a nightmare
when she woke you up?

318
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,600
I don't remember.

319
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,900
Oh. 

320
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,900
Been having any recurring
dreams lately?

321
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,700
No.

322
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,100
Okay. 

323
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,100
That's what we in the pray
trade call a lie.

324
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,700
And lies aren't going to
get you anywhere, my friend.

325
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,900
So skip over the
denials and the deceptions...

326
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,800
and let's get right
down to it, shall we?

327
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,800
You're having dreams.

328
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,800
What are they? 

329
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Tell me about
your dream, Chief.

330
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,900
Every night...every night,
it's the same.

331
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,000
For how long?

332
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,600
Couple weeks.

333
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,600
And you were having the same dream
when Cally woke you up, weren't you?

334
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,100
I don't know.

335
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,400
I don't remember. Maybe.

336
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,800
It doesn't matter, does it?

337
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,800
All I remember is Cally on
the ground and the blood.

338
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,000
She stopped you. 

339
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,400
By waking you up,

340
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,400
she prevented you from carrying out
your secret desire to kill yourself.

341
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,000
I don't have a secret
desire to kill myself.

342
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,500
Well, actually, you're right.
It's not a secret.

343
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,500
You obviously want to kill yourself.
Question is why.

344
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,400
I think there was some kind of
glitch in the navcon firmware.

345
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,100
Hey bottom line, we're to hell and gone...

346
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,100
from where we're
supposed to be, skipper.

347
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Okay, um, any chance that we
can still catch up with them?

348
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,800
Not a chance.

349
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,500
Mission rules say we head back.

350
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,400
Frak me! It was the first jump!

351
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Hey, look, you gave me
these coordinates.

352
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,200
Back to the barn.

353
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Hey. 

354
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,400
I am picking up a large
planetary body. 

355
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,400
It's frakkin' close.

356
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,200
Where'd that come from?

357
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,800
Hell if I know.

358
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,900
So much dradis interference here,
it didn't even register.

359
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,900
Hey, check this out.

360
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,700
Atmosphere is nitrogen/oxygen.

361
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,500
Organic molecular spectra.

362
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Fresh water? 

363
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,200
Hey, you know what this is?

364
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,200
It's habitable.

365
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,700
We may have just found a world
that can support human life.

366
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Maybe we're not just a bunch
of frak-ups after all.

367
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Climate readings overall are within
human norms.

368
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,300
There's some extremes at the
poles that we couldn't withstand...

369
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,300
but that's not unusual.

370
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,900
Well done.

371
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,700
Thank you, sir.

372
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,400
We got a mottled area here at
the river mouth.

373
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,600
So it's probably a delta.

374
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,400
And the chances are, we've got
significant plant and animal life.

375
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,400
So I want a lot of nice,
low passes across here.

376
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,900
Heard the Pegasus survey
mission found wildlife.

377
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,300
Fruit trees. 

378
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,100
Rivers of milk and honey.

379
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,300
Yeah. You forgot the lakes of ambrosia.

380
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,400
Most of the planet's
actually pretty barren.

381
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,100
Plant and animal
life located in a...

382
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,000
temperate belt around the equator.

383
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,200
But the best part is...

384
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,300
with all the dradis
interference from the nebula...

385
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,300
the cylons will
probably never find it.

386
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Who cares about
this stupid planet anyway? 

387
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,300
Song and dance over nothing.

388
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,300
Less than 20% of that place actually
supports human life so...

389
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,900
You're not seeing the big picture.

390
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,700
This is your new home.

391
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,500
The place where you will
lead a new life.

392
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,400
This is the future, Gaius.

393
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Now there's a
difference in thought.

394
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,000
What's that?

395
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,700
Oh, nothing, Tom. 

396
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,200
Just, uh...

397
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,200
can you imagine if we actually had
to live on that thing.

398
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,900
You...

399
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,500
are a genius.

400
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,800
And?

401
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,700
Pay attention.

402
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,100
You're about to win the election.

403
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm sorry.
What were you saying, Tom?

404
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,800
We needed an issue. 

405
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Something to set us
apart from Roslin.

406
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,300
Something to put her clearly on
the wrong side of a major issue...

407
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,000
that people care
passionately about.

408
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
This is it.

409
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Permanent settlement on this planet.

410
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Permanent settlement here.

411
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,200
Have you lost your marbles?

412
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,300
It may look dreary,
it may be dreary,...

413
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,300
but it's solid ground under your
feet and a real sky over your head.

414
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,300
You'd be surprised what a
powerful idea that is to...

415
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,000
people cooped up in metal
boxes for nine months.

416
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,300
You should listen to him, Gaius.

417
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,300
He's a smart, sexy
man, just like you.

418
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,100
Oh, give up.

419
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,500
What?

420
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,500
Give up on Earth.

421
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,200
Yes.

422
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,200
So we'd settle here.

423
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Yes.

424
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,500
You know, it's starting to look like a
lovely little planet after all.

425
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
This is a rest stop. 

426
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,700
A place to load up
on food and water.

427
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,600
We're not settling
here, obviously.

428
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,000
You've heard the
captain's reports.

429
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Every ship in the fleet has
people begging, pleading,...

430
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,300
demanding they get time
down on the surface.

431
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,300
Even if it's only for a few hours.

432
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,400
Well, a few hours is one thing.

433
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,800
But permanent settlement's
quite another.

434
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,000
Suddenly Baltar's holding out
hope for breathing real air,...

435
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,400
growing real food, sleeping in
a bed instead of a bunk.

436
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,700
Living in a house
instead of a ship.

437
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,100
It's a fantasy.

438
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,600
Look at the mission reports.

439
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,800
All the data indicate that
life on this planet would be hard.

440
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,800
It would be a struggle to even eke a
living out for a few years.

441
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,100
Today's polls show that he's...

442
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,400
also making headway
with the idea that...

443
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,400
because the planet is
hidden in a nebula,...

444
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,200
it will provide a refuge
from the cylons.

445
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,300
What, are we
now assuming that...

446
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,900
cylon technology is not sufficient
enough to find this planet?

447
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,300
We just found it.

448
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,000
Madam President, in my opinion,
people vote their hopes,...

449
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,100
not their fears.

450
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,000
Baltar is offering them what
they want to hear,...

451
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,300
and you're offering
them a bitter reality.

452
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,300
I'm offering them the truth.

453
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,300
They don't want to hear the truth.
They're tried, exhausted.

454
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,500
The idea of stopping,...

455
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,300
laying down their burdens,...

456
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,400
and starting a new
life right now...

457
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,200
is what is resonating
with the voters.

458
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,400
How well is it resonating?

459
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,400
It could turn the entire
election around.

460
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,400
Why are you running?

461
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm not.

462
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,100
How long are you
going to do this?

463
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,000
How long are you going to
refuse to see what's...

464
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
right in front of your face?

465
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,600
Forget it.
I'm done.

466
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,800
What, you're... you're leaving?

467
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,400
That's right. I'm done.

468
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,600
I'm done dancing
around the truth with you.

469
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,500
You know what's going on.

470
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,600
But you can't or
you won't face it,...

471
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,500
so...

472
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,700
I'm not a therapist. 

473
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,100
I'm not going to hold your
hand and help you along.

474
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,600
I'm just trying to get you right
with yourself and with your gods,...

475
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,500
but you're not willing to do it.

476
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

477
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,900
Oh for gods' sake, chief!
Come on!

478
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,900
You think you're a Cylon.

479
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,400
I am not a Cylon.

480
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,900
Well, of course you're not.

481
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,500
But that's what you're
afraid of, isn't it?

482
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,100
That you might be a cylon
and not even know it just...

483
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,900
just like Boomer, right?

484
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,300
Right?

485
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,200
That's the thought
that's torturing your dreams...

486
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,800
and crippling your soul.

487
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,000
I'm a cylon,...

488
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
just like Sharon,
and I deserve to die.

489
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,800
Sharon didn't know...

490
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,800
what she was.

491
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
She just kept...

492
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,900
thinking... feeling...

493
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,500
that she was going to
do this terrible thing.

494
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,500
But she knew that she had to
stop herself before she did.

495
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,700
And you think that's what you're
going to do. Some terrible thing.

496
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,800
Well, the truth is, you might.

497
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,300
But not because you're a Cylon.

498
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,500
Because you're a human being,...

499
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,000
and human beings do terrible
things all the time.

500
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,800
But how do you
know I'm human?

501
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,600
Oh, well, maybe because
I'm a Cylon,...

502
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,600
and I've never seen you at
any of the meetings.

503
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,200
There's not much more
I can do for you.

504
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
You're going to have
to go back to work...

505
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,200
and try and leave all
of this behind you.

506
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,600
No. I...

507
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,000
I can't. 

508
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I can't go back and face
the deck people again.

509
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,300
And Cally?

510
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,800
Well, you'd better.

511
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,600
That's the only family you've got.

512
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,200
Just know that that's your
family and that they love you.

513
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,600
Even Cally.

514
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,700
Especially Cally.

515
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,000
If you doubt your humanity...

516
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,600
and your essential nature
as a human being,...

517
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,300
all you need to do
is look to them...

518
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,700
for the salvation you've been
seeking from the gods.

519
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,200
The gods lift up those...

520
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,200
who lift each other, Chief.

521
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,600
SAR team, Starbuck.
We are set here.

522
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,400
Stand by for final jump to Caprica.

523
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,200
Remember, we are going
very low to the surface.

524
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,200
Be prepared for wind shear,
rain, storms...

525
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,900
anything.

526
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,000
Roger that, Starbuck.

527
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,300
Ready.

528
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,000
Ready. 

529
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,500
Here we go.

530
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Jump.

531
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,900
SAR team, Starbuck.
Form up on me.

532
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,400
Roger that skipper.

533
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,800
Any cylons, Helo?

534
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,400
Nothing on dradis. 

535
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,100
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

536
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,400
Missing a raptor.
I'm only reading 17 out there.

537
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,400
We're missing raptor 6-12.

538
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,000
That's toughguy and carousel.

539
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
What, they jumped to
the wrong coordinates?

540
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,500
No.

541
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,500
No, no. I'm picking up their
transponder, so they made it.

542
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,000
Bearing 827, carom 443.

543
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,400
About half a klick from here.

544
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,400
That would put them...

545
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,700
oh, my gods.

546
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,700
Where, Helo?
Talk to me.

547
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
They jumped
inside the mountain.

548
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,900
Damn. 

549
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,800
SAR team, Starbuck.

550
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,500
We've lost raptor 6-12.

551
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,500
We are proceeding without them.

552
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
Follow me.

553
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Roger that Starbuck.

554
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,000
I would think that my position...

555
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,600
and the position of my
campaign is abundantly clear.

556
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,100
Madam President,
you have 30 seconds to respond.

557
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,700
Well, my initial response is
there he goes again.

558
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,700
Once again, ladies and gentlemen,...

559
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,700
Doctor Baltar is distorting
the real issues before us.

560
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,200
The issue here,
the real question, is...

561
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,900
not allowing the scriptures to
dictate the policy of this government.

562
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,100
The question is...

563
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,100
do the scriptures
contain real world relevance?

564
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,900
Do they contain the
information necessary...

565
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,800
to guide us to a safer home than
some completely unknown planet...

566
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
that we've just now discovered?

567
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,200
Obviously, my answer to that
question is yes.

568
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,900
I have always and will
continue to feel...

569
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,500
the scriptures hold
real world relevance.

570
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,400
Mr. Vice President,
the next question is for you.

571
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,900
Uh, how do you
respond to the charges...

572
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,000
that you seized the idea of...

573
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,400
permanent settlement
on this planet...

574
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,600
as an opportunistic
gamble, um,...

575
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,900
some would say as...

576
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,500
to be construed as a desperate
move from a campaign,...

577
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
uh, that was falling
behind on every poll?

578
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,800
Well, you know that is, um,...

579
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,600
that is an excellent question,
in fact, Jim. Thank you. 

580
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,000
And I'm only too glad to
have the opportunity to respond to it.

581
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,500
You see, I have long been a
proponent in the search for Earth.

582
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,100
The promise of perhaps
finding not only a new home,...

583
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,400
but also the prospect of
discovering our long lost...

584
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,200
brothers and sisters of the 13th
colony is a powerful one...

585
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,700
and one I have believed
in heart and soul.

586
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,000
But the trouble is,...

587
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,700
the cylons continue
to follow us...

588
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,600
as they have done
every step of the way...

589
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,700
since the destruction
of the colonies.

590
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,500
And if we have a chance
to change this dynamic,...

591
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,800
to stop this deadly chase,...

592
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,400
should we take it?

593
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,200
My answer is yes.

594
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,000
Thank you.
Madam President, 30 seconds.

595
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
There's no assurance...

596
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,800
none whatsoever...

597
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,500
that the cylons don't already
know about this planet,...

598
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,900
that they don't make regular
stops here looking for us,...

599
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,000
and that in fact...

600
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,900
they aren't simply waiting for
us to settle on the surface...

601
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,700
- so they can...
- I have to respond to that.

602
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,300
I simply have to
respond to that.

603
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,200
I'll give you 15 seconds.

604
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,700
What you've seen right now,
ladies and gentlemen,...

605
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,500
is another example of
the President using fear...

606
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,100
to drive her campaign.

607
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,300
Fear. 

608
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,400
Fear of the gods. 

609
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,300
Fear of the cylon.
Fear of fear itself.

610
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,600
Is it not time to
stop being afraid?

611
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,500
I'm asking all of us...

612
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,400
to stop running
from our lives...

613
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,300
and start living them.

614
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,500
Thank you.

615
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,900
Thank you.
That is all we have time for today.

616
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,000
I'd like to thank, uh,...

617
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,100
both the candidates for
their frankness today.

618
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,400
Very exciting debate.

619
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,000
This concludes the cycle of
the debates for the presidency.

620
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The polls will be
open in three days.

621
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,900
Please vote. 

622
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,900
Thank you and good night.

623
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,200
Not your night, I guess.

624
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,200
Why don't you go frak yourself.

625
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,100
With me now is campaign
manager for Doctor Baltar,...

626
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,700
Mr. Tom Zarek.

627
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,100
Tom, welcome. Uh,
you were in there with us today.

628
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,200
What was your impression?

629
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,800
Well, I...

630
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,600
thought Doctor
Baltar did exceptionally well.

631
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,400
Laid out his vision of the future...

632
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,700
and offered the people a way
to end the suffering and terror...

633
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,400
that defines so many
of their lives.

634
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,100
On the other hand,
I found myself wondering how...

635
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:52,000
Roslin's arguments against
settlement could possibly win.

636
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
CYLON OCCUPIED CAPRICA

637
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,500
Let's go.

638
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,800
- right there.
- Go it.

639
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,100
Let's figure out
where we are, Karl.

640
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,600
Resistance base camp.
We're still...

641
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,500
another klick ahead.

642
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Movement. Eleven o'clock

643
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,300
Friendlies?

644
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You got a Samuel T. Anders there?

645
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,000
Is there a Kara Thrace there?

646
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,300
If there is,...

647
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,300
you tell her she took her
good, sweet time getting here.

648
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,400
Friendlies.

649
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,700
What took you so long?

650
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,600
We have marines in raptors.

651
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,200
We're gonna get you and your
people out of here, okay?

652
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,700
As good as your word, huh?

653
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,300
Yeah, good as my frakkin' word. 

654
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,800
What, did you think I
was going to leave you here?

655
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,700
Now you feel like a big frakkin'
idiot, don't you?

656
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,500
All right, just shut up
and save us already, okay?

657
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,300
People, this is nice,
but we have toasters on our ass.

658
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,400
Where are the rest
of your people?

659
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,100
This is it.

660
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,600
Toasters hit our base
camp this morning.

661
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,400
I lost half my crew.

662
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,400
Incoming!

663
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,900
Back to the raptors!

664
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,800
No!

665
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,000
Shell trajectories are coming
between us and the raptors.

666
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
We're cut off!

667
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,700
