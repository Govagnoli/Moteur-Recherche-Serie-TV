1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,840
The Cylons Were Created By Man

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,170
They Evolved

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,410
They Rebelled

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,120
There Are Many Copies

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,130
And They Have A Plan

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,910
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica...

7
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,370
CYLON OCCUPIED CAPRICA

8
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,680
They've got us zeroed in.

9
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,320
If we stay here,
they're gonna chew us up.

10
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,500
All right, we gotta fall back.
Position up this hill. Let's go!

11
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,290
All right, let's go, people!

12
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,910
Jaw set nicely. You're done here.

13
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,530
I'm kicking you out of here
and sending you back to work.

14
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,520
Work like this?

15
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,740
You gotta love a woman who can
complain even with her jaw wired shut.

16
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,370
You got a visitor.

17
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,870
I'm sorry.

18
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:43,290
What I did was... unforgivable,
inexcusable. I didn't come here to...

19
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,440
I forgive you.

20
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,750
No. Cally. No.

21
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:54,970
It wasn't you. I know
that. It wasn't you.

22
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,030
It was me. I... may
have been out of my mind

23
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,180
and not know where I was doing
or anything, but it was me.

24
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,210
You're in pain. You have been
in pain for a really long time.

25
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,030
Don't feel sorry for me.

26
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,480
I care about you. I always
have. And I always will.

27
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,290
Let's move! Let's go, let's go.

28
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,790
Move it, move it, move it.

29
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,780
Get a medic!

30
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,530
Sharon, take the gun!

31
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,730
They got us blocked
in here really good!

32
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,940
Frak! Can't raise the raptors.
The cylons have jammed the freq's.

33
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,530
Frak.

34
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,520
Still out there?

35
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,380
Watch yourself.

36
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,600
Yeah. They're holding back though.

37
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,720
Yeah, but why?

38
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,990
They're holding position.
Sending for nonlethal weapons.

39
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,690
They want some prisoners
for interrogation.

40
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,610
The rest they're
gonna send to the farm.

41
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,660
I'm not going back
to one of those farms.

42
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,910
Yeah, well, you won't have
any choice. None of us will.

43
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,690
They're gonna lob some gas in here and
then we'll all wake up somewhere else.

44
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,010
Damn.

45
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,490
So what do you want to do here?

46
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,850
Sit it out. Wait and
see if she's right.

47
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,880
If she is, then you and me,
we gotta have an agreement.

48
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,030
An agreement?

49
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,260
Not going back to one of
those farms, Sam. I'm not.

50
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:35,550
So if she's right and they throw
gas in here... you do me, I do you.

51
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,130
What are you talking about?

52
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,330
This is what I'm
talking about, okay?

53
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,770
Yeah, okay.

54
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,990
Okay.

55
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,530
Down two more points. And this after
hearing his notions of social policy.

56
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,920
Not to mention his wishful thinking
that he is calling "security policy."

57
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,510
Are people really
going to be that stupid?

58
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,520
Are they really going
to be that short-sighted?

59
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,650
He's got the only
issue people care about.

60
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,230
I know. The planet.

61
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,730
That's all anybody wants to talk
about is that frakkin' planet.

62
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,340
Excuse my language,
Tory, I'm sorry.

63
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,480
I know in my gut that settling on this
planet's gonna mean disaster for humanity.

64
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,730
And I will not say otherwise
just to win an election.

65
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,760
As you wish, Madam President.

66
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,990
So I guess I should
start packing up my office

67
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,740
unless you have some
super secret backup plan

68
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,900
for victory in your pocket.

69
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,410
There's always a
backup plan for victory.

70
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,550
Just in time for the priest.

71
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,170
Good. Send him in.

72
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,240
Eighteen hours. They're taking
their good sweet time out there.

73
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,580
They could've overrun us at
any point during the night.

74
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,910
They're up to something.

75
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,800
What are we up to?

76
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,670
Got any brilliant ideas in
that military brain of yours.

77
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,590
Do the same thing we always
do. Fight 'em till we can't.

78
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,920
What do you think?

79
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,210
Let's get a recon crew
together. Scout the area.

80
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,140
Figure out what's
going on out there.

81
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,860
They're gone. They just left.

82
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,630
Thank the gods!

83
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,800
It's a miracle.

84
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,490
Let us pray.

85
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,230
Lords of kobol, we trust in your
benevolence and praise your righteousness.

86
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,490
Give the people of this fleet
the wisdom to see the goodness

87
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,970
and the strength of your
servant, Laura Roslin. Amen.

88
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,080
Admiral?

89
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,550
Madam President.

90
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,340
The Admiral's not here.
This is my meeting.

91
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,210
I wanted us to talk privately
without the press getting wind of it.

92
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,920
Please have a seat.

93
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,770
Well, you must have
something very interesting

94
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,460
to say to resort to such
pedestrian methods of deception.

95
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,590
The question of permanent
settlement may well be

96
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,840
the most important issue
we face since the attack.

97
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,250
I agree.

98
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,650
Good. The question should be carefully
studied before making a final decision.

99
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:30,200
In the middle of an election campaign
is hardly the time for careful study.

100
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:38,250
Therefore I propose a truce. You and I
will issue a joint statement declaring

101
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,560
that the  question be tabled
till after this election.

102
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,200
We will both pledge that
regardless of who is elected,

103
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,100
the decision will be made
only after careful deliberation

104
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,040
involving all
elements of the public

105
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,660
and after consultation with the
military and the Quorum of Twelve.

106
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,560
Doctor, I know we've
had our disagreements,

107
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:13,000
but this issue transcends personal
disagreement as well as politics.

108
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,720
I am appealing here to
your sense of patriotism.

109
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,030
Let me tell you my sense of
patriotism is doing just fine.

110
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,080
Thank you very much for asking.

111
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:38,170
I see it as my patriotic duty to
lead this fleet to a new world.

112
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,110
That new world is
unquestionably New Caprica.

113
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:55,860
But thank you, Madam President,
for demonstrating to me

114
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,090
just how desperate your campaign
for re-election has become.

115
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,580
Were you with a blond woman on
Caprica just prior to the attack?

116
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,820
A what?

117
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,940
She knows.

118
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:24,900
Were you with a tall, blond
woman in the river walk

119
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:30,480
section of Caprica City
just prior to the attack?

120
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,740
She can see right through
you. Get out of here now.

121
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,120
You'll resort to anything
at this stage, won't you?

122
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,760
I'm afraid my affairs on Caprica

123
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,950
and who I chose to consort
with are none of your business.

124
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:50,360
I saved your life. I won't
save your political career.

125
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,290
We are not moving
down to that planet.

126
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,480
- If Baltar wins the election--
- Baltar won't win the gods-damn--

127
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,570
If he does, then what? We're
going to just sit on this ship

128
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,850
and rot while everyone else
gets to start a new life?

129
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,930
Ellen, my job is to protect
the fleet from the cylons

130
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,740
and that's exactly
what I'll be doing.

131
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,050
If you want to move down
there, go ahead, be my guest.

132
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,790
Go down and cat around with all the
men. Have yourself a good old time.

133
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,410
Saul, I want you.

134
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:29,930
XO. You gotta be kidding
me. I'll be right down.

135
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,620
Starbuck's back. I
gotta get down there.

136
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,660
You're going to be
okay. We're almost there.

137
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,950
Guys, take it easy
with it. Come on.

138
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,880
Am I good or what?

139
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,620
There's gonna be no
living with her now.

140
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,000
It's good to see you. Welcome back.

141
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,500
Thank you, sir. I brought
some friends with me.

142
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,470
I see.

143
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,150
Right. Right.

144
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,000
This is... This is
Samuel T. Anders.

145
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,280
I know who he is.

146
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,620
- Damn good to meet you, sir.
- Caprica Buccaneers.

147
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,650
That's right.

148
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,840
Hell of a player. I'm a
Picon Panther fan myself.

149
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,520
We enjoyed beating them too.

150
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,120
- It's good to have you aboard.
- Thank you.

151
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,910
I have news. Good news, actually.

152
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:37,240
The cylon occupation is
over. They left. They're gone.

153
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,640
- What are you talking about?
- It's true.

154
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,040
The cylons have left the colonies.

155
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,210
They're headed for
greener pastures.

156
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,290
- Security!
- What the hell?

157
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,350
Don't move! He's a cylon.

158
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,600
Back off, chief. We got it.

159
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:16,250
Well, this is an awkward moment.
Yes, he's right. I'm a cylon.

160
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:24,290
And I have a message. So
take me to your leader.

161
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,160
Take him to the brig.
Take that to the brig too.

162
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,150
What? Admiral, she didn't know.

163
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,790
Don't even start, Helo!
Of course she knew.

164
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,350
Welcome to Galactica.

165
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,380
Why the frak didn't
you say anything?

166
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,590
I don't know. Maybe
I didn't want to.

167
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,680
Maybe I wanted him to come
here and blow up the whole ship.

168
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,580
Is that what you're looking for?

169
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,710
You don't mean that.

170
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:24,020
Sharon, we finally got the Admiral to
start trusting us. Finally! And what?

171
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,880
They killed my baby.

172
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:39,730
You think I care about you or us or
whether the Admiral trusts me anymore?

173
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,100
Sharon! I love you!

174
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,870
And I'm not giving up this
frakkin' easy! Not after everything!

175
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,020
- You ready?
- All right.

176
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,510
Listen. You don't
have to get me drunk.

177
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,490
I will sleep with you, okay?

178
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,180
I figure I owe you one what
with you saving me and all.

179
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,200
- Little slut.
- Shut up.

180
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,480
Come here. Now you're
going to play hard to get.

181
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,160
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

182
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,020
My hero.

183
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,870
Gods, I guess they'll let
anybody in here these days.

184
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,190
Hi.

185
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,240
Welcome back.

186
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,570
- Do you want to meet my man?
- Your man.

187
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,700
My personal property. Right, Sammy?

188
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,010
Don't call me Sammy.

189
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,060
How does it feel to be
my personal property?

190
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

191
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,150
And before you answer...

192
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,830
He loves it.

193
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,850
I'll bet he does.
I'm Lee, by the way.

194
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,930
- Hey. Sammy. I'm sorry.
- I've heard a lot about you.

195
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,800
- Pleasure. Shot?
- Sure. Why not?

196
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,810
Lee, when are you gonna
get yourself a girl?

197
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,190
I'm doing fine, thank you.

198
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,430
You're not still
frakkin' Dualla, are you?

199
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,210
Thanks a lot.

200
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,050
I mean, I'm not one
to like, you know,

201
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,180
lecture or anything 'cause
I'll do just about anything

202
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,910
to get into the pants of
some hot little young thing.

203
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,890
Is that all I am to you?

204
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,250
Yes. But you love it.

205
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,820
That's all right. I don't
mind doing charity work.

206
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,040
Where did he go?

207
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,290
I'm here to deliver a message.

208
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,350
After that, you can do whatever
you want with me. I don't care.

209
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,180
Would you mind telling
me what's going on?

210
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:03,110
I'm not a frakking cylon.
I'm not... Well... Okay, then.

211
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,020
Sorry to bust up your day, brother.

212
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,080
But there's been a change of plans.

213
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,610
It's been decided that the occupation
of the colonies was an error.

214
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,050
I could've told them
that. Bad thinking.

215
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,400
Faulty logic. Our first
major error of judgment.

216
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,170
Live and learn.

217
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,890
But the war heroes have managed to
swing opinion over to their side.

218
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,560
What heroes?

219
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,570
A six and an eight. One of the
eights you know as Sharon Valerii.

220
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,850
Their voices carry a lot of weight.

221
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,430
So when they started talking about
our mistakes and our corruption

222
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,010
and our need for a new beginning,
the rest of us listened.

223
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,280
You see, we're not like you.

224
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,790
We can admit our mistakes and
we're not afraid of change.

225
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:00,280
So you abandoned the colonies leaving
behind a devastated nuclear wasteland.

226
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,050
And we're supposed to be grateful.

227
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,050
Our pursuit of this fleet
of yours was another error.

228
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,790
That's two for anyone
who's keeping score.

229
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,980
Both errors led to the same result.

230
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,080
We became what we
beheld. We became you.

231
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:21,520
Amen. People should be true
to who and what they are.

232
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,340
We're machines. We
should be true to that.

233
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,230
Be the best machines the
universe has ever seen.

234
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,810
But we got it into our heads that
we were the children of humanity.

235
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,680
So instead of perusing
our own destiny of trying

236
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:40,790
to find our own path to
enlightenment, we hijacked yours.

237
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,730
You said it, brother. My
mission here is simple.

238
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,420
I'm to tell you that you've
been given a reprieve.

239
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:54,650
Cylon and man will now go their
separate ways, no harm done.

240
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,660
No harm.

241
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,510
You completely annihilated our race

242
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,740
and destroyed our civilization.

243
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,350
Now if you going to
start pointing fingers...

244
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,250
Where did the cylons go?
Back to their home world?

245
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:15,340
Well, I'd rather not say just now.
Let's just say we have other plans.

246
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:19,260
New marching orders
by your one true god.

247
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,620
There is no god.

248
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,140
Supernatural divinities
are the primitive's answer

249
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,000
for why the sun goes down at night.

250
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,670
At least that's what we've been
telling the others for years.

251
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,560
Can't really prove it one
way or the other, of course.

252
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,150
I know a way to prove it. Throw
them both out the air lock.

253
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,930
Let them see if there
really is a cylon god.

254
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,260
ELECTION DAY

255
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,710
Ballots from the
Adriatic. D? This way.

256
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,190
It's been an exciting day.

257
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,180
The election has been a
real roller-coaster ride.

258
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,530
The polls now have been
closed for about five hours.

259
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,330
Results have come in and
it's been a seesaw battle back

260
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,580
and forth between the Presidential
candidates all night long as we,

261
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,650
of course, expected it would be.

262
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,670
Uh, we're still waiting for a
few more numbers to come in now,

263
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,700
from the counting
room of Galactica,

264
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,980
which must tell you as some of
you may know, was a source of a bit

265
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,860
of a controversy yesterday.

266
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,650
Councilman Zarek had
filed a formal complaint

267
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,790
against the use of military
involvement in the election process.

268
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,620
Now it's just reached a compromise
was just reached late yesterday

269
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,460
allowing Galactica to provide
security for the balloting

270
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:39,240
as well as civilians to oversee
and monitor the situation.

271
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,610
Yes, okay. We have some
more votes coming in here.

272
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,480
Still not done.

273
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,630
But what we have so far is
6,282 more votes for Baltar,

274
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:55,010
which puts his total now
to 21,569. Is that correct?

275
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:01,200
And we also have Roslin.
Her total now is at 17,754.

276
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,400
We've had 2,981 more votes
come in for Roslin at this time.

277
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,900
So that is how things
are looking at this point.

278
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,940
We'll continue to bring you
up-to-the-minute coverage...

279
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:39,670
Yeah, it's me. Is this
a secure line? Okay.

280
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,740
There are only five ships left
to report in. We need to move now.

281
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,340
I'll take care of it.

282
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,930
Lieutenant, I'll be right back.

283
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,530
Are those the ballots
from the Zephyr?

284
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,850
Yes, sir.

285
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,590
All right, we'll take it from here.

286
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,320
We were told to take these
to the ballot room, sir.

287
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,350
Counting has already begun.
We'll take it from here.

288
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,950
Last one.

289
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,270
We have some more results
have come in here now.

290
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:57,610
Okay. 8,593 for Roslin,
which puts her over the top.

291
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,460
That's 24,265 for Laura
Roslin. Is that correct?

292
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,720
And 22,366 for Gaius Baltar.

293
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,650
We're going to check these again

294
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,110
because that has put her
over the top. She has done it.

295
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,480
She has retained the presidency
in an improbable comeback

296
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,140
in the final hours of the campaign.
Again, we would, of course,

297
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,780
like to check those
numbers, if we could.

298
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,160
But it appears that Laura Roslin
has retained the presidency

299
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,920
in defiance of the
polls, the pundits,

300
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,910
and the surveyors
of gloom and doom.

301
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,610
I've never seen a political
race end like this,

302
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,690
but it has just happened.
I am James McManus.

303
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,150
We'll check those numbers and
we'll be back to you very shortly.

304
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,820
Thank you.

305
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,730
I've seen a lot of
elections, Gaius.

306
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,660
Most honest, a few fixed.

307
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,100
And you can always tell the fixed
ones because they don't make sense.

308
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,770
And this doesn't make sense.

309
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:06,020
Laura Roslin is many things.
But she's not corrupt.

310
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:12,850
And she's not dishonest. It's over.

311
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,810
Congratulations, Madam President.

312
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,750
Thank you.

313
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,010
I hope you don't take
this the wrong way,

314
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,110
but are you as shocked as I am?

315
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,710
I'm relieved.

316
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,550
Well, you don't sound it.

317
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,780
I'm just tired. It's
been a long campaign.

318
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,810
Colonel, may I speak
to you for a moment?

319
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,610
What's up?

320
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,300
Sir, I'm afraid these ballots
from the Zephyr are wrong.

321
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,620
What the hell are
you talking about?

322
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,200
Doctor Baltar's name is spelled
correctly on these ballots.

323
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,380
But this morning, the
Zephyr called me and told me

324
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,420
their ballots had a misprint. They
misspelled Baltar's first name.

325
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,650
We didn't have time to print
new ballots, so I told them

326
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,210
on my authority to go
ahead and use them anyway.

327
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,400
Baltar's name is
spelled correctly here,

328
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,750
so they couldn't have come
from the Zephyr. They're frauds.

329
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,510
Now there's a complete chain
of custody from the Zephyr

330
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,780
all the way into this room.

331
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,370
So someone in the chain
is either a perpetrator

332
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,990
or at least a willing ally.

333
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,540
Thank you for bringing
this to my attention.

334
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,460
I'll take care of it from here.

335
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,260
Sir. We should at least
notify the civilian observers

336
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,650
and the press that these ballots...

337
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,910
I said I'll take
care of it from here.

338
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,390
Yes, sir.

339
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,290
Madam President,
you should celebrate.

340
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,580
It's a great victory
and you've earned it.

341
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,120
Excuse me.

342
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,920
Admiral, we'll talk
later. Thank you.

343
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,620
Adama.

344
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,830
Yes, sir. This is Lieutenant Gaeta.

345
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,600
Sir... I don't know
how to say this.

346
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,350
Fast and straight, I'd advise.

347
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:28,600
Yes, sir. Admiral, I
believe that Colonel Tigh

348
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,470
is involved in a conspiracy to rig
the election for President Roslin.

349
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:43,030
When I confronted the
colonel, he admitted his guilt.

350
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:50,080
He said he acted in collusion with
your campaign manager, Tory Foster.

351
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,140
Saul said tory contacted
him a few days ago.

352
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:58,630
He did it because he felt that Baltar
as President would be a disaster.

353
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:04,090
I said I agreed, but that
what he had done was illegal.

354
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,140
A judicial tribunal
may have to be convened.

355
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:14,180
Stop. I gave Tory the go-ahead.

356
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,090
I didn't know exactly
what she was planning.

357
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,920
I certainly did not
know about Colonel Tigh.

358
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:24,680
My gods. But I did know that
she was planning to fix the vote.

359
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,040
You tried to steal an election?

360
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,740
Yes, I did. And I got caught.

361
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,540
But Gaius Baltar cannot become
President of the Colonies, Bill.

362
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,590
It cannot happen.

363
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:46,570
Laura... I don't want him
as President either, but...

364
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,740
He's working with the cylons.

365
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,700
I saw him just before
the attack in Caprica

366
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,200
with a copy of the
tall blond cylon woman.

367
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,720
The same model who accused Baltar of
treason before disappearing from Galactica.

368
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,690
What the hell are you saying?

369
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,700
Why didn't you say
something before this?

370
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,520
Because I didn't remember
seeing him with that woman

371
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,640
until I remembered
it when I was dying.

372
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,360
I know how that
sounds, but it's real.

373
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:19,310
The same way Kobol is real,
and the Tomb of Athena is real,

374
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:24,660
and the map to earth is real.
Baltar is working with the cylons.

375
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,620
Even if that's true,
you have no proof.

376
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,390
No, I don't.

377
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,800
Do we steal the results of
a democratic election or not?

378
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:03,340
That's the decision. Because
if we do this, we're criminals.

379
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:08,960
Unindicted, maybe, but
criminals just the same.

380
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,450
Yes, we are.

381
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:21,450
You won't do it. We've gone
this far, but that's it.

382
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,950
'Scuse me?

383
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,270
You try to steal this election,

384
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:30,890
you'll die inside likely move
your cancer right to your heart.

385
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:37,400
The people made their choice.
We're gonna have to live with it.

386
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,800
It's the wrong choice.

387
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,550
Yes, it is.

388
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:59,090
All right. All right. All right.

389
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:10,780
So that's it. We just
give it up, just like that.

390
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:18,550
The battle, perhaps.
But not the war.

391
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,380
Well, the important thing is the
error was discovered and corrected.

392
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,660
You've been elected
President. Congratulations.

393
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,960
Thank you very much,
Admiral. Now about this error.

394
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,870
Exactly what kind of a tabulating
error could have occurred on your ship

395
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,690
that could've swung several
thousand votes away from me

396
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,770
in favor of your preferred
candidate, Admiral?

397
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,640
As soon as I have the time,
there will be an investigation.

398
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,670
I suggest that you take your victory
and you leave it at that, Doctor.

399
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,840
I think you'll find I can be
magnanimous in victory, Admiral.

400
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:20,820
And I believe the correct honorific
at this time is Mr. President elect.

401
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,720
Set course for New Caprica.

402
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,460
Jump completed. We are in
orbit around New Caprica.

403
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,010
We have all ships present
and accounted for, sir.

404
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,160
Send word to the Pegasus to launch their
initial ground team onto the surface.

405
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:02,680
Let's get a good look at our
new home. Gods help us all.

406
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,700
Well... well, I think
my ability to see you

407
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:35,810
will no doubt be constrained
by the responsibilities

408
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,990
and the requirements of my
new position. Listen to me.

409
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,250
My new position.

410
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:51,130
But obviously, we will
have the chance to connect,

411
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,640
to get together again
on New Caprica once...

412
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,800
I'm not going to New Caprica.

413
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:05,340
What? What are you talking about?

414
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,810
I'm not going to New Caprica.

415
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:15,650
We're all going to
New Caprica. All of us.

416
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,400
Every last, single one of us!

417
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,620
It's our chance to be together.

418
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,340
To be together again.

419
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,030
No.

420
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,000
I can't do this anymore.

421
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,170
Stay.

422
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,600
If you'll raise your right
hand and repeat after me.

423
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:30,080
"I, Gaius Baltar, do
now avow and affirm."

424
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:34,240
"I, Gaius Baltar, do
now avow and affirm."

425
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,960
"That I take the office of the
President of the 12 Colonies of Kobol

426
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:50,890
without any moral reservation
or mental evasion."

427
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,300
"That I take the office of
President of the 12 Colonies of Kobol

428
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,670
without any moral reservation
or mental evasion."

429
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,240
"That I will protect and defend
the articles of colonization."

430
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,850
"That I will protect and defend
the articles of colonization."

431
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,970
"With every fiber of my being."

432
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,740
"With every fiber of my being."

433
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,040
- Congratulations, Mr. President.
- Thank you.

434
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,240
I accept the role offered
to me by the Colonies

435
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:44,870
with humility and
gratitude. Thank you.

436
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:54,050
Wait, wait. No, no, wait. And now...
because it was the first will of the people,

437
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:57,090
I'm going to sign my
first executive order

438
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,240
requiring the fleet to
immediately establish settlements

439
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:06,790
on the planet we have come
to know as New Caprica.

440
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,310
Admiral Adama. You
have your orders.

441
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,610
We suspect the warhead
was stolen from your lab.

442
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,250
Then smuggled aboard
Cloud 9 by a Cylon agent.

443
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,150
I don't suppose I could interest
you in a cup of tea, Admiral?

444
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:26,030
Mr. President, this may be the first
step in a coordinated cylon attack.

445
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,050
I suggest our first priority would
be to focus in on internal security.

446
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:36,890
No. No, I don't think so.

447
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,120
Our first priority
is to the people.

448
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:49,610
See that they are safely
established on New Caprica.

449
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:00,340
Once  that's accomplished... We
can put this tragedy behind us.

450
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,440
You're not listening.

451
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:10,070
I don't have to listen.
I'm the President.

452
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,980
The settlement begins
and it begins now.

453
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:14,260
Mr. President. President
Baltar. Good morning, sir.

454
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,870
Good morning, sir.

455
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,000
Mr. President, the
Union needs their answer.

456
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,820
The union. If it's not
the union, it's the Quorum.

457
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,700
If it's not the Quorum,
it's the people's council.

458
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:47,040
ONE YEAR LATER

459
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,510
We survived a nuclear
holocaust, Mr. Gaeta.

460
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:52,860
And the people complain
about the weather.

461
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,670
- Sir, it's hardly the weather...
- Well, whatever it is.

462
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,640
How many cylon attacks have
there been since I took office?

463
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,720
- How many?
- None, sir.

464
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:10,480
None. Precisely. So why
do the people complain?

465
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,480
Tell the union to get
off their fat asses

466
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,960
and do some frakking
work for a change

467
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,380
or I'll start rounding
up their leaders

468
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,000
and holding them in detention. I
doubt they'll like that very much.

469
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,740
- I'll tell them, Mr. President.
- Thank you.

470
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,320
Morning. Where's
my, where's my pills?

471
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,260
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
ORBITAL DEFENSE PATROL

472
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,450
DAY 380

473
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,360
- I'm telling you to go, okay?
- No, it's not okay.

474
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,010
I feel like I'm abandoning my post.

475
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,690
It's time to pack it
in, Saul. You know it.

476
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,290
More than half the crew is down
there on the ground already.

477
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:12,670
We can barely put a
squadron in the air to train,

478
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:15,970
much less fly a decent cap.

479
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:19,410
We're not really doing
too much up here anymore.

480
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,130
You're staying.

481
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,660
Yeah, well, someone has to
take care of the lighthouse.

482
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,080
Then I'll stay and take
care of it with you.

483
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,080
I appreciate that. But you know
there's only one person per lighthouse.

484
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,980
We both know the cylons
could still show up.

485
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,500
Anything's possible.

486
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:44,580
We've been orbiting New Caprica
longer than we ran after the attack.

487
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,130
I don't think they're
coming back anymore.

488
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:50,660
Colonel...

489
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,700
Good luck.

490
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:16,580
If she gives you too much trouble,
find yourself a younger one.

491
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,710
Attention, all
section four residents.

492
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,890
Please report to supply depots
to pick up weekly food rations.

493
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:51,920
NEW CAPRICA CITY POPULATION 39.192

494
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:55,630
Supplies are limited. Please
report as soon as possible.

495
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,060
You seen Sam?

496
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,260
- I think he's over there playing pyrimid.
- Thanks.

497
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,380
Set her up.

498
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,630
Sam, you idiot! I've been
looking for you everywhere.

499
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:26,580
What the hell are you thinking?

500
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:28,440
Looks like I'm in trouble.

501
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:31,580
Doc Cottle is here. You're sick.
You're supposed to be in bed.

502
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,400
I would rather work
this out of my system

503
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,390
right here than lie in bed all day.

504
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,540
Player 1: Sam, come on. Come on.

505
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,700
- Duty calls.
- You gotta be tough.

506
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:47,200
Let's go, Anders.

507
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,290
Tomorrow, man. Same
time, same score.

508
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,680
Can't believe I married
a moron. Are you okay?

509
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,950
Fine. I'm fine.

510
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,170
It's okay.

511
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:21,120
I'll be right back,
okay? Doc, wait. So?

512
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:26,610
There's fluid in the lungs.
It's probably pneumonia.

513
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,120
So give him something.

514
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:32,830
I'd love to. I've been out
of antibiotics for months.

515
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:36,540
So what, that's it?

516
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,670
I have a lot of patients to see.

517
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,790
But he's young and he's
strong. So make him rest.

518
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,060
Keep him warm. And with a
little luck, he'll make it.

519
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,360
Son of a bitch.

520
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,260
Everybody, please. Just calm down.

521
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,730
Please just calm down. Everybody
listen just for a second.

522
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:22,500
Please. Please. Be quiet!

523
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,980
Shut the frak up!

524
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,320
When you elected
me union President,

525
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,970
I promised I would keep us
working, keep benefits flowing.

526
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,560
But most of all,
keep this city alive.

527
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,930
I promised we would
stay on the job.

528
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,420
And well hey. And
building a better tomorrow.

529
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,040
- Look at you.
- Hi.

530
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,620
I'm so glad you guys are here.

531
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,570
Me too. It's pretty...
pretty exciting.

532
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,530
Yeah, that wears off.

533
00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:00,220
- So what's going on here?
- President Baltar.

534
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:06,660
Sir, Anders is really sick.

535
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,410
But Doc Cottle's
giving me the runaround

536
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:12,460
and says there's no antibiotics.
And that's a load of crap.

537
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:16,620
Anything you can do to help
me cut through the red tape.

538
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,430
You should give Apollo a call.

539
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:23,540
Pegasus is sitting on the backup
meds. He'd spring some for you.

540
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,240
Yeah. I doubt that.

541
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:31,050
That was a long time
ago. People change.

542
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,200
Okay.

543
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,260
But there comes a
time when you realize

544
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:44,500
that the engine you've
built with your blood

545
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:49,340
and your sweat and your tears is
being used for something so foul,

546
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:53,570
so perverted that it makes
you sick in your heart.

547
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,460
And it's then that you
must throw your body

548
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,980
on the gears and on the levers
and on the machine itself

549
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,230
and make it stop. And you have
to show the people who run it,

550
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,310
the people who control
it, that unless we're free,

551
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:07,400
that machine will be
prevented from working at all.

552
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:13,740
Strike! Strike! Strike!

553
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,500
Okay. Everybody have that so far?

554
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,840
Yes.

555
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,400
Good, you're listening.

556
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:26,440
Think the President has a
bit of a problem on his hands.

557
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,650
I also want you to
look at chapter ten.

558
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:33,100
It's the history of the 12
colonies. It's really interesting.

559
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:37,370
The President's problems are
not our problems, are they?

560
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:42,730
That's right. Our problems are
homework for everyone tonight.

561
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:50,520
Now some of you are
going to stay and help me

562
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,550
with the art project
for the presentation.

563
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,540
Everyone else, your
parents are here.

564
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,020
Get your stuff, let's go.
Go on. Get out of here.

565
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,250
Good job. Yeah. Okay.
Bye, honey. Thanks.

566
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,750
Good job. Good job.

567
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,950
Thank you, parents.

568
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,870
You know what, why don't
you and the baby go on, okay?

569
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,720
- I'll finish up here.
- You sure?

570
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:17,180
Yes. Yes. Go ahead. Thank you.

571
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,740
Bubble head. A bubble
head. I love this.

572
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,640
Hello. Hello, Isis.

573
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,530
BATTLESTAR PEGASUS
LEE ADAMA, COMMANDING

574
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:24,750
What's going on?

575
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,280
- It's for you.
- Who is it?

576
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,950
- It's for you.
- Who is it?

577
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,030
Right.

578
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,150
What do you want?

579
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,700
I need a favor.

580
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:50,870
Is that right?

581
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:56,220
I hear that you're hoarding a
bunch of antibiotics for the pilots.

582
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:59,970
Where did you hear that?

583
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:10,090
Anders is sick. He has pneumonia,
Lee. I think that he might die.

584
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,460
Commander.

585
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:18,260
Wait. Yeah, lieutenant. What is it?

586
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:21,890
I'm not sure. Picking
up something on dradis.

587
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:25,860
Dradis? How can you see
anything in that soup?

588
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:31,420
There it is.

589
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,100
What is it?  Wait, what is that?

590
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:50,390
Oh, my gods, it's a cylon fleet.
They found us. They found us.

591
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:58,900
We have to get out of here, sir.

592
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:00,800
We can't just leave
all those people behind.

593
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,140
There's nothing we can do.

594
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:04,480
It's taken us forever just to
get to action stations over here.

595
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:06,500
We're in no shape for a fight, sir.

596
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,390
They'll be wiped out.

597
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,300
We don't have a choice. We need
to get out of here right now.

598
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,120
All decks finally report
condition one, sir.

599
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,160
Should we launch
the alert fighters?

600
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:28,100
Begin jump prep. We're leaving.

601
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:32,990
But we'll be back. Start your prep.

602
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,760
Mr. President! Mr. President!

603
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:50,210
- Don't you knock?
- Gaius. Gaius!

604
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,410
Yeah, what is it?

605
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:56,170
The cylons just jumped into
orbit and the fleet's jumped away.

606
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,740
Judgment day.

607
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,040
I'm looking for Kara Thrace.

608
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,330
I'm Gaius Baltar.

609
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,440
President of the Colonies.

610
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:24,770
I know who you are, Gaius.

611
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:30,440
I know very well.

612
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:38,780
As long as you offer no
resistance, you won't be harmed.

613
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:48,770
How do I know that?

614
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:53,640
You don't. You also
don't have any choice.

615
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:06,760
How did you find us?

616
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:10,550
It was quite by accident, actually.

617
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:13,770
We were over a
light-year away from here

618
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:19,280
when we detected the radiation
signature of a nuclear detonation.

619
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:49,700
Very well. on behalf of the people
of the 12 Colonies, I surrender.

620
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:36,280
What do you want
to do now, Captain?

621
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:44,640
The same thing we always do,
fight them until we can't.

622
