1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
The Cylons Were
Created by Man

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,800
They Evolved

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,500
They Rebelled

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,500
There Are Many Copies

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,600
And They Have A Plan

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica...

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,200
Frakk me.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,300
Are you alive?

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,300
It's probably a Cylon itself.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,300
More of an animal maybe,
than the human models.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,700
Maybe they genetically design it
to perform a task.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,000
To be a fighter.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,900
- Don't even try defending
- for no frakking reason!

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,700
Knock it off!
Knock it off!

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,300
You get the hell
out of here, now.

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,800
I'm so sick of her.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,900
Come on, come on, come on.

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,000
I can't do it.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What the hell happened?
Kat's made the trap 100 times.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,100
What are these?

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,800
Stims.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,700
By the look of it, she's been
taking them by the handful.

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,600
I was ???????????????

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,500
So I taking stims.
It's so stupid.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,100
As soon as I get back to Galactica,
I'll send a rescue party.

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,600
Yeah, right.

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,700
If I say I'm gonna
do something, I do it.

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,700
- Count on it.
- My kind of woman.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The resistance base camp is here.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,100
300 cliks north of the only
Cylon airbase in the area.

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,300
I respect what
you trying to do here.

32
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,200
However...

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,700
We have a duty to the
people we left behind.

34
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,800
We undestand that.

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,900
We have to find a way to
jump back to Caprica...

36
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,900
- and go get then
- Kara

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Colonial Mining Ship Majahual
29th Day of operations

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,900
Entering section two-five-nine.
Keep your eyes open, Kat.

39
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,500
This is where BB and Jo-Jo 
bought it.

40
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,900
Come on out, Scar, you ugly
cylon son of a bitch. Let's party!

41
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,900
Yeah, I don't think he's
gonna RSVP, Kat.

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,000
He prefers surprise parties.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,300
Yeah, well be surprised when
I blow his ass apart.

44
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Yeah, that'll be the day.

45
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Cassie.

46
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,700
Cassie, wasn't that her name?

47
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,800
Whose name?

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,300
Reilly's girlfriend.

49
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,100
You know what Kat, I told you
I have no frakkin' idea,...

50
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,000
so give it rest, all right?

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,700
94 hours ago

52
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,500
Reilly's dead for
one very simple reason.

53
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
He couldn't
control his fear.

54
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,500
Yup, poor idiot cut and ran.

55
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,900
Gave the toaster a free
shot up his ass.

56
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,000
Scar spooked him.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,500
He saw that motherfrakker's
red eye coming straight for him,...

58
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,300
and he panicked.

59
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,700
Reilly was a good stick.

60
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,000
A little short on guts,
but a good stick.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,700
Beano who had plenty.

62
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,300
Took Cally an hour to
clean out his cockpit.

63
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,300
Hey, does anybody remember
the name of Reilly's girlfriend?

64
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,700
No.

65
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,200
Karen, I think.

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,900
Died on Picon. Karen.

67
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,200
No, was it Kather.. Kathy?

68
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,600
You guys, what does it matter?

69
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,100
Gonna hold a little prayer circle?
Good cry? The whole thing?

70
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,100
Actually. It does matter.

71
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,800
Hi.

72
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,600
Hey. This is Ensign Baxton.

73
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,200
Ensign Clark.

74
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,300
And I guess
we're your new bunkmates.

75
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,200
Welcome.

76
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,300
We just finished, uh,
viper training on pegasus.

77
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,500
Ready to kick some Cylon butt.

78
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,800
So was Beano.

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,700
Who's, uh, Beano?

80
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,700
Right here.

81
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Ooh, Scar's gonna smoke you
like a fine cigar, my man.

82
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,700
Who's Scar?

83
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,800
Not who. What.

84
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Toaster's top gun.
Deadliest raider in the cylon fleet.

85
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,500
Gimme break.
Come on they're machines.

86
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,400
One's the same as the next.

87
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Yeah, that's what we thought till
Cap Thrace cut the brain out of one.

88
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,300
Scar's the best they got.

89
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,300
Lotta pilots die going
after that bastard.

90
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,300
Why do they call him Scar?

91
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,100
You'll find out soon enough.

92
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,100
He's got a taste for nuggets.
Easy pickings.

93
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,300
Starbuck, I think I got something.

94
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,300
Big spud, lower rim.
You see that?

95
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,700
Negative.

96
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,300
A time you'd have
noticed it before me.

97
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,200
Fine, you're the shooter.

98
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,700
Try to keep up!

99
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,700
Yeah, just don't screw up.

100
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,300
- So,...
88 Hours Ago

101
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,200
how does Scar take out an
experienced pilot like Beano?

102
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,800
- He hides...
- He hides behind an asteroid.

103
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,300
Or the debris field
that you've ignored.

104
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,000
Because it looked like a
bunch of harmless rocks.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,100
You see, Scar doesn't
like to fight...

106
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,000
until the odds are
on his side.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And then, suddenly
out of nowhere, bam.

108
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,300
He pops out,
blows you to pieces.

109
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,700
And then jumps away
before you can return fire.

110
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,800
Well, if you ask me,
I think Scar's a coward.

111
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,500
This isn't dueling
pistols at dawn, this is war.

112
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
You never wanna fight fair.

113
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,600
You wanna sneak up
behind your enemy,...

114
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,400
and club 'em over the head.

115
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
You see, Scar understands that.

116
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,400
And so do I.

117
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,000
So, that's why
I'm gonna kill him.

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,800
You?

119
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Starbuck, you can barely walk.

120
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,300
Look who's talking, Stim Junkie.

121
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,200
You know,...

122
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,200
I wouldn't be calling anyone a
junkie if I were you Starbuck.

123
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,800
Not the way you been pounding
back that booze lately.

124
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,800
One Tigh on the ship's enough.

125
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,700
Uh,
I got...

126
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,700
I got 200 here.

127
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,900
Says I nail Scar's chrome-plated
ass. And when I do?

128
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,900
You hand that top gun over
to me and pour me my first drink.

129
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,300
Your lips'll never touch
the rim, little girl.

130
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,300
We'll see.

131
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,100
Starbuck!

132
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Maybe you should slow down.

133
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,100
Maybe.

134
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,700
Maybe not.

135
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Starbuck! Starbuck!
Starbuck! Starbuck!

136
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,300
Comin' in hot!

137
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Checkers green.
Speed 250!

138
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,300
Oh, yeah,  it's gotta be Scar.

139
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Found your hiding place,
you little frakker.

140
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Starbuck, kiss your 200 goodbye.

141
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,700
49.593 survivors

142
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,500
in search of a home

143
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Called Earth

144
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,800
This guy's mine.

145
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,700
Something's definitely wrong.

146
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,300
That can't be Scar.

147
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,300
He should be jumping,
or wheeling to gun at us.

148
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,700
I'll check
our tails.

149
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,000
Frakk!

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,200
Frakk, I'm hit

151
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Scar got me!
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!

152
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,900
See, Beano opened fire too early.

153
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,400
You guys,...

154
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,200
you gotta fill the
windscreen with the sucker...

155
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,900
or you're not gonna hit him.

156
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,700
See,  look.

157
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,100
He's still not close enough.

158
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,800
Beano's already dead, he just
doesn't know it yet.

159
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Do any of you guys see where
he went  wrong?

160
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,600
There, you see that glint?

161
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
There.

162
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,400
That's a Raider.

163
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,400
If beano hadn't fixated on
his target, he'd have seen that.

164
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Was it Scar?

165
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,600
There he is, boys and girls.

166
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,600
There's the motherfrakker
I'm gonna kill.

167
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm afraid this
is one of those...

168
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,900
good news, bad
news conversations.

169
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,100
Bad news first.

170
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,900
The mining chip's broken
another drill bit.

171
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,700
We need to extend again.
Another eight days.

172
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,700
Eight more days.
Son of a bitch.

173
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,800
They've just discovered an
incredibly rich vein of ore.

174
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,700
Enough to build two entire
squadrons of vipers.

175
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,700
I can't walk away from that.

176
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,400
What's the good news?

177
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,300
The Pegasus production team
has just turned out...

178
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,700
its first combat-ready viper.

179
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,100
We are beginning to
replace our losses.

180
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,700
Hmm. Are they going to be
able to replace pilots as well?

181
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,900
Let's review the tactical
situation.

182
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,200
Four weeks ago,...

183
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,400
our mining ships struck pay
dirt on this asteroid.

184
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,900
A pile of strategic  metals
that we need to build new ships.

185
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,800
Since we're sitting ducks
until the miners finish the job,...

186
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,200
the old man has sent the
fleet out of harm's way...

187
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,100
under the protection of Pegasus.

188
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,500
Our job is to stay
behind and protect the miners.

189
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,100
Unfortunately, this star system
is full of rocks and dust.

190
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,000
Dradis cannot tell the rocks
from the bad guys,...

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,400
so our only reliable
system of detection is...

192
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Our eyeballs.

193
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Which means we have to put
those eyeballs way out there.

194
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,900
Split up, cover a huge perimeter.

195
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,400
We'll be patrolling the area
in divisions of four...

196
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,600
at these picket points.

197
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,500
Twos, we're going in
sections of twos.

198
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Are you planning
the ops for me now too?

199
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,700
CAG wants us to spread out to
control a larger area.

200
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,100
It's right here in the briefings.

201
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,800
All right.

202
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,800
So, we do go in twos.

203
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,900
Scar and his buddies are out there.

204
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,800
Looking for easy kills.

205
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,600
Let's not give him any.

206
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
This operation is vital...

207
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,700
to the long term
survival of this fleet.

208
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,700
Yes, it is.

209
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,800
And we'll
continue to support it.

210
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,600
They're grinding us down,
viper by viper.

211
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,000
Why'd they stop
coming at us en masse?

212
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,500
Is it because we destroyed
the resurrection ship?

213
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,300
Starbuck's working on that.

214
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,300
This guy's probably died and
been reborn a dozen times.

215
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,700
You may have faced him before.

216
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,200
So what, raiders reincarnate?
Just like you?

217
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Yeah, just like me.

218
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,300
Great.

219
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,700
What a frakkin' world.

220
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,200
A raider's much
like a trained animal,...

221
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,200
with the basic consciousness
and survival instinct.

222
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,600
But with the destruction of
the resurrection ship,...

223
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
when they die,...

224
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,200
they're really dead.

225
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,000
So,...

226
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,800
they're not gonna
mount mass attacks...

227
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,300
where they could have
major casualties.

228
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,900
Raiders reincarnate?

229
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,500
Makes sense, doesn't it?

230
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,300
It takes months for
you to train a nugget...

231
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,000
into an effective
viper pilot.

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,100
And then they get killed.

233
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,800
And their experience,
their knowledge,

234
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,200
their skill sets.

235
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,000
They're all lost forever.

236
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So, if you could
bring 'em back...

237
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,400
and put 'em in a
brand new body,...

238
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,800
wouldn't you do it?

239
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,800
'Cause death then becomes a
learning experience.

240
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,400
How, uh...how many pilots
have we lost?

241
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,700
I mean, have you lost?

242
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,600
You know, there are
times when I look at you

243
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,900
and I forget
what you are.

244
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,800
All I see is...

245
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,300
that kid...

246
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,300
that pooched her
landings day after day.

247
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,100
The kid that was
frakkin' the chief...

248
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,100
and thinking she was
getting away with it.

249
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,300
Yeah, I remember.

250
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You were like a big sister to...

251
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,900
Kara, um...be careful
of Scar, okay?

252
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,900
He's filled with rage.

253
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,100
About what?

254
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,200
Dying's a painful and
traumatic experience.

255
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Every time he's reborn, he's
filled with more bitter memories.

256
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,700
Scar hates you every bit as
much as you hate him.

257
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,300
A raider is a squirmy
son of a bitch.

258
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,000
You won't be able to
keep him in your sights...

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,500
for more than two seconds.

260
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,700
So, you have to deliver
a killing burst...

261
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,300
within that time or
he will turn and nail you.

262
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,300
All that yanking and banking gives
you one hell of a case of vertigo.

263
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,300
And that is what this chair
simulates.

264
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,300
All right, Jo-Jo.

265
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,100
Go!

266
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Time!

267
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,300
Not bad.
At least you hit the target.

268
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,500
Yeah, but that's a lot better
than I did the first time.

269
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,600
I think I took out that
clock over there.

270
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,400
So, what's the all time record?

271
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,100
Four hits on the x-ring.

272
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,300
Are you kidding? Who did that?

273
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,900
I did.

274
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,500
Mind if I give it a
shot for old times sake?

275
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Be my guest.

276
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Two seconds. Go.

277
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Time!

278
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,400
- Five.
- Yes!

279
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,700
Frakk! I'm hit, I'm hit!

280
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,800
Scar got me!
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit.

281
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,000
Kat, Starbuck.
Where the hell are you?

282
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Starbuck, I lost visual on you.

283
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Starbuck, what's your position?

284
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,500
Primary and secondary hydraulics
are bent. I can deal with it.

285
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Starbuck, I got no visual on you,
where you at?

286
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Forget it, Kat. Scar's mine.

287
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't be an idiot, Starbuck,
what's your position?

288
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Yeah, you remember me, don't you?

289
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
You want my ass so bad,
you can taste it.

290
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,100
Well keep coming.

291
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,800
'Cause I guaran-frakkin-tee you,...

292
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,800
I will put you down
this time for good.

293
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,700
42 Hours Ago

294
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,300
One more.

295
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,300
Come on, Starbuck, let's go.
Get it up there.

296
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,700
Why are you pushing so hard?

297
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,700
Kat's just another hot shot
kid out to make her bones.

298
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,300
Like you were
before you met Anders.

299
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,100
You ever think about him?

300
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,100
What's the point?
He's dead.

301
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,600
Kara.

302
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,800
If you didn't think he
had a chance of surviving,...

303
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,800
why'd you promise to return
with a rescue party?

304
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,800
I thought I was...

305
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,800
I don't know
what I thought.

306
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,200
Captain Thrace. If Scar
jumps us out there, um...

307
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Keep your eyes open so he can't.

308
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Okay. But, if I screw up and he
bushwhacks me, what do I do then?

309
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,600
Come on!

310
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,900
They drilled this into you
over and over and over...

311
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,100
again at basic air combat.

312
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,900
I know, sir, but Scar's
something I'm not...

313
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,500
Scar is no different
than any other attacker.

314
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,200
He comes at you, turn
into him, get closer,...

315
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,100
pull the trigger.

316
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,200
Turn into him, get closer,
pull the trigger. Thank you, sir.

317
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,800
Don't run, or you'll die.

318
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Right.

319
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,200
What are you waiting for?

320
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,000
Nothing, sir.

321
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,900
Come here.

322
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,300
Come here,
I want to talk to you.

323
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,400
Now listen me,...

324
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,600
you're flying Duck's
wing today. Baxton, right?

325
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,800
Yes, call sign BB, sir.

326
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,500
Okay, that's one of our best
pilots that we got.

327
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,300
Okay, so just do what he says,
and you'll be fine.

328
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,800
Just don't let the raiders
get anywhere near the miners.

329
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,000
- Okay.
- Yeah. Thank you, sir.

330
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Okay, go get 'em, tiger.

331
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Starbuck.

332
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,900
That kid needs more than a
pat on the ass...

333
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,400
and a textbook quote
about tactics, okay?

334
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
You wanna be his wet-nurse,
go right ahead, all right?

335
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,800
Be my guest.

336
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,400
His jacket says he's a
qualified viper jock.

337
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,800
So, I either fly him,...

338
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,100
or I ground him and
then we go up short.

339
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,600
What's it gonna be?

340
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Your call, Kat.

341
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,500
Galactica, Starbuck.
Wilco return to base.

342
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,800
Roger, Starbuck.

343
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,700
BB, Duck.

344
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,000
Four raiders. From
behind the rocket, left ten.

345
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,100
Coming hard, looks like Scar.

346
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,900
Duck, BB. What do we do?

347
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,500
We don't have enough fuel to
mix it up.

348
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,100
We bug out, BB.

349
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,200
Let our relief deal with 'em.
We're going home.

350
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,600
Negative! Starbuck said to
turn into any attack.

351
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,400
Weapons hot!

352
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,600
You're bingo fuel. Don't
attack, you idiot.

353
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,300
Gods damn it, BB. This is
the frakkin' exception.

354
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,500
Abort and reform.

355
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,100
Duck, Starbuck. Position?

356
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,900
Four-two alpha.
Behind the big spud.

357
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,300
We need a hand,
right frakkin' now.

358
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,400
You're on your own, Duck.
Everybody's way out of range.

359
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,700
Duck, be there in six minutes.

360
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,400
Duck, Kat. Eight minutes out.

361
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Duck, they're on
my six, oh, my god.

362
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,800
It's all right, Jo-Jo.

363
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Verify pc-2 pressure zero,
throttles closed,...

364
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,800
oxygen, generator and master
switches off.

365
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,500
Check. Shutdown complete.

366
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Nothing you could do, Captain.
You were too far away.

367
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Nice work, Starbuck.

368
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,700
What the hell happened to BB?

369
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,400
What happened?

370
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,400
He did exactly
what you told him to do, Captain.

371
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,800
Him and Duck had bingo fuel
and a head start home,...

372
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,300
but instead the FNG
turned and attacked.

373
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,300
And Scar lit him up like a pinwheel.

374
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,600
Why'd he try to take Scar
on by himself?

375
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,400
Stupid idiot.

376
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
"Try to run and your
dead."

377
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,400
I heard you, you drilled that
into the poor moron's head.

378
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,700
You know what?

379
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,700
You and I both know that 99%
of the time that is the right move.

380
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Hmm, not this time.

381
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,500
You know what gets me?

382
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,600
I know that in two weeks,...

383
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,100
I won't remember his face.

384
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,100
I can't remember any of their
faces after they're killed.

385
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,300
No matter how hard I try,
they just fade.

386
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,900
I don't even remember
their names.

387
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,100
Names.

388
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,100
Oh, let's see, there was...
there was Flattop.

389
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,500
Who bought it on
his thousandth landing.

390
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,800
There was Chuckles.

391
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,100
Stop it, already.

392
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,700
Please, not funny.

393
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,600
- All right.
- It's not funny.

394
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,200
It is funny.

395
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,900
You know the President...

396
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,400
says that we're saving
humanity for...

397
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,400
a bright, shiny future...

398
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,900
on Earth.

399
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,900
That you and
I are never gonna see.

400
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
We're not.

401
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,500
Because we go out...

402
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,500
over and over again...

403
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,200
until someday, some metal motherfrakker...

404
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,100
is gonna catch us on a
bad day and just blow us away.

405
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,400
Bright, shiny futures
are overrated anyway.

406
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,500
That is why...

407
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,000
we gotta get
what we can.

408
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,300
Right now.

409
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,300
I'll drink to that.

410
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,300
To right now.

411
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,700
So, why don't we?

412
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Why don't we what?

413
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,000
Wait a minute.

414
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
- What?
- Wait a minute.

415
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,700
Ow. Hey, slow down.

416
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,600
Whoa, this isn't a race.

417
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,200
Kara,
what's going on?

418
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
What's going on?

419
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,400
What's wrong
with you, all right?

420
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,400
Okay, you know what? I don't
wanna know. I don't wanna know.

421
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,200
Hey, what about us?

422
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,100
There is no us, all right?

423
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,700
I just wanted a good lay.

424
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,300
There is nothing here.

425
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,400
Do you get that? Nothing.

426
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,000
Sure.

427
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
My gods.

428
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,200
Hey.

429
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,500
Well, that's just great.

430
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,300
Frakk or fight, huh?

431
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,900
Okay,...

432
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,000
maybe I am just a quick lay.
But, Kara, I'm also your friend.

433
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,300
I am hung up on a dead guy, okay?

434
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,500
And it is pissing me off.

435
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,500
And I don't know what I'm doing.

436
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,400
Anders, right? On caprica,
the resistance fighter.

437
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,200
Yeah, well, Samuel's
dead so what does it matter?

438
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,900
Oh, Kara please.

439
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,500
- I don't need your pity, Lee!
- For once in your life...

440
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,100
you haven't got my pity!

441
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,700
Listen, you are fine, you're
fine with the dead guys.

442
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,700
It's the living
guys you can't deal with.

443
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,600
There you are. I got visual
on you Starbuck.

444
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,600
I'm inbound
about 15 out.

445
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Now!

446
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,200
All right, Scar,...let's see
how much you like...

447
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,200
playing chicken when
you can't download, bitch.

448
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,800
How's it feel,
you bastard?

449
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,500
One of us is gonna have
to break away first...

450
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,500
and it isn't gonna be me!

451
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,900
Starbuck, wake up!

452
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,900
He's a machine,
he's not gonna break.

453
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,100
You're committing suicide, Starbuck!

454
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,700
3 hours ago

455
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,300
In two on two engagements,...

456
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,300
cylon raiders like to
isolate individual vipers,...

457
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,600
and then gang up on one,...

458
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,600
hoping to kill it before his
wingman has a chance to protect him.

459
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,700
Captain

460
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,200
Which is exactly what happened
to Jo-Jo 20 minutes ago.

461
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,000
Frakk me,...

462
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,100
was it Scar?

463
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,100
Bastard smoked Jo-Jo and
jumped away in less than 15 s...

464
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,900
before his wingman
could get a shot off.

465
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,900
And, where were you?

466
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,400
What?

467
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,500
Flight schedule had you flying lead
for Jo-Jo on that patrol.

468
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,900
So...

469
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,500
why'd you assign
Snake to take your place?

470
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Was it too early in the morning
for you, Starbuck?

471
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,000
What exactly are you trying
to say, lieutenant?

472
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,900
What I'm trying to say, Captain,...

473
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,200
is maybe if you weren't up
all night drinking,...

474
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Jo-Jo would have still been here.

475
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Give us the room.

476
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,300
What is it with you, Katraine?

477
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,500
Ever since I got back,...

478
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,400
you've been on my
ass like a bad rash.

479
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,800
You know, coming late for a
briefing 'cause your hung over,...

480
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,800
that's bad enough. But when
you back out on a mission?

481
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,700
I put Snake in my place because
I was in no condition to fly.

482
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,900
And I knew that.

483
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,300
You see, unlike you, I don't
take a bunch of pills,...

484
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
and then climb
into my cockpit so wired...

485
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,300
that I can't land the frakkin' ship.

486
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,700
Starbuck,...

487
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,200
you're an embarrassment.

488
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,700
You used to be the hottest
stick on the fleet.

489
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,600
Now,...

490
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,500
you're just
a reckless drunk...

491
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,500
that sends other people
out to get killed.

492
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,100
What're you gonna do, hmm?

493
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,100
What are you gonna do,
you gonna hit me Starbuck?

494
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,400
It's scares you, does it?

495
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Actually, no.

496
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,000
You're afraid most
of the time, Kat.

497
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,400
You're afraid that
you're gonna end up...

498
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,400
like that picture
of Reilly's girlfriend.

499
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,300
Some little,...

500
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,500
forgotten...

501
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,500
picture that nobody
really remembers.

502
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,600
You see, that's why you're
riding my ass so hard.

503
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,400
So, no one will
notice that Scar...

504
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,400
scares the living
crap out of you.

505
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Ten-hut!

506
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
What's going on?

507
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,700
Little tactical discussion, sir.

508
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,900
Well, it must
have been lively.

509
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,700
Right, I'm pairing you two up.

510
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,500
Kat, I want you to fly
Starbuck's wing out by the big spud.

511
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Sir, I...

512
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,900
I got a hunch a
couple of raiders...

513
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,700
are gonna try and
sneak through that sector.

514
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,700
So, I want my heavy
hitters out there to greet 'em.

515
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Skid's up in 49 minutes.

516
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,900
Sir

517
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Starbuck.

518
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Are you okay?

519
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,100
Colonial Mining Ship Majahual
29th Day of operations

520
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,200
Entering section two-five-nine.
Keep your eyes open, Kat.

521
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,500
This is where BB and Jo-Jo bought it.

522
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,700
Cassie, Cassie!
Maybe that was her name.

523
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,600
You know, Kat, I told you I
have no frakkin' idea,...

524
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,000
so give it a rest, all right?

525
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Whoa, hold up Starbuck.
Did you see that?

526
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Oh yeah!
It's gotta be Scar.

527
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Something's definitely wrong.
That can't be Scar.

528
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,700
Frakk! I'm hit

529
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,700
Scar got me. I'm hit,
I'm hit, I'm hit!

530
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Don't be an idiot, Starbuck,
what's your position?

531
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Now, you remember me, don't you?

532
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,100
There you are.

533
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,900
Got visual on you, Starbuck.
I'm inbound about 15 out.

534
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,100
All right, Scar, let's see how much
you like playing chicken...

535
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,700
when you can't download, you bitch.

536
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,200
How's it feel, you bastard?

537
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,000
One of us is gonna have
to break away first...

538
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,600
and it isn't gonna be me!

539
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Starbuck, I'm inbound your
starboard, Seven high at ten.

540
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Starbuck, wake up!

541
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
He's a machine, he's not
gonna break!

542
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,800
He's a machine,
he's not gonna break!

543
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,500
I got nothing to lose.

544
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,500
You're committing suicide, Starbuck!

545
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,200
I'm coming back.

546
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,900
I said it.

547
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,200
I meant it.

548
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Yeah, okay.

549
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Gods damn it!

550
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,100
I am gonna put
him right in front of you.

551
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:52,100
Do not miss him,
you frakkin' stim junkie.

552
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,600
And that's the way it's done!

553
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Yeah, let's go home, skipper! whoo!

554
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,700
Yo, Starbuck!

555
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,900
Hey, Starbuck!

556
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,900
My cup runneth dry.

557
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
Seems I recall someone boasting...

558
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,400
that my lips would
never touch this rim.

559
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,900
You earned it.

560
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,200
To BB.

561
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,000
Jo-Jo,

562
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,100
Reilly,

563
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,200
Beano,

564
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,900
Dipper,

565
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,000
Flattop,

566
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,500
Chuckles,

567
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,200
Jolly,

568
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,900
Crashdown,

569
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,600
Sheppard,

570
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,500
Dash,

571
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,300
Flyboy,

572
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,600
Stepchild,

573
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Puppet,

574
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Fireball.

575
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,800
To all of 'em.

576
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,800
So say we all.

577
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,100
I could have done it, you know.

578
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,800
Could have taken out Scar.

579
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,700
Head on pass.

580
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,700
Straight for him.

581
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,300
Just needed to get a little closer.

582
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,400
So, why didn't you do it?

583
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,000
Probably would have
died in the process.

584
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,900
The bastard was too good.

585
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,200
Couple months ago,...

586
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,900
I wouldn't have even
thought about that.

587
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,000
Would have just
gone for the glory...

588
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,400
hoping I could pull it out
of the fire somehow.

589
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,900
Quit kicking yourself.

590
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,200
You did the right thing
and called in your wingman.

591
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Okay?

592
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,200
Scar's dead.
You and Kat came back alive.

593
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,500
It's not why I did it though.

594
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,800
Can't get Anders out of my head.

595
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,800
Can't get over this insane
hope that maybe he's alive.

596
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,700
You got something to live for now.

597
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Not just die for.

598
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,000
He's down for the count. Uh!
