You've made
a remarkable recovery,
Madam President.

30
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:38,187
Remarkable indeed.
But now I'm playing catch-up.

31
00:02:38,187 --> 00:02:41,099
I'm afraid during my illness
I lost focus.
I let some things slide.

Well, that's behind us now.

and the people are worried.

be civilians

something to bitch about.

that in this case,
they're entitled.

37

Our inventory levels
are tight,
but they're not critical.

38

But all the way
across the fleet,

39
00:02:57,771 --> 00:02:59,819
people are reporting
shortages of essential goods,

40
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,251
and what they do get
comes at a high price.

41
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:04,446
They're turning
to the black market.

42
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:08,939
Last week, one of my aides
came down with pneumonia.

43
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,965
Billy had to trade liquor
to get the antibiotics.

44
00:03:12,779 --> 00:03:16,078
It's the nature of the beast.
People want what they want.

45
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:20,939
A few trades would be
one thing, Commander Fisk.
That's reality.

46
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,338
But I'm talking
about criminals

47

making outrageous demands
on the people.

48
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:28,046
So, bottom line is,
I'm implementing a new,
fleet-wide trade policy.

49
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:33,263
We need to be in control
of our supply chain,
not black market thugs.

50
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:36,843
I am hoping that I can have
the military's support
on this.

to run these dogs down,
you just give us the word.

whatever it takes
to get this under control.

It's widespread, inevitable,

and according to
President Roslin, illegal.

345

that you and Fisk
were in it up to your necks.

Fisk, maybe, but not me.

about the company I keep.

This is Fisk's log.

349

He says he made three runs
to Astral Queen
in the last 10 days

350
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:56,042
and I doubt it was to
discuss prison reform.

351

from me, Captain?

352

Why do you think
Fisk approached me?

355

To get a piece
of your black market scam.
To offer you protection.

356

You and your father are both
so blinded by the past.

357
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:25,275
Fisk's black market
was up and running
when he approached me.

358
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:29,098
He knew Adama would pick up
on his unauthorized shuttles,

359
00:26:29,098 --> 00:26:32,330
so he tried to force me
into taking over
the deliveries,

360
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:36,266
creating a firewall
between Pegasus
and the illegal shipments.

361
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:40,195
So you're trying to tell me
that you turned him down?

362
00:26:40,745 --> 00:26:42,076
At great cost.

363
00:26:42,986 --> 00:26:44,647
Check the fleet logs,

364
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,810
see how many supply ships
made stops at the Astral Queen
after Fisk's last trip.

365
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,004
The answer is none.

366
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,425
So if Fisk was
trying to starve you out,

367
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,914
why didn't you bring it
to the Quorum?

like the black market's
some sort of aberration,

you were smarter than that.

Twenty...

511
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:10,235
Why aren't you doing
any of these?

512
00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:11,910
No talking, no talking,
please.

513
00:40:11,913 --> 00:40:14,537
No cheating.
Hold it up, a little higher.

514
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,765
(CHUCKLlNG)

515
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:19,013
Sneaky.
Eight, nine...

516
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:21,043
Start again.
You aren't serious.

517
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:22,327
Zero...

518
00:40:25,641 --> 00:40:26,972
Well? No?

519
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,402
President wasn't
very happy today.

520
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:32,785
No.

521
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:41,179
Ever since you ejected
from the Blackbird,
you've been different.

522
00:40:43,657 --> 00:40:45,215
Harder to reach.

523
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:49,164
I'm just trying to understand.

524
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:55,802
Well, like you said, Dad,
we've all been through a lot.

525
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,222
Fair enough.

526
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:04,006
But you should have told me
about the woman.
