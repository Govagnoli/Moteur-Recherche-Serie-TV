4
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,395
BOOMER: It's probably
a Cylon itself.

5
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,133
More of an animal, maybe,

6
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,072
than the human models.

7
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,811
Maybe they genetically
design it to perform a task.

8
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,647
To be a fighter.

9
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:50,947

For no frakking reason!

10
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,781
Knock it off! Knock it off!

11
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,445
Get the hell
out of here now.

12
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,582
I am so sick of her.

13
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,288
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

14
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,420
No!

15
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,897

Kat's made the trap
a hundred times!

16

Give me those.

STARBUCK: What is this?
Oh, my God!

18
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,669
Stims.

19
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,570
And by the look of her
she's been taking them
by the handful.

20
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,367
I was burnt out.

21
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:20,279
I started taking stims.
I was so stupid.

22
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,072
As soon as I get back
to Galactica
I'll send a rescue party.

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,412
Yeah, right.

24
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,817
If I say I'm gonna
do something, I do it.

25
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:28,877
Count on it.

26
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,849
My kind of woman.

27
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,955
The Resistance Base Camp
is here.

28
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,222
Three hundred clicks north

29
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,059
of the only Cylon air base
in the area.

30
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,328
I respect what
you're trying to do here,
however...

31
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,562
We have a duty
to the people we left behind.

32
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:44,934
We understand that.

33
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,701
We have to find a way
to jump back to Caprica
and go get those...

34
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,866
Kara!

35
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,782
STARBUCK: (OVER RADlO)
Entering Sector 2-5-9.

36
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,258
Keep your eyes open, Kat.
This is where BB and Jo-Jo
bought it.

37
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,987
Come on out, Scar,
you ugly Cylon son of a bitch.
Let's party.

38
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,727
I don't think
he's going to RSVP, Kat.

39
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,933
He prefers surprise parties.

40
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,495
KAT: Yeah?
Well, he'll be surprised
when I blow his ass apart.

41
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,404
Yeah, that'll be the day.

42
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,941
Kassie. Kassie?
Wasn't that her name?

43
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,242
STARBUCK: Whose name?

44
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,311
Reilly's girlfriend.

45
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,376
You know, Kat, I told you
I have no frakking idea.

46
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,977
So give it a rest,
all right?

47
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,022
STARBUCK: Reilly's dead
for one very simple reason.

48
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,856
He couldn't control his fear.

49
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,462
KAT: Yeah, poor idiot
cut and ran.

50
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,331
Gave the toaster
a free shot up his ass.

51
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,497
Scar spooked him.

52
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,439
He saw
that motherfrakker's red eye

53
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,975
coming straight for him
and he panicked.

54
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:57,705
Reilly was a good stick.

55
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,008
A little short on guts,
but a good stick.

56
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,707
Beano had plenty.

57
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,541
Took Cally an hour
to clean out his cockpit.

58
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,413
Hey, does anybody
remember the name
of Reilly's girlfriend?

59
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,346
No.

60
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,921
Karen, I think.
Died on Picon. Karen?

61
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,657
No. Was it Kathy? Kathy?

62
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,530
You guys,
what does it matter?

63
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,260
Gonna hold
a little prayer circle,

64
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,199
good cry, the whole thing?

65
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,397
Actually, it does matter.

66
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:29,731
Hi.

67
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,835
Hey!
This is Ensign Baxton.

68
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,412
Ensign Clark.

69
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,907
And I guess
we're your new bunkmates.

70
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,012
Welcome.

71
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:42,153
We just finished
Viper training on Pegasus.

72
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,747
Ready to kick
some Cylon butt.

73
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,017
So was Beano.

74
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,993
Who's Beano?

75
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,955
Here.

76
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:59,332
Oh, Scar is gonna smoke you
like a fine cigar, my man.

77
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,634
Who's Scar?

78
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,174
DUCK: Not who, what.

79
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,871
The toasters' top gun.
Deadliest Raider
in the Cylon fleet.

80
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,644
Give me a break.
What, they're machines.
One's the same as the next.

81
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:13,083
Yeah, that's what we thought,
till Captain Thrace cut
the brain out of one.

82
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,447
HOTDOG: Scar's the best
they got.

83
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:18,423
Lot of pilots died
going after that bastard.

84
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,387
Why do they call him Scar?

85
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,123
Oh, you'll find out
soon enough.

86
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,799
He's got a taste for nuggets.
Easy pickings.

87
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,429
KAT: Whoa!
Hold up, Starbuck.

88
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,668
I think I got something.
The Big Spud. Lower rim.
You see that?

89
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,075
STARBUCK: Negative.

90
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,338
There was a time
you would have
noticed that before me.

91
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,940
Fine, you're the shooter.

92
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,580
KAT: You gotta keep up.

93
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,780
STARBUCK: Kat,
please, don't screw up.

94
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:59,526
So, how does Scar take out
an experienced pilot
like Beano?

95
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,392
He hides...
STARBUCK: He hides

96
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,564
behind an asteroid,
or the debris field
that you've ignored

97
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,502
because it looked like
a bunch of harmless rocks.

98
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:14,871
You see,
Scar doesn't like to fight
till the odds are on his side.

99
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,882
And then, suddenly,
out of nowhere, bam.

100
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,149
He pops out,
blows you to pieces.

101
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,351
And then jumps away
before you can return fire.

102
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,628
Well, if you ask me,
I think Scar's a coward.

and club him
over the head.

108
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,174

Scar understands that.

00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,236
They've just discovered
an incredibly rich vein
of ore.

176
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,511
Enough to build two entire
squadrons of Vipers.

177
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,279
I can't walk away from that.

178
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,819
What's the good news?

179
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,047
The Pegasus production team
has just turned out
its first combat-ready Viper.

180
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,622
We are beginning
to replace our losses.

181
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,755
Are they gonna be able
to replace pilots as well?

182
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,594
STARBUCK: Let's review
the tactical situation.

183
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,636
Four weeks ago,
our mining ship
struck pay dirt

184
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,136
on this asteroid.

185
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,672
A pile of strategic metals

186
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,639
that we need
to build new ships.

187
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,541
Since we're sitting ducks
until the miners
finish the job,

188
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,943
the old man has sent the Fleet
out of harm's way

189
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,913
under the protection
of Pegasus.

190
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:59,042
Our job is to stay behind
and protect the miners.

191
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,952
Unfortunately,
this star system
is full of rocks and dust.

192
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,616
Dradis cannot tell the rocks
from the bad guys,

193
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,126
so our only reliable system
of detection is...

194
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,661
Our eyeballs.

195
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:20,196
Which means we have
to put those eyeballs
way out there.

196
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:23,540
Split up,
cover a huge perimeter.

197
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,974
We'll be patrolling the area
in divisions of four

198
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,479
at these picket points.

199
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,210
Twos. We're going
in sections of twos.

200
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,377
Are you planning the ops
for me now, too?

201
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,982

202
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,715
(PlLOTS MURMURlNG)

203
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,826
CAG wants us to spread out
to control a larger area.

204
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,753
It's right here
in the briefings.

205
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,566
(STARBUCK CLEARS THROAT)

206
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,043
You're right.
So we do go in twos.

207
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,839
PlLOT: (WHlSPERlNG) Great.
You ask her to spread out...

208
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:06,112
Scar and his buddies
are out there,
looking for easy kills.

209
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,177
Let's not give them any.

210
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,654
This operation is vital

211
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,350
to the long-term survival
of this Fleet.

212
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,587
ADAMA: Yes, it is.

213
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,961
And we'll continue
to support it.

214
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,866
They're grinding us down
Viper by Viper.

215
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,563
Why have they stopped
coming at us en masse?

216
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,162
Is it because
we destroyed their
Resurrection ship?

217
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,037
Starbuck's working on that.

218
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,104
BOOMER: You know,
Scar has probably died

219
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,202
and been reborn
a dozen times.

220
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,745
You may have
faced him before.

221
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,510
So what,
Raiders reincarnate,
just like you?

222
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,821
Yeah. Just like me.

223
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,318
Great.

224
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,925
What a frakking world.

225
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,862
A Raider's much like
a trained animal,

226
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:56,197
with basic consciousness
and survival instinct.

227
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,405
You know,
but with the destruction
of the Resurrection ship,

228
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:04,068
when they die,
they're really dead.

229
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,469
So, they're not gonna
mount mass attacks

230
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,310
where they could have
major casualties.

231
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,848
Raiders reincarnate.

232
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,587
Makes sense, doesn't it?

233
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,157
It takes months for you
to train a nugget

234
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,987
into an effective Viper pilot.

235
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,156
And then they get killed
and then you lose
your experience,

236
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,924
their knowledge,
their skill sets,

237
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,396
it's gone forever.

238
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,094
So, if you could
bring them back and put them
in a brand new body,

239
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,760
wouldn't you do it?

240
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,499
'Cause death then becomes
a learning experience.

241
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:40,675
How... How many pilots
have we lost?

242
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,213
I mean, have you lost?

243
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:54,054
You know, there are times
when I look at you

244
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,223
and I forget
what you are.

245
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,294
All I see is

246
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,163
that kid

247
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,306
that spooched her landings
day after day.

248
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,909
The kid that was
frakking the Chief

249
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,472
and thinking she was
getting away with it.

250
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,917
Yeah, I remember.

251
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,887
You were
like a big sister.

252
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:45,738
Kara,

253
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,771
be careful of Scar, okay?

254
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,641
He's filled with rage.

255
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,081
About what?

256
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,151
Dying's a painful
and traumatic experience.

257
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,982
Every time he's reborn,
he's filled with
more bitter memories.

258
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,258
Scar hates you every bit
as much as you hate him.

259
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,268
STARBUCK: A Raider is
a squirmy son of a bitch.

260
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,240
You won't be able to
keep him in your sights
for more than two seconds,

261
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,407
so you have to deliver
a killing burst
within that time,

262
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,713
or he will turn
and nail you.

263
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,817
All that yanking and banking

00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,216
Thank you, sir.

346
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,815
Go get them, Tiger.

347
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,490
Starbuck.

348
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,230
That kid needs more
than a pat on the ass

349
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,827
and a textbook quote
about tactics, okay?

350
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:16,068
You wanna be the wet-nurse,
go right ahead, all right.
Be my guest.

351
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,838
His jacket says
he's a qualified
Viper jock,

352
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:22,642
so I either fly him
or I ground him
and then we go up short.

353
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,610
What's it gonna be?

354
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,876
Your call, Kat.

355
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:34,219
STARBUCK: Galactica, Starbuck.
Wilco return to base.

356
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,588
DUALLA:
Roger that, Starbuck.

357
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:36,821
DUCK: BB, Duck.

358
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,865
Four Raiders
from behind the rock
at left ten, coming hard.

359
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:40,956
Looks like Scar.

360
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,898
BB: Duck, BB,
what do we do?

361
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,404
We don't have
enough fuel to mix it up.
We bug out, BB.

362
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,702
Let our relief
deal with them.
We're going home.

363
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:52,642
BB: Negative.
Starbuck said to turn into
any attack. Weapons hot.

364
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,906
You're bingo fuel.
Don't attack, you idiot.

365
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,778
DUCK: Gods damn it, BB,
this is
the frakking exception.

366
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,511
Abort and reform!

367
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,652
STARBUCK: Duck, Starbuck.
Position?

368
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,620
Four-two alpha,
behind the Big Spud.

369
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,317
We need a hand,
right frakking now.

370
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,921
You're on your own, Duck.
Everybody's way out of range.

371
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,486
STARBUCK: Duck,
be there in six minutes.

372
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,430
KAT: Duck, Kat.
Eight minutes, out.

373
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,162
BB: Duck,
they're on my six!
Oh, my Gods.

374
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:18,567
(YELLlNG) Duck!

375
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,982
It's all right, Jo-Jo.

376
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,582
MAN: Verify PC-2
pressure zero,

377
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,856
throttles closed,
oxygen generator
and master switches off.

378
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,963
Check.
Shutdown complete.

379
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,332
Nothing you could do,
Captain.

380
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,836
Too far away.

381
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,367
KAT: Nice work, Starbuck.

382
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,503
What the hell happened to BB?

383
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,012
What happened?

384
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:05,341
He did exactly
what you told him
to do, Captain.

385
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,085
Him and Duck had bingo fuel
and a head start home,

386
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,952
but instead, that FNG
turned and attacked.

387
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,822
Scar lit him up
like a pinwheel.

388
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,827
Why'd he try to
take on Scar by himself?

389
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,589
Stupid idiot.

390
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,633
"Try to run
and you're dead."

391
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,863
I heard you.
You drilled that into
that poor moron's head.

392
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:27,432
You know what?

393
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,373
You and I both know that
99% of the time

394
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,637
that is the right move.

395
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,069
Not this time.

396
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,090
APOLLO: You know
what gets me?

397
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:53,664
I know that in two weeks
I won't remember his face.

398
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:58,837
I can't remember
any of their faces
after they're killed.

399
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,468
No matter
how hard I try,
they just fade.

400
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,676
I don't even remember
their names.

401
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,146
The names.

402
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:14,148
Well, let's see,
there was Flattop,

403
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,620
who bought it on
his thousandth landing.

404
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,057
There was Chuckles.

405
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,694
(LAUGHlNG)
Stop it, all right?

406
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,961
Please,
it's not funny.

407
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,023
All right.

408
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:32,070
It's not funny.
It is funny.

409
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:36,738
You know, the President says
that we're saving humanity

410
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,938
for a bright, shiny future

411
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,876
on Earth

412
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,811
that you and I are
never gonna see.

413
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:53,252
We're not.
Because we go out

414
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:58,591
over and over again,

415
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:04,161
until some day,
some metal motherfrakker

416
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:10,598
is gonna catch us on a bad day
and just blow us away.

417
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,847
Bright, shiny futures
are overrated, anyway.

418
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,024
That's why

419
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:33,520
we got to get what we can
right now.

420
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,662
I'll drink to that.

421
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,572
To right now.

422
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,273
So why don't we?

423
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,778
Why don't we what?

424
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,233
Hey, wait a minute.
What?

425
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,529
Wait a minute.

426
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,068
Ow! Hey, slow down.

427
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,686
Whoa. This isn't a race.

428
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,279
Kara, what's going on?
What's going on?

429
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,091
What's wrong with you?
All right?

430
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:39,525
Okay, you know what?
I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna know.

431
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,361
Hey! What about us?

432
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,534
There is no "us".
All right?

433
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,126
I just wanted a good lay.

434
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,968
There is nothing here.
Do you get that?

435
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,763
Nothing!
Sure.

436
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,974
My Gods!

437
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,408
Hey.

438
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,377
Well, that's just great.

439
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,184
Frak or fight, huh?

440
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:08,226
Okay, maybe I am
just a quick lay,

441
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,022
but, Kara,
I'm also your friend.

442
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,655
I am hung up
on a dead guy, okay?

443
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,826
And it is pissing me off.

444
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,267
And I don't know
what I'm doing.

445
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,169
Anders, right? On Caprica.
The resistance fighter.

446
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,375
Yeah, well, Samuel's dead,
so what does it matter?

447
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:31,109
Oh, Kara, please,
for once in your life...
I don't need your pity, Lee.

448
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,673
You haven't got my pity!

449
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,584
Listen, you are fine.
You are fine
with the dead guys.

450
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,918
It's the living ones
you can't deal with.

There you are.
I got visual on you,

let's see how much
you like playing chicken

456

when you can't downward,
you bitch.

457
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,580
(GUN FlRlNG)
How's it feel, you bastard?

458
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:19,181
One of us is gonna
have to break away first
and it isn't gonna be me.

459
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,523
KAT: Starbuck, wake up!
He's a machine!
He's not gonna break!

460
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,966
You're committing suicide,
Starbuck!

461
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,019
In two-on-two engagements,

462
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,322
Cylon Raiders like to isolate
individual Vipers,

463
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,120
and then gang up on one,

464
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:04,325
hoping to kill it
before his wingman
has a chance to protect him.

465

MAN: Captain.

466
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,984

to Jo-Jo 20 minutes ago.

00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,611
KAT: Oh, no.
DUCK: Frak me.

468
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,487
Was it Scar?

469
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,718
The bastard smoked Jo-Jo
and jumped away
in less than 15 seconds

470
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:31,126
before his wingman
could get a shot off.

471
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,427
And where were you?

472
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,461
What?

473
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:43,263
Flight schedule had you
flying lead for Jo-Jo
on that patrol, so,

474
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,708
why'd you assign Snake
to take your place?

475
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:50,308
Was it too early
in the morning for you,
Starbuck?

476
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,308
What exactly
are you trying to say,
Lieutenant?

477
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,480
What I'm trying to say,
Captain,

478
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,990
is maybe if you weren't up
all night drinking,

479
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,151
Jo-Jo would have
still been here.

with you, Katraine?

Ever since I got back,
you have been on my ass
like a bad rash.

for a briefing
'cause you're hung over,

that's bad enough,

488
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,425
but when you back out
on a mission...

489
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:50,400
I put Snake in my place
because I was in no condition
to fly and I knew that.

You see, unlike you,
I don't take a bunch of pills

491
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,147
and then climb
in my cockpit so wired

492
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,512
that I can't land
the frakking ship.

493

you're an embarrassment.

the hottest stick
on the Fleet.

Are you going to hit me,

most of the time, Kat.

00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,476
All right,
I'm pairing you two up.

515
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:42,281
Kat, I want you to fly
Starbuck's wing
out by the Big Spud.

516
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,753
Sir, l...

517
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,552
I got a hunch a couple Raiders
are gonna try and sneak
through that sector,

518
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:53,325
so I want my heavy hitters
out there to greet them.

520

Starbuck.

522
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,825
Are you okay?

523
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,829
STARBUCK: (OVER RADlO)
Entering Sector 2-5-9.

524
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:36,389
Keep your eyes open, Kat.
This is where BB and Jo-Jo
bought it.

525
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,994
Kassie. Kassie?
Maybe that was her name?

526
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,428
You know, Kat, I told you
I have no frakking idea.

527
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,700
So give it a rest,
all right?

528
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,708
KAT: Whoa, hold up, Starbuck.
You see that?

529
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,934
Oh, yeah, it's got to be Scar.

530
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,549
STARBUCK: Something's
definitely wrong.

531
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,356
That can't be Scar.

532
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,390
Frak! I'm hit!

533
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,626
KAT: Starbuck!

534
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,532
STARBUCK:
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!

535
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,407
Don't be an idiot, Starbuck!
What's your position?

536
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,838
STARBUCK: Yeah,
you remember me, don't you?

537
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,973
There you are.
I got visual on you, Starbuck.

538
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,574
I'm inbound
about 15 out.

539
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,211
STARBUCK: All right, Scar,
let's see how much
you like playing chicken

540
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,050
when you can't downward,
you bitch.

541
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,123
How's it feel, you bastard?

542
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,285
One of us is gonna
have to break away first
and it isn't going to be me.

543
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,421
Starbuck, I'm inbound
your starboard...

544
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,494
Starbuck, wake up!

545
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,867
KAT: He's a machine!
He's not gonna break!

546
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,936
He's a machine!
He's not gonna break!

547
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,807
I do this and you lose.

548
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,084
You're committing suicide,
Starbuck!

549
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,422
I'm coming back.

550
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,072
I said it. I meant it.

551
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,802
Yeah, okay.

552
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,100
Gods damn it!

553
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,353
I am gonna put him
right in front of you.

554
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,218

I could have done it,
you know?

587
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,400
I could have
taken out Scar.

588
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,405

straight for him.

to get a little closer.

died in the process.

thought about that.

for the glory,

You did the right thing
and called in your wingman,
okay?

Scar's dead. You and Kat
came back alive.
