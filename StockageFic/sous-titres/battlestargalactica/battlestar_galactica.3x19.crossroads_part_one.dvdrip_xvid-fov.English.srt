00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,436
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,592
<i>(Roslin) The Cylons have established</i>
<i>a human police force.</i>

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,559
<i>Hundreds of us</i>
<i>have been rounded up by the Cylons,</i>

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,189

<i>questioned, tortured.</i>

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,554
What's this?

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,076
This orders the executions
of all the detainees on the next page.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,469
- It requires your signature.
- <i>(gun cocks)</i>

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,835
Sign it! Sign your name!

<i>(gunfire)</i>

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,351
The Cylons knew
where we were gonna be.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,954
- l want to explain.
- She sold us out.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,352
You know what has to be done here. It
would be better for her sake if it was you.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,396
<i>(sobs)</i>

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,313
You're not afraid to represent
the most hated man alive?

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,109
l'd like to see my client.
If they wanna kill me, they'll find a way.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,349
No!

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,395
<i>(Adama) Baltar's defence will need help.</i>

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,790
Dad, why not me? l'm close to the case.
l've read the documents.

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,155
You're a CAG.
You're not a lawyer.

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,152
l will not allow you
to sit across the courtroom,

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,959
on the other side,
defending Gaius Baltar.

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,874
- Is that an order?
- l'm through giving you orders.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,551
<i>(child laughs)</i>

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,752
Hera?

25
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,111
Hera!

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,554
We got <i>Greenleaf</i> s FTL nailed down.
So fleet's ready to jump again.

27
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,835
How many more
before we find the nebula?

28
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,356
l'm estimating an even dozen.
We're getting close.

29
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,954
Still no sign of the Cylons.

30
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,679
No. We've left a trailing bird
at every jump site.

31
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,389
No DRADIS contacts,
no sightings, nothing.

32
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,948
Alter the orders of the trailing Raptor.

33
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,749
Tell them to remain six hours
before catching up with the fleet.

34
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,068
<i>(Gaeta)</i> Yes, sir.

35
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,151

You're up, superstar.

39
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,358
You know this game has frak all
to do with the real thing?

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,238
<i>(Skulls)</i> l didn't hear you
say that in the beginning.

41
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,949

- <i>(Seelix)</i> Had what?

44
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,712
That song.
You don't hear that song?

45
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,473
No. Come on.
You're up. Let's go.

46
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,994
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,636
Baltar was instrumental
in the Cylon attack on the Colonies.

48
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,314
The president wants him
charged with genocide.

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,631
l can't make it stick.
There's no evidence of his involvement.

50
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,750
The president saw him with one of
the Sixes on Caprica. Before the attacks.

51
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,356
You want me to put Roslin on the stand
to testify about her drug-induced visions?

52
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,432
What we want is for you to do your job
and convict him.

53
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,795
If you can't,
we'll find someone who will.

54
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,475
This is a courtesy meeting,
not a strategy session.

55
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,835
l am charging Baltar
with what l can prove.

56
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,152
l do serve at the pleasure of the president
and if <i>she</i> decides to replace me

57
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,472
l'm sure there are other lawyers
willing to take up the case.

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,154
If there are any other lawyers.

59
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,432
Dr Baltar?

60
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,596
Who are you?

61
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,636
Oh.

62
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,350
l'm under instructions from my attorney
not to speak to any members of the press.

63
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,878
Oh. No, Dr Baltar,
I... l want you to look at this picture.

64
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,279
This is my son. He's sick
and l want you to bless him.

65
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,351
Bless him?

66
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,633
- Guard! l'm terribly sorry, madam.
- Please.

67
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,077
l can't help you. l'm not God, the God,
or a god of any derivation thereof.

68
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,072
- Please. I...
- Sorry. l don't have any special powers.

69
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,994
- l believe in you. Just please take it.
- Well, that's very flattering.

70
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,029
- Please, will you just take it? Please.
- l'm on trial for my life. l need privacy.

71
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,190
- Please.
- l'll do my best.

72
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,068
- You can save him.
- Yeah. Mind how you go, now.

73
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,474
How many is that now?

74
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,236
Five. Not including the 30 or 40
who've written letters.

75
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,155
Well, l suppose it can't be helped.

76
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,392
Celebrity trials invariably
bring out the crazies.

77
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,869
So, you think they're crazy?

78
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,353
You see, l saw a woman in pain.

79
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,751
l saw a woman who can see you
more clearly than you can see yourself.

80
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,310
Even if they kill you,
your name will live on forever.

81
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,916
<i>(Racetrack) Galactica, Raptor 289. We're</i>
<i>clear and in position for rearguard picket.</i>

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,310
<i>(Tigh) Roger, 289.</i>
<i>Have fun watching our ass, Racetrack.</i>

83
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,070
Have fun watching
Baltar's ass get nailed.

84
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,910
All right, get comfortable.
12 hours and counting.

85
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,275
12 hours hanging out here
like bait on a hook

86
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,158
waiting to see if the Cylons
are still following us.

87
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,834
Just shut up and deal, OK?

88
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,315
How do we measure loss?

89
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,555
How do we measure loss?

90
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,993
We measure it in the faces of the dead.

91
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,153
The faces that haunt our memories
and our dreams.

92
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,995
How do we measure loss?

93
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,359
We measure it in our own faces,

94
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,908
the ones we see
in the mirror every day,

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,719
because it has marked each of us.

96
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,190
So, how do we measure loss?

97
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,070
When the scale of it becomes too hard
to absorb any other way,

98
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,991
we use numbers.

99
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,835
How many killed. How many maimed.
How many missing.

100
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,957
And when those numbers
become too vast to comprehend,

101
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,759
as they did two years ago,

102
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,035
we had to turn it around.

103
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,033
We began to count the living,

104
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,319
those of us who survived
to continue the saga of the human race.

105
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,316
44,035 -

106
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,155
the sum total of survivors from the Twelve
Colonies who settled on New Caprica

107
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,234
with President Gaius Baltar
as their leader and protector.

108
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,353
38,838 -

109
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,712
our number
the day after we escaped.

110
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,114
And the missing number?

111
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,192
The one that no one wants to face?

112
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,431
5,197.

113
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,754
5,197 of us killed,

114
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,957
left behind, or simply disappeared.

115
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,954
5,197 of all that remains
of the human race...

116
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,356
Iost.

117
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,196
<i>The citizens of the Twelve Colonies</i>

118
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,795
<i>entrusted their fate and their lives</i>
<i>to Gaius Baltar.</i>

119
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,440
<i>What we received was a reign of terror</i>

120
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,990
<i>that staggers our minds</i>
<i>and breaks our hearts.</i>

121
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,072
<i>Instead of governance,</i>
<i>we got tyranny.</i>

122
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,958
<i>Instead ofjustice,</i>
<i>we got oppression.</i>

123
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,510
<i>Instead of a president,</i>
<i>we got a murderer.</i>

124
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,071
<i>Today, humanity holds him</i>
<i>accountable for his crime.</i>

125
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,908
Gaius Baltar is not a victim.

126
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,673
Gaius Baltar chose
to side with the Cylons

127
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,515
and to actively seek the deaths
of his fellow citizens.

128
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,591
For that,

129
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,274
he must pay the ultimate price.

130
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,350
Your Honours, the defence would like
to change our plea to guilty.

131
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,714
What? Counsellor,
are you sure you want to do that?

132
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,110
No. But what choice do l have?

133
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,954
l mean, it's obvious my client is guilty.

134
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,591
He's a traitor, a killer. He's no better than
a Cylon, and what do we do with them?

135
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,708
- <i>(man)</i> Throw 'em out the airlock!
- That's right. Throw 'em out the airlock.

136
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,395
This man sold us to our enemy.

137
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,233
This man <i>is</i> our enemy.

138
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,791
And if there's one thing that's good
in war, that is right and just and proper,

139
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,110
it's slaughtering our enemy!

140
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,792
Getting some righteous payback!

141
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,000
What are we waiting for?!

142
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,275
Let's just kill him now!

143
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,469
It'd be easier, wouldn't it?

144
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,358
Simpler.

145
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,079
Justice of the mob.

146
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,355
It's what they want.

147
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,631
Especially her.

148
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,309
She's been wanting this
for over a year now.

149
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,191
Ever since he beat her
in a free and fair election of the people.

150
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,033
Now she gets the chance
to exact her revenge

151
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,274
upon a man whose only real crime
is bowing to the inevitable.

152
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,195
Gaius Baltar saved the lives
of the people on New Caprica

153
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,590
where Laura Roslin
would have seen us all dead,

154
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,118
victims of a battle
we had no hope in winning.

155
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,870
l don't know about you,
but l'm glad she wasn't the president

156
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,431
when the Cylons arrived
and said, "Surrender or die."

157
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,196
l owe my life to Gaius Baltar
and the decision he made that day.

158
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,395
And so does Laura Roslin.

159
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,475
- Yeah, like you'd frakking know.
- l know you wank it in your rack,

160
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,118
ladies' man.

161
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,839
You see, that's called self-healing.

162
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,954
- OK. Time check.
- <i>(beeping)</i>

163
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,636
Oh, we got something.
Lots of company.

164
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,070
Reading five baseships.
Crap! They're right on top of us.

165
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,709
- Frak. Frak! Incoming!
- The FTL's still spinning up.

166
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,190
We gotta jump.
Now, godsdammit! Now!

167
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,272
Search the entire fleet
for tracking devices.

168
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,797
It's possible they could have placed one
on a ship on New Caprica.

169
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,069
l think that we should ask the Six.
She may be willing to help.

170
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,594
Baltar's girlfriend?
Why would she do that?

171
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,355
Because she does not want to see Hera
go back to the Cylons.

172
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,752
You think that thing would stick
her neck out for some half-Cylon whelp?

173
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,718
l have a feeling
she'd lay her life down for her.

174
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,791
A feeling?

175
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,957
It's more than a feeling, all right?
Just do it!

176
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,235
It doesn't hurt to ask.

177
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,988
No.

178
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,868
Ask the prisoner if it knows
of any tracking devices in the fleet.

179
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,951
With pleasure.

180
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,630
The president,
gods bless her sunny, optimistic soul,

181
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,872
thinks you might wanna share
how your buddies have been tracking us.

182
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,556
So l'm here to ask the question
and listen to your lies.

183
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,796
In the last battle, we discovered your
fuel ship had a unique radiation signature.

184
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,956
They must have found
a way to track it.

185
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,993
What else do you know?

186
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,313
What other secrets are rattling around
inside that mechanical brain?

187
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,789
Don't be intimidated by him.

188
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,868
He's just using you
to exorcise his own pain.

189
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,395
Poor old sod.

190
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,472
He lost someone close to him.

191
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,836
You know how that feels, don't you?

192
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,710
l know a lot of things.
You wanna know one thing l know?

193
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,075
l know about your loss.

194
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,429
It hurts, doesn't it?

195
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,751
You wonder
how you can even survive it.

196
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,629
l don't know what you're talking about,
but it's not gonna work.

197
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,597
<i>(Baltar)</i> She was his world.

198
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,632
Of course, he only realised
when she was gone.

199
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,711
Did she know?

200
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,474
Did she know?

201
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,950
Did she know how much
she meant to you?

202
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,589
Or did you wait to tell her
until she was gone?

203
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,079
What?

204
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,993
But you made her think
that she was a burden.

205
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,196
A millstone around your neck.

206
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,277
But then, you humans always destroy
the ones who love you, don't you?

207
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,549
Shackle this thing.

208
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,991
<i>(lawyer)</i> Colonel Tigh?

209
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,719
Colonel Tigh?

210
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,394
Excuse me.
What was the question, again?

211
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,076
As the leader of the insurgency,
did you ever hear of an instance

212
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,470
when Baltar stood up to the Cylons
or tried to disrupt their plans?

213
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,473
Oh, no, never.
He never lifted a frakking finger to help us.

214
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,150
Ellen did more.

215
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,755
At least she was trying to...
<i>(slurs words)</i> to help us.

216
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,035
My gods, he's drunk.

217
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,633
Yes.

218
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,194
Yes, Ellen. Your wife.

219
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,790
Another victim of Baltar's Cylon allies.

220
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,269
Yeah, that's right.

221
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,839
Yeah.

222
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,351
Thank you, Colonel.

223
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,554
Your witness.

224
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,474
- What happened to his wife?
- She worked for a Cylon administrator.

225
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,028
Worked for him?
You know what happened to her?

226
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,908
No. No idea. l presume she died
in the exodus from New Caprica.

227
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,591
- Colonel?
- Hm.

228
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,591
You dislike Gaius Baltar because
you consider him to be a traitor. Correct?

229
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,240
And a coward and a mass murderer.

230
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,348
The suicide bombing
of the police graduation.

231
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,908
Baltar was the intended target,
was he not?

232
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,356
If he'd had the guts to show up that day
like he was supposed to,

233
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,318
you and l wouldn't be having
this conversation now.

234
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,315
So you ordered the killing of -
what was it? - 33 other men and women

235
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,075
just for the chance
to kill Gaius Baltar.

236
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,631
They were all traitors -
anyone who put on that uniform.

237
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,679
But, yes. He was the target.

238
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,912
What happened to your wife?

239
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,993
- Exception. Relevance?
- The door was opened on direct.

240
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,311
- l fail to see the point of pursuing...
- He's right, Admiral.

241
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,359
If it was brought up during direct
examination, it can be pursued in cross.

242
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,590
Overruled. Continue.

243
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,389
- What happened to your wife, Colonel?
- You frakking son of a bitch.

244
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,029
Isn't it true that she collaborated
openly with the Cylons?

245
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,190
That she actually worked for them?

246
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,874
She was faking it.

247
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,918
Making them think
that she was working for them.

248
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,151
l-I see. And Baltar,
he wasn't faking it. No?

249
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,071
That's right.

250
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,594
And you blame him for her death.

251
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,513
Have you been drinking today, Colonel?

252
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,236
l had a drink.
l haven't been drinking.

253
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,749
- You liked to drink with Ellen, l imagine.

Gaius Baltar didn't order

Colonel, that was somebody else.

260
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,391
Who was it, Colonel?

261
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,231
Who killed Ellen?

262
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,953
Come on, Colonel.
We're waiting. Tell us.

263
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,589
Who was it?
Who killed Ellen?

264
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,316
l did.

265
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,670
l did.

266
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,269
l did.

267
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,229
She was giving information
to the Cylons.

268
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,519
A lot of good men died.
She was my wife, it was my responsibility.

269
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,431
She did it for me.
That's what she said.

270
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,071
To save me from going back to prison
so they could tear more pieces off me.

271
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,355
So l killed her.

272
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,072
All because of that thing over there.

273
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:16,756
All because Gaius frakking Baltar didn't
have the guts to stand up to the Cylons.

274
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,753
Because he handed our fates
over to the Cylons,

275
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,229
l had to kill my Ellen.

276
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,278
So Gaius Baltar made you kill your wife.

277
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,351
That's why you hate him,

278
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,910
and that's why you'd say anything
to see him die.

279
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,560
You're godsdamn right, l would.

280
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,870
l would do anything,

It was after dark.

As it turned out, all of our names

Let us be crystal clear on this fact.

You are saying that the defendant,
Gaius Baltar,

ordered your execution

Yes. Indeed.
That's exactly what l'm saying.

304
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,790
We need to talk.

305
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,910
<i>(Baltar)</i> We need to find something

She's a fanatic, right?

- Have what?

310
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,672
He's right. You do know something. You
know something and you're not saying.

Enjoying yourself so far, huh?

316
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,436

the old man, defending a hated man?

317
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,559
- That's not why l agreed to do this.
- You just decided to stand up for justice

318
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,712
and those other things
we inscribe upon courtroom doors?

319
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,669
Yeah. That's exactly what l'm doing,
because l believe in the system.

320
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,356
l really believe. l even believe
that our lowlife pond scum of a client

321
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,557
actually deserves a fair trial.

322
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,755
The system requires
that you tell what you know,

323
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,116
which leaves you with
one of two uncomfortable options.

324
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,953
First, share the information,
and in so doing,

325
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,157
uphold the very principles
that you claim to hold so dear.

326
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,312
Or second, keep 'em to yourself

327
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,198
and prove once and for all
your only purpose here

328
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,068
is to jab your father in the eye and make
a mockery of the justice system.

329
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,037
Very, very nice.

330
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,430
But l know why l'm here. l don't need
to prove it to you or to anyone.

331
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,196
You're wrong. You need to prove it
to yourself. Or you'll leave that courtroom

332
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:18,276
knowing you kept a secret that could
have saved that man's miserable life.

333
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,157
Unless l misjudge you,

334
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,791
that's not something that Lee Adama
wishes on his conscience.

335
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,476
So, what'll it be, Major?

336
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,916
Sit on the sidelines mouthing pieties,

337
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,393
or are you gonna get in this trial
and give us something we can use?

338
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,673
There we go. We made it.

339
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,751
- Come on.
- <i>(groans)</i>

340
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,356
There we go. Come on.

341
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,432
- Come on. There we go.
- <i>Oh. (coughs)</i>

342
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,636
There we go.

343
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,874
<i>(mumbles)</i> You've had enough of that.
l know. l know.

344
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,520
- l'm all right.
- Attaboy.

345
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,591
Got some good news today.

346
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,151
We found the radiation signature
on the tylium ship

347
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,390
like the Cylon prisoner said we would.

348
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,075
Good. That's great.

349
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,153
It's being repaired as we speak.

350
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,519
Mr Gaeta estimates the fleet's
nine jumps away from the nebula.

351
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,230
Considering how long
it's gonna take to fix the tylium ship,

352
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,914
we're out maybe three days.

353
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,309
Three days out

354
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,393
from the next clue
on the road to Earth.

355
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,714
l can't smell her.

356
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,592
l can't smell her any more, Bill.

357
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,875
l kept her clothes...

358
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,910
but her smell is gone now.

359
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,671
<i>(sighs)</i>

360
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,158
l gotta go, Saul.
l'm really tired.

361
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,437
l'm really sorry about all that in court.

362
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,478
- There's nothing to be sorry about.
- l embarrassed you. Made you look bad.

363
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,314
You're my oldest friend, Saul.

364
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,635
You never embarrass me.

365
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,751
Get some rest.

366
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,358
Can the former CAG make
a radical suggestion to the admiral?

367
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,715
What if we don't fix the tylium ship?

368
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,918
- Repairs have already started.
- l realise that, but hear me out.

369
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,471
We're too close to the nebula to hope
the Cylons can't guess where we're going.

370
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:57,396
So if we don't fix it, if we send the ship off
on a new course with a couple of Raptors,

371
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,712
let her make a few jumps before rejoining
the fleet, it might throw the Cylons off.

372
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,473
It's a good idea.

373
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,350
l'll take it into consideration.
Is there anything else?

374
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,188
- How's the president?
- What?

375
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,070
Is she OK? She looked
a little rattled in court yesterday.

376
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,471
<i>(sighs)</i>

377
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,473
We can't talk about the trial outside
of court. You know that, or you should.

378
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,518
l know. l wasn't asking...

379
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:40,197
After what you did to Tigh, you're the last
person l would consider to confide in.

380
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,670
Me? l didn't do anything to Tigh.

381
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,433
He was drunk.
That's really not my fault.

382
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,035
You told Lampkin about Ellen.

383
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,271
l didn't even know about Ellen.

384
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,157
Yeah, right.

385
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,151
Are you calling me a liar?

386
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,879
l'm calling you a liar and a coward,

387
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,750
one who doesn't have the guts
to go after a man himself.

388
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,790
Instead, you hand
the shiv to a stranger

389
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,269
and let him stab Tigh in the back.

390
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,551
And for what?

391
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,428
The traitorous piece of garbage
Gaius Baltar

392
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,080
who doesn't even deserve a trial.

393
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,111
Are you done?

394
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,272
Yes.

395
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,555
Then so am I.

396
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,157
l will not serve under a man
who questions my integrity.

397
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,915
And l won't have an officer under
my command who doesn't have any.

398
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,674
l'll see you in court, Admiral.

399
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,800
- Let me do this.
- <i>(Baltar)</i> What?

400
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,075
Are you sure, Major?

401
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,869
It's "Mr" now.
And yeah, l'm sure. It should be me.

402
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,956
- You're not gonna let my security guard...
- <i>(Franks)</i> We're waiting, Mr Lampkin.

403
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,670
If it please the court, my associate
Mr Adama will question the witness.

404
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,149
His associate.

405
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,437
- The defence may proceed.
- <i>(Lampkin)</i> Thank you.

406
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,517
Aren't you alive today
because of Gaius Baltar?

407
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,754
l'm alive today because the insurgents
managed to stop the execution.

408
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,069
They saved you
from a Cylon firing squad,

409
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:36,996
but wasn't it Baltar who saved your life
when you were dying from cancer?

410
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,435
Relevance?

411
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,874
Um... Your Honours...

412
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,916
Hostile witness, Your Honours.

413
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,675
If the court would grant us
just a little latitude...

414
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,751
We'll allow it.

415
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,751
Thank you. Um...

416
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,396
Did Gaius Baltar save your life
when you were dying from cancer?

417
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,076
Dr Baltar's scientific knowledge
did save my life, indeed.

418
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,709
Can you be more specific? How did
he save your life on that occasion?

419
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:12,079
He injected me with the blood
of a half-Cylon, half-human baby.

420
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,550
And your cancer vanished?

421
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,119
Completely.

422
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,314
During your illness,
what sort of medication were you on?

423
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,039
l was taking
a lot of medications at the time

424
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,192
and l don't remember all their names.

425
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,350
Did you take something
called chamalla extract?

426
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,115
Hm.

427
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,519
Yes.

428
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,514
Isn't it true that one of the side effects
of taking chamalla

429
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,990
is a propensity
to experience hallucinations?

430
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,516
Yes, that is one of the possible
side effects of chamalla.

431
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,909
And isn't it also true

432
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,676
that the visions that you once described
as messages from the gods

433
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,910
were actually the result

434
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,992
of a pharmacological reaction
from taking chamalla?

435
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,834
The chamalla enabled me to see
things foretold by the scriptures,

436
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,992
things that will help this fleet
find its way to Earth.

437
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,992
- You of all people should know that.
- Your Honours?

438
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,392
- Where are you going with this?
- Just one more question, Your Honour.

439
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,792
<i>(whispers)</i> Please, don't do this.

440
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,871
Please.

441
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:49,756
Madam President, are you taking
chamalla at this time?

442
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,912
"Captain Apollo."
You remember that?

443
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,592
l always thought that had such a nice ring
to it. l am so, so sorry for you now.

444
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,997
Chamalla, Madam President.

445
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,914
Perhaps dissolved in your tea
to mask the bitterness.

446
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,434
Don't answer.
l'm putting a stop to this now.

447
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,478
If she is on drugs
it goes to her credibility as a witness.

448
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,152
Witness is dismissed.

449
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,028
Your Honours, l have to object.
He's trying to cover something up here.

450
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,634
One more word
and you'll be held for contempt.

451
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,871
- Admiral!
- l'd like to hear the witness answer.

452
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,951
As would I.

453
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,839
Madam President,
are you taking chamalla again?

454
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,835
Yes, l am.

455
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,914
No further questions.

456
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,675
Mr Adama, aren't you going
to ask me why?

457
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,999
- l'm sorry?
- Why am l taking chamalla again?

458
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,032
- It's not strictly relevant.
- Perhaps not to you, but it is to me.

459
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,158
Go ahead. Ask me why.

460
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,075
Finish what you started.

461
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,196
Why are you taking the chamalla again,
Madam President?

462
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,195
l am taking chamalla again
because my cancer has returned.

463
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,909
The fact that she's having hallucinations
is relevant to Baltar's defence.

464
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,230
That's the way the system works, Dee.

465
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,632
The accused has a right to challenge
the credibility of witnesses against them.

466
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,188
The system is broken, Lee.

467
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,193
The system elected that man to be
president and it's trying to let him walk.

468
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,511
That system doesn't deserve
to be defended, but taken apart

469
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,989
and put back together again.

470
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,437
You know, l wish...

471
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,314
- l wish l could make you understand.
- l do understand, Lee.

472
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,595
That's why l'm leaving.

473
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,430
No, you don't.

474
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,471
You frakking don't.

475
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,635
How long have you known
about the cancer?

476
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,678
- About a week.
- And how advanced is the disease?

477
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,275
Will you be getting more transfusions
from the half-Cylon donor?

478
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:13,275
This is detail l'm not going into now. l'll let
you know when we have a game plan.

479
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,477
How will the treatment
impact your duties as president?

480
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,950
- So far, it hasn't at all.
- Are you currently taking chamalla?

481
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,110
Don't answer that.

482
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,236
How often do you hallucinate?

483
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,392
- Enough of this crap. We're done here.
- Tory.

484
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,632
- You can go pick over another carcass.
- Tory! Come here.

485
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,632
l'll see you inside. Thank you.

486
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,917
<i>(laughs)</i> l'm sorry.

487
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,629
Temperatures are running a little high
in the fleet these days.

488
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,075
Who's next? Karen?

489
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,311
Madam President,
how long do you have to live?

490
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,957
How long do you have to live, Karen?

491
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,111
- You handled that well.
- You didn't.

492
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,910
"Pick over another carcass"? As opposed
to mine? That'll look good in the press.

493
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,389
I... l don't even know
why l said that. I...

494
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,313
What is up with you?
You've been off your game for days.

495
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,154
You're distracted, exhausted.
Frankly, you're plain obnoxious.

496
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,708
l just haven't been sleeping very well.

497
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,315
You need to pull it together
and focus on your job fast,

498
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,994
or l can find someone
who can handle the press

499
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,470
as well as pull a comb
through their hair once a week.

500
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,638
<i>(static/haunting music)</i>

501
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,714
- <i>(Helo)</i> Lieutenant?
- Oh, morning, XO.

502
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,957
Morning. It's just temporary.

503
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,508
The colonel will pull it together.

504
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,431
Right.

505
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,593
We're using the tylium ship as a decoy
to lead the Cylons along this course,

506
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,511
almost directly opposite to ours.

507
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,513
When they reach this point here
they'll recalibrate their FTL

508
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,276
and jump back to rendezvous with the rest
of the fleet here at the Ionian Nebula.

509
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,635
Any indication the Cylons are following?

510
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,349
Nothing yet. It would appear
they've stopped following us as well.

511
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,355
Our Raptors have yet to pick up any sign
of pursuit since the ship left the fleet.

512
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,908
How many jumps
until we reach the nebula?

513
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,115
Uh...

514
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,671
it's hard to believe,
but we're down to the last three.

515
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,318
Good.

516
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,233
Is there anything else, sir?

517
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,515
No. No, l was just, uh...

518
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,468
just remembering back on Caprica,
when the weather was about to change,

519
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,438
you'd... you'd get this smell in the air.

520
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,114
The sun could be out, not a cloud
in the sky, but you'd pick up this smell,

521
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,274
and you knew that, um...
something was just over the horizon.

522
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,753
Weather's changing, Felix.

523
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,229
We need to be ready for it.

524
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,555
There's a storm coming.

525
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,551
<i>(haunting music)</i>

526
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,555
It's in the ship.

527
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,917
It's in the frakking ship!

528
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,399
- <i>(talks gibberish)</i>
- He's doing it again.

529
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,072
- Thanks.
- <i>(laughs)</i>
