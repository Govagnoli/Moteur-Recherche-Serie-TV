NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,349
We lost her.

3
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:30,411
We did the best we could,
but she's dead. And that's
all there is to it.

4
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:33,867
It's you and me from now on,
no matter what.
Just like we agreed.

5
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,064
I just can't get
her out of my head,
our little girl.

6
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:39,129
She's so beautiful.

7
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:42,987
You understand, Maya,
that this adoption
requires absolute secrecy.

8
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:44,045
You have my word.

9
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:48,248
I'm leaving Galactica,
not you.

10
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:49,589
I don't know how we can.

11
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:52,512
I don't either,
but I know I'm gonna try

12
00:00:53,835 --> 00:00:55,029
if you will.

13
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,948
I'm Brother Cavil.

14
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:01,864
I understand you've asked
for religious counseling.

15
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:03,193
Let's talk about
what happened.

16
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:04,200
Chief?

17
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,525
Ah!

18
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:08,747
TYROL: I don't understand
how I could do that
to Cally.

19
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:09,873
BROTHER CAVlL: You think
you're a Cylon.

20
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,389
I am not a Cylon.

21
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:13,451
Well, of course you're not,

22
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:15,510
but that's what
you're afraid of, isn't it?

23
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:17,739
CAlN: We have our own
Cylon prisoner.

24
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:20,401
NO. 6: She's obviously
been abused, tortured.

25
00:01:20,587 --> 00:01:24,387

where you can stay,
where you will be safe.

Where I can look after you...

27
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:33,007
Vice President Baltar offered
the contents of this case
as proof of his sincerity.

28
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:38,881
GlNA: A nuclear bomb?

29
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,547
I'm afraid that
I have no alternative

30
00:01:41,547 --> 00:01:44,516
but to announce that I am,
as of now, a candidate
for the presidency.

31
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:46,923
What should be
important to you, personally,

32
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:49,323
is that Roslin's up
three points in the polls.

33
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:54,369

a large planetary body.

Hey, you know what this is?

35
00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:58,625
It's habitable.

36
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:01,867
We may have just found
a world that can support
human life.

37
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:03,198
ZAREK: We needed an issue,

38
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:05,394
something to set us
apart from Roslin.

39
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:08,593
This is it.

they're gonna chew us up!

fall back. Position
up this hill. Let's go!

unforgivable,

They're holding position,

They want some prisoners
for interrogation.

This is my meeting.

157
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:19,659
I wanted us to talk privately,
without the press
getting wind of it.

158
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:21,354
Please have a seat.

159
00:12:25,674 --> 00:12:29,906
Well, you must have
something very interesting
to say to resort to such

160
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:32,420
pedestrian methods
of deception.

161
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,176
The question
of permanent settlement

162
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:43,155
may well be
the most important issue
we face since the attack.

163
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,031
I agree.
Good.

164
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:54,293
The question should be
carefully studied before
making the final decision.

165
00:12:55,179 --> 00:13:00,139
And the middle of an election
campaign is hardly the time
for careful study.

166
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,136
Therefore, I propose a truce.

167
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:07,306
You and I will issue
a joint statement

168
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:10,400
declaring that
the question be tabled
till after this election.

169
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:14,190
We will both pledge
that regardless
of who is elected,

170
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,474
the decision will be made only
after careful deliberation

171
00:13:18,474 --> 00:13:21,136
involving all elements
of the public,

172
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,444
and after consultation
with the military
and the Quorum of Twelve.

00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,757
I know we've had
our disagreements,

175
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:38,917
but this issue transcends
personal disagreement

176
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:41,000
as well as politics.

177
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:45,211
I am appealing here
to your sense of patriotism.

178
00:13:53,194 --> 00:13:56,789
Let me tell you,
my sense of patriotism
is doing just fine.

179
00:13:56,906 --> 00:13:58,771
Thank you very much
for asking.

180
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:02,469
I see it
as my patriotic duty

181
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,415
to lead this fleet
to a new world.

182
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:08,635
That new world is
unquestionably New Caprica.

183
00:14:15,882 --> 00:14:18,646
But thank you,
Madam President,

184
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,326
for demonstrating to me

185
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:26,123
just how desperate
your campaign
for reelection has become.

186
00:14:26,123 --> 00:14:29,923
Were you with a blonde woman
on Caprica just prior
to the attack?

187
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:38,190
What?

188
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:39,276
She knows.

189
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:43,094
Were you

190
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:48,099
with a tall, blonde woman

191
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:52,202
in the Riverwalk section
of Caprica City,

192
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:55,035
just prior
to the attack?

193
00:14:55,306 --> 00:14:57,322
She can see
right through you.

194
00:14:57,322 --> 00:14:58,755
Get out of here now.

195
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:02,570
You'll resort to anything
at this stage, won't you?

196
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,514
I'm afraid my affairs
on Caprica, and who I chose
to consort with,

197
00:15:05,514 --> 00:15:07,498
are none of your business.

198
00:15:07,498 --> 00:15:09,591
You know, I saved your life.

199
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:13,526
I won't save
your political career.

200
00:15:20,874 --> 00:15:22,890
We are not moving down
to that planet.

201
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,084
If Baltar wins the election...

202
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:25,403
Baltar won't win
the goddamn election...

203
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:26,715
If he does, then what?

204
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,810
We're gonna just sit
on this ship and rot

205
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,368
while everyone else gets
to start a new life?

206
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:32,298
Ellen, my job is
to protect the fleet
from the Cylons,

207
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,731
and that's exactly
what I'll be doing.

208
00:15:33,738 --> 00:15:36,138
If you want
to move down there,
go ahead, be my guest.

209
00:15:36,138 --> 00:15:38,218
Go down and cat around
with all the men,

210
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:40,138
have yourself a good old time.

211
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:43,005
Saul, I want you.

212
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,668
XO.

213
00:15:47,722 --> 00:15:49,212
You got to be kidding me.

214
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:53,127
I'll be right down.

215
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:54,812
Starbuck's back.

216
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,201
I gotta get down there.

217
00:15:58,602 --> 00:15:59,660
WOMAN: Put him in here!

218
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,420
Hey, hey, guys,
take it easy with it.
Come on.

219
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:07,714
Am I good or what?

220
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,464
There's gonna be
no living with her now.

221
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,985
It's good to see you.
Welcome back.

222
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:23,975
Thank you, sir.

223
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,001
I brought some friends
with me.

224
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:27,506
I see.

225
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:30,213
Right, right. Um...

226
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,595
This is, um...

227
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:36,586
Wow. This is
Samuel T. Anders of...

228
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:37,712
I know who he is.

229
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:38,864
Damn good to meet you, sir.

230
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,618
Caprica Buccaneers.
That's right.

231
00:16:40,618 --> 00:16:42,017
A hell of a player.

232
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:44,042
Picon Panther fan myself.

233
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,873
Well,
we enjoy beating them, too.

234
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,531
It's good to have you aboard.
Thank you.

235
00:16:49,002 --> 00:16:51,800
I have news.
Good news, actually.

236
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:54,315
The Cylon occupation is over.

237
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,734
They left. They're gone.

238
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:57,770
What are you talking about?

239
00:16:57,802 --> 00:16:59,497
BROTHER CAVlL 2: It's true.

240
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:03,187
The Cylons have
left the Colonies.

241
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:06,538
They're headed
for greener pastures.

242
00:17:06,538 --> 00:17:07,527
Security!

243
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:08,961
What the hell?

244
00:17:09,514 --> 00:17:10,845
Code Blue!

245
00:17:12,138 --> 00:17:13,605
He's a Cylon.

246
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:19,143
Back off, Chief.
We've got him.

247
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,414
Well, this is
an awkward moment.

248
00:17:32,074 --> 00:17:34,542
Yes, he's right.
I'm a Cylon.

249
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,099
And I have a message.

250
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:42,437
So, take me to your leader.

251
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:44,901
Take him to the brig.

252
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:47,424
Take that to the brig, too.

253
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,226
HELO: What?
Admiral, she didn't know...

254
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:51,820
Don't even start.

255
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:54,315
Of course she knew.

256
00:18:00,874 --> 00:18:02,603
Welcome to Galactica.

257
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,370
Why the frak
didn't you say anything?

258
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:21,209
I don't know.
Maybe I didn't want to.

259
00:18:22,154 --> 00:18:25,920
Or maybe I wanted
him to come here
and blow up the whole ship.

260
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,983
Is that what
you're looking for?

261
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:31,180
Hmm?

262
00:18:32,138 --> 00:18:33,799
You don't mean that.

263
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:39,402
Sharon, we'd finally got
the Admiral to start
trusting us.

264
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:40,630
Finally.

265
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:43,160
And what?

266
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:48,187
They killed my baby.

267
00:18:50,985 --> 00:18:54,442
You think I care
about you or us

268
00:18:54,442 --> 00:18:57,172
or whether the Admiral
trusts me anymore?

269
00:19:20,938 --> 00:19:21,927
Hey!

270
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:25,801
Sharon, I love you!

271
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:29,601
And I'm not giving up
this frakking easy!
Not after everything!

272
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:39,546
Are you ready? All right.

273
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,895
Aah!

274
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:49,609
No, no, no, no, no.

275
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:50,666
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

276
00:19:50,698 --> 00:19:52,359
Hey, hey, hey, listen,
you don't have
to get me drunk.

277
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:54,634
I will sleep with you,
okay?

278
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:57,610
I figure I owed you one,
what with you saving me
and all.

279
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,237
Little slut.
Shut up.

280
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:07,705
Now you're gonna
play hard to get.
Yeah.

281
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,134
My hero.

282
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,561
Gods, I guess they'll let
anybody in here these days.

283
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:20,619
Hey.

284
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:23,430
Hi.

285
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:26,582
Welcome back.

286
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,069
Do you want
to meet my man?

287
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:29,541
Your man?
Hmm.

288
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:31,560
My personal property.

289
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:32,743
Right, Sammy?

290
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:33,904
Don't call me Sammy.

291
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,124
Oh!

292
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:37,898
How does it feel to be
my personal property?

293
00:20:37,898 --> 00:20:38,956
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

294
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:40,817
And before you answer.

295
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:48,833
He loves it.

296
00:20:49,002 --> 00:20:51,266
I bet he does.
I'm Lee, by the way.

297
00:20:52,105 --> 00:20:53,629
Hey, Samuel.
I'm sorry.

298
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:54,666
I've heard a lot about you.

299
00:20:54,698 --> 00:20:55,790
Pleasure. A shot?

300
00:20:55,818 --> 00:20:56,842
Sure, why not.

301
00:20:56,874 --> 00:20:59,177
Lee, when are you
gonna get yourself a girl?

302
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:00,872
I'm doing fine, thank you.

303
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:05,966
You're not still
frakking Dualla,
are you?

304
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:09,770
Thanks a lot.

305
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,330
I'm not one to like,
you know, lecture
or anything

306
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,442
'cause I'll do just about
anything to get into the pants

307
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:16,000
of some hot, little
young thing.

308
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,407
Hey!

309
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:23,273
Is that all I am to you?

310
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:24,934
Yes, but you love it.

311
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:27,668
That's right. I don't mind
doing charity work.

312
00:21:34,122 --> 00:21:36,521
You are a hot, little thing,
but you know that.

313
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:37,852
Thank you.

314
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:48,605
Where did he go?

315
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:50,631
(EXCLAlMS)

316
00:21:51,465 --> 00:21:53,660
I'm here to deliver
a message.

317
00:21:53,706 --> 00:21:57,540
After that, you can do
whatever you want with me.
I don't care.

318
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,234
Would you mind telling me
what's going on?

319
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:06,725
I'm not a frakking Cylon.
I'm not...

320
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:10,769
Oh. Well.

321
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,078
Okay, then.

322
00:22:15,562 --> 00:22:18,409
Sorry to bust up
your day, Brother,

323
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:20,425
but there's been
a change of plans.

324
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:24,521
It's been decided
that the occupation
of the Colonies was an error.

325
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:29,834
I could have told them that.

326
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:32,098
Bad thinking, faulty logic.

327
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,186
Our first major
error of judgment.

328
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,674
Well, live and learn.
But the war heroes

329
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:40,458
have managed
to swing opinion
over to their side.

330
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,652
What heroes?

331
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:45,872
A Six and an Eight.
One of the Eights
you know as Sharon Valerii.

332
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:49,000
Their voices carry
a lot of weight,

333
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:52,874
so when they started talking
about our mistakes
and our corruption

334
00:22:52,874 --> 00:22:55,146
and our need for
a new beginning,

335
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:56,807
the rest of us
listened to them.

336
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,936
You see, we're not like you.

337
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:02,146
We can admit our mistakes,
and we're not afraid
of change.

338
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:04,473
So you abandoned
the Colonies,

339
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,690
Ieaving behind
a devastated,
nuclear wasteland.

340
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,282
And we're supposed
to be grateful?

341
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:12,138
Our pursuit of
this fleet of yours
was another error.

342
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:15,369
That's two, for anyone
who's keeping score.

343
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,852
Both errors led to
the same result.

344
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,201
We became what we beheld.

345
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:22,843
We became you.

346
00:23:23,273 --> 00:23:24,331
Amen.

347
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:28,014
People should be true
to who and what they are.

348
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,107
We're machines.

349
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:31,817
We should be true to that.

350
00:23:31,817 --> 00:23:34,615
Be the best machines
the universe has ever seen.

351
00:23:34,826 --> 00:23:38,728
But we got it into
our heads that we were
the children of humanity.

352
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:41,258
So, instead of pursuing
our own destiny

353
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:44,318
of trying to find
our own path to enlightenment,

354
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,562
we hijacked yours.

355
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,393
You said it, Brother.

356
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,293
My mission here
is simple.

357
00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:53,980
I'm to tell you that
you've been given
a reprieve.

358
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:58,134
Cylon and man
will now go
their separate ways.

359
00:23:58,378 --> 00:23:59,709
No harm done.

360
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:02,230
No harm?

361
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,346
You completely
annihilated our race

362
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:08,439
and destroyed
our civilization.

363
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:11,050
Now, if you're gonna start
pointing fingers...

364
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,780
Where did the Cylons go?
Back to their home world?

365
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:16,778
Well, I'd rather not
say just now.

366
00:24:16,778 --> 00:24:19,786
Let's just say
we have other plans.

367
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:23,483
New marching orders
by your one true god?

368
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:25,426
There is no god.

369
00:24:25,802 --> 00:24:28,490
Supernatural divinities
are the primitive's answer

370
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,666
for why the sun
goes down at night.

371
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,353
At least that's what
we've been telling
the others for years.

372
00:24:33,353 --> 00:24:36,254
We can't really prove it
one way or the other,
of course.

373
00:24:37,994 --> 00:24:39,850
You know a way to prove it?

374
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,253
Throw them both out
the airlock. Let them see if
there really is a Cylon god.

375
00:25:30,282 --> 00:25:32,682
Ballots from the Adriatic.
D?

376
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:34,988
Right. This way.

377
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:56,927
MCMANUS: (ON RADlO)
It has been an exciting day.

378
00:25:56,937 --> 00:25:59,599
The election has been
a real rollercoaster ride.

379
00:25:59,753 --> 00:26:02,153
The polls now have
been closed
for about five hours,

380
00:26:02,154 --> 00:26:04,746
results have come in,
and it's been
a see-saw battle,

381
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:06,889
back and forth between
the presidential candidates.

382
00:26:06,889 --> 00:26:09,929
So, all night long,
as we of course suspected it would be.

383
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:13,034
We're still waiting
for a few more numbers
to come in now,

384
00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:15,146
from the counting room
of Galactica,

385
00:26:15,146 --> 00:26:17,930
which, I must tell you,
as some of you may know,

386
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,362
was the source of a bit
of a controversy yesterday.

387
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:22,953
Councilman Zarek
had filed a formal complaint

388
00:26:22,953 --> 00:26:25,866
against the use of military...

389
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:28,201
The military involvement
in the election process.

390
00:26:28,201 --> 00:26:30,825
Now, it's just reached...
A compromise was just reached

391
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:32,809
Iate yesterday,
allowing Galactica

392
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:35,114
to provide security
for the balloting,

393
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:38,409
as well as
civilians to oversee

394
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:40,809
and then to monitor
the situation.

395
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:44,714
Yes, okay.
Now we have some more votes
coming in here.

396
00:26:44,714 --> 00:26:49,706
Still not done,
but what we have so far is
6, 282 more votes for Baltar,

397
00:26:49,706 --> 00:26:51,367
which puts his total now to

398
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:54,218
21,569.

399
00:26:54,218 --> 00:26:55,310
Is that... Is that correct?

400
00:26:55,337 --> 00:26:56,634
And we also have Roslin.

401
00:26:56,649 --> 00:27:01,052
Her total now is at 17,754.

402
00:27:01,193 --> 00:27:06,538
We've had 2,981 more votes
come in for Roslin
at this time.

403
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:09,803
So that is how things
are looking at this point.

404
00:27:09,866 --> 00:27:14,326
We'll continue to bring you
up-to-the-minute coverage
as the count progresses.

405
00:27:31,498 --> 00:27:32,931
Yeah, it's me.

406
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,777
Is this a secure line?

407
00:27:37,418 --> 00:27:38,510
Okay.

408
00:27:38,793 --> 00:27:41,694
There are only five ships
left to report in.

409
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,173
We need to move now.

410
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:46,575
I'll take care of it.

411
00:27:51,113 --> 00:27:52,444
Lieutenant.

412
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:54,922
I'll be right back.

413
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:05,697
Are those the ballots
from the Zephyr?

414
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:07,071
Yes, sir.

415
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:08,605
All right,
we'll take it from here.

416
00:28:08,617 --> 00:28:10,346
We were told to take these
to the ballot room, sir.

417
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:13,042
Counting
has already begun.
We'll take it from here.

418
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:53,239
GAETA: Right there, please.

419
00:29:15,817 --> 00:29:17,284
Last one.

420
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,889
We have some
more results that
have come in here now.

421
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:40,220
And, uh...

422
00:29:42,953 --> 00:29:47,849
Wow, okay.
8,593 for Roslin,

423
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:50,875
now, which puts her
over the top.

424
00:29:51,145 --> 00:29:54,249
That's 24,265
for Laura Roslin.

425
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:55,375
Is that correct?

426
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:59,839
And 22,366 for Gaius Baltar.

427
00:29:59,946 --> 00:30:02,665
We're gonna check these again
because that has put her
over the top.

428
00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:03,893
She... She has done it.

429
00:30:03,913 --> 00:30:05,505
She has retained
the Presidency

430
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:09,194
in an improbable comeback
in the final hours
of the campaign.

431
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:13,193
Again we will, of course,
like to check those numbers
if we could,

432
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:17,001
but it appears
that Laura Roslin has
retained the Presidency

433
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:20,905
in defiance of the polls,
the pundits and the purveyors
of gloom and doom.

434
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:23,946
But I've never seen
a political race
end like this,

435
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:25,470
but it has just happened.

436
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:27,657
I'm James McManus.
We'll check those numbers

437
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:30,148
and we'll get back to you
very shortly. Thank you.

438
00:30:33,673 --> 00:30:35,868
I've seen
a lot of elections, Gaius.

439
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:40,797
Most honest, a few fixed.

440
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:44,457
And you can always tell
the fixed ones
because they don't make sense.

441
00:30:45,322 --> 00:30:47,449
And this doesn't make sense.

442
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,574
Laura Roslin is many things,

443
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,614
but she's not corrupt.

444
00:30:57,993 --> 00:30:59,790
And she's not dishonest.

445
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:03,868
It's over.

446
00:31:08,137 --> 00:31:09,900
Congratulations,
Madam President.

447
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,482
Well, thank you.

448
00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:15,597
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way,

449
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:17,768
but are you as shocked
as I am?

450
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:21,631
I'm relieved.

451
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:23,787
Well, you don't sound it.

452
00:31:25,353 --> 00:31:26,843
I'm just tired.

453
00:31:26,858 --> 00:31:29,053
It's been a long campaign.

454
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:33,745
Colonel?

455
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:35,760
May I speak to you
for a moment?

456
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,100
What's up?

457
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:47,440
Sir, I'm afraid these ballots
from the Zephyr are wrong.

458
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,281
What the hell
are you talking about?

459
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:53,353
Dr. Baltar's name
is spelled correctly
on these ballots.

460
00:31:53,353 --> 00:31:55,113
But this morning
the Zephyr called me

461
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,444
and told me their ballots
had a misprint.

462
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:58,729
They misspelled Baltar's
first name.

463
00:31:58,729 --> 00:32:00,356
We didn't have time
to print new ballots,

464
00:32:00,361 --> 00:32:03,797
so I told them on my authority
to go ahead, use them anyway.

465
00:32:04,873 --> 00:32:06,825
Baltar's name is spelled
correctly here.

466
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,292
So they couldn't have come
from the Zephyr.

467
00:32:08,297 --> 00:32:09,594
They're frauds.

468
00:32:10,953 --> 00:32:13,673
Now, there's a complete chain
of custody

469
00:32:13,673 --> 00:32:15,721
from the Zephyr,
all the way into this room.

470
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:18,345
So someone in the chain
is either the perpetrator

471
00:32:18,345 --> 00:32:19,869
or at least,
a willing ally in...

472
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:21,280
Thanks for bringing this
to my attention.

473
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:22,916
I'll take care of it
from here.

474
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:25,717
Yes, sir.

475
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:28,937
We should at least notify
the civilian observers

476
00:32:28,937 --> 00:32:30,370
and the press
that these ballots will...

477
00:32:30,377 --> 00:32:32,675
I said I'll take care
of it from here.

478
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:35,767
Yes, sir.

479
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:53,577
Madam President,
you should celebrate.

480
00:32:53,577 --> 00:32:56,137
It's a great victory
and you've earned it.

481
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:58,618
Excuse me.

482
00:32:58,825 --> 00:33:01,521
Admiral, we'll talk later.
Thank you.

483
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:02,857
Adama.

484
00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:04,379
Yes, sir,
this is Lieutenant Gaeta.

485
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:06,347
Sir,

486
00:33:07,273 --> 00:33:08,433
I don't know how
to say this...

487
00:33:08,457 --> 00:33:10,185
Fast and straight,
I'd advise.

488
00:33:10,185 --> 00:33:11,174
Yes, sir.

489
00:33:11,753 --> 00:33:15,529
Admiral, I believe
that Colonel Tigh is
involved in a conspiracy

490
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:18,089
to rig the election
for President Roslin.

491
00:33:26,665 --> 00:33:30,032
When I confronted the Colonel,
he admitted his guilt.

492
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:35,337
He said he acted in collusion
with your campaign manager,

493
00:33:35,337 --> 00:33:36,736
Tory Foster.

494
00:33:37,545 --> 00:33:40,605
Saul said Tory
had contacted him
a few days ago.

495
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:45,257
He did it because he felt
that Baltar as president
would be a disaster.

496
00:33:45,353 --> 00:33:47,082
I said I agree,

497
00:33:47,977 --> 00:33:50,275
but that what he had done
was illegal.

498
00:33:50,953 --> 00:33:53,193
A judicial tribunal
may have to be convened.

499
00:33:53,193 --> 00:33:54,285
Stop.

500
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,703
I gave Tory the go ahead.

501
00:34:00,137 --> 00:34:02,793
I didn't know exactly
what she was planning.

502
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:05,577
I certainly didn't know
about Colonel Tigh.
Oh, my Gods.

503
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:09,911
But I did know that
she was planning
to fix the vote.

504
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,265
You tried
to steal an election?

505
00:34:12,265 --> 00:34:13,493
Yes, I did.

506
00:34:15,497 --> 00:34:17,124
And I got caught.

507
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:20,385
But Gaius Baltar

508
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:24,169
cannot become President
of the Colonies, Bill.

509
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:25,932
It cannot happen.

510
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:27,407
Laura,

511
00:34:28,873 --> 00:34:30,500
I don't want him
as President either, but...

512
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:32,473
He's working
with the Cylons.

513
00:34:34,345 --> 00:34:38,475
I saw him just before
the attack on Caprica

514
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:42,089
with a copy
of the tall, blonde
Cylon woman.

515
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:44,745
The same model
who accused Baltar
of treason

516
00:34:44,745 --> 00:34:46,665
before disappearing
from Galactica.

517
00:34:46,665 --> 00:34:48,393
What the hell
are you saying?

518
00:34:48,393 --> 00:34:50,409
Why didn't you
say something before this?

519
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:53,161
Because I didn't remember

01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:24,890
I surrender.

871
01:04:06,951 --> 01:04:09,215
What do you want to do now,
Captain?

872
01:04:11,911 --> 01:04:14,106
The same thing we always do.

873
01:04:15,527 --> 01:04:17,256
Fight them until we can't.

874
01:04:57,415 --> 01:05:00,263
And now a moment of Zen,
as we reflect on Season 6.

875
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:01,594
Oh, my God!
Pay back.
