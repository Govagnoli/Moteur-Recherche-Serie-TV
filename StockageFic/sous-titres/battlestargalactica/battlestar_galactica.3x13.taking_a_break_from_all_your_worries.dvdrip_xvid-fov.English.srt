Oh, no, look, l'm sorry,

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,952
So l won't divorce and you won't cheat.

4

- So where does that leave us?
- Trapped.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,035
What's this?

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,476
The summary executions of all
the detainees listed on the next page.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,709
It needs your signature.

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,031
<i>(Gaeta)</i> This is a death warrant.

<i>(Number Six)</i> If you are a Cylon, these

Her destiny will part company from yours.
She's not the Chosen One, you are.

Dear God, tell me the truth before l die.
Am l a Cylon?

Welcome home, Mr President.

<i>(Baltar and Number Six sing lullaby)</i>

17
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,473
Sorry. Improvising.

18
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,872
You're doing the right thing, Gaius.

19
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,837
- Gaius...
- What?

20
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,397
Yes.

21
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,435
Yes.

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,151
Wake up!

Wait.

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,671
Wait a minute.

26
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,240
l need some time to think this through.

27
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,311
Too late, Gaius.

28
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,909
It's time to learn the truth.

29
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,789
- Sergeant.
- Sorry, sir.

30
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,395
No one can speak to the prisoner
without presidential authorisation.

31
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,393
- l already have authorisation.
- Step back, sir.

32
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,039
That's it, Gaius.
Deep breaths.

33
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,151
Deep breaths.

34
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,997
That's it, Gaius.
Deep breaths.

35
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,470
Deep breaths.

36
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,109
The first time's the hardest.
You're doing wonderfully.

37
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,431
l'm alive.

38
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,395
l'm alive.

39
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,031
Thank God! l'm alive!

40
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,237
l always told you to have faith.

41
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,750
Then no one was betrayed.

42
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,594
l was never one of them.

43
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,596
l <i>am</i> one of you.

44
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,148
Is that what you think, Gaius?

45
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,033
l knew it. l knew it.

46
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,391
l always knew l was different.

47
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,869
Special.

48
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,758
Maybe a little gifted.

49
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,997
Ow! That's a bit rough, actually.
That hurt.

50
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,474
- What's wrong?
- <i>You're</i> wrong, Gaius.

51
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,314
You're not Cylon, you're human.
And you're dead!

52
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,234
He's alive.

53
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,311
l'll get Cottle.

54
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,678
l'm just saying,
you're gonna be surprised.

55
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,836
- Yeah, well, Major...
- Right this way.

56
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,673
"Joe's"?
Well, l think l've seen a bar before.

57
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,035
<i>(laid-back music plays)</i>

58
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,879
- You've got to be frakking kidding me.
- Come on.

59
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,031
OK, this way.
Hey, Joe!

60
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,829
Chief Tyrol. Welcome.
Any friend of the major's a friend of mine,

61
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,390
which means you get the good stuff.

62
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,836
Thank you very much, don't mind if l do.
Not going home tonight, so...

63
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,992
Why, did you and Cally have a fight?

64
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,509
You didn't hear us?
l figured we could've sold tickets.

65
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,875
Uh...

66
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,520
To marriage: why we build bars.

67
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,631
Yeah.

68
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,948
Joe!

69
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,873
<i>(Cottle)</i> l warned about
the dangers of sleep deprivation.

70
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,430
Psychosis can make a man
do strange things.

71
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,876
And Baltar's little hunger strike
is not helping, either.

72
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,349
Bastard wants to die that bad,
l say let him.

73
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,476
Bottom line, we need Baltar to talk.

74
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,233
If the other Cylons saw
the same symbols that we saw,

75
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,915
they could be on their way to Earth
and setting up an ambush by now.

76
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,195
l bet after tonight
he'll be more willing.

77
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,556
Doc, wait an hour or two.
l want him cogent.

78
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,029
l also don't want him to starve.

79
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,595
- What do you expect me to do about it?
- l expect you to make sure he eats.

80
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,796
<i>(clears throat)</i>

81
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,271
l'll see about putting
security cameras in that cell.

82
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,351
Um, Mr Gaeta...

83
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,791
What exactly were you doing going to see
Dr Baltar in the middle of the night?

84
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,632
Um...

85
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,157
l couldn't sleep and l guess l thought
he might be willing to talk to me.

86
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,949
We understand.
Just leave his interrogation to us.

87
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,395
Of course.

88
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,431
You're up late.

89
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,312
- You know, the Chief says hi.
- He one of your new drinking buddies?

90
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,749
l would invite you, but you made it
very clear it's not your thing.

91
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,152
No, it's your thing,
and that's not what l was asking.

92
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,310
l got a briefing at 0500.

93
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,799
- Are we still on for dinner tomorrow?
- <i>(sighs)</i> Yeah.

94
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,110
- l already switched watches.
- Sure.

95
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,716
Just be nice for a husband and wife
to occasionally...

96
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,751
Forget it.

97
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,395
<i>(Roslin)</i> Thank you.

98
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,755
You can leave the door open.

99
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,118
Hi.

100
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,749
Touché, Madam President.

101
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,834
l have no wish to see you suffer.

102
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,911
Really?

103
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,069
l've just had the pleasure of having a tube
forced up my nose and down my throat.

104
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,993
Everybody's got to eat.

105
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,275
It's for your own good.

106
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,955
And it's nothing compared to what
many of our people were subjected to

107
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,713
in your jail cells on New Caprica.

108
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,637
Not my jails... the Cylons'.

109
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,235
It's an academic distinction
at this point, Doctor.

110
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,199
None of us are enjoying this, so why
don't you just tell me what l need to know

111
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,910
and your suffering will come to an end,
and l promise you this.

112
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,675
l know nothing about the Cylon plans
or their whereabouts.

113
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,399
l witnessed nothing in that temple.

114
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,632
My information on Cylon intelligence is...

115
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,760
is limited, to say the least.

116
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,109
Prior to the attack, did you have
high-level security clearance?

117
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,430
- Yes. So what?
- Did you tell anybody about it?

118
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,875
Did you let someone
into the defence mainframe?

119
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,599
- Careful, Gaius.
- The blonde woman l saw you with

120
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,875
on Caprica, just prior to the attack?

121
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,353
She'll flush you out of an airlock
without a moment's hesitation.

122
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,070
Unless, of course,
that prospect no longer frightens you.

123
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,151
<i>(exhales)</i>

124
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,790
Lies.

125
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,871
All lies.

126
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,472
A rehash of all the other old lies.

127
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,115
l did not collude

128
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,839
in the genocide of my own people.

129
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,672
Devlin and Maryanne McAIlister
and their son and daughter.

130
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,228
A family of four gunned down
in their own home

131
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,914
- on suspicion of insurgency.
- l am not responsible.

132
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,992
l just wondered if you recognised
even one of these faces.

133
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,232
Did any image get through to you on the
rare occasion when you ventured out...

134
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,517
- l am not responsible...
- ...from behind your sandbags to see...

135
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,513
- <i>...any</i> more than l am for the genocide.
- ...what was happening to your people?

136
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,388
<i>Your</i> people! l need to know, now.

137
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,552
Colonel Tigh, get in here!
Get this man out of here.

138
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,790
This is not about uncovering a threat.

139
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,317
- Toss him out of the nearest airlock.
- This is about your pound of flesh!

140
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,153
- Get in here! Get rid of him!
- What about my fair trial?

141
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,119
- Take him out of here.
- Get your frakking hands off me!

142
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:36,070
l demand a fair trial! l am a citizen
of the Colonies and l demand a fair trial!

143
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,673
A fair trial!

144
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,515
Take a good look. Just a fraction
of the people you sent to their deaths.

145
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,398
Rather fitting they should see
you take your last breaths.

146
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,755
Stop! Stop, wait!

147
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,353
- Stop!
- What? What?

148
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,908
You asked if l know these people.
l know that man.

149
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,594
Show me, show me!
Let him go, let him go!

150
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,274
- Keep your guns on him!
- This man.

151
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,272
His name was Adrien Bauer,
my lab assistant on Caprica.

152
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,590
- So what?
- He was Gemonese. l got him a visa.

153
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,195
l introduced him to his wife.
l am godfather to their first child.

154
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,236
l wouldn't harm this man or his family.

155
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,599
Or anybody's family! l am not a murderer!
l am innocent! Why won't you believe me?

156
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,639
- Get him! Take him out of here!
- Is this what you call Colonial justice?

157
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,635
What did l ever do for you, huh?
Only save your bleeding life! Argh!

158
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,637
You gave it your best shot.
l understand.

159
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,429
Yeah, the bastard still wouldn't talk.

160
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,308
Either he's got more stones
than l gave him credit for, or...

161
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,472
Or he knew you were bluffing.

162
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,074
Well...

163
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,310
what do we do with him now?

164
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,311
There is one thing.

165
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,830
Admiral?

166
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,272
The military once ran an experimental
interrogation programme involving drugs.

167
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,828
Hallucinogens, specifically.

168
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,914
The goal of the programme was
to create a state of anxiety so intense

169
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,393
that the subject believed
that their very survival was at stake.

170
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,870
The interrogators exploit that,

171
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,193
become less an adversary and more
a lifeline - at least, that was the idea.

172
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,114
It might get Baltar to talk,
tell us what the Cylons know about Earth.

173
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,797
But it's dangerous, especially
for someone in Baltar's condition.

174
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,156
Are you telling me we have these drugs
aboard <i>Galactica?</i>

175
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,034
You're being awfully accommodating.

176
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,270
Is that how it looks to you?

177
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,310
Your estranged two-timing bitch of a wife
calls you up for a quickie

178
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,234
and you hop on the first shuttle?
l'd say yeah.

179
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,110
- l've been thinking about stuff, Kara.
- Yeah, like what?

180
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,551
Like...

181
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,800
what that crazy skin-job Leoben said
about you and your "special destiny".

182
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,758
What if there's something to that?

183
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,152
Kara Thrace and her special destiny?

184
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,913
That sounds more like
a bad cover band, Sam.

185
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,991
Think about it, though.

186
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,118
Why did l survive all those months
on Caprica, waiting for you to return,

187
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,715
if l was just gonna walk out on you?

188
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,712
And you... l mean,
did you go through that hell

189
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,553
locked in that fake house
with that fake husband

190
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,835
just so you could ditch me?

191
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,638
l don't think so.

192
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,792
Not when l think about it like that.

193
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,189
Do you love him?

194
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,758
What?

195
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,356
Lee, Kara. Do you love Lee?

196
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,311
Gods, Sam, I...

197
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,789
Maybe.

198
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,871
l don't know.

199
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,911
Then you gotta go to him.

200
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,628
- l thought you were off duty.
- l am, yeah.

201
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,793
l was just gonna
stop by the bar for a little while.

202
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,357
If you're gonna see Kara, just admit it.

203
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,753
- l told you, there's nothing going on.
- Yeah, you both told me.

204
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,310
"Lee won't cheat, he's too noble."
The problem is, it's all a crock.

205
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,475
You know what the only problem is?
That you don't trust me, that's it.

206
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,554
And this is just your own frakking
insecurities talking, same as always.

207
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,029
l mean, right from the get-go.

208
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,511
The very first morning that l proposed.
l mean... You know what? Forget it.

209
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,319
This is frakking pointless.

210
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,391
Maybe you're right.

211
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,036
l did see this coming.

212
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,669
And l was naive enough
to marry you anyway.

213
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,035
And you wanna know why, Lee?

214
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,956
Cos l loved you.

215
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,477
l loved you so frakking much.
l thought l was lucky.

216
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,472
That's right - lucky.

217
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,959
That l could have you for just as long
as you - or Kara - would let me.

218
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,678
Dee...

219
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,311
- Come on, come here.
- <i>(sobs)</i>

220
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,273
It's not a marriage, Lee.

221
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,911
This is a lie.

222
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,348
You wanna be with Kara?

223
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,431
Go ahead.

224
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,151
l won't stand in your way.

225
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,829
It's over.

226
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,715
Wait, where are you going?

227

l gotta get going.

230
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,315

l'm not sure l can, Gaius.

237
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,596
Pain is one thing, but this...

238
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,114
Without free will, what are you?

239
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,397
Can God even pity such a creature?

240
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,870
Why not just admit you're doing this
for your own satisfaction.

241
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,758
That's the truth.
Why not put the needle in yourself?

242
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,718
- <i>(Cottle)</i> Hold his head.
- Oh, no, no, no!

No! No! Oh, God!

He's under.

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,996
Put the head strap on.

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,631

you're not gonna pull another 180?

253
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,040
These are our frakking marriages.

It's not some stupid dogfight
we can just jink our way out of.

Think about it, Lee.
It's what you're best at.

- <i>l'm looking for you, Doctor.</i>

But l can't find you.

It's water.

<i>Can you see it?</i>

Caprica.

Caprica Six!

275
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,795
She saved my life.

276
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,758
She shielded me from the explosion.

277
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,718
Doctor, did you conspire with her
to subvert our defence system?

278
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,872
Conspiracy requires intent.

279
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,190
l never intended...

280
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,317
But she said deep down
l'd always suspected.

281
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,836
But l didn't know.
How could l know?

282
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,356
Did l conspire? Did I?

283
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,795
No!

284
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,440
No! l don't know.

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,158
No.

286
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,436
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't my fault!

She...

290
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,677
Caprica Six.
She chose me.

291
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,875
She chose me over all men.

292
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,190
Chosen to be seduced.

293
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,876
Taken by the hand.

294
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,838
Guided between the light and the dark.

295
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,390
<i>But is she an angel or is she a demon?</i>

296

<i>ls she imaginary or is she real?</i>

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,678
Is she my own voice or the voice of?

l can't stay afloat much longer!

299
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,230
Now give us details, Doctor.

300
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,519
Give us details about the Cylons,
or we'll let you drown.

301
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,714
Alone... in the dark.

302

Hey, Chief.

Why is it so frakking hard?

Why can't we just... get back to normal?

306
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,877
Normal...

307
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,035
What is "normal", anyway?

308
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,678
Chief, you can tell me
if l'm out of line here,

309
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,751
but, um...

310
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,309
Do you ever think about Sharon?

311
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,630
No.

312
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,200
Come on.

313
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,317

Yeah, mistakes... mistakes were made,
terrible mistakes!

318
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,948
Were they mine?
Am l solely to blame?

319
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,349
l was a player, that's all! l was a player!

320
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,353
l was struggling to try
to find my place in God's plan!

321
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,476
God's resolve. I...

322
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,235
l never intended for certain things
to happen! Doesn't that matter?

323
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,917
You took the Cylons to the temple,
to the Eye of Jupiter. What did it tell them?

324
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,991
What did it tell them about Earth?

325
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,548

326
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,113
What were you looking for, Doctor?

327
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,395

00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,518
The five.

332

The final five.

333
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,394

334
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,389
l thought l might be one of them.

335
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,715
l told them l wanted to be one of them.

336
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,553
A Cylon? Why?

337
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,872
All my sins forgiven.

338
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,593
A new beginning.

339

Are you a Cylon, Dr Baltar?

340
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,391
No.

341
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,790
That's not good enough, Doctor.
Tell me what you told the Cylons.

342
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,156
What do they know?
Tell me, or l'll have to let you go, Doctor.

<i>Tell me, or l'll have to let you go.</i>

00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,271
<i>l'll have to let you go.</i>

345
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,199
Look where you're going.

346
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,435
My ring.

347
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,751
Has anybody seen my ring?
l lost it.

348
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,149
Has anybody seen my ring?

349
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,036
l want my ring!

350
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,750
- Admiral, we're losing him.
- <i>(rapid bleeps)</i>

351
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,039
That's enough. l'm putting an end
to this freak show right now.

352
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,872
<i>(Roslin)</i> No, listen to this.
Five final Cylon models.

353
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,349
Five pillars of the temple

354
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,319
for the five priests devoted
to the one whose name cannot be spoken.

355
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,155
- Come on, it's all just mumbo jumbo.
- He's holding a lot back, l'm sure of it.

356
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,708
Maybe we should resort
to more direct methods.

357
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,109
Direct methods?
Now you have my vote.

358
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,758
No.

359
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,792
We tried the stick -
it's time to try the carrot.

360
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,919
The thing he's most deeply afraid of
is, even if he talks, we'll kill him.

361
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,073
- Smart man.
- We have to ease his fear,

362
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,517
make him believe that if he collaborates,
at the very least he'll have his life.

363
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,716
He won't buy that, coming from us.

364
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,791
Of course not.

365
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,437
We have to find someone he trusts.

366
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,432
<i>(Baltar)</i> As perverse as it may seem,

367
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,990
l may actually owe these people
a debt of gratitude.

368
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,593
l realise there's probably nothing l can say
that can make this right.

369
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,515
But there's something you need to know.

370
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,276
l asked you to marry me
because l was in love with you.

371
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,635
Just like l'm in love with you now.

372
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,431
They forced me...

373
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,396
to admit my failings.

374
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,988
<i>And now that l have,</i>
<i>l feel positively liberated.</i>

375
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,753
You were right.

376
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,831
l loved Kara.

377
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,959
You know? And maybe
there's part of me that always will.

378
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,679
In my heart,

379
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,035
l know l have always done...

380
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,311
what l've had to do.

381
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,631
But l married you.

382
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,671
l married you.

383
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,638
And, you know,
when l look back at our marriage,

384
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,598
at the time that we have spent together,

385
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,113
you are good for me, Dee.

386
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,797
And l need you.

387
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,192
And l don't think l ever really realised that

388
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,396
till l knew that l was losing you.

389
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,392
<i>(Gaeta)</i> l can't promise you a trial, Doctor.

390
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,916
l'm sure that if you give them
something... anything...

391
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,470
But, please, just give me another chance -
that's all l'm asking.

392
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,755
Just give me the chance.

393
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,395
<i>(Gaeta) These charts that l've been using</i>
<i>to plot our course to Earth...</i>

394
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,835
<i>l've never been confident</i>
<i>of my calculations.</i>

395
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,428
That's lucky, because
the calculations are wrong.

396
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,717
l detect a number of inconsistencies
right off the bat.

397
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,669
- These figures here are wrong.
- That's exactly what l was afraid of.

398
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,958
Cylon navigation systems
are far more advanced than ours.

399
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,715
But l have managed to commit
many of the algorithms to memory.

400
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,997
If we can offer them this kind of help,

401
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,958
l'm certain, at the very least,
they'll spare your life.

402
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:58,309
Maybe we can even get you out of this cell
and offer you some proper quarters.

403
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,356
Creature comforts, that's the clincher?

404
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,431
Sorry?

405
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,234
Where is it?

406
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,313
- Um... where is what, Doctor?
- "Where is what?"

407
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,280
So much for that little stratagem.

408
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,719
<i>Hello.</i>

409
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,675
You all right?

410
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,958
Listen, we don't have to stay here
if you don't want to, OK?

411
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,951
Yeah.

412
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,631
Two whiskies, straight up.

413
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,110
l should have known that you'd betray me.

414
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,557
What did you tell them?

415
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,509
You stayed behind till the grisly end
on New Caprica so you could, what,

416
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,558
so you could feed information
to the Resistance?

417
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,996
Who do you think allowed you to do that?

418
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,914
- That's a lie.
- No, it's not a lie. You think l'm blind?

419
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,072
You see, l literally had a gun
pointed to my head.

420
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,959
But nobody forced you to play both sides.

421
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,988
So l'm asking you, Mr Gaeta...

422
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,396
who is the real traitor in this room?

423
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,157
To the first of many.

424
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,959
- Let's do another.
- Yeah.

425
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,031
Thank you.

426
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,758
- l'm not a traitor.
- Of course.

427
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,356
<i>Because there are far worse things</i>
<i>than being a traitor, aren't there, Felix?</i>

428
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,512
If your friends only knew the truth.

429
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,508
Don't worry. l can keep your little secret.

430
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,551
We gotta get in there.

431
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,598
Frak you!

432
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,875
<i>(guard)</i> Lieutenant Gaeta,
step away from the prisoner, now!

433
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,594
Step away from the prisoner.
l will not ask again.

434
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,398
- Stand down, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

435
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,438
- Step back, Mr Gaeta.
- No! No, sir.

436
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,115
l can't let him live,
not after what he's done.

437
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,636
Mr Gaeta? Mr Gaeta, wait, please.
Look at me.

438
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,560
- l understand what you're feeling.
- No, you don't.

439
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,315
Yes, l do. The other night, you didn't
come here to interrogate Dr Baltar.

440
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,188
You came here to kill him, didn't you?
l understand that, l do.

441
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,397
- What's his condition?
- He missed the artery. He'll live.

442
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,313
Gotta get him to sickbay.
Get a gurney in here right away.

443
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,789
<i>(Roslin)</i> Go easy on him.

444
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,833
<i>(Number Six)</i> All things considered, Gaius,
it could have been worse.

445
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,911
Much worse.

446
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,040
Well, you're not one of the five,

447
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,554
but you certainly have
the luck of the gods.

448
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,596
Well, l <i>am</i> the Chosen One.

449
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,558
You didn't tell them that, did you?

450
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,711
No.

451
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,832
Everybody's got to have a secret.

452
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,554
l told him l didn't take any satisfaction
in seeing his pain.

453
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,833
But the truth is, l was willing to see him
endure a great deal of suffering

454
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,036
in order to get what l wanted.

455
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,392
It wasn't some intelligence or some truth.

456
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,870
l wanted a genuine admission of guilt.

457
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,629
That's something you're not gonna get
from someone like Baltar.

458
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,872
He doesn't see himself that way.
It's not who he is.

459
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,873
In his eyes... he's the victim.

460
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,075
Not the criminal.

461
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,750
It's not too late for him

462
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,195
to just... disappear.

463
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,791
We can't do that.

464
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,917
For all his crimes, he's one of us.

465
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,991
So what happens next?

466
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,513
We give him his trial.

467
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,519
Back masking.

468
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,352
Turn me on, dead man.
