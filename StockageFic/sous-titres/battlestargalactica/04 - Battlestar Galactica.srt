1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,793
The Cylons were created by man.

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,505
They evolved.

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,383
They rebelled.

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,095
There are many copies.

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,101
And they have a plan.

6
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,105
Previously on Battlestar Galactica:

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:28,820
Congratulations, Doctor.
You've just uncovered your very first Cylon.

8
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,409
I'm not a Cylon.

9
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,704
This isn't happening.

10
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,503
I've been here for months.
By myself, on the run.

11
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,004
One step ahead of the Cylons.

12
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,800
You're going out there or I'm
gonna blow your brains out.

13
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,719
Right here, right now.

14
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,682
How did Crashdown die?

15
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,518
He gave his life in the...
in the finest tradition of the service.

16
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,980
You have my parole.
When I'm on duty, I'll make no attempt

17
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,983
to free her or sow insurrection
among the crew.

18
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,403
And when I'm not on duty,
I'll report directly back to this cell.

19
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,490
I have a few months to live.
And in that time,

20
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:17,995
I will lead the people to salvation.
It is my sole purpose.

21
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,998
As it appears obvious that the
government cannot function

22
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:21,999
under the current circumstances,

23
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:27,087
I have decided to dissolve
the Quorum of Twelve.

24
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,717
And as of this moment,
I have declared martial law.

25
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,317
You're sweating.

26
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,484
It's hot in here.

27
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,487
How long have you known
lieutenant Valerii was planning

28
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,114
to assassinate Commander Adama?

29
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,784
I had no idea she was
planning anything of the kind.

30
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,787
You were frakking her!

31
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,581
I ended that weeks ago,
on your orders.

32
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,917
You covered for her,
you lied for her.

33
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,795
- I admit I used bad judgment.
- You protected her at every turn.

34
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:13,884
Colonel, I had no idea she was a Cylon.

35
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:21,016
I'd like to exercise my article
21 rights at this time.

36
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,894
Oh, I'm sure you would.
I guess you haven't heard.

37
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,397
Cylons don't have rights.

38
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,693
- Cylon? Wait a minute.
- You know what we do with Cylons, Chief?

39
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,905
- I'm not a Cylon.
- Roslin came up with the execution method.

40
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:39,910
- I'm Galen Tyrol!
- She put a Cylon out of the airlock.

41
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,287
My father was a priest!
My mother was an oracle.

42
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,082
I've served on Battlestars
since I was 18 years old.

43
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,794
Pegasus, Columbia,
Atlantia, Galactica.

44
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,004
Don't talk to me like you're
a soldier!

45
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,091
You are not a soldier!

46
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,099
The old man always had a soft spot for you.
Let him decide what to do with you.

47
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:06,311
Colonel, you gotta believe me.
I am not a Cylon.

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,480
I'd never do anything to hurt Adama.

49
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,692
I love the old man.

50
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,487
That's what your girlfriend said.

51
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,615
Get him the hell out of here!

52
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,604
Chief?

53
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:56,403
I thought you were on Kobol.

54
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,491
Don't... you... talk to me.

55
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,286
Don't come near me.
Don't touch me.

56
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,997
If you do, I swear...

57
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,583
I will kill you.

58
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:22,679
Cylon-occupied Caprica

59
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,112
No sign of Centurions on the perimeter.

60
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,907
I don't like it. The human
toasters don't go anywhere alone.

61
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,493
- Think they're bait?
- Well, a pair of Cylons

62
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,703
don't just drive up here
in broad daylight.

63
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,705
Not after we hit that
convoy last week.

64
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,792
Frakkin'-A.

65
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,002
All right, screw it.

66
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,879
Pass word for everybody to sight in.

67
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,215
I wanna blow these Cylons away
before they ever knew what hit them.

68
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,801
Got it.

69
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,897
Unh! We gotta figure out
where the hell we are.

70
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,816
Why? You don't know?

71
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,693
You're the navigator.

72
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,821
You were driving.

73
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:31,707
Resistance

74
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:45,804
En subs by Laddin
bsg-cz.net

75
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,809
47,861 survivors

76
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,188
In search of a home.

77
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,315
Called Earth.

78
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,484
Earth.

79
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,200
All right we can head towards Gups' Point.
There's an emergency airstrip there.

80
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,284
No.

81
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,119
I've been.

82
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,914
I was thinking we could
head southwest.

83
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,917
Did you hear that?

84
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,190
- Drive through a lot of bad neighbourhoods?
- Better safe than sorry.

85
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,193
I hear that.

86
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,614
- We're sitting ducks down here!
- You go, I'll cover!

87
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,616
- Why me?
- Don't start!

88
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:48,492
Fine!

89
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,786
- You ready?
- Yeah.

90
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,205
Go!

91
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,089
Five of them, split up between
nine and one. 50 meters.

92
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,882
Ready?

93
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,301
Go!

94
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,684
Didn't see any shiny
silver out there.

95
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,186
I think we're dealing with
the human variety.

96
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:20,899
Hope so... they're not as
tough as mechanicals.

97
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:26,113
They do bleed good, though.
You gotta like that.

98
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,617
Let's get out of here!
Come on!

99
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,998
They locked the Chief up with Boomer.
Tigh thinks he's a Cylon.

100
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,792
I know.
I'm gonna see the Colonel now.

101
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,503
I think he wants me to find
a way to clear the Chief. Or...

102
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,797
Or what? Throw him out the airlock

103
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,091
like a piece of garbage?

104
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,093
If Commander Adama were in charge,
this would never happen.

105
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,804
Yes, but he's not in charge, is he?

106
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,307
No, but I've known the Chief for years.
He's no toaster.

107
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:57,102
He was involved with Lieutenant Valerii,
who most certainly is a toaster.

108
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,897
That word is racist.
I don't like it.

109
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,691
Sure... he's shown some bad
judgment getting involved with her,

110
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,485
but that doesn't mean he's a toaster.

111
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,697
- You've got to help him.
- Say something, Gaius.

112
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,909
Tell her you won't have racial
epithets used in your presence.

113
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,204
I'm very sorry. I was gonna tell
the Colonel there's nothing I can do.

114
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,081
The Cylon detector I developed doesn't work.

115
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,291
Clearly.

116
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,585
No!

117
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,379
You've got to help him.

118
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:29,009
Your child's gonna be half toaster.
How does that make you feel?

119
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:33,180
Nothing could make me happier.
I just don't know what I'd possibly say.

120
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,515
Excuse me.

121
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,683
He helped you!

122
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:40,521
He didn't tell anyone what
you did on Kobol.

123
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:44,191
What you did to Crashdown.

124
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:51,907
What I did to Crashdown
saved your life.

125
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,911
Are you blackmailing me?

126
00:08:56,411 --> 00:09:00,582
Help the Chief to help
yourself, Doctor.

127
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:05,712
Yes, Doctor. That's what
you're best at, isn't it?

128
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,509
- Deck log.
- What the hell's the matter

129
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,595
with your Cylon detector, Doctor?
You gave the assassin a pass.

130
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:17,516
Yes, but that was a beta test, a preliminary.
Clearly I hadn't perfected my methodology,

131
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,017
- and she slipped through.
- Fuel report.

132
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,895
So that the hell are you telling me here?
That we are back to square one?

133
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,606
That no one's results are definitive?
That we have no way

134
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,816
of knowing who are the
Cylons among us?

135
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,610
No, I'm saying that since Valerii's te--

136
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,488
since the assassin's test, I've
developed a new set of protocols which

137
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,783
should eliminate any errors...
anomalies, that cropped up earlier--

138
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,411
If you let me test the Chief's blood,
I might be able to tell once and for all if--

139
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:41,290
No "if". I want a definitive answer.
No more of your weasely techno babble.

140
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:47,504
He's a Cylon or he's not. So get down
there and do something right for a change.

141
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,799
I am the Vice President.

142
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,718
Legally speaking, if the
President is incapacitated,

143
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,219
shouldn't I take over her duties--

144
00:09:54,386 --> 00:10:00,017
Legally speaking,
I have declared martial law.
That makes you nobody.

145
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,020
So... unless you want to
join Roslin in the brig,

146
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,315
I suggest you get to work.

147
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,401
It's good to see you, Colonel.

148
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,987
Aren't you getting tired
of the continuous humiliation?

149
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,781
The disrespect from mechanics
and Colonels alike?

150
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,783
What do you think?

151
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:20,621
Maybe it's time to do something about it.

152
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,499
- What is this?
- The fleet Captains

153
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,210
are reporting protests among the civilians.

154
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,505
Demonstrations, petitions,
even some civil disobedience.

155
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,590
All over the declaration
of martial law.

156
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,092
Sir, there's more.

157
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,887
The Aturian refining vessel
has stopped refining tylium.

158
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,805
They say if they don't have
a voice in the government--

159
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,807
What?!

160
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:44,811
Their captain says they'll send fuel once
the civilian government has been restored.

161
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,106
And three other ships are
also refusing to resupply Galactica

162
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:52,611
until the President's reinstated.

163
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:59,409
And I got a note from combat warning
about problems with tylium resupply.

164
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,995
So watch your fuel burn
till further notice.

165
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,916
- Questions? - Yeah, when you
coming back to the card game?

166
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:10,879
I'm afraid when I'm off duty I'll be
enjoying the intimate surroundings
of the brig until...

167
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,091
ah, well, until further notice.

168
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,301
Come on back.
We miss you, Captain.

169
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,388
- We could bring the game to you.
- Somehow I doubt Colonel Tigh would approve.

170
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,181
Oh come on.

171
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,392
Hey, all right, all right.

172
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,019
Hey! Knock it off!

173
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,188
- Morning, Sir.
- Sergeant.

174
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:31,108
Shall we?

175
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,694
- Morning, Sir.
- Morning, Dee.

176
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,280
- Fancy meeting you here.
- I was just on my way, Sir.

177
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,698
- Hey, guys.
- How's it going, Dee?

178
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,992
Good, thanks.

179
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,413
- How's my father today?
- Uh, Commander Adama's the same... Captain.

180
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,418
He's sedated. Resting comfortably
since the surgery.

181
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,503
Trouble brewing in the fleet, though.

182
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,797
Oh, I'm shocked.
What kind of trouble?

183
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:55,716
Martial law isn't going
down too well.

184
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,801
Protests, demonstrations.

185
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,387
Some ships are even refusing
to resupply Galactica.

186
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:05,809
And this is the honeymoon period.
What's a dictator to do?

187
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,812
I, um, I wish...

188
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,814
I wish you were in command, Sir.

189
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:12,691
Dee...

190
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:16,486
He's hitting the bottle.
A lot.

191
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,991
Thank you for the company,
Petty Officer Dualla.

192
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,911
You're welcome, Sir.

193
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,509
- You okay, baby?
- No, I'm not okay.

194
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,011
My head feels like it's gonna
roll off my shoulders.

195
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,013
- What are you working on?
- I'm trying to figure out how to

196
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,894
solve our resupply problem now
that half the fleet has gone out on strike.

197
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,313
- You serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

198
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,316
I should probably call a summit
sit-down with all our ships' captains

199
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:58,820
and explain the situation and tell
them why I had to declare martial law.

200
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,782
Screw them. Like you have to
explain yourself to them.

201
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,787
It wouldn't hurt.
It would cool things down a little.

202
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,582
What?

203
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,001
Nothing.

204
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,212
No, no, no, it's...

205
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,590
you're the boss. Far be it from me to tell
you how to do your job.

206
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,010
- I know that's one of your issues.
- Just say it.

207
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:25,681
I don't know, it just feels
kind of... touchy-feely

208
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,392
You know, "Let's all sit
down and talk about how

209
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,104
we feel about martial law."
Bill would never do that.

210
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,482
But you gotta do what you gotta do.

211
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:39,903
I mean, Bill may never get
on his feet again.

212
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,408
Honey... honey, you handle
this the way you want.

213
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,911
They'll respect that.
Eventually.

214
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:58,797
This is the XO. Mr. Gaeta, send the
following to all ships' captains

215
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:04,720
Message begins: Resupply operations
of this ship are not, repeat, not optional.

216
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:09,808
All ships to recommence scheduled
supply runs immediately.

217
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:14,313
Failure to comply will result
in... stern measures.

218
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,608
Message ends.

219
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,696
You happy now?

220
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:26,992
- I'll fake.
- I'll draw fire.

221
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,108
Hi.

222
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,802
We're not Cylons.

223
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,097
Right. You're human.
You have a soul.

224
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,599
You swim in the stream.
We heard it all before.

225
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,185
Hey, colonial fleet.
Notice the uniforms?

226
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:37,980
Yeah, right, we've seen
Cylons in uniform before.

227
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,815
- We're human.
- Yeah, right.

228
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:42,484
- Everyone on Caprica is dead.
- You're not.

229
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,194
I just got here.

230
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:47,489
I want to hear some names.

231
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,199
I'm Anders.

232
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:52,202
- Samuel T. Anders?
- Yeah, that's right.

233
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,496
This is Jo-man, Rally, Ten-point...

234
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,583
Sue-Shaun, Crip-Key, Morris Fink.

235
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,086
Kara, these are the Caprica Buccaneers.

236
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,588
- Hmm. I don't think so.
- Give me a ball, little girl.

237
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,798
I'll shove it up your ass.

238
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,092
Please... try.

239
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,218
Okay,

240
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:12,389
since we're all getting along so well,
can people stop pointing their guns at us.

241
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:15,517
How does a professional pyramid
team survive a nuclear holocaust?

242
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,896
We were in the mountains when the
Cylons attacked. High altitude training.

243
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,607
We've been on the run ever since.

244
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,109
- Doing what?
- Raiding military stores

245
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,487
for ammo. Anti-radiation meds.

246
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,990
And plugging toasters whenever
they show up.

247
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:33,994
- Same as us.
- Okay...

248
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:38,498
how many foul breaks did you
have in the playoff against Aerilon?

249
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,501
- You're kidding, right?
- You either have the answer,

250
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,503
or you have a bullet.

251
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,505
Three.

252
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,215
Wrong.

253
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,383
- Four.
- Three.

254
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,802
Three. Last one was called
back on instant replay.

255
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,597
He's right, Starbuck.

256
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,892
I lost 20 cubits on that game.

257
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,103
Fine.
For now.

258
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,107
on three.

259
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,817
1.

260
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:06,902
2.

261
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,196
3.

262
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,496
You know you guys suck, right?

263
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,707
Can't shoot, can't pass.

264
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,001
Sure as hell can't take the point.

265
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,213
Everyone's a critic.

266
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,387
Here's your, uh, medication,
Madame President.

267
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,515
And a little something from the galley.

268
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:40,102
Thank you, Corporal Venner.

269
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:48,193
Chamalla and liquorice.
Would you like some?

270
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:52,698
- I hate liquorice.
- Me too.

271
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,705
It's interesting he still
calls you Madame President.

272
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:04,084
You still have a lot of
supporters out there.

273
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:11,216
Something ugly is coming.
I can feel it.

274
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:16,013
Sir, refinery captain's still not
cooperating. And now seven
other container ships are

275
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,599
refusing to release their supplies.

276
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:22,102
- Food, medicine, even coffee.
- Coffee?

277
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,396
This is getting ridiculous.

278
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:28,192
Frak this. It's time to get their attention.
I'm sending in the marines.

279
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,907
I want a Raptor and an armed marine
boarding party for every ship
refusing the resupply order.

280
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,992
Sir, we're stretched pretty
thin on manpower.

281
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,996
I'm not sure we have enough marine non-coms
to command that many boarding parties, Sir.

282
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:45,083
Well, pull pilots and deck officers to
command the boarding parties if you have to.

283
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,419
Tell them to get over there and
bring back the supplies.

284
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,587
Whatever it takes.

285
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:54,593
- Make it happen, Lieutenant.
- Yes, Sir.

286
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:00,599
Heavy Hauler Transport "Gideon"

287
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,184
People, step back, all right?!
We're just here for the supplies!

288
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,020
Galactica Boarding Party Six
Lt. Joe "Hammerhead" Palladino, Commanding

289
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,980
Just stay out of the way
and no one gets hurt!

290
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,816
For the last
time, step back!

291
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:11,109
Step back!

292
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,885
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

293
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,397
Four civilian dead. How the frak
could this have happened?

294
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:54,319
What'd you expect, genius? You put
a pilot in charge of crowd control.

295
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,412
Palladino! Did you give the order
to shoot on that crowd?

296
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,581
No, Sir, of course not.

297
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,291
The crowd surrounded us.

298
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:10,586
- Were they armed?
- No, Sir, but...

299
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,380
you had to be there. They were
yelling and screaming at us,

300
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:15,591
and then it got violent.
They started throwing things,

301
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,510
canisters.

302
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,888
- Coffee, I think.
- Coffee?

303
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,807
You shot people for
throwing coffee?

304
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,018
The crowd was out of control.
They were pressing in on us.

305
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,395
My men were getting hurt.
Somebody took a shot.

306
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,396
I don't know who it was.

307
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:32,900
Then all hell broke loose.

308
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:42,409
If ever we needed you, Bill,

309
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:45,621
it's right now.

310
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:50,501
Troops shooting unarmed civilians.
This is a travesty.

311
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:54,379
He has truly stepped over the line.
It'll cause an explosion in the fleet.

312
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:58,217
The press will have a field day.
The ships would begin to splinter.

313
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:03,680
The Cylons will be able to eliminate
us a few ships at a time.

314
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,483
We've got to get out of here now.

315
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:18,111
- Corporal.
- I am right with you.

316
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,114
I'm so glad you said that.
I want to take Billy and Elosha with me.

317
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,699
Of course you do.

318
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,785
I've worked out a way of
getting us in the hangar deck.

319
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,787
And I can get us a Raptor.

320
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,499
But we're still gonna need
clearance to get off the ship.

321
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,001
- I know how to get that.
- You do?

322
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,713
Question is, where do we go
once we get off this ship?

323
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,800
We'll have to find some place to hide
in the fleet while we rally
support among the people.

324
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,803
I've got an idea about that.

325
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,391
You're not going to like it.

326
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,982
I'm not cut out for this.
I never was.

327
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,609
Don't talk like that, Saul.
This is your moment.

328
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:01,613
Me and Bill, side by side, that was the deal.
It was never supposed to be me alone.

329
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,616
Well, like it or not, you're in command,
so you better deal with it.

330
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,994
I don't want to deal with it.
I do not want to command.

331
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:07,995
Don't you get it?

332
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,997
Jeez, why do I listen to you?

333
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:12,916
What are you talk? I never told you
to send troops out to that ship.

334
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,294
No, no, you didn't tell me to
send troops anywhere.

335
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,881
You just manipulate. You always do.
You put the knife in, and you twist it.

336
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,007
Oh, right,

337
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:21,800
you're going to blame me
for your own inadequacy?

338
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,801
I'm not blaming you, Ellen.

339
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:27,681
you are so frakking passive that
if I didn't push you,

340
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,101
you would never get your head out
of that frakking bottle and do anything.

341
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,603
I warned you.

342
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:35,689
I'm telling you.

343
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,287
- I love you so much.
- Shut up, Ellen.

344
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:54,499
I guess you really must hate me.

345
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,921
I don't know if it makes any difference
right now, but I'm really sorry

346
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,882
you got pulled into this.
You know, what we had--

347
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,884
Was nothing.

348
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:04,718
Nothing.

349
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,597
You're a machine.
I'm not.

350
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,518
Well, whatever I am,
I know how I felt.

351
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,811
- Software doesn't have feelings.
- Open the cell.

352
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,191
I never meant to hurt you.

353
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:30,410
I'd like some privacy, please.

354
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:33,914
I'll be fine, thank you.

355
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:41,296
And how are we this evening?

356
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:43,715
What do you want?

357
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:48,220
I'm here to determine whether
you're a Cylon or not.

358
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:53,183
Your arm, please.

359
00:23:57,187 --> 00:24:00,190
His test doesn't work too well.
I mean, he gave me the green light.

360
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,901
The test works...

361
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,904
just fine.

362
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,581
Chief?

363
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:16,999
Chief?

364
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:18,709
I lied to you, Sharon.

365
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:22,588
I covered up your true nature from
the rest of the fleet for my own purposes.

366
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:24,506
What did you do to him?
He's not breathing.

367
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:28,302
No, he's dying right now, Sharon.
I can save him

368
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,804
if you tell me how many Cylons
there are left in the fleet.

369
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:33,307
I don't know,
but I'm not getting a pulse.

370
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:37,102
Yes, you do. Now, buried
deep down in that thing you call

371
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,396
- a subconscious you know how many.
- I don't know!

372
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:42,691
He doesn't have time for this, Sharon.
His organs are shutting down.

373
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,986
In ten seconds time, he'll experience
complete brain stem death.

374
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:48,405
Now how many?

375
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:51,700
Do you love him, Sharon?

376
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:53,785
only you can save him!

377
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:54,995
10.

378
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:56,079
9.

379
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:57,706
do you love him?

380
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:00,209
Do you love him, Sharon?

381
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:01,210
Eight!

382
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:04,296
There are eight.

383
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,206
All right, let's get these
weapons unloaded. Let's go!

384
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,084
Hit an armory earlier today,
about 18 clicks north.

385
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:45,212
- Brought home a lot of toys.
- What is this place?

386
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,714
Delphi union high school.
Toasters don't patrol this area.

387
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:50,884
It's good place to get some
shut-eye, a bite to eat.

388
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:53,387
- How many people you have here?
- 53.

389
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:56,890
We had almost a hundred before the
toasters ambushed us last week.
Let's go!

390
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:59,810
- More pyramid teams?
- Nah, just us C-Bucs.

391
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,104
Rest are survivalists,
hikers mostly.

392
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:03,981
How's your stock of
anti-radiation masks?

393
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,400
Raided a couple of hospitals
down in Pilgrim Bay.

394
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:09,611
I figured we've got enough
for three months.

395
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,282
Let's get you some
bunk space, come on.

396
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,992
53...

397
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,202
Not exactly an army.
A hell of a lot better

398
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,288
than the two of us
if we're going to assault an airbase,

399
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:22,416
steal a heavy raider,
and get the frak off this planet.

400
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:26,003
I'll just be a moment.

401
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,299
Doctor...

402
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,301
I need your help.

403
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,220
But it's illegal, dangerous, and in
violation of your oath as

404
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:37,389
an officer.

405
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:39,683
You're a lousy salesman.

406
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:42,811
Corporal! Corporal Venner.

407
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,479
I, uh...

408
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:47,816
I just want to tell you how much the
President appreciates all the
little things you do for her.

409
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:50,903
Hey, anything I can do to
make things easier for her.

410
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:53,614
Great. She, um...

411
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,992
has a special request.

412
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:01,997
If I could just get your signature, Sir.

413
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:13,592
Why are we closing down Causeway B?

414
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,886
Integrity testing, Sir.

415
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:18,096
Got chewed up pretty bad when
the toasters boarded us.

416
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:22,184
And we've been getting some
pressure drops in there.

417
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:28,607
Tell 'em to get it fixed.

418
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:43,789
- Oh! Sorry.
- Lieutenant.

419
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:46,500
Things are pretty frakked up
these days, huh?

420
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,920
Yeah, things are pretty
frakked up most days.

421
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:54,716
If people are upset, they should
go through the proper channels.

422
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:58,220
- I'm not sure I understand what...
- I was running some maintenance checks,

423
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,889
detected a series of scrambled calls
going out over the past few hours.

424
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:03,392
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

425
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,397
No, Sir. Off-log calls are against regs.

426
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:11,483
Hmm... that's right.

427
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:21,910
I'm sure you won't approve.

428
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:25,205
But I guess that's nothing new.

429
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:30,794
I just want you to know that this, um...
this isn't about you and me.

430
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:40,095
Good-bye, dad.

431
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:54,902
- You gonna help out here or what?
- They're putting the Chief in there,
you know?

432
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,904
I don't care if they put
a giant parakeet in here.

433
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:59,114
Colonel says build a cell,
we build a cell.

434
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,992
This isn't right.
He's one of us.

435
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:04,620
No, he's one of them.
He always was. We just never saw it.

436
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,706
No, he's innocent.
She tricked him.

437
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:11,919
Wow, such loyalty.
Were you frakking him too?

438
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,011
You want to get pissed at someone,
you get pissed at Boomer.

439
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,516
She's the one who put the
Chief in the cell here, not us.

440
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,484
- Evening, Sir.
- Evening, Dee.

441
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,694
Fancy meeting you here.

442
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:41,114
- Everything set?
- Roger that.

443
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:44,618
Sorry, captain.
Can't chit-chat today.

444
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:47,412
Captain!

445
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,499
I'm having trouble with the ordnance
tracking on my Raptor, Sir.

446
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:52,000
I can't get it to cycle.

447
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:56,588
Oh... change of plans, boys.
Instead of getting some rack time,

448
00:29:56,797 --> 00:30:00,217
I going to take a minute to do
the Lieutenant's job for her.

449
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:04,096
- Yes, Sir.
- After you.

450
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:09,810
Okay, make it look good,
but not too good.

451
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,716
Hold it!

452
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:45,220
Private, do you know who I am?

453
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:46,513
Good.

454
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,391
You and I have something in common.

455
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,604
We each took an oath to protect
and defend the Articles of Colonization.

456
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:55,981
Those articles are under attack,

457
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,692
as is our entire democratic way of life.

458
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:03,280
Now, my duty won't let me stand
here and allow that to happen.

459
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:09,411
So I intend to go through that hatch
and get off this ship.

460
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,580
Damn it.

461
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:14,208
They should be here by now.

462
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:18,212
You can either stand aside,
or you can shoot me.

463
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:23,300
You'll have to decide where your duty lies.

464
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:27,596
Madame President...

465
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:46,406
Madame President, this way.

466
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:48,200
Madame President.

467
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:52,412
I'm not getting on that ship with you.

468
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,499
What?

469
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:58,502
I understand what you're trying to do.

470
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,880
But it's going to divide the fleet.

471
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,716
At the very best, it'll create
an insurgency against Adama.

472
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:07,302
And at the worst, a civil war.
Taking part in that is a line

473
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:09,513
that I won't cross.

474
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,891
We do not have a lot of time.

475
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:20,816
I wish you well.

476
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:42,004
Dustoff two-seven, checkers green,
ready for launch on medical mission.

477
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:44,590
Request clearance.

478
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,508
Good to see you. You okay?

479
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:50,012
I think so. My feet barely touched
the ground getting here.

480
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,388
I know what you mean.

481
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:55,684
Dustoff two-seven. Standard port three
departure approved. Cleared for launch.

482
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:59,188
Standard port three, wilco.

483
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:13,994
Sir. Corporal Venner reports
the former President's missing.

484
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:15,913
- Missing?
- Two men down, cell's empty.

485
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,581
Damn it.

486
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,791
Alert security.
Set condition two!

487
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,003
No one on or off the ship!

488
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:29,801
Attention, set condition two throughout
the ship. Repeat, set condition
two throughout the ship.

489
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:36,892
Sir. Flight log records a Raptor departed
the ship two minutes ago

490
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,187
with Doc Cottle on
a medical emergency.

491
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:42,606
Medical? Confirm that.

492
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:47,903
Dradis has their transponder
bearing 2-8-7 carom 0-0-3. Range 2-7.

493
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:54,493
Get the cap on the horn and have them
intercept. And get Captain Adama
out of the brig.

494
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,912
Sir, Dr. Cottle is still inboard.
He says he was forced

495
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,207
to request the Raptor at
gunpoint by Captain Adama.

496
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:02,209
Son of a bitch.

497
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:06,004
Dee, put me through to that Raptor.

498
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:10,592
Cap has visual on their target.

499
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:14,513
Turn that ship around, Apollo,
or I'll order the cap to shoot you down.

500
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,099
- We're not turning back.
- I'll do it.

501
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:19,810
Don't think I won't just because
you're the old man's son.

502
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:23,188
Then do what you have to do, Galactica.

503
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:26,191
Apollo out.

504
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:30,988
Fire across their bow.

505
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:33,115
Hot Dog, Galactica.
Fire across their bow.

506
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:37,494
- Acknowledge.
- Wilco, Galactica.

507
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,918
Hot Dog reports they're
not turning around, Sir.

508
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:49,089
- Where are they now?
- Dradis shows them approaching cloud nine.

509
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:51,884
Sir, if they dock, we may lose them.
Cloud Nine is one of the busiest

510
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:55,012
transport hubs in the fleet.
Shuttles coming and going constantly.

511
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,389
If they board one and take off,
it'll be before we can

512
00:34:57,598 --> 00:35:01,518
shut down air traffic.

513
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,898
Galactica, Hot Dog.
Request instructions.

514
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:08,609
Galactica, Hot Dog.
I need further instructions.

515
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:12,112
Do I fire or not?

516
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:20,120
Dee... tell Hot Dog to hold his fire.

517
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,581
Repeat, weapons
hold. Do not fire.

518
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:28,295
Hot Dog, Galactica. Weapons hold.
Repeat, do not fire.

519
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:34,593
They couldn't have done
it on their own.

520
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,012
Did anybody notice off-log calls?

521
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:40,182
Scrambled communications?

522
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,309
No, Sir.

523
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:44,686
Nothing.

524
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:03,705
Well, we're home free for now.

525
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:10,295
Good to see you, Madame President.

526
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:14,508
Captain Apollo...

527
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:17,594
what is Mr. Zarek doing here?

528
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:21,098
Once Tigh gets over his initial shock,
he'll send troops out to search for us.

529
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:25,686
If we're going to make it, we have to keep
on the move. I figured Mr. Zarek here is

530
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:29,815
the only one in the fleet with enough shady
friends around who can possibly hide us.

531
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:32,401
Love the way he puts that.

532
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:36,905
Well, Mr. Zarek, it would seem the enemy
of my enemy is my friend.

533
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:38,782
Call me Tom.

534
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:43,787
Our shuttle's waiting, ma'am.
We have to hurry.

535
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,091
Wow, is that the best you can do?

536
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,512
Nice to know installing a regulation
pyramid court was one of the
priorities of the resistance.

537
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:04,516
Well, there are some things
one cannot live without.

538
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:06,101
Let's go.

539
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,395
Are you kidding me?
I'll wipe the court with you.

540
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:10,981
Yeah, we'll see about that.

541
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:16,111
I was scouted for the pros.
Bum knee took me out of contention.

542
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,197
I see.

543
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:21,116
Is that going to be your
excuse when I kick your ass?

544
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:25,120
- "My poor knee hurts."
- At least I have an excuse.

545
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:29,583
I can't imagine what
yours is going to be.

546
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:05,786
Nice shot.

547
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:08,413
Thanks.

548
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:20,801
Thanks. Thanks, doc.
I appreciate it.

549
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:22,594
Don't thank me.

550
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:24,304
Thank her.

551
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:26,890
Why, what does she
have to do with it?

552
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:29,893
Everything.
Nothing.

553
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:38,610
Love is a strange and

554
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:41,780
wonderful thing, Chief.

555
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:45,409
You'd be happy you experienced it at all.

556
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:49,413
Even if it was with a machine.

557
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,208
- What are they going to do to her?
- They're setting up a new holding facility.

558
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:54,793
There will be tests.

559
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,420
Mental.

560
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:57,713
Physical.

561
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,801
Like she's some kind of lab rat?

562
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:06,013
That's the idea.

563
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,100
This is just great.

564
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:13,896
Bill Adama's little baby boy
pulls the wool over your eyes,

565
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:18,609
and you let him get away Scot-free.
You're a laughing stock.

566
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:20,819
You didn't want this command.

567
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:23,697
Well, don't worry about it.
You won't have it for much longer.

568
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:27,701
All because when push came to shove,
you got shoved.

569
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,913
It was his son.

570
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:42,007
What's happening on my ship?

571
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:47,513
Wait in the corridor.

572
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,599
Ellen, can I speak to my XO?

573
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:53,519
Of course.

574
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:02,194
Slowly.

575
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:09,117
What's happened?

576
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:12,204
I frakked things up and good.

577
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:16,291
- How?
- I made some bad calls.

578
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:20,087
- I've done that.
- Not like these.

579
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:24,216
You gonna pour us one
of those or what?

580
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:31,515
Never had much use for people
who second-guessed my decisions.

581
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:34,893
Especially if they've never held a command.

582
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:38,397
They don't understand the pressure.

583
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:41,817
You make a call.

584
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,903
It affects the lives of thousands.

585
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:47,906
And you have no one to
turn to for back-up.

586
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:50,409
Well, you make it look easy.

587
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:54,288
Well, you know that's a lie now.

588
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:59,001
A lot of pieces to pick up.

589
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:04,006
Then we'll pick 'em up together.
Where's my son?

590
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:06,717
Bitch!

591
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:09,386
Traitor!

592
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,515
No, no, no.

593
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:05,484
I love you, Chief.
