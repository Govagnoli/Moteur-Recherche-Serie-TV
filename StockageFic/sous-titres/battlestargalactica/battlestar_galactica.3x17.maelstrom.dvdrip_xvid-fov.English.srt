1
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,352
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,228
<i>(Adama) Leoben's a very clever Cylon.</i>
<i>He's gonna try to get into your head.</i>

3
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,232
We haven't been properly introduced.
l'm Leoben.

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,390
<i>(Starbuck)</i> l want
the Cylon interrogated.

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,959
Do it.

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,071
This has happened before.

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,199
And all of it will happen again.
Your destiny has already been written.

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,511
Assaulted, Miss Thrace.
A lot of old fractures from childhood.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,276
Children of abusive parents often fear
passing that abuse to their own children.

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,270
Get out!

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,391
l'm trying to help you, Kara. l only want
you to see the truth of your life.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,950
The reason you suffered.
The reason you struggled for so long.

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,397
Was there something to what Leoben
said about you and a special destiny?

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,392
Kara Thrace and her special destiny?

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,675
That sounds like
a bad cover band, Sam.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,833
<i>(Adama) l think the nova does look like</i>
<i>the mandala inside this temple.</i>

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,119
Maybe it was a road sign. Show
me the direction it's headed to next.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,270
<i>(Helo) l'm curious about something.</i>

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,193
<i>Those paintings you did</i>
<i>from your apartment on Caprica.</i>

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,354
This... was on the temple.
Where did you get the idea to paint yours?

21
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,228
That's something l've been doodling
since l was a kid. l liked the pattern.

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,949
<i>(Helo) Well... they built the temple</i>
<i>4,000 years ago.</i>

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,879
- What is it?
- Just something Leoben said once.

24
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,875
That l had a destiny.
That it had already been written.

25
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,477
What's up?

26
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,318
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

27
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,031
You're up early.

28
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,911
You too.

29
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,277
Yeah.

30
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,512
Hera gets these nightmares.

31
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,398
Wakes up crying and shaking.

32
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,517
By the time we calm her down
and get her to sleep, l'm wide awake.

33
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,275
All that crap she went through on
New Caprica really left its mark on her.

34
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,956
l know how she feels. l wish you'd never
shown me that picture of that mandala.

35
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,398
l dream about it and that bastard Leoben
every godsdamn night.

36
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,278
l feel like l'm losing my mind here.

37
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,959
You know, Kara, there's a, um...
psychiatrist aboard <i>Inchon Velle.</i>

38
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,555
We've made an appointment for Hera.
Think about seeing her.

39
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,792
Are you kidding me? Most shrinks are
more frakked up than their patients are.

40
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,436
You know, you might want to check out
that Oracle camped in Dogsville.

41
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,310
People say she interprets dreams.
Sees things in them. Predicts events.

42
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,114
Hey.

43
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,191
You OK?

44
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,471
l don't know.

45
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,431
Hello? <i>(clears throat)</i>

46
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,353
<i>(woman)</i> The goddess Aurora.

47
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,950
Take it. It's yours.

48
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,034
- What the hell am l gonna do with this?
- You'll know when the time comes.

49
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,637
Sit.

50
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,997
I, uh...

51
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,071
l can't sleep.

52
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,277
- Having these nightmares.
- About the Cylon.

53
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,792
The one who held you captive
on New Caprica.

54
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,677
Leoben.

55
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,315
He was just...

56
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,633
He knows you better than
you know yourself... Kara Thrace.

57
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,759
He sees the truth about you.
About your destiny.

58
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,831
You don't...

59
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,631
Enough of that.

60
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,312
The only destiny l have
is as a world-class frak-up.

61
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,517
Who hurts everyone
she cares about.

62
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,389
That was your mother's gift to you,
wasn't it?

63
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,790
You were born to a woman who believed
suffering was good for the soul,

64
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,189
so you suffered.

65
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,431
<i>Your life is a testament to pain.</i>

66
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,832
You want to believe it because
it means that you're bad luck.

67
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,912
You're like a cancer
that needs to be removed.

68
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,993
<i>Because you hear her voice every day.</i>

69
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,594
<i>(Leoben)</i> And you want her to be right.

70
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,068
Somebody told you
what Leoben said to me.

71
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,759
Did you ever tell anyone about that?

72
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,232
You learned the wrong lesson
from your mother, Kara.

73
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,636
You confused the messenger
with the message.

74
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,315
Your mother was trying
to teach you something else.

75
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,750
You don't know crap
about my mother.

76
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,509
Leoben does.

77
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,709
He sees the patterns,
sees how it all fits together.

78
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,031
- Shut up.
- <i>He's coming for you.</i>

79
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,155
<i>Soon.</i>

80
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,435
Shut the frak up.

81
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,474
You can't stop him.

82
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,268
And he will show you the way.

83
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,039
l'm on a shuttle in a half an hour.
Ask for your leave, come with me.

84
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,758
You could use the downtime.

85
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,512
It sounds tempting.

86
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,390
So do it. No strings, OK? We don't even
have to talk about our relationship.

87
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,675
l'll think about it.

88
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,951
Which means no.

89
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,551
<i>(sighs)</i>

90
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,715
You know, l hate to say this, but that
whack-job oracle... she's got a point.

91
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,555
Your mother frakked up your head
long before Leoben ever got to you.

92
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,915
She was dealing with a lot, Sam.

93
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,994
She told me that l was
different from other kids,

94
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,390
that l needed to be a warrior, like her.

95
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,793
Taught me that fury gets you killed.
And anger keeps you alive.

96
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,316
Well, she gave you plenty
to be angry about, didn't she?

97
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,069
Split your head open with a broom
because you didn't make your bed.

98
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,958
- l ever tell you how l got back at her?
- No.

99
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,830
In the first Cylon war, she was stationed
with the first marines on Medra.

100
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,753
Stinking jungles you wouldn't believe.

101
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,230
Had this phobia of insects
for the rest of her life.

102
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,038
Hated the damn things.

103
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,990
So l go out and l buy a bunch of
rubber bugs and l slip into her closet...

104
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,799
and l put 'em all over her shoes.

105
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,757
And?

106
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,193
She screamed her frakking head off.

107
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,510
l go in...

108
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,673
and she's trying to smash them
with her shoes.

109
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,914
But that's just making 'em
bounce around even more.

110
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,798
You must have caught hell for that.

111
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,270
She grabbed my hand, held it in
the doorjamb, and slammed the door.

112
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,998
Frak me.

113
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,795
It was worth it, though.

114
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,431
<i>(Hotdog) lt's "Galactica". We had some</i>
<i>valve failures. We're restarting the unrep.</i>

115
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,152
<i>(Dualla) Great. Hotdog, settle in. We're</i>
<i>gonna be out for another three hours.</i>

116
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,390
Hotdog, what the hell are you doing?

117
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,399
Enjoying blue skies again. About
the only thing l miss about New Caprica.

118
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,757
<i>Galactica,</i> Starbuck. Showtime.

119
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,355
Bogey. My right one,
in the soup at 45. Committing.

120
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,795
Starbuck, Hotdog. No joy. Press.

121
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,158
Abort the unrep.
Unhook those fuel lines immediately.

122
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,631
Refuelling ships, <i>Galactica.</i> Immediate.
Cease all under-way replenishment ops.

123
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,395
We've got both Starbuck and Hotdog
on DRADIS, but no contact on the bogey.

124
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,393
We're lucky we can see anything.
That planet's synchrotron radiation

125
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,029
has been kicking the crap out of every
DRADIS in the fleet since we got here.

126
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,112
Price you pay for a good place
to hide and refuel the fleet.

127
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,398
Looks like it's also a good place
for hiding a Cylon Raider.

128
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,270
Starbuck, Apollo.
What have you got?

129
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,990
Apollo, we got one turkey playing
hide-and-seek in the clouds. No sparrows.

130
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,832
Engaging offensive.

131
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,309
One heavy Raider.
No fighter escort.

132
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,118
<i>(Gaeta)</i> Still no bandits on DRADIS.

133
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,510
If that bastard jumps,
the Cylons could be all over us in minutes.

134
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,795
Alert the fleet to stand by for a jump.

135
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,678
Starbuck, Hotdog.
No visual on the Raider! l'm losing you!

136
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,309
Dammit. Starbuck, blind!
l say again! l lost you in the clouds!

137
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,069
<i>(Hotdog) Starbuck, we have no DRADIS</i>
<i>on your bogey. Do you have visual?</i>

138
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,311
Affirmative.
He just ducked into the storm system.

139
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,391
<i>(Hotdog) Do you see him?</i>
<i>Do you see him?</i>

140
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,789
<i>Galactica,</i> Starbuck.
Tally. Weapons hot.

141
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,950
<i>Galactica,</i> Starbuck.
Took a hit but still flying.

142
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,396
- <i>(Hotdog) Starbuck, where did you go to?</i>
- <i>l'll be on him in a few seconds.</i>

143
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,638
- Where the hell is that Raider?
- <i>(Gaeta)</i> Sir.

144
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,676
Starbuck's close to the hard deck.

145
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,197
The atmospheric density could
keep her from reaching orbit again.

146
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,319
Then the pressure will crush her
like a cheap soda can.

147
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,791
<i>(Apollo) Starbuck, you're getting too low.</i>
<i>Break off and climb.</i>

148
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,038
<i>l repeat. Starbuck, you're getting too low.</i>
<i>Break off and climb.</i>

149
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,712
<i>Starbuck.</i>

150
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,828
Pull out before you don't have
to smash to regain orbit.

151
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,991
<i>You got to come in.</i>

152
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,674
Where the hell is she going?
Get outta there.

153
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,958
<i>(Apollo) Starbuck, come in. Do you read?</i>
<i>You're getting too low.</i>

154
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,191
- Get up.
- <i>(Apollo) Have you a visual on Starbuck?</i>

155
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,431
<i>Starbuck, come in! Do you read?</i>
<i>Starbuck! Pull up!</i>

156
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,909
That is an order. Pull out!

157
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,152
Apollo, Starbuck. Wilco!

158
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,397
Come on!

159
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,631
- Where'd l take the hits, Chief?
- Looks like nowhere, Captain.

160
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,995
What? l felt the impact.

161
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,594
Damn Viper felt like
it hit a brick wall.

162
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,468
Well, we'll keep checking,
but so far not a scratch.

163
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,108
<i>(Starbuck)</i> It has to be there.
Run it again.

164
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,953
- We've watched it twice.
- Then this isn't my film.

165
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,110
<i>(Sharon)</i> No one else
pulled a trigger all day.

166
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,749
We checked <i>Galactica's</i> DRADIS records.
There was no paint on your Cylon.

167
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,549
And we all know that DRADIS
can be wonky near this planet.

168
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,154
Maybe the Raider jumped away
before you fired.

169
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,595
Or maybe it never existed
to begin with.

170
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,231
It was there.

171
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,634
Gonna ground her?

172
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,635
Karl says she's physically fit,
but an emotional basket case.

173
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,518
In peacetime, he'd ground us all.

174
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,038
So it falls back on you.

175
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,917
Yeah.

176
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,871
Even screwed up,
she's still the best Viper driver l've got.

177
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,272
Sometimes it's hard to admit
that the best of us... can burn out.

178
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,874
Do you think she has?

179
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,877
l don't know.

180
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,678
l think her identity as a steely-eyed Viper
jock is the only thing holding her together.

181
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,955
So if l ground her...

182
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,110
Everyone gets rattled sometimes.

183
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,191
But the bottom line is...

184
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,669
when the bullets start to fly...

185
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,391
can she handle it?

186
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,632
So where do you want to go
when you bite the big one?

187
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,598
l want to go right there.
Next to Kat.

188
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,151
A water-walking Viper jock.

189
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,119
A royal pain in the ass,
but a hell of a stick to have on your wing.

190
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,434
You can put me right here.

191
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,511
Next to Duck and Nora.

192
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,115
Good card players.
Nice way to spend eternity.

193
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,238
Whoever croaks first, the other one makes
sure their picture goes in the right place.

194
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,311
Deal?

195
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,077
Deal.

196
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,117
So what did the old man have to say
about my combat report?

197
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,796
"Starbuck's finally gone off the deep end.
Unfit for duty."

198
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,629
He said l'm the CAG.
It's my call.

199
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,594
Ah.

200
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,190
And what do you say?

201
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,835
l say l trust your eyes over DRADIS
any day of the week.

202
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,310
Something could have been there,
vanished in the cloud cover.

203
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,311
So you don't think l'm nuts?

204
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,834
l didn't say that.
You're a raving lunatic.

205
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,992
As demented and deranged
as the first day l met you.

206
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,197
And you're a bastard.

207
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,989
Look, um...

208
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,992
stress has made us all twitchy.

209
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,072
After what that Cylon put you through
on New Caprica,

210
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,436
you've had more than your share.

211
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,750
Get some rest...

212
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,718
or you will start seeing things.

213
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,439
Yeah.

214
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,713
<i>(Adama)</i> That leaves
six civvies in line to refuel.

215
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,190
- <i>(Roslin)</i> In another ten hours we're done.
- Yeah.

216
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,197
Starbuck?

217
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,919
- What do you hear?
- Nothing but the rain.

218
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,958
Well, then grab your gun
and bring in the cat.

219
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,190
Wilco, Admiral.

220
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,198
- Madam President.
- Captain. How is it out there?

221
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,239
- Hell of a view.
- <i>(Adama)</i> We're almost to the finish line.

222
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,880
Then we can jump the hell
outta this system.

223
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,599
So say we all.

224
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,913
Um... Actually...

225
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,991
Sorry. Boss.

226
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,118
l have something for you.

227
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,479
l thought that it would be a nice
figurehead for your model ship.

228
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,109
Aurora. Goddess of the dawn.

229
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,590
Yeah. She brings the morning star
and a fair wind.

230
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,557
A fresh start.

231
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,710
Thank you.

232
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,154
- Good hunting.
- Thank you.

233
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,639
<i>(Chief)</i> Harness assembly?

234
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,714
Lap and shoulder retaining pins installed.
Retraction reel correct.

235
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,958
Disconnect block locking indicator,
yellow flag visible.

236
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,908
<i>(gasps)</i>

237
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,195
You all right, Captain?

238
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,119
Uh...

239
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,359
Give me a minute here, Chief.

240
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,352
<i>(screaming)</i>

241
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,237
<i>(Chief)</i> Major.

242
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,838
She's just sitting there.

243
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,798
Did you talk to her?

244
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,269
You talk to her.

245
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,109
Feeling sorry for me?

246
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,159
Kara.

247
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,629
Everyone gets rattled.

248
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,511
Even the best.

249
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,274
l'm not going back out there.

250
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,554
l don't trust myself.

251
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,359
Hm.

252
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,271
So trust me.

253
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,793
l'll fly your wing.

254
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,189
The CAG flying my No.2?

255
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,349
Whatever it takes.

256
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,237
How are things with you and Dee?

257
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,469
Uh...

258
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,869
You know. Good.

259
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,313
No.

260
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,278
Better than good.

261
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,749
Best they've ever been.

262
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,592
l'm happy for you.

263
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,517
Really.

264
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,148
It's funny, though,
after all we've been through...

265
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,038
we are right back where we started.

266
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,472
You're CAG and l am
your hotshot problem pilot.

267
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,672
l guess that's all
we'll ever be now, huh?

268
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,679
Starbuck, Apollo.
How we doing?

269
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,799
Copacetic.

270
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,718
Another 30 minutes
and we head back for the barn.

271
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,508
Dammit. Apollo! One turkey, my right.

272
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,070
Level and ten, ducking in and out
of the clouds. Engaging.

273
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,678
<i>Starbuck, Apollo. No joy.</i>

274
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,877
Starbuck, <i>Galactica.</i>
No DRADIS contact on your Cylon.

275
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,155
<i>Apollo. Starbuck.</i>

276
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,236
Weapons hot. Committing.

277
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,269
This time l'm gonna drag him back and
dump his sorry ass on the hangar deck.

278
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,195
Set the fleet at condition one.
Uncouple the hoses.

279
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,590
Starbuck, Apollo.
l've lost you on DRADIS. l'm blind!

280
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,514
Starbuck, Apollo. l repeat.
l got no sign of you or the Raider.

281
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,992
Starbuck! Report!

282
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,911
Starbuck, report!

283
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,833
<i>This is Apollo.</i>
<i>Can you read me?</i>

284
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,399
<i>Starbuck, we're falling.</i>

285
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,472
<i>Starbuck!</i>

286
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,036
<i>Starbuck, l have zero visibility.</i>

287
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,918
<i>Starbuck, are you out there? Kara!</i>

288
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,433
<i>(beeping)</i>

289
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,353
<i>(beeping continues)</i>

290
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,237
<i>(radio) Good morning.</i>
<i>Got another hot one in store for you today.</i>

291
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,835
<i>It's time to head for the beach.</i>
<i>Weatherman says we can exp...</i>

292
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,911
Rise and shine.

293
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,188
We have a big day ahead of us.

294
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,951
Come on.

295
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,590
l'm not here.

296
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,433
l'm out cold, or on a Cylon ship,

297
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,956
and you dragged me
to play your frakking mind games.

298
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,918
No games, Kara.

299
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,389
This is about your destiny.

300
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,308
l write my own destiny.

301
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,758
l didn't paint that symbol, Kara.

302
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,592
You did.

303
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,069
You saw it again.

304
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,476
In the clouds.

305
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,551
Didn't you?

306
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,758
But you didn't tell anyone else.

307
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,988
Because you're drawn to it.

308
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,836
You feel its pull.
You want to fly into it.

309
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,593
You want to cross over.

310
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,875
But you're afraid.

311
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,758
Afraid of what?
A frakking cloud?

312
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,791
Of the unknown.

313
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,517
Death.

314
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,032
All of your high-wire stunts
have been an act.

315
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,911
Time after time...

316
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,754
you skip to the edge of the abyss,
then dance away again.

317
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,832
But you never really
conquered your fear.

318
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,516
You've been afraid.

319
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,909
Ever since that day.

320
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,518
What day?

321
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,869
All this has happened before.
And will happen again.

322
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,715
<i>(knocking)</i>

323
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,155
- <i>(woman)</i> It's open.
- <i>(door opens)</i>

324
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,631
Hello, Mamma.

325
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,274
It's hard to believe
it's only six years ago.

326
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,914
You look so much younger.

327
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,991
l was.

328
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,313
<i>(mother)</i> So, you really did it. First person
in the family to become an officer.

329
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,153
What <i>is</i> the world coming to?

330
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,758
Kara, they tell me that you're
the best natural pilot they've ever seen.

331
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,638
First time l got in that cockpit, l just...

332
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,034
felt like l belonged.

333
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,956
All that natural ability, and still
you only graduated 16th in your class.

334
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,556
16th out of 117 cadets, Mamma.

335
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,552
Why are you proud of that?
You should have been No.1.

336
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,392
They tell me that you have left a trail
of demerits from here to Aerelon.

337
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,350
- You have no respect for authority...
- It's none of your business any more.

338
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,434
You have a gift, Kara.

339
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:25,116
l've always known that in my gut. And
l am not going to let you piss that away.

340
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,909
- You're special. Don't you understand?
- No, l'm not.

341
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,992
Would you let go of
that stupid dream of yours?

342
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,991
Look, l am sorry as hell
that you never made officer,

343
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,789
and all you have to show for a life
of dedication is this crappy apartment

344
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,670
and that frakking medal on the wall.
But l will not make up for it all. l can't.

345
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,957
Yeah, because you're a quitter.

346
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,315
You always have been.

347
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,828
You went to an oncologist?

348
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,912
Hey! Put that down.
Don't touch that.

349
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,879
- What are you gonna do about this?
- Nothing.

350
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,672
There's nothing <i>to</i> do.
It's metastasised.

351
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,830
Game is over.

352
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,632
- l'm sorry, Mamma.
- l don't want your pity.

353
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,311
- You haven't got it.
- You want to feel sorry for someone?

354
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,436
Feel sorry for yourself.

355
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:08,231
You have to find another way to motivate
your ass. l'm not gonna be around to do it.

356
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,630
Oh, don't tell me
you're gonna cry about it now.

357
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,310
You know what? l don't need this.
l'm gonna... l'm gonna walk out that door.

358
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,629
And you can look at it every frakking
miserable day you have left

359
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,076
and know that l am never
gonna come back through it again.

360
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,434
Kara!

361
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,312
Kara!

362

<i>(door slams)</i>

364
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,074
You kept running, didn't you?

365
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,718
For blocks.

366
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,436
<i>(Leoben)</i> She waited here.
Five weeks.

367
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,429
Hoping you'd come back.

368
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,591
She died alone.

369
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,554
l was afraid l couldn't watch.

370
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,951
It's not too late.

371
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,831
She's waiting still.

372
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,239
Mamma.

373
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,394
You came back.

374
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,909
l can't believe you kept all this.

375
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,877
Everything.

376
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,394
Always.

377
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,157
Mamma.

378
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,154
Something's about to happen.

379
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,551
You know that thing that
you were trying to prepare me for?

380
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,431
l don't know if l can do it.

381
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,469
Oh, yes, you can. You can.

382
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,912
How can you be sure?

383
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,276
You're my daughter.

384
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,149
<i>(Leoben)</i> See? There's nothing
so terrible about death.

385
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,119
When you finally face it...
it's beautiful.

386
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,551
You're free now.

387
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,671
To become who you really are.

388
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,278
You're not Leoben.

389
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,271
Never said l was.

390
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,193
l'm here to prepare you
to pass through the next door.

391
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,068
To discover what hovers
in the space between life and death.

392
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,591
<i>(beeping)</i>

393
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,510
<i>Starbuck, Apollo.</i>
<i>l lost you on DRADIS.</i>

<i>Switch idents.</i>
<i>l'll try and get a fix on you.</i>

<i>Kara!</i>

397
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,549
<i>(Starbuck) Lee.</i>

398
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,710
<i>l'm not afraid any more.</i>

399
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,279
Say again?

400
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,871
l'm not afraid any more.

401
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,396
She should be afraid.
She's damn close to the hard deck.

402
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,789
The pressure will crush them both.

403
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,838
- Lee, get her out of there.
- <i>(Gaeta)</i> 90 seconds to hard deck.

404
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,956
All right, Kara. Listen to me.

405
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,871
Forget the damn toaster.

406
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,474
Climb now or you're dead.

407
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,598
<i>We can still pull out. We haven't</i>
<i>gone past the point of no return.</i>

<i>Kara!</i>

409
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,469
<i>(Gaeta)</i> 60 seconds to hard deck.

D vector red section to Apollo's last

00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,876
Visual. Visual.

414
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,758
OK. Kara, l'm coming to get you.

<i>Listen to me! Come back...</i>

Can you see her?

<i>Negative.</i>

She went in.
