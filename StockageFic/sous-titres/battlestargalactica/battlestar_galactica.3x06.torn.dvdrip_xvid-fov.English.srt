00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,439
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,399
I, Sharon Agathon, will carry out
the lawful orders of my superiors

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,074
as an officer in the Colonial fleet.

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,718
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,155
We're talking about people
blowing themselves up.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,152
l've got one job here, lady,
and one job only.

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,791
To disrupt the Cylons, make them worry
about this ant hill they've stirred up here

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,237
so they're distracted and out of position
when the old man shows up in orbit.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,552
You know the mission. You also know
there's only one way this mission ends,

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,475
and that's with the successful rescue
of our people off of New Caprica.

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,872
Evacuate the facility. You should go
as well, Gaius. There's a place for you too.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,074
Captain? Hi. Who's this?

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,879
- This is...
- Kacey!

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,636
Oh, my little girl!
When the Cylons took her, l thought...

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,029
But you saved her!

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,031
Gods bless you.

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,237
A lot of good people had to pay the price
for choices they made on New Caprica.

18
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,878
Like my wife.

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,191
That's right.
Ellen collaborated.

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,989
Gave the Cylons information
on the Resistance, and she died for it.

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,438
- There's still a question of my value.
- There always will be. You're human.

22
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,671
<i>(Baltar)</i> Good to see you.

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,039
l far prefer these picturesque settings
for our little interludes, don't you?

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,830
l thought you'd abandoned me
to your Cylon comrades.

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,593
Would l do that?

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,037
You've always been more unpredictable
than your flesh-and-blood counterparts.

27
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,990
A man that loves women as much as you
should have learned that a long time ago.

28
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,157
l'm a slow learner.

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,199
Then take this period as a time
to learn all you can about the Cylons.

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,955
- You'll need it in the days ahead.
- Something special on the horizon?

31
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,669
- Cylon psychology's based on projection.
- Projection?

32
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,228
How they choose to see
the world around them.

33
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,711
The only difference
is you choose to see me.

34
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,875
What are you?

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,951
Really?

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,317
You're either connected to
the woman l knew on Caprica,

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,713
or a part of my subconscious struggling
for self-expression. So which one is it?

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,190
l'm an angel of God,
sent here to help you.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,639
Just as l always have been.

40
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,118
We're all part of one big ecosystem.

41
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,398
Yes, l can feel it... breathing.

42
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,550
Get used to it.

43
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,469
- So, what'd he say?
- l haven't asked him yet.

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,798
Asked me about what?

45
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,438
Earth.

46
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,318
Uh... Wha?

47
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,994
Earth.
It's the thirteenth colony.

48
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,554
Do you know how to find it?

49
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,631
Not really, no.

50
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,870
That's unfortunate.

51
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,677
There was a hope - my hope -
that if you knew the way to Earth,

52
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,151
it would justify keeping you alive
a little longer. Come on, Six.

53
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,993
Wait. Wait! Wait!

54
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,311
Now, when l say
that l do not know exactly where Earth is,

55
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,279
that is not to say l do not know
a great deal about its probable location.

56
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,590
Honestly, l spent hours... Days. Weeks!

57
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,958
Months and months on a map
that Adama and Roslin found on Kobol.

58
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,875
l correlated that with our observations.
l doubt anyone can make the same claim.

59
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,554
We'll get back to you.

60
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,190
What do you care
about finding Earth?

61
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,396
Because we're looking for it.

62
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,151
You are?

63
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,193
Yes, we've decided that Earth's
going to be our new home.

64
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,433
<i>(Helo) Ship-to-ship training exercise</i>

Compressor blew.
Looks like it severed the fuel line.

82
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,152
Cally, check the tank.
God, this is ugly.

83
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,429
Tank's dry.
There's not even fumes in here.

84
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,832
- <i>(Chief)</i> Captain, how'd you land this?
- l pointed it at the deck and stopped.

85
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,789
Bone-dry, she says.
Landed the bird without a drop of fuel.

86
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,469
If you want to die,
l will open up an airlock for you,

89
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,759

Excuse me!
Hey, make a hole!

96
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,030
Excuse me.

97
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,508
Ellen.

98
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,998
<i>(woman)</i> l've told you
a thousand times.

99
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,073
- Ellen, l'm right here.

100
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,673

101
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,593
- Kacey?
- Kara, Kara!

102
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,912
l'm sorry, don't you remember me?
l'm Julia Brynn. l'm Kacey's mom.

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,434
- Yeah, l remember.
- <i>(Kacey)</i> Give me a hug.

104
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,592
We're staying in...
Everyone's calling it Camp Oil Slick -

105
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,195
part of the hangar deck.
They've put up cots for refugees.

106
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,637
- Yeah. Yeah, l heard.
- Kacey's been asking to see you for days.

107
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,998
l sent messages.
l thought maybe you'd come for a visit.

108
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,557
You seem like a nice person
so l'm gonna be honest with you.

109
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,952
The last thing l need is a two-year-old
friend, and she doesn't need me in her life,

110
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,591
so do us both a favour and do not
bring her around here again, OK?

111
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,039
Go to your mom, Kace.

112
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,193
Sure. Sorry.
Don't let us keep you up.

113
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,271
Sorry, honey. We gotta go.

114
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,190
<i>(Helo)</i> There it goes.

115
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,113
That's it. See?

116
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,873
See? l told you you could do it.

117
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,910
You did great.

118
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,117
Remind me never
to let that happen again.

119
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,475
You got it, slim.

120
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,357
Ever!

121
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,079
l've been trying to reassemble
President Bal...

122
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,518
Dr Baltar's work on piecing together
the thirteenth tribe's path to Earth.

123
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,232
What is it you trust about his research?
How do you know it's not another lie?

124
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,515
One thing l learned about Baltar

125
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,752
was his extraordinary capacity
for self-preservation.

126
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,958
l think he wanted to find Earth
because <i>he</i> wanted to get there.

127
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,190
How far did he get
with his research?

128
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,999
As you can see,
l'm still hacking through his notes,

129
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,359
but it appears that he was trying to
correlate our own astrometric readings

130
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,274
with the map of constellations
that we found back on Kobol

131
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,478
and applying his findings
to certain select passages

132
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,870
- within the scroll of Pythia.
- Why the scroll of Pythia?

133
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,476
Pythia's supposed to have chronicled
the journey of the thirteenth tribe to Earth.

134
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,588
If l can draw your attention to this, "The
caravan of the heavens was watched over

135
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,070
by a great lion
with a mighty blinking eye..."

136
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,754
- "Red and blue."
- <i>(Gaeta)</i> Exactly.

137
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,832
Exactly what?
We're looking for a lion's head?

138
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,798
- With a mighty blinking eye.
- Blinking!

139
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,155
The scrolls,
they speak in metaphors.

140
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,349
l thought the doctor might be off his meds
as well, sir, but then l found this note...

141
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,830
here, where he had written
"blinking equals pulsar".

142
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,990
That means a star, right?

143
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,755
Plural, actually.
They're the rotating cores of dead stars.

144
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,628
They emit a blast of radio waves.
From a distance, they appear to...

145
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,631
- Blink.
- Right.

146
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,430
The doctor found two in very close
mutual orbit within this sector.

147
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,556
The spectrographic readings l found

148
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,997
show one will appear to be red
and one will appear to be blue.

149
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,629
Now, these pulsars
appear to be in this nebula.

150
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,711
We have never had a look at this area,

151
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,712
but it is possible,
with a couple of eyeballs out there,

152
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,109
they might look at the nebula and see...

153
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,317
A giant lion's head.

154
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,995
Well, it looks like this is
the best thing we've got going, so...

155
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,312
Unless you object, Admiral,
l suggest we go lion hunting.

156
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,955
<i>(Number Six)</i> The navigational markers
you gave us may prove useful.

157
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,149
We sent a baseship out to investigate
the pulsars and look for this lion's head.

158
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,231
Look, this isn't easy for me.

159
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,108
l don't think you fully appreciate
just how difficult this is.

160
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,036
l have very conflicted, very ambiguous
feelings about helping you find Earth.

161
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,032
Funny how all that ambivalence
and conflict vanished

162
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,159
once you thought
your life hung in the balance.

163
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,036
You should know there's still scepticism
about whether you're being truthful.

164
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,948
Uh...

165
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,477
l'm very sorry.
We didn't mean to intrude.

166
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,028
Come on, Gaius.

167
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,634
<i>(Baltar)</i> Are we going round in circles?

168
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,633
It all looks the same to you. It'd be hard
for any human to navigate here,

169
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,154
especially without projecting.

170
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,836
You've used that word before. l'm not sure
what you're talking about. It helps you to...

171
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,195
What, exactly?

172
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,516
Have you ever daydreamed?
Imagined you were somewhere else?

173
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,068
l do have an active imagination.

174
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,232
Well, we don't have to imagine,
we project.

175
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,995
We choose to see our environment
in any form we wish, whenever we wish.

176
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,835
For instance, now, you see us as standing
in a hallway, but l see it as a forest.

177
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,439
Filled with trees, birds, sunlight.

178
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,354
Like the walks that you and l used to take.
On Caprica.

179
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,036
The aesthetic's what gives me pleasure,
not the specific memories.

180
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,072
Instead of blank walls, l surround myself
with a vision of God's creation.

181
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,873
Right, l think l understand projection,
but it's a bit of a coincidence, isn't it?

182
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,476
That l could see
such a vivid reality that l've created

183
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,472
and the Cylon projection experience
seems so similar.

184
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,551
Is it a coincidence?

185
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,598
Well, what are you saying?

186
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,989
There's a connection?

187
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,834
What? Because of
my experiences with you...

188
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,831
Am l a Cylon?

189
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,718
What was that?

190
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,272
Oh, nothing.
Just talking out loud.

191
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,350
Silly me.

192
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,875
Are you sure you want to go in second
seat again? l hear you're a pretty fair pilot.

193
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,750
Yeah, too many pilots, not enough birds.
Anything to keep me flying at this point.

194
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,513
If you want me, l'm yours, Boomer.

195
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,115
Uh, no. Boomer was...
She was someone else.

196
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,232
Listen up! We need a call sign
for Lieutenant Agathon.

197
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,834
- Chrome Dome!
- Titania.

198
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,151
- Wind-up Toy.
- Tin Can.

199
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,390
- Microchick.
- How about Athena?

200
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,040
- Digital...
- Wait, wait, wait. What was that?

201
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,509
You know,
the goddess of wisdom and war.

202
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,593
Usually accompanied by
the goddess of victory.

203
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,238
- <i>(man)</i> She likes it.
- Athena it is.

204
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,471
<i>(Kat)</i> Hey, Colonel!

205
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,757
Colonel, come have a seat.
Over here.

206
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,673
Enough of that to go around?

207
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,751
Always.

208
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,794
Dead Man's Chest - a cut-throat game.
Not usually your style.

209
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,192
It is now. And l'm in it to win.
If you don't like it, find another game.

210
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,635
There's some straight talk.

211
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,678
Have you seen the line-up
outside the head?

212
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,232
15 civilians standing in line, picking
their noses, waiting to take a shower.

213
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,155
- Frakking civilians think they run the ship.
- Beats what we had - it was like a tomb.

214
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,836
If you want to know what alone feels like,
spend a few weeks in a Cylon holding cell.

215
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,434
Yeah, it was a bitch on both sides.

216
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,830
It wasn't easy coming up with a plan
to save your sorry butts.

217
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,436
Yeah, you guys had it rough, huh?
Hot showers, three squares a day,

218
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,433
Viper jocks didn't even take a shot
till you jumped into orbit.

219
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,353
- We all made sacrifices.
- Is that so?

220
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,589
Yes, that's right.

221
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,990
While you were pinning wings
on your Cylon girlfriend,

222
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,436
our people were strapping
home-made bombs to their chests,

223
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,069
doing whatever they could
to take the bastards out.

224
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,870
So forgive me if l don't get all misty
over your sacrifices.

225
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,829
You seem distracted, Gaius.

226
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,111
Do I?

227
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,632
You can rest easy,
at least for now.

228
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,190
The data on Earth's location
and your valiant rescue of the baby

229
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,874
has gone a long way
toward impressing the others.

230
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,588
l used to think
you and l would have a baby one day.

231
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,310
There are 12 Cylon models. In the entire
occupation on New Caprica, l saw seven.

232
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,551
Now here, again, the same seven.

233
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,315
- Who are the final five?
- l can't talk about that.

234
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,789
- Can't or won't?
- l can't.

235
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,350
It's complicated,
but we don't talk about them. Ever.

236
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,673
But you'd know one of them, wouldn't
you? If they were to walk past here...

237
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,751
Six, we have a problem.

238
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,118
A baseship - the one we sent
to investigate the pulsars and Lion nebula.

239
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,270
We've lost contact.

240
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,196
The trouble is we know almost nothing
about the ship's status.

241
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,670
We received a garbled distress call,
then silence.

242
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,356
Unsurprisingly, their hybrid sent us
confusing data. Our hybrid is analysing it.

243
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,434
- What are the hybrids he's talking about?
- Be quiet, Gaius.

244
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,635
<i>(Number Eight)</i> Our hybrid's deciphered
part of the data we received.

245
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,711
<i>(Doral)</i> This is impossible.

246
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,270
<i>(Simon)</i> It may have been inevitable
once we took human form.

247
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,920
<i>(Doral)</i> We're not human.
We're not like him.

248
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,639
<i>(Simon)</i> God has chosen this time
to test us.

249
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,190
Whether we fail or pass the test
is up to us.

250
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,271
What's going on?

251
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,955
The missing baseship. It's been infected
with some kind of disease.

252
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,112
- Disease?
- Yes, it's killing them. All of them.

253
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,954
If an infected Cylon dies
and carries this into a resurrection ship,

254
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,476
it could rapidly spread,
potentially infecting our entire race.

255
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,554
Make sure the resurrection ship is
out of range then send in Centurions to...

256
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,791
No. The data indicates
that as soon as a hybrid was infected,

257
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,917
the Centurions started shutting down.

258
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,037
l assume our Raiders and baseships
are also susceptible.

259
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,476
Of course. We are all created
from the same genetic pool.

260
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,792
Then no Cylon can board that ship
without risk of infection.

261
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,353
Say you'll go aboard the infected baseship
and investigate what happened.

262
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,556
You sent them to that nebula,
remember?

263
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,598
Are you mad?

264
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,355
You have to prove to them
you can be counted on in an emergency.

265
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,560
- Show them you're worth keeping alive.
- What if l catch the disease?

266
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,279
What are the chances that a human

267
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,511
could catch something
that infects a Centurion or a Raider?

268
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,956
That is, if you're human.
And if you're really a Cylon -

269
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,669
one of the final five
you haven't seen yet -

270
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,231
then wouldn't you just rather
get it over with and die?

271
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,156
l'll go.

272
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,593
What?

273
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,869
Yes, l'll go.

274
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,717
Look, l am a trained scientist.
l can go to the baseship.

275
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,598
l can make observations
about their condition,

276
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,797
bring back information
about this disease.

277
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,192
If we land, the disease killing the human
Cylons could infect one of our Raiders.

278
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,271
Then don't send a Raider.

279
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,319
Surely the war's furbished you
with some Colonial vessels.

280
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,872
He's right. We could program one of
our Raptors to approach on autopilot.

281
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:52,514
- All right, then. Prepare to jump the ship.
- Make sure the resurrection ship stays.

282
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,160
A truly selfless act.

283
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,871
l could use a refill here.

284
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,632
<i>(Hotdog)</i> Here.

285
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:16,193
Here's to knowing that somebody
will always have your back.

286
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,068
The sentiment's good,
but, in my book,

287
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,720
trust is an overrated commodity.

288
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,153
Mm.

289
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,959
That one, l'll drink to.

290
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,079
- Frak you guys.
- What is your problem, Katraine?

291
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,154
My problem is you, Captain.
All this us-against-them crap.

292
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,476
- <i>(Starbuck)</i> Truth hurts. Give me another.
- Why don't you take it out on the Cylons?

293
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,873
- We busted our ass to get you back.
- You think that means anything?

294
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,034
Every Colonist that landed on
New Caprica was loyal, to a point.

295
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,875
It was amazing watching those people you
thought you knew go over to the Cylons.

296
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,635
- At least we knew where we stood.
- Is that so?

297
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,359
Then how come
you are off flight duty

298
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,319
and some Cylon lover
is holding down my post?

299
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,439
Don't kid yourselves. You're on your own
in life, each and every one of us.

300
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,548
Why don't you tell that to the pilots
that died getting you off that rock?

301
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,633
Gaeta's briefing Sharon and Racetrack
on the mission to the pulsars.

302
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,598
You mean Athena and Racetrack.

303
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,638
- Word travels fast.
- Yes, it does.

304
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,350
l understand that morale's taken a hit
on the flight deck.

305
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,874
Nothing we can't handle, sir.

306
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,069
l'm also told that Colonel Tigh is spending
a lot of time down the pilots' rec room.

307
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,915
Him and Starbuck. They've been holding
court, second-guessing the rescue,

308
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,036
bad-mouthing the crew
that stayed up.

309
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,317
If you weren't on the ground,
it's like you can't be trusted.

310
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,436
And people are listening?

311
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,795
Their word carries a lot of weight.

312
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,156
You're right. They're destroying morale
and unit cohesion.

313
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,677
- They both know better.
- l don't think they care, sir.

314
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,836
<i>(woman) Two protons</i>
<i>at each coupling site creates a force.</i>

315
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,798
<i>The embryo becomes a fish</i>
<i>that we don't enter.</i>

316
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,839
We're here to experience the evolving
little toe. Atrophy. Don't ask how.

317
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,471
l'll be dead in a thousand light years.
Thank you. Genesis turns to its source.

318
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,111
Reduction occurs stepwise
so the essence is all one. End of line.

319
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,239
FTL system check, functions
within parameters repeats the harlequin.

320
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,312
The agony, exquisite.
The colours run the path of ashes.

321
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,153
Neuronal network
by the 52% of heat exchanger,

Upper senses repair order.
Relay to zero zero zero zero...

324
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,591
- <i>(Baltar)</i> Is it aware of us?
- <i>(Number Six)</i> She's aware of everything.

325
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,075
<i>(woman)</i> New paragraph. Pancreatic fluid
at one with the continuum of evolution.

326
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,869
We're here to experience. Evolve the toe.
Reduction occurs stepwise,

327
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,750
so the essence is all one.
Full stop. New paragraph.

328
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,400
Do you have any idea
what it's talking about?

329
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,838
No. Most Cylons think the conscious
mind of the hybrid has simply gone mad,

330
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,595
and the vocalisations we hear
are meaningless.

331
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,068
But not everyone thinks that.

332
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,238
The ones you know as Leoben

333
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,995
believe that every word out of her mouth
means something,

334
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,311
that God literally
speaks to us through her.

335
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,158
<i>(Baltar)</i> She sort of controls the ship,
does she?

336
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,755
<i>(Number Six)</i> She is the baseship
in a very real sense.

337
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,400
Mind gone mad.

338
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,711
She experiences life
very differently than we do, Gaius.

339
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,189
She swims in the heavens.

340
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,078
Laughs at stars,
breathes in cosmic dust.

341
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,913
Maybe Leoben's right.

342
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,116
Maybe she does see God.

343
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,790
We're wasting time.

344
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,351
Jump.

345
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,156
<i>(woman gasps for breath)</i>

346
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,396
There are bodies everywhere,

347
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,630
others dying.

348
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,191
What the hell is that?

349
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,915
Definitely man-made.

350
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,355
<i>(woman gasps for breath)</i>

351
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,038
You're severely dehydrated.
You must drink water.

352
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,350
Kill me.

353
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,954
There is no resurrection ship nearby.

354
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,430
You will not be downloaded
into a new body, you will just be gone.

355
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,478
l saw how they died.

356
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,030
Please.
Please, l can't bear that.

357
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,074
l'm here to bring help.
All right?

358
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,073
l'm just going to take some blood samples
for analysis on the baseship,

359
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,711
and then we will be able to
make a treatment for the disease.

360
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,711
You must breathe, please.
Please, take some water.

361
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,156
You're... you're from <i>Galactica.</i>

362
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,515
No, l'm from a baseship.

363
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,315
Tell me,

364
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,991
do you know what this is?

365
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,071
We found it floating
at these coordinates.

366
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,038
It must be some kind of...

367
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,190
beacon or marker.

368
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,999
It looks too old.
It looks very old.

369
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,599
Must have been left
by the thirteenth tribe.

370
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,636
Infected, poisoned,

371
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,713
left by some humans like you
to destroy us.

372
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,759
A human device,
filled with a pestilence.

373
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,229
- You sent us to this place.
- It wasn't me.

374
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,676
- You knew we'd bring it aboard.
- You don't know what you're saying.

375
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,469
This is the disease speaking through you.
Calm down.

376
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,233
- l am going to bring help.
- You knew it was here.

377
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,710
- You wanted other baseships to follow.
- l would never hurt you.

378
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,429
You wanted the other baseships
to know it was here.

379
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,751
- Be quiet.
- Suffer the same infection.

380
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,277
- Be quiet! l'm going to bring help.
- You want to destroy us all! You'll lie.

381
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,989
- Shut up!
- You'll lie to them. l know. It's your fault.

382
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,548
Shut up! Be quiet.

383
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,790
Shut up! Shut up.

384
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,838
Shut up!

385
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,995
<i>(Doral) Gaius, do you hear us?</i>

386
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,914
<i>Gaius, do you read?</i>
<i>Do you read? Are any of them alive?</i>

387
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,869
<i>What do you see? Speak to us.</i>
<i>What do you see? Are any of them alive?</i>

388
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,269
This is Gaius Baltar.

389
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,270
- l'm returning to the baseship.
- <i>(Doral) What do you see?</i>

390
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,874
l've seen nothing.

391
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,994
Nothing of consequence.

392
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,150
There's nothing left to do here.

393
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,511
Nobody likes it, but we have to make a
terrible choice. Do we attempt a rescue?

394
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,036
Risk the lives of our fleet,
even our species, or do we leave them?

395
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,669
- There's no cure in science.
- There has to be.

396
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,912
Look at them. They're so afraid. Even
the humans don't abandon their own.

397
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,515
- <i>(Leoben)</i> They must be sacrificed.
- <i>(Simon)</i> There is a question.

398
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,239
Yes, there is.

399
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,470
How did this happen?

400
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,438
<i>(Doral)</i> It's Baltar.
He led us there deliberately.

401
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,159
He's been working with <i>Galactica</i>
the whole time.

402
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,596
It wasn't me. Whatever you think l did,
l didn't do it, Honestly.

403
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,470
Baltar, we followed your coordinates,
found a disease with no treatment or cure.

404
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,393
If we leave, they're doomed,
never to return.

405
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,153
Perhaps God
would smile upon us for our mercy.

406
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,913
Listen to you.
You can barely even speak his name.

407
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,959
We have to agree. We are not
abandoning our brothers and sisters.

408
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,190
<i>(all speak at once)</i>

409
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,119
We have to leave them.

410
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,352
We have to jump and leave them
to their fate. There is no other way.

411
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,431
<i>(screams)</i>

412
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,351
<i>(screams echo)</i>

413
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,798
Mists of dreams drip along
the nascent echo and love no more.

414
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,518
End of line.

415
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,878
- The hybrid objects.
- She doesn't get a vote.

416
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,713
Jump the ship.

417
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,358
Jump.

418
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,074
This disease...

419
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,958
it must have come from someplace.

420
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,757
- So what did you notice on the ship?
- <i>(Baltar)</i> Nothing.

421
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,070
l am just as baffled as you are.

422
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,589
You noticed nothing suspicious
on the infected ship?

423
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,110
<i>(Baltar)</i> Nothing whatsoever.

424
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,838
<i>(man)</i> Admiral on deck.

425
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,911
<i>(Tigh)</i> Admiral.

426
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,398
Give me the room.

427
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,550
Stay in your seats.

428
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,635
<i>(Tigh)</i> Have a drink.

429
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,669
Give me your side arm.

430
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,193
What?

431
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,510
Your side arm.

432
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,833
<i>(Tigh)</i> Hey, there's a live round in that.

433
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,151
Now one of you -
l don't care who -

434
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,198
pick that weapon up
and shoot me.

435
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,232
- Admiral, l don't know...
- l didn't say to talk.

436
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,709
You've done enough of that already.

437
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,232
l said to pick up that weapon and shoot.

438
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,710
What's the matter?
No guts?

439
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,154
You don't got a pair?

440
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,993
- You're both frakking cowards.
- Watch your mouth.

441
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,995
Or what? You're going to turn
the rest of my pilots against each other?

442
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,310
Poison the crew?

443
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,630
You've already done that, Saul.
Both of you.

444
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,589
Yeah, well, if you're looking for
an apology, it isn't gonna happen.

445
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,715
You were like a daughter to me once.
No more.

446
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,275
You're a malcontent and a cancer,

447
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,393
and l won't have you on my ship.

448
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,994
So you have a choice.

449
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,153
You can figure out how to become
a human being again and an officer,

450
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,630
or you can find another place to live,
off of this ship.

451
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,790
You're dismissed.

452
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,392
Are you gonna kick me
out of my chair too?

453
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,358
- l know you've been through a lot.
- Don't patronise me.

454
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,318
Say what you came here to say.

455
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,117
You're full of bile, hatred,

456
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,875
and l know that has something to do with
Ellen. l'm sorry for that.

457
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,353
If you need time, Saul, you take all the
time you want. But l've got to run a ship.

458
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,594
The last thing l need
is a one-eyed drunk sitting down here,

459
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,877
sowing discontent and disobedience.

460
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,428
So l'll tell you once again, Saul,

461
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,193
you can pick up that weapon
and kill me,

462
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,876
or you can get your ass
back into your quarters and not leave

463
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,956
till you're ready to act like the man
that l've known for the past 30 years.

464
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,309
That man doesn't exist any more, Bill.

465
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,029
And you won't be seeing me again.

466
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,072
Oh, my gods!
It's right there.

467
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,914
The Lion's Head nebula
and the blinking eye!

468
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,597
Holy crap!
It's the road to Earth.

469
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,113
<i>(laughs)</i>

470
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,237
Oh, my gods!
Let's get the frak out of here.

471
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,470
l'll start the jump.

472
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,194
When God's anger awakens,
even the mighty shall fall.

473
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,511
Frak, Athena,
we need to get out of here!

474
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,233
- Blah-ba-bloo-ba...
- He's doing it again.

475
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,958
- Thanks.
- <i>(laughs)</i>
