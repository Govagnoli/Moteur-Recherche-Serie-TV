1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:02,294
The Cylons were created by man.

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,005
They evolved.

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,884
They rebelled.

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,596
There are many copies.

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,602
And they have a plan.

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,606
Previously on Battlestar Galactica:

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,902
This will be Adama's command
until the day he dies.

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,613
And we are not going to
let him die.

9
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,407
Sir! What about our people
on the surface of Kobol?

10
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,619
If they're still alive,
they'll have to wait.

11
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,997
Lt? I think we should double-check
the supplies before we bug out.

12
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,291
We don't have the time.

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,711
I could give you a shot,
but you wouldn't like the side effects.

14
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,296
Just do it.

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,511
The time is going to come when you won't
be able to hide what you're going through.

16
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,514
Sir, his lungs are
filling up with fluid.

17
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,392
If he doesn't get more serisone soon,
he's not gonna make it.

18
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,980
Tarn, you forgot the med kit, so you're
gonna have to go back and get it.

19
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,815
Take a rifle, three clips
of ammo, and a canteen.

20
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,991
Too late.
He's not gonna make it.

21
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,202
I'm sorry, Chief.

22
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,296
Lords of Kobol,

23
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,592
take these brave men into your arms.

24
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,888
Take upon...

25
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,682
in your arms the spirits
of our fallen friends,

26
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,311
so that they may share in
the everlasting life

27
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,813
that awaits us all beyond the vale of tears.

28
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,816
So say we all.

29
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,818
So say we all.

30
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:57,284
Nothing awaits them.
No eternal life, no damnation.

31
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,204
Only oblivion.

32
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,416
Because they haven't seen
the face of God, I take it.

33
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,710
Because they died here.

34
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:09,087
On Kobol.

35
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,716
- I see.
- Doc...

36
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,384
Let's go.

37
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,887
We're moving out.

38
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,391
Doc, you hear me?

39
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,605
- We're moving out.
- I did hear you, Chief.

40
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,816
I just don't respond to the title "Doc."

41
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,111
A "dock" is a platform for
loading and unloading material.

42
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:37,991
My title is "Doctor," or
"Mr. Vice President," if you don't mind.

43
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,202
You are loading, are you not?

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,501
El-tee?

45
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:49,586
El-tee?

46
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:50,921
Crash!

47
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,091
Hmm? Oh, yeah, Chief,
I'll be right there.

48
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,484
- No Cylons.
- You sure?

49
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,701
Uh-oh. Wait a minute.
Tree-line, two o'clock.

50
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,792
- Got 'em.
- What are they doing?

51
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:32,504
- Looks like they're dismantling the ship.
- Why?

52
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,715
Why not just use it to fly
the hell out of here?

53
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,507
I don't know.

54
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,512
I can't tell.
They're... dragging it into the tree-line.

55
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,307
It's, uh... oh, wait oh minute.
They're building something.

56
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,810
- Chief, is that a...
- A missile.

57
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,813
They're building a missile battery.

58
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:53,901
Well, at least we know
why they're not chasing us.

59
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,112
Why?

60
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:01,783
- Why aren't they chasing us?
- Because they don't have to.

61
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,996
They can just sit back,
launch a missile barrage

62
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,414
that'll wipe out every
living thing in this valley.

63
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,011
Next time I say I'm in a hurry,
cycle the damn air lock faster.

64
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,387
Is this your first day?

65
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,515
Doctor, thank the Gods, you're here.
The President needs your help.

66
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,891
- Move.
- Doctor...

67
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,518
Doctor!

68
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,194
Okay... let's have some vitals.
Like now.

69
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,404
Two bullets, 9 mm.
This one lacerated the spleen,

70
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,405
the other one nicked the aorta.

71
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,492
Now, we've removed the spleen,
and we thought we repaired the aorta, but--

72
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,410
Over the past few hours,
his BP'S dropped down again.

73
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,411
It's only 80 over 40.

74
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,206
And his heart rate's creeping
into the 130s.

75
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,085
Well, you missed something.
He's still hemorrhaging somewhere.

76
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,883
We're gonna lose him unless
we can stop that bleeding.

77
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,302
Get me an ABG, CBC and coags,

78
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,596
and get set up for a rapid
sequence intubation.

79
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,515
- Is he gonna make it?
- How should I know?

80
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,683
I'm not a psychic.

81
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,309
Now get the hell out of here.

82
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:23,407
Fragged

Earth

89
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,028
It is a mess in here.

90
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,489
Looks like the mesenteric
artery may have been damaged.

91
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,283
3.7 mac.

92
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,996
God damn it, Kim, learn the instruments.
I said a 3.7 mac!

93
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,915
Sorry.

94
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,792
Clamp. Clamp!

95
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,212
Dr. Cottle, his pressure's dropping.
It's 60 on 30.

96
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,213
Heart rate's starting to fall.

97
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,089
I don't think he can last much longer.

98
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:21,798
Just stay focused.

99
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,799
Get some more suction in here

100
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,886
so I can see what I'm doing.

101
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,406
Ahem. Colonel...
how's the Commander?

102
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,699
What?

103
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,203
- Uh, ahem, how's the Commander?
- He's still in surgery.

104
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,996
What's on your mind?

105
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,499
Uh, I need some medication
for the President.

106
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,293
She's not the President anymore.
Cottle's a little busy right now.

107
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:58,919
Sir, she's very ill...

108
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,588
Why aren't you in the brig?

109
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,219
Um... because...
no one put me in there?

110
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,900
What the hell's all this?
Why aren't you in the brig?

111
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:22,693
I'm on duty, Sir.

112
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,403
Planning the search and rescue mission.

113
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,281
Search and rescue?
For who?

114
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:31,285
We lose a plane, and nobody tells me?!

115
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,498
For our Raptor crew down
on the surface of Kobol, Sir?

116
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,505
Simes is senior pilot now.
He can plan the SAR.

117
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:46,717
You asked me to command the
air group when I'm on duty.

118
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,511
So am I in command... or not?

119
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,314
What's the status of
the SAR, Captain?

120
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,483
Well, we don't know in what
area Raptor 3 went down.

121
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,903
So the only realistic chance
we have of finding her is to hope

122
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,405
that her transponder disaster
beacon is still functioning.

123
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,700
I intend to take two Raptors,
one with medical personnel,

124
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,619
and make five low level
orbits of the planet.

125
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,788
What about the Cylon base ship
that Lieutenant Valerii supposedly destroyed?

126
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,415
What if she was lying?

127
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,501
Racetrack confirmed the
destruction of the base ship,

128
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,712
and I checked the gun camera
footage from the Raptors,

129
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,881
which verifies it.

130
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,010
Lieutenant Gaeta,
why are you hovering about?

131
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,803
- Uh, it's the press.
- The press?

132
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,515
They're demanding to know
how much longer we plan on holding them,

133
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,600
and when they can
contact their home ships.

134
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,312
They demand? They're in no
position to demand anything.

135
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,899
You tell them to shut their yaps.
We'll get to them in due time.

136
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,317
Excuse me, Colonel.

137
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,488
Shuttle from the Zephyr has just requested
permission to enter the landing pattern.

138
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,615
- The Zephyr?
- Yes, Sir.

139
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,700
Evidently the Quorum of Twelve is aboard.

140
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,410
They're demanding to see you.

141
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:56,912
They demand?

142
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,290
Demanding job,
commanding a Battlestar.

143
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,919
Clear them to land.
Put them in the ward room

144
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,506
and hold them there until
I have time to see them.

145
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,016
Madam President.

146
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,017
What's wrong with her?

147
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,020
I don't know, but she's clearly sick.
You can see that, can't you?

148
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,815
Well, there's nothing I can do.

149
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,487
- Madam President...
- Yes?

150
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,783
Can I get you anything
while you're in the brig?

151
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:40,372
Really?

152
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,585
No, thank you.

153
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,511
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:00,184
I'm finding it... hard to think.
It's withdrawal.

155
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,020
- The chamalla?
- Yes.

156
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,606
I'm trying to get you more.

157
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,482
Go fast.

158
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:22,789
I count... six missiles being
carried into the forest site so far.

159
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,212
It's all so pointless.

160
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,802
We kill them.

161
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,514
And they kill us.

162
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,519
So we kill more of them.

163
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,107
They kill more of us.

164
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,692
What's the point anymore?

165
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,693
You and your...

166
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,988
race invented murder.

167
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,784
Invented killing for sport, greed, envy.

168
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,579
It's man's one true art form.

169
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,415
You've done some killing
of your own, I think.

170
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:09,795
Yes, well, we're your children.
You taught us well.

171
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,590
Why does God want to bring
a child into this kind of world anyway?

172
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,593
Because, despite everything,
despite all of it,

173
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,680
he still wants to offer you salvation.

174
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,103
Our child will bring
that salvation, but only if you

175
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,396
accept your role as her father.

176
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,399
And her guardian.

177
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,405
I'm not ready for that.
All right?

178
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,491
I'm not a father.
I'm not a guardian.

179
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:43,412
I'm not a moral leader
capable of leading anyone.

180
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,205
Let alone a baby.

181
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,583
Be a man, Gaius.

182
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,084
What?

183
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,712
Be a man.

184
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,506
Whatever else
you are, you are that.

185
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,719
The time is coming when
you'll have to act like one.

186
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,017
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
El-tee, check this out.

187
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,518
What do you got, Chief?

188
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:10,689
45 degrees east of the launcher.
You see that tree stump?

189
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,987
- What the hell is that?
- It looks like a dradis dish.

190
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,282
At least, the Cylon version of a dradis dish.

191
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,202
It's probably salvaged from
the nose cone of the ship.

192
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,290
They're building an anti-aircraft battery.

193
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,002
Anti-aircraft? For what?
There are no other aircraft around here.

194
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,214
The Galactica's gonna send
a search and rescue team.

195
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:40,010
When they do, that's at least two
Raptors doing a low pass over the crash site.

196
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,889
When those Raptors come looking for us,
risking their lives to rescue us...

197
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,308
Cylons will shoot 'em down.

198
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:57,194
Seven birds down for repairs.
Three out on picket duty with the cap.

199
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,780
Uh, con traffic, Sir.
Priority messages are on top.

200
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,283
Cut to the chase, Captain!
How long before you launch the SAR?

201
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,285
Come on, Dee,
these are all marked "priority."

202
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,204
Sorry, Sir, that's how they came in.

203
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,580
I'm cannibalizing 305 for parts.

204
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,582
Should be up in the air in,
I don't know, 90 minutes.

205
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,920
90 minutes?!
We got men down on that frakking planet!

206
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,595
Get your head in the game.
You do your job, or go back to the brig.

207
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,392
Are on the members of
the Quorum in the ward room?

208
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,810
All 12, Sir.

209
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,395
Don't suppose you wanna do this for me?

210
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,105
Never was much for public speaking, Sir.

211
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,108
So why are we here under guard?
That's what I want to know.

212
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:40,195
Laura Roslin suborned mutiny
and sedition aboard this ship.

213
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,700
She caused a key military
asset to be lost at a critical moment!

214
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:48,412
The Commander felt he had no choice
but to remove her from power.

215
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,789
- You've said that, several times.
- Well, ...

216
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:54,501
You don't seem to be listening, Colonel.
It does not matter what Adama felt.

217
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:58,881
- He had absolutely no authority...
- Adama knew exactly what he was doing.

218
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,593
He was paving the way to declare martial
law and usher in a military dictatorship.

219
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:07,181
- Isn't that right, Colonel?
- I can't speak for the Commander.

220
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,893
He's still in surgery.

221
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,395
Well, you seem to be giving
the orders around here.

222
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,981
So what exactly are you planning to do?

223
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,401
- Are you declaring martial law?
- Absolutely not.

224
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:23,780
I know for a fact that the old man
hated the very idea of martial law.

225
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:27,492
He believed in freedom and
democracy and all that good stuff.

226
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:32,497
Well, since this is still a...
democracy, and all that good stuff,

227
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,791
I move that the Quorum demand

228
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,710
immediate access to President Roslin.

229
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,712
Excellent. I second it.

230
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,506
All those in favor.

231
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,007
Aye.

232
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,886
Motion carries. Colonel,

233
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:49,806
we demand immediate
access to the President.

234
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,607
I will take your "demand"
under advisement.

235
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,110
Madam President.

236
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,906
Madam President.

237
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,700
- I have to consider...
- Laura. Laura.

238
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,588
- Hello.
- Hi.

239
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,716
Are you all right?

240
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:33,892
I, uh, just came down to see if
there was anything I could do for you.

241
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,103
Anything I can get you?

242
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,906
I would like to have a conversation
with my attorney.

243
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:48,907
Could you arrange that?

244
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,119
Yeah. Yeah, sure, right.

245
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,793
Laura, do you know where you are?

246
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,004
I'm in jail.

247
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,090
- What's my name?
- Have we met?

248
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,592
I'm...

249
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,220
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

250
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,307
There's just...
a ringing.

251
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:14,892
Excuse me.

252
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,685
Ringing?

253
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,484
Right.

254
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,113
Okay, then.
Take care.

255
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,085
Oh, my Gods.

256
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:43,879
Ellen Tigh.

257
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,089
Ellen?

258
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,899
Lords of Kobol...

259
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,886
The launcher looks like a simple
point-and-shoot. No built-in guidance.

260
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,597
Ordnance appear to be standard
ship-to-ship missiles.

261
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:38,517
They're modifying them for
atmospheric flight.

262
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,686
one Cylon Centurion walks the perimeter,

263
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:43,981
stopping at regular intervals.

264
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:49,611
The dradis dish that controls
the missiles is on the 4.5 kg wavelength,

265
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:50,612
judging by the diameter.

266
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,116
It's guarded by two
Centurions, I think.

267
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:58,120
I'm sorry, Doc, did you say it
was guarded by two Centurions?

268
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,413
Yes, I did.

269
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,916
Okay, is the dradis guarded
continuously of intermittently?

270
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,503
I saw two Centurions

271
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:10,507
through the field glasses...
continuously, for five minutes.

272
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:14,094
In that time, they didn't leave their post.

273
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:32,029
So there's three toasters near the launcher.

274
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,114
Two more out by the dish.

275
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,115
That's a lot of Cylons.

276
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,496
You ever handle a weapon?

277
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,292
Who, me?

278
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,794
No.

279
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,380
I'm not a soldier, Crashdown.

280
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,217
I'll try to give you the most simple
assignment, but I'm gonna need every man.

281
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,220
You're not suggesting
we attack the Cylons?

282
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,305
We owe it to Socinus and Tarn
to tack the frakkers

283
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:02,100
out before they kill anyone else.

284
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,603
We have equal numbers.
We have the element of surprise.

285
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,813
Therefore, we have the initiative.

286
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:10,484
We can attack at the time
and place of our choosing.

287
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:17,491
El-tee, a word... in private.

288
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,789
He's crazy.

289
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:28,001
I'm not trained for this kind of thing.
I've never fired a gun in my life.

290
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,879
I haven't fired one since basic.

291
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,214
You?

292
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:36,009
I just joined to pay for dental school.

293
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,600
Basic ground assault was
a long time ago. For all of us.

294
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,186
Those aren't training officers out there.
They're programmed killing machines.

295
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,272
We don't have any choice.
Galactica will definitely be sending

296
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,189
a search and rescue party,

297
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,692
It's just a matter of time.
And if we don't take out that launcher...

298
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:54,319
we can't go up against an armed
and defended position like that.

299
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,405
- They'll wipe us out in the first
two minutes. - That's enough!

300
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:02,494
Chief, look, under the circumstances,
it's important that you keep your cool.

301
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:07,791
- I don't believe I've lost my cool.
- I disagree.

302
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,211
Look, I don't want to attack
the launcher either, but it's our duty.

303
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:16,383
We owe it to the rescue party,
and we owe it to Socinus and Tarn.

304
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,220
I fail to see what this has
to do with Socinus and Tarn.

305
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:23,807
Maybe that's why I'm an officer,
and you're not.

306
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,315
Dismissed.

307
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,206
This briefing will outline
a plan of attack in five graphs.

308
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,208
Graph one: Situation.

309
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:53,212
Our situation is that we are stranded on
Kobol with a group of five Cylons

310
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:57,090
who plan to use an AAU
to destroy any SAR craft sent to find us.

311
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:58,884
There are no friendly forces present.

312
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,302
What's all this graph business?

313
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,596
- Graph two...
- It's a five-paragraph order.

314
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,099
It's a basic command tool.
It's taught at officer candidate school.

315
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:09,895
It's just not usually used this...
literally in the field.

316
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,816
Graph four: Execution.

317
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,612
We will assault the Cylon launch
site from the northwest, using...

318
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,489
Oh, come on.

319
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,407
This is absurd.

320
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,202
What, we're talking on
the Cylon army, are we?

321
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,411
Us?

322
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:27,913
Look at us.

323
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,706
What, with two rifles and a canteen?

324
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,416
- Have you lost your mind?
- That's enough, Doctor.

325
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,212
Is it? Look, no disrespect,
but why are we always going uphill?

326
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,714
Does anybody else think
that this plan is frakking nuts?

327
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,592
I'll tell you what's fair. This is fair.
We'll have a show of hands...

328
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,094
No!
Absolutely not!

329
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:45,389
This is not a democracy!
The El-Tee's in charge!

330
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:46,890
The El-Tee's in charge.

331
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,517
No ifs, no ands, no buts.

332
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,103
He say we go, we go.
There's no questions...

333
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:55,899
We've already lost two men, Chief!
How many more people are we gonna lose?

334
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,821
You need to sit down.
And shut up right now.

335
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,781
Nobody tells me to shut up.
I'm the Vice President...

336
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:05,492
You need to sit down
and shut up right now.

337
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,086
Your briefing, El-Tee.

338
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,798
Thank you, Chief.

339
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,217
Graph four.

340
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,511
We'll approach the Cylon launch
site from the northwest,

341
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,598
using natural ground
cover to mask our approach.

342
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:33,020
Our objective is the command and control
console. once we reach this position,

343
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:40,194
Cally, you're gonna flank out to the left,
making a feint on the Cylon position.

344
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,780
Hopefully drawing their
fire long enough for me and Seelix

345
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:47,409
to flank out to the right and
get a shot at the console.

346
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:51,705
Tyrol, you and the Vice President
will stay at position one,

347
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,792
and provide covering fire for
both flanking maneuvers.

348
00:22:56,502 --> 00:23:00,380
I have been given the opportunity to
perceive the scriptures more clearly.

349
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,510
Anything that impedes that,
I have to view as contrary to

350
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,386
the survival of the human species.

351
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,598
This is ridiculous.

352
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,185
Look, she obviously needs her medication.

353
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:14,311
I keep trying to tell anyone that'll listen.

354
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:17,814
Sounds like she's talking about
the scrolls of the Prophet Pythia.

355
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,107
I suppose.

356
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:22,402
Pythia foretold the rise of a leader.

357
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:26,490
A leader who would lead all
humanity to salvation.

358
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,909
So say the Gods.

359
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:29,910
Impedes that action...

360
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:36,083
You seem to know a lot
about the scriptures.

361
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:40,504
I'm from Gemenon. We believe in
the literal truth of the scriptures.

362
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,297
Contrary to the survival of the human...

363
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,508
Corporal Venner?

364
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:48,262
There's a, uh, a drug that
priests sometimes use.

365
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:49,471
It's called chamalla extract.

366
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,108
- Guess it's happy hour.
- What's happy about it?

367
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,991
The old man is still in surgery.

368
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:15,414
And I got a boatload of politicians
and press demanding to see Laura Roslin.

369
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:18,417
- Let 'em.
- Yeah, right.

370
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,294
- She's crazy.
- I know.

371
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:22,713
No, no. Really, Saul.

372
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:26,216
She's lost it. I just went
down to the brig to see her.

373
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,302
- You did?
- She's...

374
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:31,180
completely nuts.

375
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,891
She doesn't even know
where she is anymore.

376
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:37,019
- You're kidding.
- You should let 'em see her.

377
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,104
The press, the Quorum.

378
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,315
All of 'em.

379
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:45,402
I mean, the little schoolteacher's
mind has gone bye-bye.

380
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:48,989
And the Vice President is
either missing or dead.

381
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:55,204
That leaves you in unchallenged
command of this ship.

382
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:59,208
- And this fleet. - Just until the
old man gets back on his feet.

383
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,002
Well, of course.

384
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,304
Galactica, Apollo. We are
preparing to jump to Kobol.

385
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:14,890
Roger that, Apollo.
You are clear to jump.

386
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:15,891
And good hunting.

387
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:19,603
Thank you, Galactica.
Let's go find our people.

388
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:30,906
Okay, cock the rifle,
click the safety, open the scope.

389
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:36,286
Okay, cock the rifle,
click the safety, open the scope.

390
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,915
One of you will turn against the others.

391
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:43,210
- During the mission?
- Yes.

392
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,588
- One of us will betray the others?
- Yes.

393
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,091
- During the attack?
- Yes.

394
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:53,303
But if the attack fails?

395
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,097
You'll die.

396
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:57,808
Not me.

397
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:01,186
I am God's instrument.

398
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:06,316
God turned his back on Kobol.

399
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,195
Turned his back on man and
the false Gods he worshiped.

400
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,198
What happens on Kobol is not his will.

401
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:14,992
Saddle up.

402
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,788
It's time to junk some toasters.

403
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,707
XO.

404
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,417
Combat.
Dualla here, Sir.

405
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:08,504
The Quorum is demanding to
see the former President.

406
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:11,381
They're being pretty adamant and
they're giving the sentries a hard time.

407
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:13,091
Uh, maybe we should tell them to
shove their demand

408
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:15,511
up their collective asses,
how about that?

409
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:25,103
Yes, Sir. I need
instructions for the sentries.

410
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:28,982
- They're asking how to respond.
- Tell them that they are going to get to see

411
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:33,612
what has become of their precious
President. You tell them that.

412
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:55,509
I got a transponder signal.
Definitely Colonial.

413
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,511
Trying to establish a lock.

414
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,180
Got it.

415
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,018
Northern hemisphere.
Looks like mountainous terrain.

416
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:07,020
There's a valley.

417
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:08,814
Take us out of orbit.

418
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:11,191
Signal Raptor Two to form up on us.

419
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,417
There they are.

420
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,587
All three of 'em, right where
they're supposed to be.

421
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,589
All right, people, this is it.
We're going in.

422
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:36,300
Cally, move up the tree-line
to point alpha.

423
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,886
El-tee, there's five Cylons
at the launch site.

424
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,220
What?

425
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:48,812
Something's wrong, isn't it?
Something's wrong with the plan...

426
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:49,897
Quiet down, There's nothing wrong.

427
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,982
There's just a couple Cylons that
we didn't account for.

428
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:53,692
That makes for seven Cylons.

429
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,611
Five here, and
two up at the dish.

430
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:59,489
Are you absolutely certain about
the two guards at the dish?

431
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:02,784
I know what I saw.

432
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,705
Maybe there are only five Cylons.
They just changed their deployment.

433
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,790
They brought the two that
were guarding the dish down here.

434
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:11,418
Now the dish is unprotected.

435
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,713
Gods, Chief, that dish is,
like, almost a click away.

436
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,298
So what?

437
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,633
It's unprotected. We can go take it out.

438
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,218
We don't have to take on
the whole Cylon army.

439
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,809
- What the hell was that?
- Sonic booms.

440
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:29,811
Spacecraft entering
the upper atmosphere.

441
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:32,397
It's the SAR mission. They're here.
They are right up there, Chief.

442
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:32,731
We gotta go.

443
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:35,692
There's no time for discussion.
All right, everyone, move out.

444
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,111
It's game time. We're taking these toasters
out before they kill any more of us.

445
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,293
- Cally, I said move.
- I can't.

446
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,420
What?

447
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:57,005
That's an order.

448
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:59,591
She doesn't have to.
We can just go take out the dish.

449
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,302
Cally, you have to move.
Cally, this is not a joke.

450
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:05,597
Go. This is not a game, Cally.
Go. We have people counting on us.

451
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:07,182
They're up there, Cally.
Move!

452
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:10,811
Listen to me. We still have time to
double back and take out the dish.

453
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:14,189
Shut up for a second. Cally, Cally.
Specialist. You have your orders.

454
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:16,108
I need you to go out there and
create a distraction now!

455
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:17,484
Move!

456
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:18,986
- Move!
- Lt.

457
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:21,280
There were only supposed to be
three Cylons and now there are five.

458
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:24,199
How are we supposed to
take on five Cylons?

459
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:26,201
Frak orders, frak court marshal.
Our people are up there.

460
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:27,077
We have to save them.

461
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,912
We don't have any time.
Move!

462
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,289
- I can't do it.
- I said move!

463
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:31,582
No!

464
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:34,710
Chief!

465
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:38,213
Put it down.
Put it down.

466
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,174
You're going out there, Cally.
You're going out there or

467
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:41,175
I'm gonna blow your brains out.

468
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:43,510
Right here, right now.

469
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:45,804
Put it down.

470
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:48,223
- Hey, El-Lee. Easy.
- Take it easy.

471
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:49,224
I'm gonna count to three.

472
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:53,312
This is crazy.
This is crazy!

473
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:54,479
One.

474
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:58,692
Put it down right now.

475
00:30:58,817 --> 00:30:59,818
Oh, my Gods.

476
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:02,196
Listen to me!
Drop your weapon.

477
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:03,405
Two.

478
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:08,118
Three.

479
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,980
Fall back! Fall back!

480
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,899
Go! Go! Go!

481
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:45,405
Doc, Let's go!

482
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:56,083
Now you're a man.

483
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:08,011
- ETA?
- Five minutes!

484
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:29,992
Oh, Cally!

485
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,196
Doc! Gimme the launcher!

486
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:08,906
Gimme the launcher, Doc!

487
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:10,407
Come on!

488
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,888
Missiles!
There's a battery down there!

489
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:36,517
Evasive!
Break, break, break!

490
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:45,400
No lock. No lock!
They're not locking on us.

491
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,417
Chief.

492
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:15,514
Stay there!
Stay there!

493
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:19,518
Chief!

494
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:55,721
You're welcome.

495
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:15,407
- Viewing time at the zoo.
- Glad to see you hold the President...

496
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,286
- ...in such high esteem.
- Your day's gonna come, laughing boy.

497
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:20,913
Let's go.

498
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,591
I don't know, what to do.

499
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:35,886
All right, the show is over.

500
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:38,388
Let's give her some privacy.
Everybody out.

501
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:40,390
Let's go back to the ward room
and we'll, uh,

502
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:43,018
talk about the business of
how we proceed from here.

503
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:48,106
Thank you all for coming.
I have a statement I'd like to make.

504
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:52,486
The attempted military coup
against the lawful government of

505
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:57,282
the colonies is illegal, ill-advised and
clearly doomed to failure.

506
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:01,328
I have not resigned the Presidency and
I will fight this action with

507
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:02,621
everything at my command.

508
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,793
She's crazy, she's nuts. She thinks
she a prophet or some such nonsense.

509
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:10,295
Just hold on Colonel let her speak.
Just ask her, ask her, she'll tell you.

510
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,589
Just listen to her.
What was it, the uhh,

511
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:17,302
the Arrow of Apollo will open the uhh, the
Tomb of Artemis. Or some such nonsense.

512
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:20,097
Everything I've done is
consistent and logical.

513
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,015
We have found Kobol,

514
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:25,185
we have found the city of the Gods
and when we retrieve the arrow

515
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,896
we will open the tomb of Athena

516
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,191
and we find the road to Earth.

517
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:35,487
Madam President, have you
read the Scrolls of Pythia?

518
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:40,409
Many times, and I humbly
believe I am fulfilling the role

519
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:42,286
of the leader.

520
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,291
Okay, enough of this
nonsense, everyone out.

521
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:49,209
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

522
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:51,295
Sarah. You represent Gemenon,

523
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,881
you know more about the scrolls and
the scriptures than anyone else here,

524
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:55,382
why don't you speak up?

525
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:59,386
The scrolls tell us that a dying
leader will lead us to salvation.

526
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:01,597
She's not dying.
She's crazy.

527
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,390
I am dying.

528
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:09,021
I have terminal breast cancer.
Dr. Cottle will verify the diagnosis.

529
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,400
I have a few months to live.

530
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:16,987
And in that time, I will lead
the people to salvation.

531
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:20,115
It is my sole purpose.

532
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:25,287
Praise be to the Gods.
Here is our salvation.

533
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:38,091
- Sergeant of the guard,
- Yes, Sir.

534
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:41,011
Remove these people from the brig and
escort them back to their shuttle.

535
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:42,596
Yes, Sir.

536
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,002
Thank you, Corporal.

537
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:16,713
Thank the Gods.

538
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:31,019
It's a hell of a butchers Bill, Chief.

539
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:35,816
How did Crashdown die?

540
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,901
Leading the charge.

541
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:45,284
He gave his life in the...
in the finest tradition of the service.

542
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,214
Yeah. He was a hero.
To the end.

543
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:20,611
I'm so proud of you Gaius.

544
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:23,989
Why?

545
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:31,079
- 'Cause I've taken a life?
- It's what makes you human.

546
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,291
Is it?

547
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:38,086
Not conscious thought?

548
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:42,883
Not poetry or art or music, literature?

549
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:50,891
Murder.
Murder is my heritage.

550
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:57,314
Is that the lesson I'm supposed to
pass on to our child?

551
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,818
Shh. It'll be all right, Gaius.

552
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:04,404
Okay, Doctor, let's go!

553
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:07,783
Doctor, come on!
We gotta go.

554
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,996
I'll be your conscience.

555
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:15,791
Come on, Doctor!
We gotta get outta here!

556
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:38,605
He'll live.

557
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:40,816
When will he wake up?

558
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:45,404
Knowing him, when he damn well
wants to, probably.

559
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,703
I really frakked things up for you, Bill.

560
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,717
The events which took place aboard
Colonial one are unfortunate.

561
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,511
Laura Roslin's actions in
suborning mutiny and

562
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:12,097
sedition among the military
could not be tolerated.

563
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:17,311
Therefore Commander Adama was left with no
choice other than to remove her from office.

564
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:20,689
Miss Roslin is now resting comfortably
aboard this ship,

565
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:25,611
where she will remain until such time
as the Commander deems otherwise.

566
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:30,616
As it appears obvious that
the government cannot function
under the current circumstances,

567
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:35,495
I have decided to dissolve
the Quorum of Twelve.

568
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,791
And as of this moment,
I have declared martial law.

569
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:16,286
- Get those people the hell off my ship.
- Yes, Sir.
