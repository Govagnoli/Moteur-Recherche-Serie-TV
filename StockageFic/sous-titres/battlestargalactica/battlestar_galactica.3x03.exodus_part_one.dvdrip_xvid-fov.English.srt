1
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,315
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,113
l can't figure it. Weeks in detention,
then suddenly they let me out.

3
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,715
l want a specific place,
l want a specific time

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,429
for a very high-level meeting
of the insurgency leadership.

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,637
<i>And if l don't get it,</i>
<i>we pick up Saul again.</i>

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,871
And this time...
he'll lose more than an eye.

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,952
<i>(man)</i> The child's life
must be protected at all costs.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,352
The first Cylon-human hybrid.
It truly is a miracle from God.

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,031
We lost her.
We did the best we could, but she's dead,

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,111
and that's all there is to it.

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,959
She's so beautiful.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,510
You understand, Maya,
this adoption requires absolute secrecy.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,953
You have my word.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,237
There's a Raptor out there every day
listening for a call,

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,790
and it's there because the old man
isn't gonna leave us to Cylons.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,757
"Will make contact this frequency
every 12 hours."

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,990
"Have hope.
We're coming for you."

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,914
Cylons removed launch keys from
colonial ships. Location unknown.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,630
Best option is that Saul and people on the
ground get their hands on the originals.

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,234
Admiral's decided
to put boots on the ground.

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,872
He wants to send an officer as a liaison
to coordinate the rescue op.

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,714
- Makes sense. What's the problem?
- It's who he's sending.

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,878
This plan is reckless. You are risking
the lives of the entire human race.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,391
Plan to resume the search for Earth with
the <i>Pegasus</i> and the fleet. l'm going back.

25
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,553
We round up leaders of the insurgency
and we execute them, publicly.

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,189
We round up groups off the street
and we execute them, publicly.

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,114
Send a message that the gloves are
coming off. The insurgency stops now,

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,751
or else we start reducing the human
population to a more manageable size.

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,670
Let them stretch their legs
for a minute.

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,550
<i>(Jammer)</i> All right. Everybody, out.
Five-minute rest break. Come on. Move.

31
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,189
You. Over here.

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,033
Run. Run!
Don't look back.

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,678
Go!

34
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,830
<i>(gunfire)</i>

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,515
- <i>(Ellen)</i> Can l help you?
- No. Uh...

36
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,591
- There we go.
- Thanks.

37
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,034
- Sorry.
- No, that's all right. It doesn't hurt.

38
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,318
l appreciate you doing this.
l can't seem to get it right in the mirror.

39
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,391
Saul.

40
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,112
Um... l want you to know...

41
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,310
that l would do anything for you.

42
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,912
Yes.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,275
<i>(clattering)</i>

44
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,954
Cally's on the list.
They're gonna kill her.

45
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,953
- What list? What are you talking about?
- l got this.

46
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,713
l got this from the source
in the administration.

47
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,997
It's a death list,
and Cally's name is on it.

48
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,158
They're rounding up
people in the city.

49
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,438
- Cally's already in detention.
- This is organised by transport vehicles.

50
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,910
Cally's in a group heading
for map coordinate x-ray seven.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,753
l know, but where the frak is that?
How are we going...

52
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,197
Calm down, dammit!
Think clearly here, Chief, or she's dead.

53
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,352
We've already figured out
their map-coordinate system.

54
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,956
It's referred to on the list of Cylon freqs
you got from the last dead drop.

55
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,749
Holy frak! You're right.
l can extrapolate the coordinate system.

56
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,594
Cally's group has to pick up people
in town first. That'll take time.

57
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,673
Take four men
and get there ahead of the trucks.

58
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,034
Chief.

59
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,999
Pull it together. You won't do her any good
if you get caught too.

60
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,393
Besides, the last thing your son wants
is me and Ellen for parents.

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,830
Find that list, Chief.

62
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,912
<i>(mutters)</i> Where the frak is it?

63
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,112
Dammit! Dammit!
Where's that frakking list?

64
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,839
OK. It's gotta be here.
It's gotta be.

65
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,555
There. That's it.

66
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,831
Think. Come on.

67
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,276
Here it is. OK.
X-ray seven, one, four, three...

68
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,596
Hey, Chief.

69
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,148
Good day for a walk, huh?

70
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,553
Get two men together.
We're going to Pergamus Flats.

71
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,068
- Talk to me.
- Don't like it. Too much cover on this trail.

72
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,678
We could catch enfilade fire
from there, there and along there.

73
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,639
Let's move out.
l'm going to the rendezvous point.

74
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,439
Place your men on the ridge for cover.

75
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,671
Go, Panthers!

76
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,836
C-Bucks rule!

77
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,632
Hey, Sam.
It's been a while.

78
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,837
Funny, l feel like
l see you every day.

79
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,316
Come on.

80
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,192
<i>(Chief whispers)</i> There's the trucks.

81
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,870
Move down to the ridge.
Move down to the ridge.

82
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,110
You, here.

83
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,395
This is it.
Lock and load.

84
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,360
All right.
What do we see?

85
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,592
Oh, frak me!

86
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,559
- <i>(Seelix)</i> What?
- They got Laura Roslin and Tom Zarek.

87
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,110
- Is there any sign of Cally?
- Not yet.

88
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,953
<i>Galactica's</i> got a rescue plan in place,
ready to go.

89
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,112
My job is to get keys
for civilian ships still on the ground,

90
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,239
then coordinate the rescue with your
evacuation plan. When can we meet Tigh?

91
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,880
We'll wait till night
before we head to the city.

92
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,556
There she is.

93
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,631
There she is!

94
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,590
Oh, my gods!
There she is.

95
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,510
What the frak's she doing?

96
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,160
<i>(Chief)</i> She's making a run for it.

97
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,516
The bulletheads are lining up.

98
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,034
<i>(Chief)</i> It's a firing squad.

99
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,191
Sight in on the Centurions right now.

100
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,558
Cally's in our line of fire.
If we shoot, we're gonna hit her.

101
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,518
Then count to five and open fire.

102
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,031
Skin-jobs.
Should we take 'em down?

103
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,797
Where there are skin-jobs,
there are bulletheads. Bring up the RPG.

104
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,278
- There's a system of tunnels running...
- Shh!

105
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,874
Do you hear that?

106
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,479
<i>(Sharon)</i> Get back!

107
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,558
- Go, go, go!
- <i>(man)</i> Get behind the tree line!

108
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,200
1001,

109
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,714
1002,

110
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,074
1003,

111
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,799
1004,

112
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,999
1005.

113
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,228
- Frak this! We gotta get out of here.
- Stay put. Trust me.

114
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,878
Now!

115
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,469
Thanks.

116
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,997
Shh, shh, shh.

117
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,914
They were waiting for us,
where we thought.

118
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,390
Sir, you better take a look at this.

119
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,598
l found it on a dead skin-job.
It's your handwriting, isn't it?

120
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,592
Yeah, damn right it is.

121
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,875
We were sold out.

122
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,757
Ellen.

123
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,472
<i>(man)</i> Check them out.
Make sure they're OK.

124
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,913
- You all right, Tom?
- Yeah.

125
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,437
Been a while since l had a woman
throw me to the ground.

126
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,034
Not quite as much fun
as l remember.

127
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,436
Hurts, huh? Good.

128
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,991
Then l hope it hurts a long, long time
till you go to Download City.

129
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,072
- You all right down there?
- Oh, my gods!

130
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,390
It's good to see you, Chief.

131
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,119
Good to see you too, ma'am.

132
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,070
What happens now?
Where do we go from here?

133
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,029
We're going home. We're going home.
Admiral Adama's on his way.

134
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,159
We're getting off this rock.
We're going back to <i>Galactica.</i>

135
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,878
<i>(baby cries)</i>

136
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,591
<i>(baby screams)</i>

137
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,070
Don't worry about it, Gaius.

138
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,996
- It's all right. It doesn't matter to me.
- You can stop that right now, OK?

139
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,072
My ego's not so fragile as all that.

140
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,919
These things happen...
or they don't happen.

141
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,597
So what shall we talk about?

142
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,875
Shall we talk about your day?

143
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,916
How was your day, darling?

144
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,551
How was your day at the office?

145
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,033
My office.

146
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,156
Any news?

147
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,395
No?

148
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,758
Well, let me tell you about my day,
because it was a hoot.

149
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,597
l had the most fascinating chat
with one of the Dorals.

150
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,194
He's got this theory

151
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,149
about sanitation being the key
to regaining human trust and confidence.

152
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,959
Something about...

153
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,996
toilet paper.

154
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,992
No, lack of toilet paper.
That's it.

155
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,275
If people could
wipe their bums properly,

156
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,511
there'd be a measurable uptick
in the polls.

157
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,357
Four months of this, Gaius.

158
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,671
Four months of watching you
slip further and further down

159
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,276
into this well
of self-hatred and loathing.

160
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,477
Do you know
what l've given up for you?

161
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,391
Do you?

162
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,750
Do you know,
what with the occupation and everything,

163
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,118
l can't really say
l've given it that much thought recently.

164
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,831
Don't go.

165
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,397
Please.

166
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,879
That doesn't look so bad.

167
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,271
Hey, there's something
that l wanted to, um, say to you.

168
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,512
l'm sorry that l left you alone.

169
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,751
l didn't mean for you to get hurt.

170
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,479
l was upset with myself

171
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,120
and not you, OK?

172
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,910
Uh...

173
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,596
Grown-ups
do stupid things sometimes.

174
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,356
We get, uh,
caught up in our own little world

175
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,556
until it's almost too late.

176
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,034
<i>(door closes)</i>

177
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,829
You have no idea
what l'm saying to you, do you?

178
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,799
OK. Time to take a nap.

179
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,471
Don't be afraid.
l know who you are, what you are.

180
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,074
Poor thing.

181
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,189
You must be terrified.

182
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,799
Do you have any candy?

183
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,711
Candy?

184
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,472
No.

185
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,589
Chamalla's so bitter.

186
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,677
Oh, Zeus sees all.
Sees you, Number Three.

187
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,719
Sees your pain, your destiny.

188
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,839
All the gods weep for you.

189
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,990
There is no Zeus.

190
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,230
No other god but God.

191
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,073
Oh, you don't believe that any more.

192
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,073
You don't know what you believe,
and that is why you're here.

193
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,439
It's not true. l don't even know why l'm
here. This is the stupidest thing l ever did.

194
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,308
It is your dream
that brings you to me.

195
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,597
How do you know about that?

196
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,718
l have a message for you
from the one you worship.

197
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,191
He speaks through me to you,
just as he speaks in your dreams.

198
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,350
The message is...

199
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,231
the fruit borne of two peoples

200
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,914
is alive.

201
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,155
A child named after the wife and sister
of the all-knowing Zeus.

202
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,596
Hera lives.

203
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,389
That's not true.
The child is dead.

204
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,314
You will hold her in your arms
and you'll know, for the first time,

205
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,313
what it is to feel true love.

206
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,948
But you'll lose
everything you've done here.

207
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,032
Wish l had
some chocolate caramels.

208
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,554
Let's move! We got some people
waiting for their ride down there.

209
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,789
Will you quit looking at me like that?

210
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,996
Like what?

211
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,071
You know like what.

212
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,675
Like we're never
gonna see each other again.

213
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,320
We will.
It's a good plan, Dee.

214
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,473
Take care of the admiral?

215
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,755
Take care of his son.

216
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,999
All right, <i>Pegasus</i> crew on the port side
of the line, <i>Galactica</i> on the right.

217
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,749
"Their enemies will divide them,

218
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,038
their colonies broken
in the fiery chasm of space."

219
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,072
"Their shining days renounced
by a multitude of dark sacrifices,

220
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,392
yet still they will remain
always together."

221
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,789
<i>(all)</i> Always together.

222
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,195
<i>(man)</i> l'll be back before you know it.

223
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,193
- <i>(man #2)</i> See you on the other side.
- <i>(man #3)</i> l'll hold you to that.

224
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,750
That's the third time
you've taken a look at your watch.

225
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,956
- Got dinner plans?
- <i>(chuckles)</i>

226
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,758
No, l was just...

227
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,230
l was just thinking.
Sharon's probably on the ground by now.

228
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,311
l know.

229
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,556
These are your orders.

230
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,359
You'll find the rendezvous point there.

231
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,989
Take the civilian fleet
and wait for me for 18 hours.

232
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,390
If l'm not back in 18 hours
then find Earth.

233
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,550
Yeah, right.

234
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,949
l'll see you at the rendezvous point.

235
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,115
18 hours.
Try not to be late.

236
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,079
l'm getting old.
l'm a little slow, but l'll be there.

237
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,475
Gods, l wish l could talk you out of this.

238
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,155
You can't. You tried.

239
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,478
- You know, Dad, um...
- Don't.

240
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,517
Don't make me cry
on my own hangar deck.

241
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,631
<i>(sighs)</i>

242
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,271
l'll see you there.

243
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,514
Permission to leave your ship, Admiral.

244
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,558
Permission granted, Commander.

245
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,431
Attention!

246
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,355
Commander of <i>Pegasus</i> departing.

247
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,071
18 hours.

248
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,274
<i>(dog barks)</i>

249
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,513
Hey. Hey.

250
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,114
Jake. Hey, Jake.

251
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,911
Yeah, you don't care who l am, do you?

252
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,675
All God's creatures in your eyes.
Here you go.

253
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,915
Can't sleep?

254
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,229
Bad dreams.

255
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,356
Didn't know
you people had dreams.

256
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,079
Oh, sure.

257
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,549
Everybody dreams, Doc.

258
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,556
That human or Cylon blood?

259
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,551
Cylon.

260
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,351
One of the Fives got pretty shot up today
by the insurgents, but he's gonna make it.

261
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,235
You could've let him suffer.

262
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,470
That's not what l do.

263
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,392
What about the baby?

264
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,948
Sharon's baby, Hera.

265
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,676
When that child died on <i>Galactica,</i>
why did you cremate the body?

266
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,037
It's the first Cylon-human hybrid,
and you threw it in the incinerator?

267
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,078
Oh, it wasn't my decision.

268
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,310
That was the president's call.

269
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,358
l was just following orders.

270
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,360
That's a very funny thing.

271
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,913
Cos this stuff all looks the same.

272
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,878
She said,
"l hope it hurts you for a long, long time

273
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,520
before you go to Download City."

274
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,794
And then they just left me there.

275
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,953
They left me in the hot sun
with a bullet in my guts.

276
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,270
What a noble race you are.

277
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,715
How long were you there
before you died?

278
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,392
Hours.

279
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,598
Eventually, l managed to drag myself
over to some spent shell casings.

280
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,832
l used one of those
to scratch open my carotid artery.

281
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,275
Skin is a lot tougher
than you think.

282
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,512
Now that's... three for me.
Three downloads.

283
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,513
The first, l got a headache, but l could
handle it. Now it's worse and worse.

284
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:04,357
This time it was like a frakking
white-hot poker through my skull.

285
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,273
It's not worth it.
None of this is worth it.

286
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,113
He's right, you know.

287
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,432
It's not worth it, which is what l believe
l've been telling you all along.

288
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,196
- Caprica, can you please control him?
- Why don't you shoot me?

289
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,350
If that would remedy the situation.

290
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,070
- We need to crack down harder.
- How? Resources are stretched already.

291
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,958
l don't need to listen to this any more.

292
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,192
Consensus used to be so easy.
Now look what they've done to us.

293
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,669
Don't lose hope.
Worst comes to worst,

294
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,672
we can always nuke the city
and be done with it.

295
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,715
Better leave the dog tags.
If they spot 'em, they'll know who you are.

296
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,156
No. You have no idea
how hard l worked for these.

297
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,550
So our best guess puts the launch keys
in the detention centre.

298
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,077
Keep to main streets. Everybody'll think
you're a regular skin-job and avoid you.

299
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,391
But there's a lot of people
looking to gut an unwary Cylon,

300
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,756
so don't let anybody
get close enough to stick a knife in you.

301
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,479
Thanks for the concern.
Makes me feel warm inside.

302
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,551
How are you gonna
find the launch keys?

303
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,518
The data stream
will feed me the location.

304
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,717
Once l get the keys,
you need to distribute them to pilots.

305
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,995
We're on it.
We got pilots standing by.

306
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,072
- <i>(man)</i> Hey, Anders!
- Yeah, come in.

307
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,716
My gods!
What's she doing here?

308
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,271
Get her down below. You keep her there
until after the next briefing.

309
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,875
Wait a minute! No, no.
Wait, listen to me. Please. l can explain.

310
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,270
<i>(Anders)</i> l suggest
you keep your mouth shut.

311
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,550
<i>(Ellen)</i> l want to
speak to my husband.

312
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,108
Connor, let's go.
Get her down.

313
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,629
- OK, l'm outta here.
- Wait, Sharon.

314
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,472
Yeah.

315
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,075
Do me a favour.
Just keep an eye out for Starbuck.

316
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,756
l don't know if she's alive or if she's dead,
but it's been four months.

317
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,755
l'll do what l can.

318
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,637
Yeah.

319
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,353
<i>(Roslin)</i> You must
keep the child hidden at all costs.

320
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,228
<i>(Anders)</i> We keep her on the move,
along with other high-value targets.

321
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,474
She'll never stay in any one location
longer than two or three days.

322
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,358
Sam, l need you
to really hear me on this.

323
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,078
Really.

324
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,515
There is no one - no one -

325
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,273
of higher value
than Maya and her child.

326
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,193
We cannot let them
fall into Cylon hands.

327
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,874
l get it.

328
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,358
How far do you want me to go?

329
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,954
If it looks like
the Cylons will capture them...

330
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,395
No.

331
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,631
Don't let it get to that point.
That's all.

332
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,196
l don't suppose you'll tell me what this is
about. What's so important about this kid?

333
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,229
She may very well
be the shape of things to come.

334
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,880
That's either a blessing or a curse.

335
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,317
- <i>(baby cries)</i>
- l know. Shh.

336
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,748
We've stored munitions
throughout the city.

337
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,035
l can supplement that
with mortars, RPGs,

338
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,590
shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft missiles
aboard the Raptor.

339
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,070
Great. So when we give the signal,
our people attack the air base,

340
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,515
detention centre, power station.

341
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,036
The plan is to sow chaos
the moment <i>Galactica</i> and <i>Pegasus</i> arrive.

342
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,829
- That should help cover the evacuation.
- No <i>Pegasus,</i> just <i>Galactica.</i>

343
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,639
- Why? Why no <i>Pegasus?</i>
- Don't know, sir.

344
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,474
Way beyond my pay grade.
What about your evac plans?

345
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,757
We've assigned 500 block captains
to cover each sector.

346
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,312
Each captain is responsible for guiding
people in his or her sector to their ship.

347
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,073
- Have you rehearsed any of this?
- <i>(Roslin)</i> Indeed.

348
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,358
We've had three dress rehearsals
under the guise of fire and disaster drills.

349
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,877
Be different when the balloon goes up -
explosions, chaos. There'll be panic.

350
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,670
They'll do fine. These people know they'll
be responsible for saving themselves.

351
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,639
All we need to do
is be ready and hope for the best.

352
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,119
- What about Maya and Isis?
- l'm on it. l've got my two best shooters.

353
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,433
They're gonna be their escorts
and make sure they get back to the ship.

354
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,435
l can't tell you why,
but it is imperative

355
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:22,038
that this woman and her child get off
this planet. l trust you because l trust him.

356
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,350
Ma'am, yes, ma'am.

357
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,351
Saul!

358
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,715
We need to talk.

359
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,791
<i>(man hisses)</i> Toaster!

360
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,837
- She sold us out.
- What?

361
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,469
We were ambushed. The Cylons
knew exactly where we were gonna be.

362
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,549
<i>(both talk at once)</i>

363
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,235
This is the map that l drew for you.
l gave this to you in your tent.

364
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,959
You were gonna burn it.
She offered to do it for you.

365
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,113
l got it off a dead skin-job at the ambush.
Do the math!

366
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,874
I... l want to explain, Saul.

367
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,839
- Godsdamn traitor!
- Shut your frakking mouth!

368
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,714
He said... he said he'd kill you.

369
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,349
- Who said it?
- One of the Brother Cavils.

370
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,511
l did it for you, Saul.

371
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,912
It was all for you.
l had to. l didn't have any choice.

372
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,958
Don't you see that?

373
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,599
Drawer three-seven-eight.

374
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,835
What are you doing?

375
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,798
Oh, my God, it's you.

376
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,317
You're betraying your own people.

377
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,675
For what?

378
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,593
- l'm a Colonial officer now.
- You're not one of them.

379
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,036
- l gave them my word.
- That's not what counts.

380
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,758
It's who you give it to.

381
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,195
l'm gonna have to shoot you now.

382
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,840
Hera lives.

383
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,273
What?

384
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,635
Your daughter Hera is alive.

385
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,113
Your new friends tell you that?

386
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,510
They faked her death
and hid her from you.

387
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,628
- You could say anything.
- No, l had dreams. l had strange dreams.

388
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,713
l was having strange dreams
that made me question my faith,

389
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,030
made me question God.

390
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,193
And in the dreams there was a human
oracle, so l went to see Dodona Selloi.

391
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,556
l won't kill you. l'll wound you
so you can't warn the others.

392
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,760
The oracle said that the fruit
borne of two peoples is still alive,

393
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,755
that Hera lives and l would hold her
in my arms and l would know true love.

394
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,430
Put down the gun,

395
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,876
and when l find her
you can hold her too.

396
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,794
Adama wouldn't lie to me.

397
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,474
You're wrong.
You're wrong!

398
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,434
The keys don't seem
to have been damaged.

399
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,275
It looks like the ships have enough tylium
to make at least one jump.

400
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,351
Congratulations, by the way.

401
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,908
l heard it's a boy.

402
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,753
- Oh.
- What's his name?

403
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,389
Nicholas, after Cally's grandfather.

404
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,471
Hey, Chief,

405
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,592
you remember when you helped
Helo spread Hera's ashes?

406
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,990
- Mm-hm.
- You actually saw the ashes?

407
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,355
Yeah, of course. Why?

408
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,556
Nothing.

409
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,918
Just make sure
Cally never lets your kid out of her sight.

410
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,757
<i>(Helo)</i> Sir?

411
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,712
The listening Raptor
just jumped back.

412
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,513
Sharon's got the launch keys.

413
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,229
<i>(phone rings)</i>

414
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,919
Rec room.
Racetrack.

415
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,791
Very well, sir.

416
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,831
It's on.

417
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,069
This is the admiral.

418
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,869
You've heard the news.
You know the mission.

419
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,354
You should also know there's
only one way that this mission ends,

420
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,549
and that's with the successful rescue
of our people off of New Caprica.

421
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,318
Look around you.

422
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,470
Take a good look
at the men and women

423
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,915
that stand next to you.

424
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,678
Remember their faces,

425
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,514
for one day you will
tell your children and your grandchildren

426
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:24,709
that you served with such men and
women as the universe has never seen.

427
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,829
And together
you accomplished a feat

428
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,550
that will be told and retold
down through the ages

429
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,310
and find immortality
as only the gods once knew.

430
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,429
l'm proud to serve with you.

431
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,875
Good hunting.

432
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,236
- Begin jump prep.
- Action stations.

433
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,836
Set condition one throughout the ship.
Stand by for combat jump.

434
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,873
This will mark new territory.

435
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,439
Don't do it!
