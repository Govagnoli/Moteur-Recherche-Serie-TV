<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,311
<i>(Leoben)</i> You kill me,

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,672
l download, l come back,
we start over.

4
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,593
You're gonna hold me in your arms,
tell me you love me.

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,799
l don't belong here! Let me out!

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,553
Where are you getting this?
Who's your source?

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,191
<i>(Chief) No idea. The source won't tell me</i>
<i>their name. It's probably safer for all of us.</i>

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,032
- Mr President?
- <i>(Number Six)</i> Morning.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,909
A Colonial transmission. The recognition
codes match. We got a link to the ground.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,399
- We've got a signal.
- What?

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,472
<i>(Chief)</i> "Have hope.
We're coming for you."

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,792
<i>(Racetrack) Colonel Tigh has formed</i>
<i>an insurgent group against the Cylons.</i>

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,316
<i>They're waiting for instructions</i>
<i>to coordinate the rescue.</i>

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,118
It's gonna be OK.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,668
- <i>(Tigh)</i> What's our next target?
- <i>(Chief)</i> l got these.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,753
Security plans for the graduation
ceremony of the New Caprica Police.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,798
Our best guess puts
the total police force at around 200.

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,713
l wouldn't have believed 20
would turn against their own kind.

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,872
l don't like this one.
l think we're crossing the line here.

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,033
He's a soldier. Not the first time we've
sent a soldier on a one-way mission.

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,998
<i>Send a message.</i>
<i>Work with the Cylons, you're a target.</i>

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,709
No boundaries for the Cylons,
there's no boundaries for us.

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,636
We round up the leaders of the insurgency
and we execute them.

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,598
Send a message
that the gloves are coming off.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,070
<i>(door opens)</i>

26
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,509
Everyone of importance is being looked at
right now. You're no exception.

27
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,830
l can help you, Laura...

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,989
in ways l can't help myself.

29
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,998
l can protect you, but you have to
understand the situation has changed.

30
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,471
The insurgency has crossed the line.
Suicide bombings.

31
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,631
It's abhorrent.

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,192
It's contrary to everything
that we believe in.

33
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,430
So you...

34
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,954
you and I, we will...

35
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,315
we will publicly condemn these tactics.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,517
They cannot be legitimised
in any shape or form.

37
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,034
Something scares the Cylons after all.

38
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,112
Using men and women as human bombs
should scare us all.

39
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,668
Desperate people
take desperate measures.

40
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,194
All right, look me in the eye.
Look me in the eye

41
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,637
and tell me that you approve
of sending young men and women

42
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,999
into crowded places
with explosives strapped to their chests.

43
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,277
l'm waiting for you to look me in the eye
and tell me that you approve!

44
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,429
33 people killed and their only crime
was putting on a police uniform,

45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,512
trying to bring some order
to the chaos out there.

46
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,833
By arresting innocent people in the dead
of night. Detaining them without charge.

47
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,153
- Torturing them for information!
- Wait a minute. Nobody's been tortured.

48
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,836
- Tell that to Colonel Tigh.
- Nobody has been tortured.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,275
We're done here.

50
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,753
l hope you understand
the severity of the situation.

51
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,630
l'd ask you to obey
the dictates of your conscience,

52
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,679
- which is what l've always done.
- Of that l have no doubt.

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,356
Please give this lovely lady
her shoes back,

54
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,635
then get her out of here.

55
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,112
<i>(PA) Curfew is in effect.</i>

- Yes, sir.
- Good. Don't worry.

62
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,555
We have your back.

63
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,232
Did you hear?
The Cylons cut food rations today.

64
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,279
We heard. How long before
the next Raptor transmission?

65
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,911
Two minutes.

66
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,793
You know, they're taking about shutting
down the marketplace. It's a security risk.

67
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,996
We'll shift targets.

68
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,436
You were gonna hit the marketplace?
The market?

69
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,910
Full of civilians. This is crazy.

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,753
You know, we need to figure out
whose side we're on.

71
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,470
Which side are we on?
We're on the side of the demons, Chief.

72
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,156
We're evil men in the gardens of paradise
sent by the forces of death

73
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,870
to spread devastation and destruction
wherever we go.

74
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,111
l'm surprised you didn't know that.

75
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,157
<i>(Chief)</i> Contact.

Send it twice, just to make sure.

<i>(Cavil)</i> Here are the names of those

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,596
- l know some of these people.
- l'm sure you do.

81
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,630
They're all insurgents, Jammer.
We have to break the cycle of violence.

82
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,155
OK, suit up.

83
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,829
You won't have to wear those much
longer. People will see you as heroes.

Numbers five through ten,
take the tents to the right.

87
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,869
Follow down to the end. The rest of
you guys gotta keep quiet, OK?

88
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,876
<i>(man)</i> New Caprica Police! You're under
arrest for colluding with the insurgency.

- This is an NCP raid! Get your hands up!

90
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,399
- Ms Cally Tyrol.
- No!

91
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,708
No!

92
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,079
My baby! No!

93
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,879
That's my baby! No!

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,476
Hey. Oh, no, no, no.

96

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
l got you. l got you.

97
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,198
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, there you go.

98
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,748
Mommy's coming back. It's OK.

99
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,671
It's OK.

100
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,871
Their numbers are a little thin. It says here
Tigh commands 1,150 armed effectives.

101
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,909
That's a lot less than he should have
if you count all enlisted available there.

102
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,151
Could be taking heavy losses.
They mentioned a crackdown.

103
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,710
Get a breakdown of available pilots
in the insurgent group.

104
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,314
Somebody's gotta fly those ships.

105
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,789
Those ships aren't going anywhere yet.

106
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,952
"Cylons have removed launch keys
from Colonial ships."

107
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,634
"Location unknown."
Came from Tyrol.

108
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,996
- Can we manufacture new launch keys?
- <i>(Apollo)</i> Forget it.

109
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,631
The specs are incredibly sophisticated.
It would take weeks just to do the R & D.

110
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,430
Best option is for the people on the
ground to find the original launch keys.

111
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,478
- Assuming they weren't destroyed.
- No. No way.

112
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,314
Cylons would keep them safe in case
they needed to use one of those ships.

113
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,868
She's right. Keys gotta still be there.

114
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,236
Make a weapons drop to the insurgents.
They know the land.

115
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,914
They've been hitting
the Cylons in the teeth.

116
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,070
Given the tools,
they can find the keys.

117
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,357
No way. The only thing
you've got going for you so far

118
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,876
is the Cylons reduced their defence
perimeter to five baseships.

119
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,350
Put heavy weaponry down there,
they'll know we're in contact.

120
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,512
Call in ten more baseships
and your whole plan's frakked.

121
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,229
- Funny. l thought this was <i>our</i> plan, sir.
- Moving on.

122
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,359
The military plans you have in your hands
are to be with you at all times.

123
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,994
Why'd they pick her up?
She hasn't done anything.

124
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,196
We've got a baby, for gods' sakes.

125
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,398
- l don't know. l'll try to find out.
- How long are they gonna hold her?

126
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,598
Detention is run by a separate ministry.
They don't give us any reasons why...

127
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,435
Godsdammit, Felix! She hasn't
done anything. We've got a baby.

128
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,193
l know, Galen.

129
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,999
- l'm sorry.
- How do you do it?

130
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,310
How do you help them day after day?
How do you look yourself in the mirror?

131
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,318
l gotta get my son. Cameron's watching
him, but she's got problems of her own.

132
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,391
Chief!

133
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,754
l'll see what l can do. l'll see
if there's something l can find out.

134
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,718
Why don't you try and do <i>something?</i>

135
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,437
Hey, you OK?

136
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,351
Jammer, what's going on?

137
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,037
l heard about last night. About Cally being
on one of those lists. l'm really sorry.

138
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,432
Frakking human police, huh?
Bunch of traitors if you ask me.

139
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,479
Some of those guys who joined up, l bet
they're in over their heads, you know?

140
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,757
Especially now
with these suicide bombings...

141
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,233
At first, l bet they thought they were doing
something good. Let us police our own.

142
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,074
They're just frakking idiots.
What did they expect?

143
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,114
You don't know any of those guys?
Any names?

144
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,668
Names? No. N-No idea.

145
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,353
Damn.

146
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,238
What's up with Cally?
Why did they put her in detention?

147
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,676
l don't know. She hasn't done a thing.
l just talked to Gaeta.

148
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,718
Says he doesn't know squat,
or so he says.

149
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,917
- Gaeta's a good guy.
- He's a frakking collaborator.

150
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,278
You know what? When this is all over,
guys like Gaeta are gonna get strung up.

151
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,672
Guys like you and me,
we're gonna be there tying the knots.

152
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,751
Making 'em tight.

153
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,070
It's been a couple of ugly days.

154
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,793
l know you don't care about that,
but life means something to us, so...

155
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,476
l've decided to show you
just how precious life can be,

156
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,074
how even in the worst of times,

157
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,950
it can restore your faith.

158
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,595
Remember that breeding farm
on Caprica?

159
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,908
l remember
l blew the frak out of the place.

160
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,956
It wasn't a total loss.

161
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,873
We were able to salvage certain things.

162
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,871
Certain medical samples.

163
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,556
Like your ovary.

164
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,390
What's that?

165
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,798
This... is Kacey.

166
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,069
Kacey, this is Kara.

167
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,515
Your mother.

168
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,830
Hi.

169
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,070
Good girl.

170
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,115
<i>(Dualla) Unbelievable.</i>

171
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,519
- What?
- Admiral's putting boots on the ground.

172
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,070
Wants to send an officer as a liaison
between us and the Resistance

173
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,071
to coordinate the rescue op.

174
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,914
- Makes sense. What's the problem?
- It's who he's sending.

175
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,717
- He's frakking kidding with this, right?
- l wish he were.

176
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,156
Hoshi, l want a Raptor ready
in five minutes on the hangar deck.

177
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,869
- Inform the flagship l'm coming aboard.
- <i>(Hoshi)</i> Aye, sir.

178
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,192
- What are you gonna do?
- What l should've done a long time ago.

179
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,390
- You can't do this. She's a Cylon.
- Well, l trust her.

180
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,439
- That's a mistake.
- Well, it'll be my mistake, won't it?

181
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,877
You're gambling with the lives of everyone
on this ship, everyone on my ship.

182
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,556
l don't need a lecture from you
about the responsibilities of command.

183
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,359
We're done here.

184
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,558
l'm not finished.
This entire plan is a reckless gamble.

185
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,430
You have the right to risk the lives of the
men and women under your command.

186
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,398
But you are risking the lives
of the entire human race.

187
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,314
- l'm trying to save the human race.
- No. That's what you're not seeing.

188
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,393
The human race? That's the 2,000 people
huddled in those civilian ships

189
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,711
that got away when the Cylons
came back. They're the safe bet.

190
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,475
We should guard their survival
like after the attack on the Colonies.

191
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,269
- Sharon can penetrate Cylon defences.
- It's not about her.

192
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,035
The Centurions can't distinguish her
from other humanoid models.

193
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,112
Did you know that?
They were programmed that way.

194
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,638
The Cylons didn't want them becoming
self-aware and suddenly resisting orders.

195
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,236
They didn't want a robotic rebellion on
their hands. You can appreciate the irony.

196
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,390
- Dad!
- l know what you're saying.

197
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,316
But we have a responsibility
to the people that we left behind.

198
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,676
Remember what Roslin said.
Our first responsibility

199
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,399
is to the survival of humanity.

200
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,869
We can't lose sight of that.

201
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,478
Over the last year, we've...

202
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,439
Iost sight of almost everything.

203
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,637
We got... soft.

204
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,158
But if we go back to New Caprica now,

205
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,554
and we lose,

206
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,631
it's over.

207
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,280
Humanity just stops.

208
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,957
And an admiral's stars don't give you
the right to make that gamble.

209
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,031
You're right, son.

210
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,395
Make plans to resume the search for Earth
with <i>Pegasus</i> and the civilian fleet.

211
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,349
- With <i>Pegasus?</i> What about <i>Galactica?</i>
- l know why we left those people behind.

212
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,194
l know that it was their choice
in the first place to be down there.

213
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,435
And l realise that the survival of
the human race outweighs anything else.

214
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,911
But this time...

215
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,394
l can't live with it.

216
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,675
l can't face it.

217
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,835
Maybe l'm a coward.
But l'm going back.

218
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,071
- Dad, you won't have a chance.
- l'm going back, son.

219
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:46,470
Once l fertilised your egg, we transferred
it to a woman who carried it to term.

220
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,949
She was pretty, funny.

221
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,953
Great smile. You would've liked her.

222
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,397
Although her mother died during
childbirth, Kacey's heart never failed.

223
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,519
l guess she gets
that will to live from you.

224
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,795
l've seen her path.

225
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,799
It's difficult, but rewarding. She'll know
the mind of God in this lifetime.

226
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,876
She'll see patterns that others do not see.
She probably got spiritual clarity from me.

227
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,275
She'll be hungry soon.

228
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,749
There's food on the table.

229
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,315
- You wouldn't let your own child starve?
- It's not my child.

230
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,029
- l don't even know if it's human.
- Half-human. You know she's yours.

231
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,554
You just won't admit it.

232
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,028
Where the frak are you going?

233
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,680
Take this with you.

234
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,797
Hey! Don't leave me alone with this.

235
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,110
- <i>(door closes)</i>
- Frak.

236
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,270
l don't know who or what you are,
but l do know this.

237
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,271
l'm not your mother.

238
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,239
l don't care that it's effective.
l don't care that the Cylons can't stop it.

239
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,436
It's wrong.

240
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,149
No more suicide bombings, Colonel.
You understand?

241
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,800
What, are you working
for the Cylons now?

242
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,237
l'm sorry. There's no excuse for that.

243
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,633
You see, little things like that,
they don't matter any more.

244
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,917
In fact, not too frakking much
really matters any more.

245
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,630
l've got one job here, lady,
and one job only. To disrupt the Cylons.

246
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,757
Make them worry about the ant hill
they've stirred up here

247
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,470
so they're distracted and out of position
when the old man shows up in orbit.

248
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,279
The bombings,
they got the Cylons' attention.

249
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,239
They really got their attention,
and l am not giving that up.

250
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,791
<i>(Roslin)</i> We are talking about people
blowing themselves up.

251
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,000
You know, sometimes l think
that you've got ice water in those veins

252
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,278
and other times l think
you're just a naive little schoolteacher.

253
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,354
l've sent men on suicide missions in two
wars now, and let me tell you something.

254
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,830
It don't make a difference
whether they're riding in a Viper

255
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,233
or walking out onto a parade ground -
in the end they're just as dead.

256
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,829
So take your piety and your moralising
and your high-minded principles

257
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,230
and stick 'em someplace safe
until you're off this rock

258
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,474
and you're sitting in your nice cushy chair
on <i>Colonial One</i> again.

259
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,270
l've got a war to fight.

260
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,791
Let's go. Move it.

261
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,792
- This way. Off-Ioad the rest.
- Let's go to isolation.

262
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,829
<i>(Sharon)</i> The detentions are just causing
more resentment and more enemies.

263
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,956
l know. We don't have another option.

264
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,918
We have to show
suicide bombings won't be tolerated.

265
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,276
Excuse me, sir.
Can l talk to you for a moment?

266
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,595
Yeah, sure, Jammer.
l'll catch up with you.

267
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,599
Sir, l don't know
exactly how to broach this.

268
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,355
Nor do l know exactly what
l expect you to do about it.

269
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,398
But, um, l thought, you know,
since we were...

270
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,268
- Since we were back on <i>Galactica...</i>
- Yeah, Jammer, just spit it out.

271
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,557
We picked up Chief Tyrol's wife
in the last raid. Cally.

272
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,279
She's in detention.
l think she's on a list.

273
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,991
Frak!

274
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,835

Hi, Cally. It's me - Boomer.

Physically, l mean.

283
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,438
What do you want from me?

284
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,516
Look, a lot's happened...
in everyone's life.

285
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,831
But l want you to know... l want you
and Galen to know that l'm happy for you.

286
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,276
Especially since you started a family.

287
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,158
Something him and l talked about
once before.

288
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,351
Can you get me out of here?

289
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,515

with internal security. It's...

Then frak you, Sharon,
you stupid frakked-up toaster!

291
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,511
How many times
do l have to shoot you?

292
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,036
If you can't help me,
then just go away

293
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,315

23 Cylons critically wounded.

302
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,835
14 had to be euthanised.

303
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,032
They had casualties, too.
Four human dead.

Who gives a frak about that?
Pardon my language.

305
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,430
The power substation was crippled.

306
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,115
Half the city's without power.
Estimates put repairs at two weeks.

307
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,760
Still think we're being
too hard on the humans?

308
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,196
We have a very serious,
very straightforward problem.

309
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,272
Either we increase control
or we lose control.

310
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,955
That's a fact.
We think it's time for stronger measures.

311
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,235
We agree.

312
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,431
We agree.

313
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,314
We agree as well. How about you?

314
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,192
- We agree also.
- Most of us do, anyway.

315
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,471
Enough.

316
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,949
What's this?

317
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,476
This orders the executions
of all the detainees on the next page.

318
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,869
- It requires your signature.
- My signature?

319
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,190
You're the president.

320
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,469

mean you need to drag him into sin.

322
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,677
Don't you lecture me about sin.

323
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,389
l didn't commit the first act
of Cylon-on-Cylon violence in history.

324

- What's she talking about?
- She crushed my head in with a rock.

325
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,873
- Interesting she didn't tell you.
- l had to do it. l'm not proud of it.

326
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,589
This is all very interesting.
Very edifying. Sign the order.

327
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,433
- You don't need my signature.
- <i>(Number Three)</i> We do.

328
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,512
We're here as allies
of the government of the Colonies.

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,989
Everything we do requires your signature.

330
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,356
They're worried what "God" might think
if they commit murder.

331
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,115
They're covering
their existential asses.

332
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,873
l won't do it. All right? l won't do it.

333
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,153
You'll have to salve your consciences
some other way.

334
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,550
- Then we'll find another president.
- <i>(cocks gun)</i>

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,238
Stop this!

336
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,431
This is crazy!

337
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,595
- Dear God.
- She'll be back.

338
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,275
But if he pulls that trigger now,
you won't.

339

342
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,836
But it'll be OK.

343
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,309
It's you.

344
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,234
Help me.

345
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,993

They'll kill you if you don't.

347
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,034
- Sign it!
- l can't.

348
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,315
l won't.

349
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,789
You can't force...

350
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,876
Sometimes you have to do things you
hate so you survive to fight another day.

351
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,151
<i>(Adama)</i> Raise your right hand

Congratulations, Lieutenant.

361
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,076
l never thought
l'd live to see the day.

362
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,833
Me neither.

363
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,911
Looks good on you.

364
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,036
Belongs on you.

365
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,998
This uniform...

366
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,071
It means a lot to me, Sharon.

367
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,355
l know it does, Helo.

368
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,555
It means a lot to me, too.

369
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,359
l won't betray it.

370
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,315
Bird checks out, Lieutenant.

371
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,992
Thanks.

372
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,355
Can l ask you a question?
How do you know?

373
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,398
l mean, how do you really know
that you can trust me?

374
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,040
l don't.

375
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,077
That's what trust is.

376
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,349
Good on you, Lieutenant.

377
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,519
Whew!

378
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,592
That was really <i>something. (laughs)</i>

379
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,151
l thought you might like that.

380
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,152
But you... you didn't do
the twist this time.

381
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,995
What's that deal you did right at the end?
What do you call that?

382
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,071
You mean the swirl.

383
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,472
Oh, the <i>swirl. (laughs)</i>
Boy, that's really something.

384
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,155
Well, you said you wanted
something memorable.

385
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,753
Hm.

386
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,308
How is Saul?

387
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,072
Fine.

388
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,038
When's his next meeting
with the insurgents?

389
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,437
No point denying it, Ellen.
We know he's their leader.

390
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,115
Why do you think
we let him out of detention?

391
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,315
l thought it was because of the twist.

392
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,630
Well, yes, that too, for sure.

393
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,716
But having him active with the Resistance
presents us with certain advantages.

394
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,790
- l don't know anything about...
- Let's just consider your denials as read.

395
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,670
Shall we? l want a specific place,
l want a specific time,

396
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,275
for a very high-level meeting
of the insurgency leadership.

397
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,273
And if l don't get it,
we pick up Saul again,

398
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,353
and this time
he'll lose more than an eye.

399
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:34,920
Tomorrow, the <i>Galactica</i> is going to
send two Raptors, several marines,

400
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,799
Tomorrow, the <i>Galactica</i> is going to
send two Raptors, several marines,

401
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,236
and a ground liaison officer will brief us
on the rescue mission

402
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,039
- and coordinate our evac plans.
- l'll be damned.

403
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,591
It's really happening.
Who's the liaison officer?

404
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,434
- Sharon.
- l hope that's your idea of a joke.

405
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,672
Admiral Adama has given her a uniform
and a billet. She is a serving officer,

406
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,150
which is more than you can say about us,
technically speaking.

407
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,391
The old man's lost his mind, all right.

408
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,715
- Where's the rendezvous?
- Uh, they left that up to us.

409
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,394
OK, here's my suggestion.

410
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,392
If they jump into
Breeder's Canyon out here...

411
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,040
<i>(knock at door)</i>

412
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,875
Come.

413
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,758
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Ellen.

414
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,711
As l was saying, if they jump in here they
won't get picked up on Cylon DRADIS.

415
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,917
That's a long way out there.
A lot of ground to cover by foot.

416
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,833
<i>(Anders)</i> l realise that.
l'll meet them halfway - here.

417
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,992
There's good cover from the air.
It's pretty isolated.

418
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,437
We gotta be sure. It may be the most
important meeting we're ever gonna have.

419
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:52,197
Colonel, l'm sure. This is the place.
The Cylons will not find them here.

420
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,034
All right, give me the map.
You got the message memorised?

421
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:01,513
All the wireless freqs?
All right, then give me the message, too.

422
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,471
l'll do that, Saul. Don't get up.

423
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,790
Thanks.

424
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,114
<i>(Anders)</i> l've assembled a team.
We've been out half a dozen times.

425
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,795
We have provisions for a couple of days
and access to running water.

426
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,874
l know that place like the back
of my hand. This is gonna work.

427
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,235
Gaius? Gaius!

428
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,590
Did you sign this?

429
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,356
- Tell me you didn't.
- Not now.

430
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,353
This is a death warrant!
Have you seen the names on this list?

431
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,035
Do you have any idea what they're
about to do? Are you listening to me?

432
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,476
- l didn't have any choice.
- What the hell's the matter with you?

433
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,916
There are over 200 names on this list.
Have you even looked?

434
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,117
- Look at the names, Gaius!
- l've seen them!

435
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,273
l've seen them, all right?

436
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,794
There was nothing l could do.

437
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,559

Come with us, please.

441

Killing Tyrol's wife will only embitter him
against us. He's head of a labour union...

442
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,318
Let's be honest. You don't think
there's any reason to kill any of them.

443
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,595
- Right.
- Well, we made a decision.

444
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,638
All of us. Like when we listened
to you and Caprica Six

445
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,996
when we came here
to start this new and glorious chapter.

446
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,469
This has nothing to do with
executing Cally.

447
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,439
No one enjoys the thought of mortal
death. But she tried to murder you.

448
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,478
Maybe it's gods' justice.

449
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,032
Need a lift, Mr Vice President?

450
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,917
l guess so.

451
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,434
l haven't seen much of you lately.
Been busy?

452
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,636
Well, not much to do in detention.

453
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,598
How long have you been held?

454
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,515
Four months. l told Baltar l wouldn't have
any part in collaborating with the Cylons

455
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,034
and he got a little pissed.

456
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,078
He's a little pissed at me, too.

457
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,395
Jump complete. Right on target.

458
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,315
l'm dropping down to the landing point.
There's some heavy turbulence up ahead.

459
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,875
Follow the river.
Make sure you hug the bank.

It was my mistake.
Don't punish her for it.

469
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,876
It was an accident, Kara.
Nothing more.

Kacey?

471
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,195
Kacey, oh, my gods.

472
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,759
Honey.

473
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,710
- Let them stretch their legs for a minute.
- Yes, sir.
