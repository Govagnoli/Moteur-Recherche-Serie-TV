1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,800
The Cylons Were
Created by Man

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,000
They Evolved

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,600
They Rebelled

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,600
There Are Many Copies

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,600
And They Have A Plan

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,300
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica...

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,700
Lee, you can't leave.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,200
You have to stay.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,000
You have to really stay.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You must betray Roslin and run for
presidente in the oncoming election **********

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,900
I know is hard, but it's the only way **********

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,900
Word of Fisk's murder has spread
out through the entire fleet.

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,900
Crew can fall apart when
their Commander is killed.

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,500
Pegasus lost two
in a matter of weeks.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,300
I'm putting Garner in command. **********

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,400
He's a engineer not a command officer. ************

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,400
He's the best they got. ************

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,100
PEGASUS
RAPTOR TRAINING EXERCISE

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Pegasus, Buster. 

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,100
Dradis intercept
training birds are away.

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,400
Buster, Pegasus, roger that,
take station...

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
be advised,...

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
communications will suffer
sporadic interruptions...

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,900
due to stellar EMI
activity. Acknowledge?

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,800
Pegasus, Buster, acknowledge.
Our communications suck!

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,100
Is it gonna be
like this all day?

27
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,300
Big time. 

28
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,500
Those binaries are
putting out so much EMI,... 

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,700
even the dradis
is barely working.

30
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,300
Well, I'm gonna a little distance
between us and the fleet.

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,400
Get us out of the soup.

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,400
See if we can get a cleaner
dradis picture.

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,700
Hey! 

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,300
Whoever's in there, time's up!
Let's go, come on!

35
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,900
Gotta a couple of tired viper
jockeys out here wanna sleep.

36
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,000
Go hit the showers Duck!

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We'll be gone by
the time you get back.

38
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,800
How you feel?

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,200
Mm, not great.

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,800
But Cottle's given me the thumbs-up
and it's been almost a month,...

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,600
so I guess it's back to work.

42
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,200
So you ready to go into the belly
of the beast?

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,300
The beast?

44
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,100
Yeah. 

45
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,400
That's what they call the
Pegasus now. 

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,000
Galactica's the bucket.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The bucket and the beast.

48
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,100
Don't we make a pair?

49
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,100
Come on.

50
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,100
- No, you come on.
- Come on, come on, go.

51
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,500
Anyway, it's only a
temporary assignment.

52
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,300
I should be back
again in a couple of weeks.

53
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,100
Why'd the old man pick you?

54
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,600
One word. Starbuck.

55
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,300
Is she in hack again?

56
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,700
Not yet.

57
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,900
But apparently, she's been
driving commander Garner...

58
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,500
up one bulkhead and
down the other...

59
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,900
ever since she took
over flight training on...

60
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,700
what'd you call it?

61
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,300
The beast?

62
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,300
And since I won't be flying
combat for a while, I...

63
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,700
Were you going to mention these?

64
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,500
Oh, yeah. 

65
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Got promoted to Major.

66
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,600
Well, don't sound so happy!

67
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,400
It doesn't mean much.

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,200
I think it means a lot.

69
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,600
Oh, well,...

70
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,600
if you say so,
then it must be true.

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,700
What's going on?

72
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,300
We were unloading
one of the containers...

73
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,900
and then one of the
crates shifted.

74
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,700
So,...

75
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,800
we looked inside, and saw
that something was moving.

76
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,300
Did you call it in?

77
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,500
Yeah, we shut door,
and the marines are on their way.

78
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Give me a light.

79
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Chief, we don't know what
we're dealing with here.

80
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,200
Don't you think we should wait?

81
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,000
Just wait out here.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Chief!

83
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,800
Is this the Galactica?

84
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,900
Yeah.

85
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,900
Are you Dr. Cottle?

86
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,700
What the hell was that?

87
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,500
I don't know. We should call it in.

88
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,600
All right. I gonna
spin up the ftl drive just in case.

89
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,800
Pegasus, this is Raptor 718.

90
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Emergency.

91
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,400
Request instructions.

92
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Say again, Shark.

93
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Pegasus...

94
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,400
distress.

95
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,800
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?

96
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,200
Buster, Shark, do you read?

97
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,500
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?

98
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,900
Commander Garner on deck.

99
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,800
Buster, Shark, do you read?

100
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
What have you got, Mr. Hoshi?

101
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,300
I'm not sure, sir.

102
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,800
I think Buster and Shark
are declaring an emergency,...

103
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
but their transmission's garbled.

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We've lost them, sir.

105
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,900
49.584 survivors

106
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,100
in search of a home

107
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,100
Called Earth

108
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,000
Welcome aboard, Major.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,300
I didn't expect a welcoming
committee.

110
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,200
Don't flatter yourself.
I was in the neighborhood.

111
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,300
Major Adama, sir.

112
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,800
Major Adama.

113
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,900
Commander Garner.

114
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,000
Glad to see you, Major.

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,500
Although I wish it was under
better circumstances.

116
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,700
We have just lost contact
with two of our raptors...

117
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,300
out on a training mission.

118
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,700
What?
When did that happen?

119
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,300
Captain Thrace.

120
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,900
Perhaps if you were actually
down on the flight deck...

121
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,100
and monitoring your raptors...

122
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,700
the way any training officer
worth a damn would have done,...

123
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,800
you would know that four of
our pilots were missing.

124
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,000
Major? 

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,200
You with me, Major?

126
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,000
Yes, sir.

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,500
The disappeared from the dradis
about an hour ago. 

128
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,500
They're gone.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Shut the hell up!

130
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
We lose two raptors in
a training mission,...

131
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,300
and I only find out when the
commander throws it in my face.

132
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,700
Don't all speak at once.

133
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,500
Sir, it's been made clear...

134
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,500
that discussing flight deck situations
with anyone outside Pegasus crew...

135
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,100
is not allowed. 

136
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,800
Sorry, sir.

137
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,800
And whose frakkin'
bright idea was that? 

138
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,200
It was Garner,
wasn't it?

139
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,300
Of course it was. 

140
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,300
So barely competent and paranoid.

141
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,100
There's a hell of a combination.

142
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,800
I have a problem.

143
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,200
That problem's name is Kara Thrace.

144
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,600
I-I know to handle her, sir.

145
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,300
And for the record,
she is one hell of a viper pilot.

146
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,100
What? I should cut her some slack
because she's good in the cockpit.

147
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,700
Is that what you're saying?

148
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,400
Because nobody ever cut us
any slack in the engine room.

149
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,500
I could tell you that right now.

150
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
But then, uh,...

151
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,500
I don't know, maybe being a snipe is
different than being a viper jockey.

152
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,500
No flashy stunts for us.

153
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,300
No flying by the seat of
our pants down there!

154
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,100
The engine room is like
a finely tuned watch,...

155
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,400
and everything in it needs to be
monitored and maintained...

156
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,300
in a very precise fashion.

157
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,800
Nobody freelances.

158
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,600
Everything is done
in the proper way...

159
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,800
at the proper time
in the proper order!

160
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,400
Or there'd be no power. 

161
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,000
No lights.

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No hot showers for your flyboys.

163
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,100
You know, Major,...

164
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,100
I think some of the people around here...

165
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,100
could learn a thing or
two from the snipes.

166
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm sorry, Madame President.
But it's that time.

167
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,500
Campaign meeting.

168
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
We've been
putting it off for weeks.

169
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,200
And we do have a Presidential
election coming up...

170
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,400
unless you've
decided not to run.

171
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,200
Yeah, and to be perfectly
honest with you, Tori,...

172
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,700
I've thought about it a few times.
But, um, no, I'm still here.

173
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,700
There's so much to do. So...

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
let's talk politics.

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Great.

176
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Here are the results
from our first fleet-wide poll.

177
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,800
How did you manage this?

178
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,600
I was precinct Captain for the
federalist party...

179
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,700
in delphi for five years.

180
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,300
We did polls to see what the mayor
should have for lunch.

181
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,200
For what it's worth, you've
managed to walk a very fine line.

182
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,600
You're Presidential bid has the
support of both the military...

183
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,700
and the civilian fleet,...

184
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
and you've received
enthusiastic endorsements...

185
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,800
from the Gemenese
religious leaders.

186
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Well, it helps when your only real
rival is a convicted terrorist.

187
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,100
Am I capable of
leading this fleet?

188
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,800
Absolutely.

189
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,500
And for a time,...

190
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,900
I almost had a chance.

191
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,600
Until Laura Roslin ascended from...

192
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,600
politician to prophet.

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,900
The truth is I can't win.

194
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,700
But you could.

195
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,900
You flatter me, Mr. Zarek. Really.

196
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,700
But I'm not sure I'm cut out
for a life in politics...

197
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,700
as I find the vice presidency and
everything to do with it very tedious.

198
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,500
I would imagine
carrying water for Roslin...

199
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,800
would get old after a time.

200
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,800
But it's the office that makes you
the perfect candidate, doctor.

201
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,300
You're pre-sold.

202
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
Really? 

203
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,300
To whom?

204
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,000
You'd be surprised how many
people crave the assurances...

205
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
of cold science as opposed
to the superstitious...

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
ravings of the Gemenese.

207
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,100
As a scientist, you offer hope.

208
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,500
Think about it.

209
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,600
And you, Tom. 

210
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
You'll just step aside...

211
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,200
will you?

212
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,200
I'm just happy to back a man
of true conviction.

213
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,200
A man...

214
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,200
who remembers his friends.

215
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,500
Attention on deck.

216
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,300
At ease. 

217
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,400
Where's Stinger?

218
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,800
He's in hack for
mouthing off to Garner.

219
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,900
Stepped on his precious little toes.

220
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,700
Frakking Garner.

221
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,300
He's such an idiot.

222
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,500
All right, lock that up!

223
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,700
Get something straight.

224
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,400
We got two missing raptor crews who are
gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours.

225
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,800
That's all that matters.

226
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,600
So, everyone knock
off the schoolyard crap...

227
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,500
and start doing your frakkin' jobs. 

228
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,900
Now... 

229
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,600
we need to start
thinking outside the box.

230
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Which is supposed to be
what you do best.

231
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,200
Sorry, Major.

232
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,500
All right.

233
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
I wanna know everything there is to
know about these missing raptors...

234
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,600
and their crews.
I wanna know personal quirks,...

235
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,000
aircraft squawks,...

236
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
wireless transmissions,
anything that might help.

237
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,200
Good. 

238
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Get to it.

239
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,700
How is she?

240
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,600
Rya's four months pregnant
and doesn't want to be.

241
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,700
I understand the
Gemenese have a problem...

242
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,900
with women terminating
their pregnancies.

243
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,900
Tyrol said that she
asked for you by name.

244
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,600
Do you want to tell me what
that's really all about?

245
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Pretty straight forward, really.

246
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,400
I get a note that a
girl's on the way.

247
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,800
She arrives. I do my work.
And then she leaves.

248
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,500
I don't ask a lot of questions.

249
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,700
You're gonna start.

250
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,700
I wanna talk to her.

251
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,900
I'm Admiral Adama. 

252
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,700
Don't worry,
I've just come to talk.

253
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,700
It doesn't matter what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.

254
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,200
Your parents are a little
worried about you.

255
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,700
They've contacted me...

256
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,400
through the Gemenon
representative.

257
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,800
My parents. 

258
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,400
Gods. 

259
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,400
Do you have any idea what
they would do to me?

260
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Please, do not send me back.

261
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,100
You're a stowaway.

262
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,700
Aboard a military ship.

263
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,700
Some people might say she was a
victim of political persecution.

264
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,600
Hell.

265
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,600
She could apply for asylum.

266
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,000
Asylum. 

267
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,300
That's it. 

268
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,300
I want asylum.

269
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,600
Under Gemenon law, the girl is
still the property of her parents.

270
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,500
And they can deal with her once
she's safely back on her ship.

271
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
To be honest,...

272
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,800
I'm more concerned with the broader
implications of this matter.

273
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,900
- Sarah.
- I know you don't want to hear this.

274
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,100
But my people, my voters are
demanding action on this issue.

275
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,300
We have been through this.

276
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,000
Abortion was legal under
colonial law before the attacks,...

277
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,700
and so it is still legal today.

278
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,500
It's obscene.

279
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,200
The scriptures view abortion as an
abomination in the eyes of the gods.

280
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,800
You cannot equivocate
on this point...

281
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,800
if want our support in
the coming election.

282
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Rya Kibby's petition for asylum
is under review.

283
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Thank you, Sarah,
very much for coming in.

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,700
I'm not turning that girl over.

285
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,900
I'm certainly not banning abortion.

286
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,400
Then don't. 

287
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,700
But we have to move
aggressively on this thing.

288
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,400
I'm arranging a conference call
with you and the quorum.

289
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,400
This is gonna get
out of hand fast.

290
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,200
She's not Billy.

291
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,200
No, she's not. 

292
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,400
What?

293
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,400
I hate to say this. 

294
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,300
Because I know
that this is a political issue.

295
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,000
The fact is that that number...

296
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
doesn't go up very often.

297
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,700
I fought for a woman's right
to control her body...

298
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,100
my entire career.

299
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,400
No. No.

300
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
I'm just remembering
what you said.

301
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Right after the cylon attack.

302
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,700
That if we really
want to save the human race,...

303
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,800
we'd better start having babies.

304
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Nothing, nothing, and more nothing.

305
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,100
Where...is shark's
last transmission?

306
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,900
Well...

307
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,900
there's not much there.

308
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,500
"...Eve...distress...bearing...

309
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,200
reek...shuns...emerge-- read."

310
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,600
They were in distress.

311
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,300
They...

312
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,400
give a bearing "requesting
instructions...

313
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,600
it's an emergency... can you read"?

314
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,200
Maybe, but what's this
"eve" fragment here?

315
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,000
Eve...distress.

316
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Eve...distress. 

317
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,000
Distress call

318
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Eve. Recei-received?

319
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Received distress call.

320
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,000
Okay. From who?

321
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,300
I don't know. 

322
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,300
But maybe that's where
they went. To go find out.

323
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,700
Commander, Captain Thrace has a
theory about our missing raptors,
sir.

324
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,500
That's good
considering she lost them.

325
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,900
Excuse me?

326
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,200
Well, they were out on one of your
so-called training missions.

327
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,000
Weren't they, Captain?

328
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
My "so-called" training missions.

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,300
Okay, let's just take this easy.

330
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,900
That's when you're not boozing or
sowing mutiny amongst the crew.

331
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,800
Mutiny?

332
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Commander, we should take
this to a private place.

333
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Don't you think I know what's
happening on my own ship?

334
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,200
"Barely competent? And paranoid?"

335
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,300
That was off the record.
I was just venting. 

336
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,700
Accurately.

337
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,800
I'll have you court-martialled.

338
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,100
Commander. 

339
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,200
I'm not defending
Captain Thrace's behavior.

340
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,000
Thanks, Major.

341
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Captain Thrace,
you're restricted to quarters.

342
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,700
Until I can ship you back
to Galactica.

343
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,900
You're Adama's pet.

344
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,900
Let him deal with you.

345
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,000
Major?

346
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes, sir.

347
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,100
You've been on board
less than four days,...

348
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,900
and you're already facing charges.
You don't waste any time, do you?

349
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,700
Neither do you, Lee.

350
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,100
How's it feel
being Garner's new playmate?

351
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,700
I'm here to do a job!

352
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,400
Yeah. 

353
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Keep a loudmouth, disobedient
frak of Kara Thrace in line.

354
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,700
Not doing such a
good job, are ya? 

355
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,400
Evidently not.

356
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,800
We don't have much time.
Those guys are running out of air.

357
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,100
Yeah, well, I tried. All right?

358
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,400
All I have done since I got to
the beast is try and help,...

359
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,500
and all I've gotten is Garner's
foot in my ass.

360
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Well, maybe you need
a kick in the ass!

361
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,500
All right. 

362
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,100
Here we go. 

363
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,800
Finally.

364
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
What is your problem anyway?

365
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,500
What's my problem?

366
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,300
What's my problem? 

367
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,400
Well Kara,
my problem is you.

368
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,300
You keep frakking up, and I keep
having to clean it up,...

369
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,500
and I am officially... sick of it.

370
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,900
Poor Lee, your
life is so hard, isn't it?

371
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,900
You mean, since I got shot.

372
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,300
You wanna hear what I think
happened to Buster, or not?

373
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,900
Pegasus, Red Devil.

374
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,300
I'm nearing the last coordinates
where our raptors went missing.

375
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,100
Repeat...Emergency...

376
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,900
Buster, is that you? 

377
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,800
Buster, this is
Red Devil, man.

378
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,300
Is that you, buddy?
Come back to me.

379
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,600
Power failure...

380
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,300
oxygen's almost out...

381
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,300
For love of the gods, help.

382
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Sir!

383
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,400
One of our search raptors just
picked up a possible distress signal...

384
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,200
from near where Pegasus lost
communications with Buster's ship.

385
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Finally.

386
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Possible distress signal.

387
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,800
There's a theory that Buster
himself might have jumped away...

388
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,300
to run down a phony distress
call. It could be a trap.

389
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,800
A theory? 

390
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,700
Is this your theory, major? 

391
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,700
This is captain Thrace's
theory, is it not? 

392
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,700
Mr. Thornton.

393
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,300
Can you give us a fix on where this
distress signal is coming from?

394
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,700
Yes, sir, it's long range,
over 40 SU away.

395
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,200
Then spin up the FTL drive,
and prepare to jump the ship.

396
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,100
Yes, sir.

397
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,600
Sir! 

398
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,200
This isn't just Captain
Thrace's theory.

399
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,100
I think this is a cylon trap, and...

400
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,100
And I disagree.

401
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,700
Now get Admiral Adama on the line.

402
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,700
I'm going to get our men.

403
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,400
Admiral, we finally got the
break we've been looking for...

404
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,000
bearing on the distress signal.

405
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,800
I can jump there
inside of two minutes.

406
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,600
Commander, believe me,
I understand how you feel.

407
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,800
But the cylons have been
known to lure ships into traps.

408
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,900
Using fake distressed calls.

409
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,100
Have you considered that?

410
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,500
We have, sir. 

411
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,600
It's a scenario
we don't think likely.

412
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,700
We? 

413
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,700
Major Adama, do you concur?

414
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,100
Sir...

415
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,700
Captain Thrace and I
are of the opinion...

416
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,200
that the first two raptors...

417
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,800
may very well have been lured
away by just such a trick.

418
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,800
An opinion I do not share, sir.

419
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,900
We'll send a recon
mission in full force.

420
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
Five raptors.

421
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,700
Three escort, two rescue.

422
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,400
You have your orders, Commander.

423
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

424
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,400
Thank you, Major.

425
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm sure your expertise
is needed elsewhere.

426
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Yes, sir.

427
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,900
Yes, I am curious.

428
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,300
Why the sudden interest in
the fleet's demographic projections?

429
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,900
An issue has emerged that may prove
divisive to our administration.

430
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,500
I would like all the facts in hand
before making my decision.

431
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,800
So, now it's our administration?

432
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,800
She must be desperate.

433
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,000
Well, I'm a very busy man.

434
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,100
Luckily, I made an initial
calculation on these figures...

435
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,200
over seven months ago when nobody
seemed interested or concerned.

436
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,600
All I had to do was factor in
the numbers from the Pegasus crew.

437
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,400
It took me hardly any time at all,
and I didn't mind.

438
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,200
Look, I'll save you the bother,
you needn't read the report.

439
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,500
If we continue on our
present course,...

440
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,100
within the next 18 years,
the human race will simply be...

441
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,100
extinct.

442
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,400
Since assuming the presidency,...

443
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,400
I've made it my mission to
maintain the rights and freedoms...

444
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,600
we so enjoyed prior to the attack.

445
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,500
One of these rights has now
come into direct conflict...

446
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,000
with the survival of the species.

447
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And I find myself forced to make a
very difficult decision.

448
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,000
The issue is stark. 

449
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,400
The fact is that if the
civilization is to survive,...

450
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,400
we must, must repopulate
this fleet. 

451
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,700
Therefore, I'm issuing
an executive order.

452
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,800
From this day forward,...

453
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,600
anyone seeking to interfere
with a birth of child,...

454
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,600
whether it be the mother...

455
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,600
or a medical practitioner...

456
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
shall be subject
to criminal penalty.

457
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Thank you.

458
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,500
All flight deck personnel,
please report to stations.

459
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,900
All right, come on,
let's go, let's go!

460
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
Captain Case, what's going on?

461
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,700
We've been ordered to
scramble, condition one.

462
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,800
Ship's getting ready to jump.

463
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,700
We're gonna launch
on the other side.

464
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,000
- Get down to the hangar deck!
- What?

465
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,900
Look. 

466
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,200
You're the best
pilot we've got. 

467
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,500
So, get down there.
Find a viper.

468
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,500
It's about time you admitted that!

469
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,100
Commander, what's our sitrep?

470
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,800
This is a rescue mission, Major.

471
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,000
- On whose authority?
- Mine. 

472
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,400
I'm bringing my pilots home.

473
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,900
With all due respect, sir.  

474
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,700
But if this is a cylon trap,...

475
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,900
then we are entering blind!

476
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,300
We should send a force recon...

477
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,300
My pilots are dying
down there, Major!

478
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,500
I'm going in,
I'm not waiting on recon!

479
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,300
Commander, this is in direct
violation of the Admiral's orders.

480
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,100
Major. Leave combat.

481
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,800
Making this an illegal
action on your part, sir!

482
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,500
You are relieved, Major!

483
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,300
Sergeant of the guard.

484
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,700
I am forced to take
command of this vessel!

485
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,800
- This man is in direct disobedience of an order...
 - Under federal regulations...

486
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,800
- I want him under arrest!
- I place you under arrest!

487
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,200
Sergeant. 

488
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,500
Take him below.

489
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,600
Sergeant, the commander's
been properly relieved.

490
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Escort him to his quarters.

491
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,200
This man is not
a member of this crew,...

492
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,800
and you will obey a direct order...

493
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,800
that you have been given
by me, and you will do it now.

494
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,200
Major. 

495
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,200
You'll come with me.

496
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Admiral! 

497
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,200
The Pegasus has jumped.
They're gone.

498
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,500
Dradis signal's clean. Jump put is
clear of any interference.

499
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,600
Sir, I show two raptors.

500
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,500
Transponder codes match.
They're ours.

501
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Mr. Hoshi.

502
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,400
Tell the CAG to
launch our recovery team,...

503
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,900
and let's bring our people home.

504
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,900
Aye, sir.

505
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,900
Pegasus, Red Devil. 

506
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,800
Our two birds
look intact.

507
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,000
Can't quite see inside yet.

508
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Commander, we're unable to
raise the raptors on wireless.
Oh, my gods.

509
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,800
Pegasus, both raptor
crews are dead.

510
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,800
I repeat. They're all dead.

511
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,000
Sir, three cylon base ships just
jumped into weapons range.

512
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,300
Oh, my gods.

513
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,600
They're launching nukes!

514
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Brace for impact.

515
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Damage report?

516
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,500
Two...two nuclear
detonations in the stern, sir.

517
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,600
FTL drive inoperative, sir.

518
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
We're stuck here, sir.

519
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,400
All right, Showboat. You take red
squadron. Hit 'em on the right.

520
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,000
Catbird, you take green.
Hit 'em on the left.

521
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,200
The rest of you, follow me.
We're going straight up the gut.

522
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Sergeant, I think you have
better things to do.

523
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,500
Oh, then the spinner's fine?

524
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,200
It's gotta be a sensor.
Just pull it.

525
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,200
No, no, listen to me. Listen to me.
Just pull it, pull it!

526
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,700
Nuclear detonation.

527
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,600
We have structural damage
along the topside heat exchanger.

528
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,000
We can't take much more
of this. How long before...

529
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,200
those drives are back up?

530
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,200
I don't know. They don't
seem to understand.

531
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,200
I need to go down there.

532
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,800
You have the con.

533
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,900
Yes, sir. 

534
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,400
I have the con.

535
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Make for the nearest base ship.

536
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,600
And roll us over to keep our top
side out of their line of fire.

537
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,800
Hoshi, contact Starbuck in case...

538
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,100
tell them I've
assumed command.

539
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,000
And to concentrate on
protecting our top side.

540
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,300
Aye, sir.

541
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,300
Wilco, Pegasus.
We got your back.

542
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,800
Mr. Gaeta, any contact?

543
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Negative, sir.

544
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,100
Gimme that.

545
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,600
Can I get through there?

546
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,300
Base ship dead ahead,
we're closing rapidly!

547
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,300
We can't keep taking hits
like this, Major.

548
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,700
Helm. 

549
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,200
Steady as you go.

550
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,000
Have the bow battery
stand by for a salvo fire.

551
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,300
Target their center axis.

552
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,300
Yes, sir.

553
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,900
See if we can't cut down the odds.

554
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,100
We need those FTLs fixed soon.

555
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,100
Or we're dead.

556
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,000
Twenty-two hundred.
Main battery has a firing solution.

557
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And fire.

558
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,900
Coolant pressure's off-scale low.

559
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,700
Primary inlet's choked.

560
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,300
Pressure's dropping. We gotta hull
breach in there somewhere.

561
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,000
Well, we gotta get in there,
and open the auxiliary valve!

562
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,200
We can't do that, sir!

563
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,100
We have to!

564
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,500
Sir, that breach can vent all
our oxygen into space.

565
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,500
We don't have a choice.
Now, open the hatch. 

566
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,500
Breathing gear?

567
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,400
We used it all up
fighting the fires, sir.

568
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,200
Give me sledge and a number
12 spanner. 

569
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,100
All right. 

570
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,300
Now close this hatch behind me.

571
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,200
We're losing air,...

572
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,200
close the gods damn hatch.
Close it!

573
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,800
Base ship's turning away.

574
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,800
He's--he's frakkin' running, Major!

575
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,700
But the other two aren't. 

576
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,600
They're coming hard.

577
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,900
Helm...

578
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,900
left, full.

579
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm at the manifold. 

580
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm gonna see
if I can turn them. 

581
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,700
Yes!

582
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,100
There's definitely air escaping.

583
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,800
Through a crack, over the SVC relay. 

584
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,700
The breach is behind that.

585
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,600
Starbuck reports
vipers are skosh ammo, Major.

586
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,800
We're down to throwing
rocks at the bastards.

587
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,300
We gotta haul ass
outta here now, sir! 

588
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,100
Sir!

589
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,900
Come on, Garner.

590
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,900
O2's in the red, skipper.
You're almost out of air.

591
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,700
You got it! The pressure's
coming back up.

592
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,700
Now get the frak outta there,
come on!

593
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,000
You're air is gone, skipper!
Get outta  there! 

594
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Skipper?

595
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Engineering's reporting a green
board. FTL drive online and ready.

596
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,200
Okay, commence jump prep.

597
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Bring our birds home.

598
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,900
Pegasus, Starbuck. 

599
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,900
Nobody behind me
but toasters. 

600
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,300
Now get us outta here!

601
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,900
Air wing's back on board.

602
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,100
Landing bays secure.

603
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,100
Jump!

604
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,300
You give Garner a lot of credit.

605
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,300
Well, it's all true.

606
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,500
He gave his life to save the ship.

607
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,200
Starbuck's report wasn't so kind.

608
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,600
Well, she had her perspective.

609
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,600
And I had mine.

610
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,900
In your opinion,...

611
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,600
off the record...

612
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,600
what was Garner's flaw?

613
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,200
He was used to
working with machines. 

614
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Command is about people.

615
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,100
Remember that. 

616
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:17,100
I want you to take
command... of the beast.

617
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,700
Garner was my decision.

618
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,700
His failure's my responsibility.

619
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,600
Don't let me fail a second time.

620
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Congratulations, Commander.

621
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,500
Madame President?

622
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,300
Word has it that you do not intend...

623
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,300
to prosecute the
Gemenese girl on Galactica.

624
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
She has a name, Sarah. 

625
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,200
I think that Rya has
suffered enough.

626
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,300
She's just been
through an abortion.

627
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,100
I've granted her asylum
aboard Galactica.

628
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,200
This is in total
violation of the law.

629
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,700
My order came after she sought her
procedure. No laws have been broken.

630
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,700
The girl belongs at home,
with her parents. I insist.

631
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,900
You have your pound of flesh.

632
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,900
And I suggest you take your
victory, and you move on.

633
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Ma'am?

634
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,800
You realize you're screwed, right?

635
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,700
All the pressure, the responsibility,
the sleepless nights,...

636
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,600
all the officers
giving you a hard time.

637
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,600
Yeah, well, it could be worse.
You could be my CAG.

638
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,100
I'm gonna stay
here and be Galactica's CAG.

639
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Something about wanting
to keep an eye on me.

640
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:21,800
Well,...

641
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,700
you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of
fun at those early morning briefings. 

642
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,700
'Cause the XO's
a lot of fun first thing.

643
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,700
Great. 

644
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,400
Congratulations. 

645
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,800
Really.

646
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Congratulations. 

647
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,800
You deserve it.

648
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,200
I know why I
was mad at you, Kara.

649
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
A simple thank you would
have been sufficient.

650
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
'Cause you were doing
what you always did.

651
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,200
Buck authority,
and get away with it. 

652
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,700
I bucked authority once.

653
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,700
And I almost lost everything.

654
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,700
So I guess when
I showed up on Pegasus,...

655
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,700
and there you were doing it
all over again...

656
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,200
I don't know.

657
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Pissed me off. 

658
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,200
Doesn't make a lot
of sense, does it?

659
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,200
You should hear the
way my brain works sometimes. 

660
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,500
Are we okay?

661
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,500
You have a brain? 

662
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,900
Madame President,
your decision to...

663
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,300
criminalize abortion
has created a furor.

664
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,300
Do you think that's hurt your
standing in the polls?

665
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,700
Absolutely.

666
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,700
If I may, Madame President.

667
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
It is true in the light
of recent events,...

668
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,300
the President may have lost
support in some quarters.

669
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,800
I  would ask the people
to understand that...

670
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,600
if this is an extreme decision,...

671
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,700
we live in extreme times.

672
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,800
The decision has been
made with good faith.

673
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,800
I, however, cannot with good
conscience support it.

674
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,500
I am so sorry, Madame President.

675
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,300
But the cylon have no understanding
of the meaning of the word freedom.

676
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,300
How could they? 

677
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,200
They're programmed. 

678
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,900
Machines.

679
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,300
Every time you take
away one of our freedoms,...

680
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,300
every time you restrict or
curtail one of our rights,...

681
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,600
we become one step
closer to being like them.

682
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,000
As the vice-president,...

683
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I am bound to follow
the administration's lead.

684
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,500
As president...

685
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,200
I should have no such strictures.

686
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,700
Given the current situation,...

687
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,300
I'm afraid that I have no alternative...

688
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,300
but to announce
that I am, as of now,...

689
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,400
a candidate for the presidency.

690
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,600
Are you you resigning
the vice presidency?

691
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Are you a one-issue candidate?

692
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Are you being disloyal
to the President?
