00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,235
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,756
My name is Lee Adama!

3
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,071
And l love Kara Thrace!

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,390
<i>(Anders) Did you hear the news?</i>

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,675
We got married.
Can you believe it?

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,910
No. No, l can't believe it.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,152
Congratulations, Sam.
And good luck - you're gonna need it.

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,270
- l missed you.
- l missed you too.

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,113
The child's life must be protected
at all costs.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,352
The first Cylon-human hybrid
truly is a miracle from God.

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,635
This child will not be raised by the Cylon,

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,998
and we cannot risk Cylon agents getting
their hands on it. l've made my decision.

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,073
We lost her. We did the best we could,
but she's dead.

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,673
And that's all there is to it.

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,835
As far as the Cylons know, this child no
longer exists. That is a good, good thing.

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,671
<i>(baby cries)</i>

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,755
It's Hera, the first of God's new generation.

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,628
Have you seen the faces of the other five
Cylons, the ones no one has seen?

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,917
- Why do you want to know about them?
- l could be a Cylon.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,755
- l thought the supply was inexhaustible.
- Food manufacturing's contaminated.

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,833
If we hold on until Athena gets back,
this algae can keep us alive indefinitely.

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,117
There was a way through the star cluster,
and l found the planet.

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,636
<i>There's huge swaths of algae,</i>
<i>just like we thought.</i>

24
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,995
- <i>(man)</i> 14-inch intake?
- <i>(man #2)</i> Yeah, that's great.

25
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,154
This can go in the first Raptor,
that in the second.

26
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,470
- Need a hand?
- Yeah.

27
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,311
Couple more days, we can wrap this up,
get away from this stench.

28
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,436
It's as bad up here as it is down there.

29
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,829
At least it tastes as good as it smells.

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,038
Well, it's breakfast, lunch and dinner
until someone finds a hot-fudge planet.

31
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,111
Oh, what is this?

32
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,551
Who the hell is that?

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,791
Starbuck, l guess.

34
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,795
Third time this week.

35
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,953
It's amazing how she keeps landing
on the top of the pilot rotation.

36
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,953
Well, uh...
Doughnut runs are assigned off a coin flip.

37
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,828
Kara probably thinks
she's running a stream of bad luck.

38
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,631
- l should probably get over there.
- l'll skip the meet-and-greet this time.

39
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,188
Sure.

40
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,878
- You brought her in a little hot.
- Well, had l known l was being graded,

41
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,157
l would have thrown in
a couple of barrel rolls.

42
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,836
Remind me to thank the CAG for sticking
me on these crap doughnut runs, huh?

43
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,670
This is insane, you know.

44
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,269
That's just the way l like it.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,309
Shall we start emptying the tents?

46
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,710
Yeah, get this cleared up first,
and then get to the tents.

47
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,791
OK.

48
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,274
l can barely look Dee in the eye.

49
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,994
We gotta do something about this.

50
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,230
OK. Like what?

51
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,788
l don't know. Like divorce.

52
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,591
No. Uh-uh.

53
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,038
Let's get real here.

54
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,558
You said yourself things were bad,
your marriage was failing.

55
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,232
Yeah, but marriage is a sacrament.

56
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,792
It's not a Pyramid game.
You don't... you don't get do-overs, Lee.

57
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,557
l made a vow in the sight of the gods,
and l am not gonna break that.

58
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,030
You're breaking it every time we do this.

59
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,711
Every time.

60
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,311
Divorce is different.
This is just bending the rules.

61
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,469
No, l'm sorry. l can't...
l can't live like this.

62
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,193
Every time l look at my wife,
l see my own guilt reflected in her eyes.

63
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,271
Wow, Lee, that is really poetic of you,

64
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,477
but you don't need
to make that big of a deal out of this.

65
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,358
Well, it is a big deal, Kara. It is.

66
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,670
It is.

67
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,751
Great.

68
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,359
So, l won't divorce, and you won't cheat.

69
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,755
So where does that leave us?

70
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,958
Trapped.

71
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,751
<i>(baby cries)</i>

72
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,472
Who are the final five?

73
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,710
l could be a Cylon.

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,591
<i>(screams)</i>

75
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,111
<i>(baby cries)</i>

76
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,711
She's not well.

77
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,029
What's the matter, Hera?

78
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,718
Shh.

79
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,273
It's OK, Hera.

80
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,191
It's OK.

81
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,838
Shh.

82
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,911
l'm here for you.

83
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,988
<i>(Chief)</i> Radiocarbon dating suggests
the temple's at least 4,000 years old,

84
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,799
which lines up with the exodus
of the thirteenth tribe.

85
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,996
<i>(Roslin) You found the Temple of Five?</i>

86
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,596
Yeah. l recognise it from the books
in my father's study, Madam President.

87
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,515
He was a priest, and the Temple of Five
was an important part of our... his faith.

88
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,993
Could this place be related
to the Eye of Jupiter, Chief?

89
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,752
You got me.

90
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,231
All l know is the stuff l kind of remember
from sneaking into my dad's study.

91
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,313
The Eye of Jupiter?
What exactly are we talking about?

92
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,951
According to the scriptures, it's a marker
left behind by the thirteenth tribe.

93
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,919
- It's supposed to point the way to Earth.
- <i>(alarm blares)</i>

94
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,230
Chief, we're on alert.
This is Adama.

95
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,551
Lieutenant Gaeta, CIC.
We have multiple DRADIS contacts.

96
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,279
- <i>Four Cylon baseships jumped into view.</i>
- On our way.

97
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,269
- SITREP.
- Four baseships inbound at high speed.

98
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,634
Four?

99
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,950
Bastards practically jumped on top of us.

100
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,272
Fleet's spooling up their FTL drives.
Preparing to jump to standby coordinates.

101
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,634
- Do it.
- Aye, sir.

102
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,837
We gotta hold this position
until everyone's back on board.

103
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,992
- How many are down there?
- Enough.

104
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,436
If the Eye of Jupiter is in that temple
and is a marker to Earth...

105
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,115
We can't let the Cylons get their hands
on it. Stand by to launch Vipers.

106
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,478
Something's odd here.
Cylons aren't launching Raiders.

107
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,189
Baseships are standing off,
outside of weapons range.

108
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,271
That is odd.

109
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,752
Admiral.

110
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,390
It's the Cylon baseship,
requesting to speak with you.

111
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,675
Put it through to speaker.

112
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,234
This is Admiral Adama.

113
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,438
<i>(Baltar) Admiral, l can't tell you</i>
<i>what a genuine pleasure it is</i>

114
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,272
<i>to hear your voice.</i>

115
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,751
<i>This is Gaius Baltar.</i>

116
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,439
<i>(Roslin)</i> l can't believe
we're allowing Cylons on this ship.

117
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,593
They must want something pretty bad
or else they would have started shooting.

118
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,355
Why send Baltar? They gotta know
we won't believe a word he says.

119
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,874
He can say what he wants.
The longer he talks,

120
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,430
the more time we have to get Lee
and his people off the planet.

121
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,194
Feels like old times.

122
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,188
l can't believe how much
l miss this place.

123
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,316
You know you can't return.

124
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,598
They'd toss you out the nearest air lock
and then throw a party.

125
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,159
Yes, l know.

126
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,753
Still, l can't help feeling l'm finally... home.

127
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,713
If you're really a Cylon,
a member of the final five,

128
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,793
these feelings are just part
of your programming, part of your cover.

129
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,678
And if l'm a human being after all?

130
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,996
If l'm not one of the final five, this is the
last chance l get to see my kind again.

131
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,559
- Colonel, wait.
- Well, look at this. Should we salute?

132
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,471
That's Boomer.

133
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,755
The one who shot the old man?

134
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,393
Well, you just lost your visiting privileges.

135
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,473
- Hold that thing here until we get back.
- Yes, sir.

136
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,079
You three, keep on moving.

137
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,433
Laura.

138
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,279
Laura, my...

139
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,194
It's good to see you.

140
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,675
Weapons are hardly necessary.

141
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,548
Yes, exactly.
We come in peace.

142
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,354
What do you want?

143
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,670
We want the Eye of Jupiter.

144
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,796
So let's skip the denials and protestations
and go straight to it.

145
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,519
We know that you have people
on the ground.

146
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,435
And we know that you've found the
original settlement of the thirteenth tribe.

147
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,273
It also doesn't take
a lot of deduction to conclude

148
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,558
that the only reason you haven't cut
your losses and jumped away by now

149
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,351
is that you've probably found the artefact,
but you haven't been able to retrieve it yet.

150
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,998
Is that about right?

151
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,311
We have our people on the surface.
We're not leaving them behind.

152
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,437
That's a touching,
but not very convincing, idea.

153
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,356
The chances we've all converged on this
small planet at the same time are small.

154
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,749
So we all understand it's not chance.

155
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,674
You want the Eye,
the Cylons want the Eye.

156
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,838
l'd like to discuss the practical issues,
so we can reach some accommodation.

157
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,593
The less this man says,
the better this will go.

158
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,796
Wait a minute.

159
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,634
If it wasn't for me, the Cylons
would have blown you out of the sky.

160
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,077
l think you can handle this alone.
If you can stomach it.

161
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,516
So l've saved your life - again.

162
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,160
How many times is that now?
l'm losing count.

163
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,800
If it wasn't for me, you'd all be dead!

164
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,597
What's your offer?

165
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,389
You give us the Eye of Jupiter,
we let you go.

166
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,556
- And... we'll throw in Baltar.
- What are you talking about now?

167
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,269
l'm improvising.
Throwing something sweet in the pot.

168
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,114
Besides, l suspect that the admiral
and Madam President

169
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,070
would enjoy some nice quiet,
private time with their former leader.

170
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,151
Am l right?

171
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,754
Worth thinking about.

172
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,833
Definitely worth thinking about.

173
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,270
Despite that uniform,
it's not your home any more.

174
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,998
l've made my choice,
and l know where my loyalties lie.

175
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,592
What if l told you
that your daughter was still alive?

176
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,757
- l'd say you were lying.
- Well, someone's lying.

177
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,831
But it's not me.

178
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,909
Hera's alive.

179
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,993
At least for now.
She's ill and we don't know why.

180
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,995
Yeah, right.

181
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,278
Baltar found her on New Caprica
during the evacuation.

182
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,670
She's on our baseship right now.

183
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,992
From what we could gather,
she was hidden at Laura Roslin's school,

184
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,154
which means that she probably
planned the whole thing in the first place.

185
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,518
- l don't need to listen to this. Watch her.
- They let you think that she was dead.

186
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,875
You don't do that to a person,
but to a thing!

187
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,988
That's what your friends think of you.
You're not one of them! You're a thing!

188
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,272
We're not giving you
the key to finding Earth.

189
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,194
You try bringing it up from that planet
and see what happens.

190
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,430
We outnumber you four to one.

191
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,317
l'm setting the terms now.

192
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,070
Make any attempt to attack this ship
or the people on the planet's surface,

193
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,833
l'll launch every nuke l've got.

194
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,390
Lay waste to the entire continent.

195
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,231
You're bluffing.

196
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,956
You wanna find out as much as we do.

197
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,318
- Guards, escort them back to their ship.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,557
It would help if l knew what l was looking
for. Does it really look like an eye?

199
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,996
l don't know.
The scriptures make reference to the Eye

200
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,153
being left in some sort of temple,
but there's no physical description.

201
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,232
All we know for sure
is it supposedly points the way to Earth.

202
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,515
And you believe that?

203
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,353
The Cylons do.
l can't take a chance they were right.

204
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,560
If it looks like they're gonna get
into the temple, your order is to blow it.

205
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,396
- Understood. What's...
- <i>(alarm blares)</i>

206
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,516
What's going on?

207
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,239
The Cylons are jamming the wireless.

208
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,311
Every frequency.

209
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,152
OK, we need to establish
our communications.

210
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,630
Work out a plan to defend this temple
while Tyrol searches.

211
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,076
Defend it with what? A dozen marines?
Maybe five more military?

212
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,153
- They'd have to draft the civilians.
- Can l make a suggestion you won't like?

213
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,435
Do you make any other kind?

214
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,913
Use Sam to command the civilians.

215
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,391
You're not serious?

216
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,271
- Lee.
- Hey, Sam.

217
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,238
Hi.

218
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,278
Heard you were coming down.

219
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,751
Guess it takes an emergency
to get us in the same room these days.

220
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,831
Can we do this later, please?

221
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,708
Sam, l need you to command the civilians.
Form them into fire teams.

222
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,112
- l'll give my deployment orders through...
- Whoa, whoa, wait. Deployment orders?

223
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,355
Fire teams? Come on. Some of these guys
have never even held a rifle before.

224
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,149
You're supposed to be the expert
in turning civilians into soldiers.

225
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,712
We were guerrilla fighters. Hit and run.
Keep moving, keep the enemy off balance.

226
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,315
l've never had to defend a fixed position.
That's a different game.

227
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,914
Well, you're just gonna
have to learn it fast.

228
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,197
We're defending this position
until Chief finds this Eye.

229
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,398
OK, so you want us to risk our lives for
something you haven't even found yet?!

230
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,278
Sam, l'm not even sure it exists.

231
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,590
But l don't have to tell you every detail...

232
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,310
- What you have to explain to me...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

233
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,834
The major's in charge of this one, OK?

234
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,115
- OK?
- Mm.

235
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,429
l certainly wouldn't want
to step between you and your major.

236
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,477
- Well, l thought that went really well.
- He'll do it.

237
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,869
He'd better.

238
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,077
l miss Nicky.
Do you think he's OK?

239
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,278
Yes, he's fine. He's fine.

240
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,351
l know.

241
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,075
You know, when l was growing up,
l hated everything about the faith -

242
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,915
the rules, the rituals,
endless discussions at the dinner table.

243
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,549
l used to sneak into my mom's
prayer room, the holiest of the holies,

244
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,189
and l would dance around naked
with porn magazines just to defy the gods

245
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,953
and tell them to frak off.

246
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,237
l don't even know how l found this place.
l just got this urge to start walking,

247
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,914
and then, suddenly, here it is.

248
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,395
Well, you should see the look on your face
when you're in here.

249
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,472
There's this... reverence.

250
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,151
You even talk softer.

251
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,670
l feel something in here.

252
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,875
Something true.

253
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,598
But here l am setting charges
in this special place.

254
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,231
The holiest of the holies.
This is the Temple of Five.

255
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,909
If my parents could see this.

256
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,555
And l'm gonna blow it up.

257
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,511
<i>(Gaeta)</i> l noticed some anomalies
in the solar radiation belt.

258
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,717
l made an analysis
of the star's vibration modes.

259
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,634
Sure enough, it appears
to be highly unstable -

260
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,837
if you can believe it,
on the verge of going supernova.

261
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,797
When?

262
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,237
It could be tomorrow, could be next year.
There's no way of knowing for sure, sir.

263
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,278
When it does happen,
the only warning that we're likely to get

264
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,830
is a fast helium flash, at which point
we'll have to jump out of here

265
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,311
before it obliterates
the entire planetary system.

266
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:45,033
Sir, l'm not one to look for religious signs,
but l can't get my head around these odds.

267
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,910
That human and Cylon both converge
on this planet at this exact moment,

268
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,878
just as this star is about to go supernova?

269
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,839
l'm not a religious person, Mr Gaeta,
as you well know.

270
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,151
So if this is the work
of a higher power,

271
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,550
then they have
one hell of a sense of humour.

272
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,755
We have a standoff.
Very predictable.

273
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,991
They have the Eye,
and they'll nuke it if we try to take it.

274
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,993
And we'll shoot them down
if they try bringing it up to <i>Galactica.</i>

275
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,197
Are we sure they have it?
How do we know they're not bluffing?

276
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,554
You don't.

277
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,359
We Threes feel
that we can't afford to take the chance.

278
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,194
l think we're missing the big picture here.

279
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,272
We have the opportunity
to rid the universe

280
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,670
of the human pestilence,
once and for all.

281
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,276
We can discuss that after we get the Eye
of Jupiter, after we find the path to Earth.

282
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,559
Let me point out that it doesn't matter
if we find Earth in five days,

283
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,394
or if we find Earth in 5,000 years.

284
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,191
We're machines, we'll still be around
to savour the great miracle.

285
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,198
So let them destroy the Eye,
if indeed they have it.

286
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,397
We have to take advantage of the situation
and take down <i>Galactica</i>

287
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,395
once and for all.

288
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,198
Or we could stand here and do nothing.

289
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,317
We're not doing nothing, Cavil.

290
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,188
- Plans are in motion.
- l'm sorry. What is that?

291
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,149
D'Anna.

292
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,597
l put a heavy Raider down on the planet's
surface as soon as we jumped in.

293
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,070
l thought that would be our best chance
of slipping by their DRADIS.

294
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,276
Seems l was right.

295
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,352
Was there any reason the rest of us
weren't involved in this?

296
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,355
It was a need-to-know mission. So now l
am telling you because you need to know.

297
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,150
We cut off their troops' communications
and put our own troops on the ground.

298
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,598
So as soon as the Centurions retrieve
the Eye, you can take out <i>Galactica.</i>

299
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,831
OK, here's the deal.
We're out of options.

300
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,310
The Cylons have got us pinned
on this rock, and our only way out of here

301
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,995
is to hold this place until <i>Galactica</i>
can send a rescue party.

302
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,753
So l've divided you into two teams, OK?

303
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,230
Team one is gonna be distributing
ammunition throughout the camp.

304
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,676
Team two is gonna be making
home-made tylium mines.

305
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,231
l know that's not glamorous work,
but we're gonna need the extra firepower

306
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,995
in case the Cylons decide
to take a shot at us.

307
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,956
Look, l know some of you are scared,
and that's OK, cos l'm scared too.

308
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,713
But if we keep our heads and do our jobs,
we can do this.

309
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,032
We can all get out of here. Barolay has a
list of your names and your assignments.

310
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,238
Make sure you get with her.
l'll see you outside.

311
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,871
That was good. Honest.

312
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,435
You'd make a good officer.

313
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,711
Officer, huh?

314
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,913
Like you? Someone who swears an oath
and knows how to keep it?

315
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,273
- l'm not sure what you think's going on...
- Don't insult me, OK? l'm not stupid.

316
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,956
l know my wife.
l know how she is.

317
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,910
We've been married for a year and a half.
What, you think you're the first?

318
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,913
l chose to marry Kara.
That's my business.

319
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,835
But you? l don't know
what the hell you think you're trying to do.

320
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:03,073
Look, l'm trying to fight a war. l'm trying to
get these people off this rock in one piece.

321
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,754
Anything for the cause, Major.

322
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,916
Gaius, l am on the verge of seeing
the faces of the final five Cylons.

323
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,468
Maybe the face of God Himself.

324
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,719
The five lights of the apocalypse rising,
struggling towards the light,

325
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,873
sins revealed only to those who enter
the temple, only to the Chosen One.

326
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,159
The Chosen One.
The Chosen One. The Chosen One.

327
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,152
The Chosen One. The Chosen One.

328
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,755
- The Chosen One.
- The five await me.

329
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,949
Gaius, l'm so close to knowing the truth.

330
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,031
What truth?

331
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,351
Caprica.

332
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,437
l'd like to think that we three
have shared something,

333
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,909
transcended the barriers
that separate people.

334
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,037
And yet somehow,
the more time goes on,

335
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,032
the more l find myself
on the outside looking in.

336
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,918
Well, that's not the case at all.
Is it?

337
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,878
Because we three,
we're integral, we're part of...

338
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,951
We're finished.

339
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,836
Baltar and my destiny
lies separate from yours, Caprica.

340
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,670
The five lights will be revealed
only to those who enter the temple.

341
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,593
We have to go down to the planet.
Only you and l can see this through.

342
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,114
What are you after?

343
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,990
What is this secret that you keep
pursuing? You have to tell me the truth.

344
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,878
- l love you both.
- We love you too.

345
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,955
But this is something
you cannot share with us.

346
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:05,079
Something l can't share with you? l loved
you when everyone else wanted you dead.

347
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,755
Now, look, you mustn't misunderstand.

348
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,831
It's not personal.

349
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,429
It's transcendent.
It's like what you said. It's transcendent.

350
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,511
Pray for us, Caprica.

351
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,110
We'll be praying for you.

352
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,592
OK, he wants us to set up
forward observation posts,

353
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,716
wired back to base
for communications.

354
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,554
Obs will be at strategic locations,
giving us as much warning as possible

355
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,108
if there is a Cylon advance.

356
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,476
Since we only have one Raptor,
Captain Thrace will fly point.

357
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,629
Oh, joy.

358
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,998
Wireless is dead,
so if you do make contact, do not engage.

359
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,993
Fly to the closest post, have them
relay the information back to Command.

360
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,753
Note force strength,
direction of march and position.

361
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,400
l have flown recon
once or twice, Lieutenant.

362
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,998
Griggs, you and Varrick are gonna set up
an observation post here.

363
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,799
Henick and Ditko, you go here.

364
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,795
- And who gets lucky number three?
- That would be Sergeant Fischer and me.

365
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,713
- Do you have a problem with that?
- No.

366
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,791
We go in an hour.

367
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,310
Green Base, Foxfire One. Green Base,
Foxfire One, we are open for business.

368
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,030
Son of a bitch.

369
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,075
- Tell me you're sending this.
- She's relaying a message.

370
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,037
It's Centurions!

371
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,790
Starbuck's been hit!
l say again, Starbuck's going down!

372
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,515
There's not much on the Eye
in these scriptures,

373
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,434
but there's interesting stories
about the temple. Listen to this.

374
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,115
"Five pillars of the temple
were fashioned after the five priests

375
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,351
- devoted to the one whose name can't..."
- Laura.

376
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,351
What?

377
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,228
The Cylon we knew as Boomer
arrived with the others.

378
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,795
She told our Sharon
that her child was alive,

379
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,309
and that she was onboard
one of the Cylon baseships.

380
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,473
And that she had been seen
on New Caprica, in your school.

381
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,471
The child is alive.

382
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,919
Yes... yes.

383
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,070
The child was at the school.
Yes, l kept her there.

384
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,075
We suspected that the Cylons captured
her during the exodus from New Caprica.

385
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,151
Yes, it's true.

386
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,193
Listen, the thing you might want to know
is that when...

387
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,278
Do you have any idea
what we've gone through?

388
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,115
You, of all people...

389
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,472
know what it's like to lose a child.

390
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,988
The difference is,
your child is still alive.

391
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,392
Eventually, l hope
you become grateful of that.

392
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,995
l want to see her.

393
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,200
What do you mean, she's gone down?
Gone down where?

394
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,398
Somewhere in the north valley. OK, get
your men on the line. Full ammo loads.

395
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,952
- They're coming from the north.
- We gotta set up a rescue party, right?

396
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,477
Uh, no. We don't have the manpower.
We have to defend the position.

397
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,279
- Lee, she could be dying out there.
- l know that, Sam.

398
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,955
But we are thin on the ground here
and the Cylons are on the march.

399
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,032
We have to hold our positions.

400
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,118
Are you out of your frakkin' mind?

401
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,717
We picked up six Raiders
falling away from the Cylon fleet.

402
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,920
- Definitely heading toward the planet.
- They have to know we see them.

403
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,790
They're testing us. Want to know
if we're bluffing about nuking the planet.

404
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,440
Unfortunately, we are bluffing.

405
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,750
Are we?

406
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,358
- Mr Hoshi.
- Aye, sir.

407
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,468
Order nuclear ground-strike missiles
into launch tubes four through ten.

408
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,030
Aye, sir.
This is a nuclear mission order.

409
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,754
Major's right. We don't have troops
to spare if we're holding this position.

410
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,389
Screw this position! We can take
those hills, use guerrilla tactics.

411
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,598
- That's what l've been talking about.
- That is not the mission. We have orders.

412
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,150
What are you, some goddamn
wind-up tin soldier? This is my wife!

413
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,314
l know who she is! And l have known her
and cared about her a lot longer than you!

414
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,155
You can do whatever the frak you want!
l am going after my wife!

415
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,995
- Missiles are loaded, Admiral.
- Open launch tube doors.

416
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,189
Doors are open, Admiral.

417
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,714
What are you doing?

418
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,598
Getting ready to nuke the planet.

419
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,555
Radiological detection.
They've opened their missile doors.

420
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,631
He's bluffing.

421
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,555
- l can't let you do that, Sam.
- l am not asking you for permission.

422
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,631
Sergeant Mathias.

423
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,714
Load target package three Bravo.

424
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,118
Set ground zero
to the underground structure.

425
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,318
<i>(Roslin)</i> Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee?

426
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,517
- They're loading a targeting package.
- It's a bluff.

427
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,751
The risk to us is unacceptable.
Turn back the Raiders.

428
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,910
The ships cannot turn back.
He won't launch.

429
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,074
And D'Anna was explicit that she
and Baltar make it to the planet's surface.

430
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,151
<i>(Caprica)</i> Is that what this is really about?

431
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,476
<i>(Chief) And the heavens opened up</i>
<i>and they saw the Eye.</i>

432
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,392
<i>But where is that frakking Eye?</i>

433
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,836
Are you kidding me?
You gonna shoot me now?

434
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,399
l can't let you go.
l need you on the line.

435
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,235
l need you commanding those civilians.
l'm sorry, Sam, but you cannot go.

436
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,791
l'm sorry, too, Major,
but you can't stop me.

437
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,592
Release of nuclear weapons
is now authorised.

438
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,477
Sir.

439
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,318
Slapstick.
