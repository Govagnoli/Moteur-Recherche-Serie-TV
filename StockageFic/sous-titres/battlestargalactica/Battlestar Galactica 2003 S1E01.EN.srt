1
00:00:01,087 --> 00:00:03,555
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:05,560
Now you tell me you're a machine.

3
00:00:05,647 --> 00:00:06,716
A robot.

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:09,446
You knew I wanted access
to defence mainframe.

5
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:12,644
Do you have any idea
what they'd do to me if they find out?

6
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:13,921
Get down.

7
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:17,676
Moments ago,
this ship received word...

8
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:21,077
that the Cylon attack
against our home worlds is underway.

9
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:24,125
As of this moment, we are at war.

10
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:26,402
All right, we can take three more people.

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,801
Giving up my seat.

12
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:36,285
I've decided you're an expression
of my subconscious mind...

13
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:38,676
playing itself out during my waking states.

14
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:41,201
So I'm in your head?

15
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:45,082
No.

16
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:48,000
There're maybe Cylon agents
living among us.

17
00:00:48,087 --> 00:00:50,237
Some may not even know
they're Cylons at all.

18
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:51,806
They could be sleeper agents...

19
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:56,005
programmed to perfectly impersonate
human beings until activation.

20
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:31,078
And one minute to mark.

21
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:22,644
God has a plan for you, Gaius.
He has a plan for everything and everyone.

22
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,927
Gaius? Are you even listening to me?

23
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:38,004
Passengers, 30 seconds to mark.

24
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:41,159
Planet. Men. Women. Age.

25
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:43,966
You know what? Do this after the jump.
It's all right.

26
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:00,196
You have to believe in something.

27
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:05,044
I believe in a world
that I can and do understand.

28
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:08,802
A rational universe.
Explained through rational means.

29
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:18,398
I love you. That's not rational.

30
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:21,995
I know.

31
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:26,923
No, but you're not rational.

32
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,962
You're also not really here.

33
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:34,646
Neither am I.

34
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:38,398
Madam President,
ladies and gentlemen...

35
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:40,603
our 33 minutes are almost up once again.

36
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:43,640
Please prepare for our faster-than-light jump.
Thank you.

37
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:53,245
Cutting it a little close this time,
aren't we, Billy?

38
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:56,205
Pilot says he's had to reboot
the FTL computer again.

39
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:02,755
Why do the Cylons come
every 33 minutes?

40
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:04,678
Why isn't it 34, 35...

41
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:06,280
Cally.
What?

42
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:08,846
Shut up.

43
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:13,686
Fifteen seconds.

44
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:18,917
Sir, Jump 237 underway.
Fifty-three ships have jumped.

45
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,521
Ten still reporting trouble
with their FTL drives...

46
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:23,120
including Colonial One.

47
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:25,524
We're getting slower.

48
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,405
Maybe this time.

49
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:52,800
Dradis contact.

50
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:54,236
It's the Cylons.

51
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:58,205
- Damn it.
- Not this time, maybe the next.

52
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:01,559
Got another idea for the next cycle.

53
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:04,798
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm afraid the Cylons have appeared again.

54
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:09,005
However, our FTL drive is now working
and we will jump momentarily.

55
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:11,919
Five days now.

56
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:17,999
There are limits...

57
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,235
to the human body, the human mind.

58
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:24,646
Tolerances that you can't push beyond.

59
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:28,958
Well, those are facts...

60
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:31,445
provable facts.

61
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:35,604
Everyone has a limit.

62
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:39,239
All right, you know the drill, people.
Scatter formation.

63
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:43,036
Keep them off the civies
and don't stray beyond the recovery line.

64
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:51,279
Watch the ammo hoists for the main guns.
You've got a red light right there.

65
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:58,762
We have a hit on the starboard
bow. Away the damage control parties.

66
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:00,917
Basestar is launching raiders.

67
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,997
Colonial One is ready to jump.

68
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:20,882
All civilian ships away,
including Colonial One.

69
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:23,197
Recover fighters. Stand by to jump.

70
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:24,766
Combat landings.

71
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:34,240
- All fighters aboard, sir.
- Execute jump.

72
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:53,839
Jump 237 complete.

73
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,646
All civilian ships
present and accounted for, sir.

74
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:00,445
Start the clock.

75
00:07:00,527 --> 00:07:03,246
And let's start prepping for the next jump.

76
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:06,205
Clock is running. Thirty-three minutes.

77
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,156
Mark.

78
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,883
You have 32 minutes, people.

79
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,043
You know you're not safe.

80
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:43,879
No, of course not.

81
00:07:44,687 --> 00:07:47,440
The Cylons will follow us again...

82
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,686
as they have the last 237 times.

83
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:55,961
You're right, you know.
There are limits.

84
00:07:56,407 --> 00:08:00,116
- Eventually, you'll make a mistake.
- And then you'll kill us all.

85
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,436
Yes.

86
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,566
Yes, I know.

87
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:07,282
But not for another 33 minutes.

88
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:38,236
I want to try
something new this time.

89
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,284
Divide the fleet into six groups.

90
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,321
And they jump...

91
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:55,476
And they jump two more times
and on the fourth jump, we rendezvous at...

92
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,717
a common set of coordinates.

93
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:02,802
Twenty-four jumps to plot,
we're breaking our humps...

94
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:05,959
calculating one jump every 33 minutes.

95
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:08,605
Get off my jacket.

96
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:10,962
- You eating this?
- Not anymore.

97
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:16,960
Combat landings expected again
to be the order of the day...

98
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:21,600
so double-check
your undercarriage before...

99
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:30,038
Look, you all have done this 237 times.

100
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:33,679
You know what to do.

101
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:35,960
No mistakes.

102
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:38,797
And let's make it to 238.

103
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:43,641
Good luck and be careful out there.

104
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:06,157
Can you do me a favour?
Tell Capt. Apollo he owes me one wing.

105
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:07,839
You got it, dude.

106
00:11:09,207 --> 00:11:11,926
No, Cally, there's three. I know there's three.

107
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:14,362
- Can you check it again for me, please?
- Yeah.

108
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:16,881
Let's get some of them starting to work.

109
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,605
We'll sleep when we're dead.
Come on.

110
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:21,195
Boomer.

111
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:25,319
Heard the latest?
They say Cylons look like us now.

112
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:28,877
- Primary fuel?
- Primary fuel 2893 KRG.

113
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:32,437
Marine told one of the pilots that
we marooned some guy back on Ragnar...

114
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,722
because they actually thought
that he was a Cylon.

115
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:37,367
You know what? I don't give a frak.

116
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:41,766
Red light on the number four thruster.
Go make a visual ID. See if it's blocked.

117
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,483
- Right.
- "Right."

118
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:00,441
A little rough on your new ECO,
don't you think?

119
00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:01,960
He's not my ECO.

120
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:06,563
He's some refugee from Triton
that I'm saddled with and I didn't ask you.

121
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,003
- Helo's gone, Sharon.
- I didn't ask you that, either.

122
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:20,161
Sorry.

123
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:27,119
- Colony?
- Saggitaron. How many have you got?

124
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:30,244
5,251 survivors from Saggitaron, last count.

125
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:35,922
We can't transmit photos yet.
If you want, you can leave them with us...

126
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:38,202
or you can put them on the board outside.

127
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:39,442
Sorry.

128
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,602
Thanks.
Next.

129
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:47,999
Colony?

130
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:33,520
Update on the headcount,
Madam President.

131
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:43,804
How did we lose 300?

132
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:46,797
There were some overcounts...

133
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:51,400
a few deaths from wounds
and a few missing during the last attack.

134
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:30,562
Do you want children, Gaius?

135
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:36,555
Let me think about it for a minute.

136
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:38,876
No.

137
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:44,399
Procreation is one of God's commandments.

138
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,121
Really?

139
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,438
I'm sure some day
if you're a good Cylon he'll reward you...

140
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:53,519
with a lovely little walking toaster
of your very own.

141
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:56,759
I want us to have a child, Gaius.

142
00:14:56,887 --> 00:14:58,206
You can't be serious.

143
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:01,476
- It's Dr. Amarak.
- What was that?

144
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:12,245
I'm so sorry for interrupting you
while you were speaking.

145
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,324
You were just saying?

146
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:19,479
I was just saying that a Dr. Amarak...

147
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:22,998
- has requested to speak with the President.
- Dr. Amarak. I see.

148
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:25,561
You know him?

149
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:27,877
Have you always been able to multitask
like this?

150
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,241
Yes.

151
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:33,483
I used to work with him
at the Ministry of Defence.

152
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:37,602
It says here that
he's uncovered important information...

153
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,997
regarding how the Cylons
were able to defeat colonial defences.

154
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,282
I was always a little worried he was on to us.

155
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,323
Were you going to speak to him?

156
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,967
Perhaps I should speak to him
if you're busy.

157
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:51,877
I think he wanted to speak directly
with the President.

158
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:53,525
It sounded urgent.

159
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:56,917
It must be very important.

160
00:15:57,927 --> 00:16:01,522
Maybe something about a certain traitor
in the President's inner circle?

161
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,484
There's not enough time before we jump.

162
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:06,365
I want him on board first thing
during the next cycle.

163
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:08,759
Thank you, Doctor.

164
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:14,797
- I'd say you have a serious problem.
- lf I can help.

165
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:23,482
He's a strange one, isn't he?

166
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:57,843
Landing base Team Alpha,
check three.

167
00:17:57,927 --> 00:17:59,201
Can you see it?

168
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:04,482
Twelve more cases of nervous exhaustion.
That makes 61.

169
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:08,597
Have the docs start pumping them up
with stimulants...

170
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,245
and get them back on the line.

171
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:12,283
Pilots, too.
Fuel report.

172
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:14,562
One out of every three, every other cycle.

173
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:17,366
That's gonna come back
and bite us on the ass.

174
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:20,200
We have too much work
and not enough people to do it.

175
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,686
Fuel report.

176
00:18:22,127 --> 00:18:25,085
- I've already signed one of these.
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

177
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,237
Comm traffic two from the President.

178
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:30,956
- Is this my 10 minutes or this yours?
- Yours. I took 10 last time.

179
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,038
See you guys in combat.

180
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:37,005
I believe it was your 10 minutes.

181
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:40,523
If the old man's so tired he can't remember,
then it's his turn.

182
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:49,719
- You see the note from the XO?
- Yeah, I saw it. No way.

183
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:54,166
Kara, everyone else...
I don't fly with stims.

184
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:56,920
They blunt your reflexes, your reaction time.

185
00:18:57,567 --> 00:19:01,845
- Come on, Kara, give me a break. Just...
- Why are we arguing about this?

186
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:03,155
I have no idea.

187
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:05,158
Neither do I. You're the CAG, act like one.

188
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:07,477
What the hell does that mean?

189
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:10,997
It means that you're still acting
like you're everyone's best friend.

190
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:13,521
We're not friends, you're the CAG.

191
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:15,279
"Be careful out there"?

192
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:19,326
Our job isn't to be careful,
it's to shoot Cylons out of the frakking sky.

193
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,443
"Good hunting" is what you say.

194
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,325
And now, one of your idiot pilots
is acting like a child...

195
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:27,399
and refusing to take her pills.
So she either says, "Yes, sir"...

196
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:30,206
and obeys a direct order
or you smack her in the mouth...

197
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:34,246
and you drag her sorry ass down to sickbay
and you make her take those pills.

198
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:41,801
Well, I'm glad I'm not working for you.

199
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:45,877
You're damn right you're glad.

200
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:52,157
So, do I have to smack you in the mouth,
Lieutenant?

201
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,917
No, sir. I'll take my pills.

202
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:00,195
Perfect.

203
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:05,321
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:09,600
Pilots to ready room
for pre-flight briefing. Pilots to ready room.

205
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:14,962
What?

206
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:14,718
Jump 238 complete.

207
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,399
Start the clock.

208
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:19,164
Thirty-three minutes.

209
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:21,115
Mark.

210
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,523
All civilian ships present and...

211
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:27,400
Strike my last.

212
00:21:27,727 --> 00:21:30,878
One civilian ship
missing and unaccounted for, sir.

213
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:33,322
Which one?
The Olympic Carrier.

214
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:36,558
Commercial passenger vessel.
Were they left behind?

215
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:39,525
I think I accounted
for all civilian ships before we left.

216
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:41,996
You think? Did you or didn't you?

217
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:48,925
They're not logged in, sir.
I think they may have been left behind.

218
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:51,562
How many people aboard ship?

219
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:54,957
1,345 souls, sir.

220
00:21:57,047 --> 00:22:01,245
You're telling me we left over 1,300 people
to die at the hands of the Cylons?

221
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:03,318
It may not have been her fault, sir.

222
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:07,036
It may have been a navigational error
and they jumped to the wrong coordinates...

223
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:09,277
or the Cylons destroyed the ship
before the jump...

224
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,198
Or 50 other things may have happened.

225
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:14,085
The point is we don't know
what the hell did happen.

226
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:22,085
Yes, we're tired. Yes, there's no relief.

227
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:27,124
Yes, the Cylons keep coming after us
time after time...

228
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:30,643
and yes, we are still expected to do our jobs.

229
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:42,162
We make mistakes, people die.

230
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:47,202
There aren't many of us left.

231
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:52,641
Carry on.

232
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:24,043
Okay. Next crisis?

233
00:23:27,847 --> 00:23:29,599
- List of calls?
- Yes.

234
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:34,563
But first, where's the doctor
who's supposed to be on board?

235
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,239
What's his name?

236
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:38,079
- Dr. Amarak.
- Yes.

237
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:41,525
Dr. Amarak.

238
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:47,636
Oh.

239
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:50,765
He was on the Olympic Carrier.

240
00:23:57,607 --> 00:24:00,075
God is watching out for you, Gaius.

241
00:24:04,807 --> 00:24:07,640
The universe is a vast and complex system.

242
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:12,156
Coincidental, serendipitous events...

243
00:24:12,247 --> 00:24:14,681
are bound to occur.
Indeed they are to be expected.

244
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:18,646
- It's part of the pattern, part of the plan.
- Dr. Amarak posed a threat to you.

245
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:22,364
Now he's gone.
Logic says there's a connection.

246
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:27,085
A connection, maybe. But not God.

247
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:32,316
There is no God or gods, singular or plural.

248
00:24:32,407 --> 00:24:35,319
There are no large invisible men,
or women for that matter...

249
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:39,241
in the sky taking a personal interest
in the fortunes of Gaius Baltar.

250
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:41,126
Be careful.

251
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:44,405
That which God gives, he can also take away.

252
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:53,166
Fifteen seconds.

253
00:25:00,007 --> 00:25:01,599
Maybe this time.

254
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:14,201
Dradis?

255
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,839
No enemy contacts.

256
00:25:18,527 --> 00:25:20,438
Keep the clock running.

257
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:24,599
What do you think?

258
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,319
I think we wait.

259
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:03,084
Get me the President.

260
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:11,246
Why this time?

261
00:26:13,047 --> 00:26:14,799
Was it something that you did?

262
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:17,879
We had a new plan,
but we didn't have time to implement it yet.

263
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:21,118
We lost a ship during the last cycle,
the Olympic Carrier.

264
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:24,119
Does that have something to do with it?

265
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,799
Possibly.

266
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:34,365
Are you there?

267
00:26:35,047 --> 00:26:36,685
Yeah, I'm here.

268
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:42,201
What do we do now, Commander?
I've got people on the verge over here.

269
00:26:43,207 --> 00:26:47,120
We're gonna go to Condition Two.
We have to take advantage of this time...

270
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:49,641
- and let our people get some rest.
- All right.

271
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:54,077
And how long do we stay at Condition Two?

272
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,315
Until I'm satisfied they're not going to return.

273
00:26:57,647 --> 00:26:59,797
It's a military decision.

274
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:02,325
It is. I know that.

275
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:06,082
You're right and I defer to your decision.
And, Commander...

276
00:27:07,647 --> 00:27:09,683
let your men and women...

277
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:15,404
know how grateful I am
for the job that they are doing, please.

278
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:19,245
Thank them for me.

279
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:22,478
Thank you, Madam President.

280
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:23,886
Thank you.

281
00:27:28,527 --> 00:27:30,961
Contact Apollo.

282
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:33,959
Tell him to set up a combat patrol
around the fleet...

283
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:36,925
and order his other pilots
to land immediately.

284
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,403
All right, people, you heard the order.

285
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:43,560
Boomer, Starbuck, form up with me.
We'll fly the first CAP.

286
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:47,761
I want everyone else
back on Galactica and in their racks.

287
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:50,645
Three-hour rotation.
Hey, Apollo...

288
00:27:50,727 --> 00:27:53,764
not that I'm not honoured by being chosen
to sit in my cockpit...

289
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:55,326
for the next three hours but...

290
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,965
But why you?

291
00:27:57,807 --> 00:28:00,799
- Take a guess.
- Because I'm on drugs?

292
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:04,843
You got it.
This patrol is 100% stimulated.

293
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:06,765
Anyone else feels like...

294
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:09,839
they've got frakking ants crawling
behind their eyeballs?

295
00:28:09,927 --> 00:28:11,918
How about you, Boomer?

296
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:15,158
Doc tells me you're holding up
better than anybody in the squadron.

297
00:28:15,247 --> 00:28:16,885
I'm tired like everybody else.

298
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,606
You never seem it.
Because she's a Cylon.

299
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:22,360
You're gonna make me come over there
and kick your ass.

300
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:25,120
Okay. Let's set up a patrol here...

301
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:27,243
before somebody gets hurt.

302
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:30,761
Follow me.
Copy that, Apollo.

303
00:28:37,687 --> 00:28:41,043
A couple hours rack time
does sound awfully sweet...

304
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:43,595
right about now.
You deserve it.

305
00:28:45,287 --> 00:28:47,926
Thank you. The truth is...

306
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:53,320
all this has me feeling
more alive than I have in years.

307
00:28:55,407 --> 00:28:56,999
You look that way, too.

308
00:28:57,087 --> 00:28:59,521
It's good to you
without the cup in your hand.

309
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:00,756
Don't start.

310
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:03,839
I know there's a whole lot of people
aboard this ship...

311
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:06,521
that wish you weren't feeling
as good as you were.

312
00:29:06,607 --> 00:29:09,724
If the crew doesn't hate the XO,
then he's not doing his job.

313
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:12,685
Besides, got to make the old man look good.

314
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:15,045
I always look good.

315
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:18,046
- Did you look in a mirror?
- Seriously...

316
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:19,446
Sir.

317
00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:22,121
...it's one thing to push a crew,
it's another to break them.

318
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:27,081
Dradis contact.
Bearing 348, carom 120, one ship.

319
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:29,118
Getting recognition signal.

320
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:31,880
Initiating response flash mode.
Alpha, alpha.

321
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:33,525
It's the Olympic Carrier, sir.

322
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:36,440
Is that confirmed?
It's confirmed, sir.

323
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,159
Thank the gods.

324
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:49,525
Action stations.

325
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:54,756
Put the fleet into Condition One.

326
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:58,203
I want all Vipers manned and ready,
but keep them in the tubes.

327
00:29:58,287 --> 00:30:00,039
Mr. Gaeta.
Sir?

328
00:30:00,127 --> 00:30:02,436
Restart the clock. Thirty-three minutes.

329
00:30:05,007 --> 00:30:07,202
- Hope you're wrong.
- So do I.

330
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:09,437
Clock is running.
So do I.

331
00:30:14,287 --> 00:30:16,801
No. It's all wrong.

332
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:21,357
If they were left behind,
why didn't the Cylons destroy them?

333
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:23,756
And why are they showing up now?

334
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:26,839
It's God's punishment for your lack of faith.

335
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:29,677
That's just great, that is.

336
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:33,284
A more logical and useful explanation,
please.

337
00:30:33,887 --> 00:30:35,320
All right.

338
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:40,686
The Olympic Carrier has been infiltrated
by Cylon agents.

339
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:47,043
They've been tracking the ship all along.

340
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:49,916
No.

341
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:53,845
Then that means...

342
00:30:54,207 --> 00:30:57,040
Logically, in order for you to survive...

343
00:30:57,447 --> 00:30:59,836
the Olympic Carrier should be destroyed.

344
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,284
Olympic Carrier...

345
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:09,042
this is Raptor 478, call sign Boomer.
I have you in visual contact.

346
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:11,163
Please respond to this channel. Over.

347
00:31:11,247 --> 00:31:14,956
Raptor 478, this is the Olympic Carrier.
We have you in visual contact.

348
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:18,562
Thank the Lords of Kobol. You don't know
how relieved we are to see you.

349
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:22,196
Roger that, Olympic Carrier.
Can I ask about your whereabouts?

350
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:26,075
We had trouble with our FTL drive.
Took us almost three hours to fix.

351
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:29,125
Have Boomer ask them
how they escaped the Cylons.

352
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,519
Olympic Carrier, Boomer.

353
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:34,485
I've been directed to ask how you escaped
from the Cylons.

354
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:37,479
They were closing in on us
when the rest of you were jumping.

355
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:39,797
I thought we were goners,
then they just broke off.

356
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:41,843
Someone must've been watching out for us.

357
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:43,997
Roger that.
One other thing, Boomer.

358
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:45,566
I've got a Dr. Amarak on board...

359
00:31:45,647 --> 00:31:48,207
who has an urgent matter to discuss
with the President.

360
00:31:48,287 --> 00:31:51,563
- He's been driving me crazy.
- Can you be more specific?

361
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:54,878
I can't. He says he knows
something about a traitor in our midst...

362
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:56,639
and he's unwilling to share more than that.

363
00:31:57,807 --> 00:31:59,843
Madam President, I strongly recommend...

364
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:03,317
that we cut off all wireless communication
with that ship right away.

365
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:04,876
Why?

366
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,606
Look, forgive me for being rude,
but wake up, all right?

367
00:32:07,687 --> 00:32:11,157
The Olympic Carrier is still flying
because the Cylons let them survive.

368
00:32:11,247 --> 00:32:13,317
They've been tracking that ship all along.

369
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:16,956
- There's probably a Cylon agent aboard now!
- Calm down.

370
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,040
Start over.

371
00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:23,123
Please, Madam President, I implore you.
Listen to me.

372
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:25,557
Cut off radio communication with that ship...

373
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:28,684
before they send via broadcast signal
another computer virus...

374
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:31,645
to affect our ship
shortly before they blow us all up.

375
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:35,921
Commander Adama, are you on the line?

376
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:39,479
Cut off the speakers.
Put her through on the line.

377
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:44,279
Yes, Madam President.
And I'm inclined to agree with Dr. Baltar.

378
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,605
Good. So do I.

379
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:49,925
Thank the gods you're with us.

380
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:52,441
God's got nothing to do with this.

381
00:32:56,487 --> 00:32:58,239
Boomer, Galactica.

382
00:32:58,327 --> 00:33:01,763
Your orders are to jam all transmissions
from the Olympic Carrier.

383
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,315
No further voice contact is authorised.

384
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:06,759
Roger that, Galactica.

385
00:33:06,847 --> 00:33:08,803
Boomer, Galactica.

386
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:12,926
Orders are to send the Olympic Carrier
the following message by signal light.

387
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:16,158
Message begins: Maintain present position.

388
00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:19,796
Do not, repeat, do not approach
the fleet until further notice.

389
00:33:19,887 --> 00:33:21,320
Message ends.

390
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:25,880
I'm getting a bad feeling
about where this is headed.

391
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:27,361
So am I.

392
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:30,678
If the ship poses a threat to us,
we have to eliminate that threat.

393
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:40,037
I don't think they got the message, Apollo.

394
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:44,484
Yeah, I see it. Boomer,
break wireless silence on my authority.

395
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:47,445
Warn them to stop their engines immediately.

396
00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:51,675
I suggest that we evacuate the passengers,
then destroy the ship.

397
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:54,076
Solves the problem
if they're tracking the ship.

398
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:56,442
What if they're tracking
one of the passengers?

399
00:33:56,527 --> 00:33:58,324
Olympic Carrier...

400
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:02,002
you are ordered to stop your engines
immediately. Acknowledge.

401
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:07,521
Apollo, they're not responding.
Are you using the same channel?

402
00:34:07,607 --> 00:34:10,167
Yeah,
but suddenly nobody's home.

403
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:13,442
Starbuck, fire a burst across their bow.

404
00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:16,881
Copy that.

405
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:28,122
Boomer, let Galactica know we have
a problem out here.

406
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:30,996
Commander, message from Boomer.

407
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:33,442
The Olympic Carrier is heading
directly for us, sir.

408
00:34:33,527 --> 00:34:35,518
They're refusing all orders to stop.

409
00:34:49,007 --> 00:34:51,237
Galactica,
they're still not responding...

410
00:34:51,327 --> 00:34:54,319
and continue to head towards the fleet.
Request instructions.

411
00:34:54,407 --> 00:34:58,798
Order the fleet to execute Jump 240.
Get us between that ship and the fleet.

412
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:03,085
Commander! Dradis contact.
Strike that, multiple Dradis contacts.

413
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,246
It's the Cylons.

414
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:14,243
The Cylons
are on an intercept course.

415
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:17,558
They'll be in weapons range
within two minutes.

416
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:21,279
Radiological alarm!

417
00:35:21,807 --> 00:35:24,241
- Radiological alarm!
- From where?

418
00:35:26,087 --> 00:35:28,760
The Olympic Carrier, sir.
They've got nukes on board.

419
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:33,523
Madam President, we have to eliminate
the Olympic Carrier immediately.

420
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:36,520
There are 1,300 people on that ship.

421
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:40,602
We don't know that.
The Cylons may have captured them already.

422
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:43,679
She's not going to do it. She has to do it.

423
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:47,081
- It's not her decision, Gaius.
- No?

424
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:51,357
It's God's choice.
He wants you to repent.

425
00:35:51,447 --> 00:35:55,326
Look, at this point there's no choice.
It's either them or us.

426
00:35:55,527 --> 00:35:57,324
Repent of your sins...

427
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:00,365
and accept his true love
and you will be saved.

428
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:08,762
I repent. Then I'll repent.

429
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:15,325
I repent.

430
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:19,196
Do it.

431
00:36:21,487 --> 00:36:23,637
We have new orders.

432
00:36:23,727 --> 00:36:27,606
We're directed to destroy
the Olympic Carrier...

433
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:29,643
and return to Galactica.

434
00:36:30,727 --> 00:36:32,604
It's a civilian ship.

435
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:36,805
Yeah, a civilian ship with nukes.

436
00:36:44,887 --> 00:36:47,845
I don't see anybody in there,
do you?

437
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:57,643
The Cylons will be here any second.
If we're going to do this, then just do it.

438
00:36:57,727 --> 00:36:59,558
Starbuck, form up with me.

439
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:01,922
We'll make one pass from astern.

440
00:37:03,527 --> 00:37:06,041
Lee, what if you're wrong?

441
00:37:11,847 --> 00:37:13,565
Lee, come on.

442
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:19,723
Okay, fire on my mark.

443
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,358
No frakking way, Lee.

444
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,196
Lee? Come on!

445
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:34,686
Mark.

446
00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:25,359
Are you alive?

447
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:30,644
Agathon, Karl C.

448
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:32,479
Lieutenant, junior grade, Colonial fleet.

449
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:37,277
- PK-789-9348.
- I know who you are, Helo.

450
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:39,597
It's all right. I'm a friend.

451
00:38:58,967 --> 00:39:00,161
Sharon?

452
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:08,477
What are you doing here?
Can you walk?

453
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:12,803
Yeah, I think so.

454
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:17,564
- What are you doing here, I thought...
- Let's move, mister.

455
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:45,560
Sir.
Son.

456
00:39:58,927 --> 00:40:02,044
I gave the order. It's my responsibility.

457
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,364
I pulled the trigger.

458
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:12,086
That's mine.

459
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,443
Madam President?

460
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:27,798
Madam President?

461
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:33,555
I'm sorry, you were saying something?

462
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,922
Twenty-four hours, no Cylons.

463
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:44,520
- At least you know it was the right choice.
- The right choice.

464
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:53,724
I'm sorry, Billy.
I think I'd like some time alone, please.

465
00:40:53,807 --> 00:40:55,445
Of course.

466
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:08,760
What is it?

467
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:13,836
- Update on the headcount?
- Subtract how many?

468
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:16,603
Actually, you can add one.

469
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:22,198
A baby was born this morning
on the Rising Star.

470
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:24,641
A boy.

471
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:27,921
- A baby.
- Yeah.

472
00:41:35,047 --> 00:41:36,366
Thank you.
