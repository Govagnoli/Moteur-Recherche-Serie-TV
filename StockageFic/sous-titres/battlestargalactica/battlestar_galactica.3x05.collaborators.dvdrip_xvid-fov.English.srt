00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,672
You're gonna hold me in your arms
and tell me you love me.

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,320
You're insane.

4
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,318
You kill me,

00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,198
l download,
l come back, we start over.

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,192
l don't belong here!
Let me out!

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,319
Some of the guys who joined the Cylon
police, bet they're in over their heads.

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,518
One day, when this is all over,
guys like that are gonna get strung up.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,513
Guys like you and me,
we're gonna be there tying the knots,

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,272
making 'em tight.

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,590
Where are you getting this stuff?

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,629
l've no idea. The source won't tell me
their name. It's probably safer for all of us.

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,517
- Mr President?
- Morning, Gaeta.

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,910
This is a death warrant.
Have you seen the names on this list?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,911
Got any idea
what they're about to do?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,560
l got this from the source
in the administration.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,677
It's a death list,
and Cally's name is on it.

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,075
Run. Don't look back. Go!

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,909
We were ambushed. The Cylons
knew exactly where we were gonna be.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,753
- l didn't do anything!
- This is the map l drew for you!

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,230
<i>You were gonna burn it,</i>
<i>but then your wife offered to do it for you.</i>

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,914
<i>You know what has to be done here.</i>

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,673

Come on! Move!
Move, move!

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,591
Evacuate the facility. You should go
as well, Gaius. There's a place for you too.

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,031
<i>(Connor)</i> Walk.

<i>(sobs)</i>

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,751
Evidence for the following charges
have been presented to the Circle -

31
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,752
that you carried arms
for the enemy,

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,798
that you carried out raids
against the human population

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,793
and that, during one raid, 23 people
were killed by you and your men

34
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,871
during the assault on the temple.

35
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,155
It's not true!

36
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,072
Names of the people killed by you and
those under you. Look at those names!

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,957
Connor.

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,236
The Circle examined the evidence
and found you guilty of treason

39
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,356
and crimes against humanity.

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,115
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is passed?

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,079
- l was trying to help people.
- You didn't do a very good job, did you?

42
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,837
- All right, let's just get this over with.
- l helped people. l helped lots of people.

43
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,275
Chief. Chief.

44
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,555
Chief, l helped Cally.
l saved Cally.

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,799
- l saved Cally.
- What do you mean, you helped Cally?

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,075
l let her go
when they were gonna shoot her.

47
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,516
l took her out of line, l said,
"Go. Run like hell." And she did.

48
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,709
She ran and she got away. Because of me,
Chief. l helped Cally. l saved Cally.

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,678
Cally did get away, somehow.

50
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,718
They killed 23 people
during the temple raids.

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,997
12 men, eight women
and three children.

52
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,593
Children!

53
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,274
My son is on this list.

54
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,558
His name is right there. And that
frakking son of a bitch put him there.

55
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,030
So saving Cally,
if that happened,

56
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,078
does that make up for
killing my son?

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,875
Answer the question, Chief.

58
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,274
Does saving Cally
let him off the hook for killing 23 others?

59
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,910
Did you do this, Jammer?

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,639
Did you kill these people?

61
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,550
<i>(whispers)</i> Answer me.

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,790
<i>(whispers)</i> It was crazy down there, Chief.

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,474
You know that.

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,319
You make these decisions so fast.

65
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,836
You're making an arrest
and people come out with their hands up,

66
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,118
but sometimes it's a trick. They say
they're surrendering and then open fire.

67
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,430
We thought they were insurgents.

68
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,910
It wasn't until after,
when we saw the bodies...

69
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,793
What was l supposed to do?

70
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,155
No, it doesn't.

71
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,273
Under the Articles,

72
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,430
the punishment for treason is death.

73
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,600
Sentence confirmed and carried out

74
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,831
on this, the third day
of the Second Exodus.

75
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,196

84
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,354

Shh. Good boy.

Hey, sweetie.

- No, no, you're fine.

90
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,038
Here, give him to me.
Come here, come here.

91
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,432
Come to Daddy. Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy. There you go.

92
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,274
l know. Mommy's
much more comfortable than me, huh?

93
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,434
- Cally?
- Mm-hm?

94
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,318
When you were down on the planet

95
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,472
and you ran away from the trucks,

96
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,349
did anybody help you?

97
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,000
One of the NCP goons, or anybody?

98
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,356
<i>(sleepily)</i> What? No.

99
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,389
Wait, yeah.

100
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,596
Somebody told me to run.

101
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,034
It probably was
one of those goons.

102
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,038
But l haven't thought about it since.

103
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,109
Hey, how did you know about that?

104
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,359
l mean, why do you ask?

105
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,632
No reason.
Go back to sleep.

106
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,672
OK.

107
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,552
In my opinion,
it wasn't his fault.

108
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,031
l hate to admit it, but the admiral's right.
He was in an impossible situation.

109
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,476
l'd have probably done the same
in his position.

110
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,471
Well,

111
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,190
if that's the way it has to be,
then that's the way it has to be.

112
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,794
No hard feelings?

113
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,871
None.

114
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,754
Mistakes were made -

115
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,229
of that, there's no question.

116
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,794
But the past...

117
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,997

He actively sought your deaths.

<i>(woman)</i> Excuse me, guys.

140
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,753
Uh... three days.

141
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,628
l will personally place your name

Once they confirm you, l submit
my resignation and you get sworn in.

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,792
The whole thing
should take less than an hour.

144
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,316
Stepping down without a fight?
That means you want something.

145
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,838
Why not put your cards on the table and
let's see if it's a price l'm willing to pay.

146
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,749
Well, l'm a realist.

147
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,550
l never had any illusions
about remaining in office for very long.

148
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,632
And the admiral's made it clear
he'd like nothing better

149
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,871
than to put me in a cell
if l try to hang onto power.

150
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,272
He's trying to do you a favour. You and l
both know how impossible it would be

151
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,193
to govern this fleet
without the military's backing.

152
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,352
l agree.
That's why we're here.

153
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,750
Even so, l want to be included
in the new government.

154
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,116
l don't want to be on the outside
looking in any more.

155
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,557
OK.

156
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,796
OK.

157
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,838
You stood up to Baltar
on New Caprica.

158
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,916
You nearly lost your life for your trouble.
This fleet needs that kind of courage.

159
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,397
The vice-presidency is yours.

160
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,630
If you want it, Tom.

161
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,591
Well, thank you.

00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,830
You're welcome.

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,671
You gotta be kidding.

164
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,673
Who gave this man permission
to enter the CIC?

165
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,398
Admiral's orders, sir.

166
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,632
Communications took some hits and
Mr Gaeta has offered to help with repairs.

167
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,872
Well, isn't that nice?
A man can turn his coat,

168
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,839
collaborate with the enemy,
contribute to the deaths of thousands,

169
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,152
but the old man needs his phones fixed
and suddenly all is forgiven.

170
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,435
If Cylons find us,
we'll need everyone.

171
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,799
Cylons found us, Mr Agathon. Your friend
Gaeta was on the welcoming committee.

172
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,314
Hey! Look at me!

173
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,595
Since you're here, maybe you can
help me out. l'm missing something.

174
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,511
l lost it in detention.

175
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,355
Since you're so buddy-buddy with
the Cylons, maybe you know where it is.

176
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,113
How about it?

177
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,351
- Do you know where my eye is?
- <i>(Adama)</i> Saul!

178
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,436
Admiral.

179
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,709
Back to work.

180
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,750
- Walk with me.
- Yeah.

181
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,594
We have a lot of work in the next couple
of weeks. Get some sleep, get ready.

182
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,355
l'm ready now. l may be rough
around the edges, but l can hold my own.

183
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,070
And you can tell that toaster-Iover over
there that l am still the XO of this ship.

184
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,197
- Let's go.
- Get your hands off me.

185
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,869
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- It's you who should be embarrassed.

186
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,511
Letting one of Baltar's henchmen
walk around like nothing's happened.

187
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,229
Go sleep this off.
That's an order.

188
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,029
Oh, yeah.
Just go to sleep.

189
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,874
Forget about it all.
Just forget about everything.

190
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,475
Well, l'm not forgetting.
l'm not gonna forget.

191
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,312
Charges are carrying arms
for the enemy in a time of war,

192
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,870
shooting three civilians
and collaboration with the enemy.

193
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,713
- l call the vote.
- Guilty.

194
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,119
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

195
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,589
Guilty.

196
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,274
Yeah. Guilty.

197
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,952
Guilty.

198
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,793
The vote being unanimous,
the sentence is death.

199
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,476
Chadwick's aboard the <i>Monarch.</i> l'll
contact our man there. He'll take care of it.

200
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,471
Anybody got a cigarette?

201
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,677
- How many more of these have we got?
- 57.

202
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,149
Three days.
That's all the time we've got.

203
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,836
Then stop wasting it. We all knew
there was a clock when we signed on.

204
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,956
These fraks are so guilty
they stink.

205
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,157
l could get through 50 of these things
in an hour.

206
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,676
You think we're a bunch of thugs
handing out punishment on a whim?

207
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,719
Jammer wasn't airlocked cos you <i>thought</i>
he was guilty. There was evidence.

208
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,998
You read the witness reports.
He was tried and convicted by this Circle.

209
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,356
This is about justice.
You got that? Justice!

210
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,670
Yeah. OK, OK.

211
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,999
<i>(Tigh)</i> Hey.

212
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,631
Now, don't get me wrong here.
l like you, Connor. You're a good guy.

213
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,711
Next case.

214
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,034
<i>(Seelix)</i> Felix Gaeta.

215
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,114
Charges are collaborating with the enemy
and crimes against humanity.

216
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,837
l don't want to do this.
Do you think l like it?

217
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,198
l stood beside Gaeta in the CIC
for almost four years. He was like family.

218
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,035
But he was chief of staff to Gaius Baltar,
and that alone is enough to convict him.

219
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,476
l'm saying on this particular guy,
we do not have hard evidence.

220
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,633
We got no witnesses, nothing. All we do
know is he worked for Baltar. That's it.

221
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,190
Yeah, l gotta go with Sam on this one.
We need something specific.

222
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,637
You want specific?
You think Baltar ran things? That guy?

223
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,236
He was the public face, but Gaeta,
he was the brains. Everyone knew that.

224
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,757
He ran the operation. He did the
paperwork. He approved the death lists.

225
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,358
How do you know? Were you there? Did
you see him approve a single death list?

226
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,432
He knew Cally was on a death list.

227
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,358
- What are you talking about?
- Look there.

228
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,352
That's a distribution list,
and there's Cally's name.

229
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,228
And there's Gaeta's name.
He saw her execution order.

230
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,474
It's still all circumstantial. We don't know
what Gaeta did when he saw that list.

231
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,551
l gotta go with them on this one. No!

232
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,792
You see a death list, you know innocent
people are gonna die and you do nothing?

233
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,474
He's guilty.

234
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,668
l call the question.

235
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,356
The question of the innocence or guilt
of Felix Gaeta has been called.

236
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,590
The Circle will vote.

237
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,750
- l vote guilty.
- <i>(Connor)</i> Guilty.

238
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,910
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

239
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,870
- Sam?
- No, don't bother. l'm done.

240
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,632
- We're still voting.
- l'm not.

241
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,113
l'm done. l'm done with this whole thing.
The war's over for me. l'm sorry.

242
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,669
OK. That's fine.

243
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,309
- Still 4-0, Chief. What's your vote?
- No, wait. We need six votes.

244
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,675
- Screw that.
- No, screw you!

245
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,436
We're a jury. We need six votes.
If we don't have six votes, l'm out too.

246
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,717
He's right.
We need a sixth.

247
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,389
How are you, Gaius?

248
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,953
l'm alive.

249
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,508
l suppose that's something.

250
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,991
Thank you.

251
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,233
You'll have to excuse me.
l'm slightly confused.

252
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,556
How long have l been here, exactly?

253
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,631
Three days.

254
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,469
Three days?

255
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,239
So it's taken you three days
to remember where l was?

256
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,118
No one's forgotten you, Gaius.

257
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,591
It's just there's been controversy about
whether you should've been let on board.

258
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,070
l can't believe
there's still a question of my value.

259
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,549
There'll always be a question.

260
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,029
You are a human.

261
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,431
Now, look...

262
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,316
l helped you.

263
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,789
l gave you Sharon's child.

264
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,950
Yes, that's right, you did.

265
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,515
And the child's rescue
did weigh in your favour.

266
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,670
However, the vote's deadlocked -

267
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,989
three in favour of your being
allowed to stay and three against,

268
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,355
with one model still undecided.

269
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,591
The fact is,
the decision rests with the Sixes.

270
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,549
We're starting to see a rash
of missing persons reports.

271
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,631
We left thousands on that planet.

272
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,076
No, this is different.
These are people known to have survived,

273
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,596
but who have gone missing
since the exodus. Jammer, for instance.

274
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,958
- Deck hand. l saw him yesterday.
- He didn't report at muster this morning.

275
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,749
Bed check negative, sickbay negative.
It's like he just vanished.

276
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,719
- How many people are missing?
- 13, as of today.

277
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,519
Two on <i>Galactica,</i>
11 elsewhere.

278
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,072
Every one of them confirmed as a survivor
by multiple witnesses, then poof! Gone.

279
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,915
Keep me posted on any more
missing persons. l wanna know about it.

280
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,356
Yes, sir.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

281
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,632
l have a date with a jump rope.

282
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,640
Hey, l've dropped half a stone.

283
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,915
Keep jumping.

284
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,794
Hey.

285
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,632
<i>(clears throat)</i>

286
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,790
How you doing?

287
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,398
Well, you know, l'm... making do.
How are you?

288
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,470
l'm good.
Why do you ask?

289
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,030
Well, uh... l heard about your situation.
You were...

290
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,315
Right.

291
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,393
l just try not to think about it any more,
you know?

292
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,398
l'm kinda like you.

293
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:20,318
Sitting in your cushy little office on
Colonial One, doing all Baltar's dirty work.

294
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,712
Probably never even thought about
what was happening to me, right?

295
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,916
l didn't know about your situation.

296
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,231
- If l had, l would've tried to get you out.
- Mm.

297
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,393
Like l've said about 50 times now, l was
serving the president of the Colonies.

298
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,916
- We all elected him, remember?
- So that's supposed to excuse it?

299
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,912
What do you want me to say?

300
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,039
Maybe l could've done more, but
l thought that, when the Cylons landed,

301
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,635
it was important for me to keep my job
to help from the inside.

302
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,518
Propping Baltar up
and letting them walk all over us?

303
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,993
No, l fed information to the Resistance. l
set up dead drops - there was a dog bowl.

304
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,471
l passed along Cylon positions,
internal memoranda...

305
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,869
Great, Felix.

306
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,718
You're a frakking hero.

307
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,234
Whatever feelings
l had for you have to stop.

308
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,078
l allowed my feelings
to cloud my judgment.

309
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,310
l protected you.

310
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,037
l gave your species
a second chance.

311
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,908
l even turned against a sister Cylon.
And for what?

312
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,230
l'm Cylon, Gaius.

313
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,038
Somehow l lost sight of that.

314
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,556
You are much, much more
than a machine.

315
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,835
You're a person.

316
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,280
A real person.

317
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,476
A woman.

318
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,312
And you're in love with me.

319
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,516
And it hurts.

320
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,031
l know it hurts.

321
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,553
But, believe me,
l am the only one that can make it better.

322
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,315
Don't you see?
l am the only one.

323
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,748
<i>(whispers)</i> No, this has to end.

324
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,430
You need me!
You need me, admit it!

325
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,239
Admit it!
You need me!

326
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,280
And l need you too!

327
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,716
Did you hear me?
l-I need you too.

328
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,192
Maybe l should've started with that.

329
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,075
This is a jury.
l wanna make that clear.

330
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,073
It's not about settling scores
or personal grudges. It's a jury.

331
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,594
We're just dealing
with the worst of the worst -

332
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,434
people who did more than put on an NCP
uniform or make a deal with Cylons.

333
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,717
They're the killers,
the real traitors.

334
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,549
Yeah, but none of this is legal, right?

335
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,835
No, no. It's legal.

336
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,519
You gotta be kidding me.

337
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,639
That's why we need to know right now,
are you in or out?

338
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,990
<i>(clears throat)</i>

339
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,877
- In.
- Good.

340
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,909
We've already been through the evidence,
so just take your time.

341
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,749
You're telling me that Gaeta saw this list
and didn't do a damn thing?

342
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,356
We have no idea of knowing what Gaeta
did or did not do when he saw the list.

343
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,436
The whole thing's like a bad dream, only
we woke up and the traitors are still here.

344
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,675
Guilty.

345
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,469
That's 5-0 in favour of guilty.
It's gotta be unanimous.

346
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,073
Chief?

347
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,151
You're the last to vote.

348
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,912
<i>(door opens)</i>

349
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,677
- Get out of here, Sam.
- l'd like to talk to my wife.

350
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,876
l'd like to do it now.

351
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,270
We already have your vote.
Take a break.

352
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,479
Hey. l quit because l'm not looking
for ways to keep killing people.

353
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,835
- Well, l need this, Sam.
- So, what?

354
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,276
Throwing people out of an airlock
is gonna make you feel better?

355
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,874
Those aren't the people
that kept you locked up.

356
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,555
They'll do. Not just for me,
for every person we left on that planet

357
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,236
because someone has gotta pay. So you
can either get with it or you can get lost.

358
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,199
Is that what you want, Kara?
You want me to leave?

359
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:23,673
He doesn't wanna say "guilty" because
Gaeta is such a good guy. Right, Chief?

360
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,914
Everyone likes Gaeta so let's let him
off the hook, let's just look the other way.

361
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,073
Well, a lot of good people
had to pay the price for what they did,

362
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,833
choices they made on New Caprica.

363
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,559
Like my wife.

364
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,477
That's right.
Ellen collaborated,

365
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,394
gave the Cylons information
on the Resistance, and she died for it.

366
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,598
Because that's the price
of collaborating with the enemy.

367
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,312
And l liked her a lot more
than l like Gaeta.

368
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,791
Look, Sam,

369
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,588
l'm in a different place now.

370
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,155
I...

371
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,472
l don't know how else
to explain it to you.

372
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:15,590
l got out of that cell and it's like someone
painted the world in different colours.

373
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,154
And l look at you...

374
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,710
and l wanna tear your eyes out
just for looking at me.

375
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,831
l just wanna hurt someone,
and it might as well be you.

376
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,119
So you should probably go
before that happens.

377
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,517
Baltar signed death warrants,
organised murder squads,

378
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,114
collaborated with the enemy
from day one.

379
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,397
- Baltar, not Gaeta.
- It's the same godsdamn thing.

380
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,554
<i>(Seelix)</i> He's right. A lot of people died
because of them, Chief.

381
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,470
Fine. Guilty.

382
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,915
<i>(Anders)</i> Remember this?

383
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,195
l don't want this any more.

384
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,993
Sam.

385
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,474
<i>(opens door)</i>

386
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,551
<i>(shuts door)</i>

387
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,429
<i>(Seelix)</i> Take him.

388
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,429
Turn around.
On your knees. On your knees!

389
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,031
Felix Gaeta,

390
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,236
you've been tried and found guilty
of crimes against humanity

391
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:47,190
by a circle of your peers, as authorised
by the president of the Colonies.

392
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,950
If you have any words to offer
in your own defence, now is the time.

393
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,549
Come on, Felix, talk.
We'll listen.

394
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,517
Yeah, that's right.

395
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,353
We'll listen to how
hiding behind Baltar's skirt

396
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,749
was your way
of helping the insurgency.

397
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,195
Say something.

398
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,473
What's the point?

399
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,438
l already tried to explain it.

400
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,598
l'm not gonna beg.

401
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,673
Too bad you didn't grow that spine
four months ago.

402
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,320
Beg.

403
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,918
Beg.

404
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,794
- Beg!
- <i>(Tigh)</i> Thrace.

405
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,030
No! Beg.

406
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,750
Come on. Tell 'em how you were actually
working for the Resistance the entire time.

407
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,753
Come on! Tell 'em all about the important
information you were giving up.

408
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,798
Tell 'em about all the messages
and the dog bowl and...

409
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,156
What? What did she say?
What did she just say?

410
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,959
Get the frak out my way.
What did she just say?

411
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,793
Tell me.
What did you say to her?

412
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,793
There was a yellow dog bowl.
It was a signal.

413
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,190
<i>It meant there was a message</i>
<i>in the garbage dump.</i>

414
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,512
l turned it over. It was a signal. It meant
there was a message at the dump.

415
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,319
<i>(Chief, groaning)</i> That was you!

416
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,229
Oh, my God...

417
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,039
- <i>(Tigh)</i> What are you doing?
- Chief.

418
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,628
There was a yellow dog bowl.

419
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,393
l used it.

420
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,511
We were wondering
who the source was, Colonel.

421
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,834
There's no other way
he could've known.

422
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,559
He's the only other one
that would know about it.

423
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,111
He's why we know about the death lists,
why l saved Cally, why we're on this ship.

424
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,954
He's the one who gave us
the inside information.

425
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,594
There's our source, Colonel.

426
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,800
l did what l could.

427
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,156
l don't know
what else l could've done.

428
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,278
- What the hell is this?
- It's all perfectly legal.

429
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,433
You'll find an executive order authorising
a secret jury of six men and women

430
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,399
to try, sentence and execute
people guilty of extraordinary crimes

431
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,755
or collaborating with the enemy in war.

432
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,513
l signed a death warrant
for every conviction.

433
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,832
Your presidency is a farce.
It stops right now.

434
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,469
If they're guilty,
they'll be tried by a jury of their peers.

435
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,189
They have a jury,
but they don't get lawyers.

436
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,555
They don't get to showboat
for weeks on end.

437
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,713
They don't get to blame the system,
and they don't get lasting fame

438
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,271
as martyrs or innocent people
just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

439
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,635
They just disappear. Now.

440
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,191
In the grey twilight between the night of
the occupation and the dawn of a new era.

441
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,159
You come into office clean,
without their blood on your hands.

442
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,959
Well, thank you.
That's, uh... that's very poetic.

443
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,918
However, you have a problem,
Mr President.

444
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,438
Everyone, by law, is entitled to a trial
with representation. Everyone.

445
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,638
It is not an option to be discarded
at the president's whim.

446
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,713
You think by making the trials public
that you'll find justice?

447
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,995
- Yes, l do.
- Come on, Laura.

448
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,154
You're not that naive. Let me tell you
what will happen if these cases go to trial.

449
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,869
It'll consume this fleet for months,
maybe years.

450
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,475
People will be lining up
to testify against their neighbours.

451
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,199
It'll be a circus,
an entertainment for the mob,

452
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,590
and you'll be signing death warrants
almost every day.

453
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,150
Is that how you want to spend
your next term, Laura?

454
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,913
As executioner-in-chief?

455
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,155
<i>(man)... with every fibre of my being.</i>

456
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,550
With every fibre of my being.

457
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,428
- Congratulations, Madam President.
- Thank you.

458
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,312
Thank you all for once again entrusting
me with this high office of civil service.

459
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,756
Today is a new beginning
for all of us.

460
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,877
We share a unique destiny,

461
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,195
but our future is ours to shape
and our past cannot be forgotten.

462
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,511
<i>A new day requires new thinking,</i>

463
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,990
<i>and while l had intended</i>
<i>on using this occasion</i>

464
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,312
<i>as an opportunity to announce the</i>
<i>formation of a special prosecutor's office</i>

465
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,359
<i>charged with investigating acts</i>
<i>of collaboration with the enemy,</i>

466
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,991
<i>l have decided instead</i>
<i>that a different gesture is called for</i>

467
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,551
<i>on this, the first day</i>
<i>of my next term as your president.</i>

468
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,393
We all feel the need for justice,

469
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,790
and we all feel the need
for vengeance.

470
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,429
Telling the difference between the two
can be difficult at times.

471
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:44,868
<i>We are all victims of the Cylons and none</i>
<i>of us can be impartial. l certainly can't.</i>

472
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,317
<i>So today l am forming a commission</i>
<i>on truth and reconciliation</i>

473
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,712
<i>to hear our stories</i>
<i>and record them for posterity.</i>

474
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,553
There will be no prosecutions.

475
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,878
l am issuing a general pardon
for every human being in this fleet.

476
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,313
This will not be
a popular move today,

477
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,076
but l truly believe that this is the only way
for us to move forward in strength

478
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,516
in a spirit of healing
and reconciliation.

479
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,869
l thank you

480
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,750
for your continued patience
and courage.

481
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,035
Good day.

482
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,599
Thank you.

483
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,758
<i>(woman)</i> Hey, Chief.
Do you want a seat?

484
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,679
More rebels?

485
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,672
Wanna watch the baseball game?
