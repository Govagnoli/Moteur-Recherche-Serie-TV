00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,269
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,432
Some people in the fleet
believe that the legend of Earth

3
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,318
held perhaps the greatest promise
for our survival.

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,153
- Do you know how to find it?
- Not really, no.

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,437
There was a hope - my hope -
that if you knew the way to Earth

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,114
it would justify
keeping you alive a little longer.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,397
Now, when l say
that l do not know exactly where Earth is,

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,109
that is not to say l do not know
a great deal about its probable location.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,873
<i>(Doral) A baseship -
<i>the one investigating pulsars</i>

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,190
<i>and the Lion nebula,</i>
<i>we've lost contact.</i>

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,714
<i>(Number Six)</i>
<i>The baseship, it's infected.</i>

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,839
If an infected Cylon dies and carries
this disease into a resurrection ship,

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,832
it could spread,
potentially infecting our entire race.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,436
If one of us is resurrected...
the disease will follow.

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,796
Then no Cylon can board that ship
without risking infection.

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,112
l'll go. Yes, l'll go.
l can go to the baseship.

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,033
<i>l can make observations about Cylons,</i>
<i>their condition,</i>

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,671
<i>bring back information about this disease</i>
<i>which now threatens all of you.</i>

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,878
- <i>(Baltar) Do you know what this is?</i>
- It must be some kind of... beacon.

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,633
It must have been left here
by the thirteenth tribe.

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,350
The beacon carried the disease, left by
some humans like you to destroy us.

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,159
You noticed nothing suspicious
on the infected ship?

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,549
Nothing whatsoever.

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,916
l am just as baffled as you are.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,355
Just like the scriptures say... There it is.
The Lion's Head nebula and blinking eye.

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,189
Holy crap! It's the road to Earth!

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,791
<i>(Apollo) This is combat.</i>
<i>Prepped and ready. Plan A.</i>

28
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,836

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,596
<i>(Sharon)</i> This is so wrong.

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,636
What the hell happened here?

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,917
<i>(Sharon)</i> Whatever this is,
it's something new.

32
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,275
Go.

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,394
Apollo, <i>Galactica.</i> You are cleared hot.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,355
<i>(Apollo) Roger that, "Galactica".</i>

35
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,431
We're in close now,
and by the look of it,

36
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,637
that ship's in no condition
to put up a fight.

37
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,280
Never seen anything like this.
Shall we proceed?

38
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,998
Hang on, guys.

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,435
<i>(Helo) Use extreme caution, Apollo.</i>

40
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,829
<i>(Apollo) Set perimeter.</i>
<i>Weapons tight, everyone.</i>

41
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,998
<i>Galactica,</i> Apollo. We're in.

42
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,112
<i>Galactica,</i> no sign of life.

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,749
<i>Ship appears</i>
<i>to be abandoned and powering down.</i>

44
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,280
What the hell?

45
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,591
<i>(coughing)</i>

46
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,957
<i>(Racetrack)</i> Gods, what happened?

47
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,670
<i>(Mathias)</i> l don't know, but their frakking
resurrection ship is gonna overheat.

48
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,278
<i>Galactica,</i> Apollo.
We've reached the control centre.

49
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,635
<i>30, maybe 40, dead skin-jobs.</i>

50
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,114
Mathias, set a perimeter!

51
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,555
Sharon. Athena!

52
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,029
See what you can pick up
with the computers.

53
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,510
Three fire teams, each doorway. Go.

54
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,430
OK, l'm gonna try
to call up the database.

55
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,432
If l get a connection,
put the SSR leads in the water.

56
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,796
Reduce the error-correction levels
for higher throughput.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,515
- <i>(Racetrack)</i> You sure you wanna do that?
- It's how it works.

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,239
You OK?

60
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,433
Yeah, the data points
are almost completely corroded.

61
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,035
l don't know if l'm gonna
get much out of here, but let's try.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,355
What is going on?

63
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,589
Frak me! This one's alive!

64
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,240
We've got a live one over here!

65
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,197
<i>(Mathias)</i> Cover the Major!

66
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,111
<i>(Apollo)</i> They're alive!

67
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,760
<i>Galactica,</i> Apollo. We got, uh...

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,719
one, two, three, four...
five living skin-jobs down here.

69
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,917
l say again, five... five living.

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,471
- <i>(Helo) Are you taking fire?</i>
- Negative. They seem in pretty bad shape.

71
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,710
Don't take chances.
If they make a move...

72
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,836
<i>Oh, you can trust me on that one.</i>

73
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,034
Major, what do we do?
Should we take 'em out?

74
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,588
<i>(Apollo)</i> Hold your fire, hold your fire!

75
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,073

- <i>(Cylon #3)...and</i> above all...

80
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,757
Hey, Athena, what are you doing?

81
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,989
Athena!

82
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,832
What are you doing? Athena!

83
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,430
Traitor.

84

<i>(Number Six)</i> Save yourself.

Get away from us.

87
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,712
What happened here?

88
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,189
<i>(Number Six)</i> The beacon.

89
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,114
<i>(faltering)</i> We brought it... on board.

90
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,676
It carried a disease.

91
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,476
We're infected.

92
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,999
Infected?

93
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,038
- Son of a bitch!
- OK, OK, OK! Settle down!

94
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,715
Keep back!
Watch the doorways. Get the doorways!

95
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,394
<i>Galactica,</i> Apollo.
We have a situation down here.

96
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,030
The Cylons have been
infected with... a disease.

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,197
<i>We have all been exposed.</i>

98
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,555
<i>We've all been exposed.</i>

99
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,308
<i>(Cottle) They'll come aboard</i>
<i>under quarantine.</i>

100
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,472
Clear a path from the hangar
to sickbay, and sterilise it.

101
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,393
- And the Raptors, after they're in.
- l'll handle that.

102
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,472
- How long in quarantine?
- l won't know till the blood work.

103
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,835
Could be days, weeks.
There's no way to tell.

104
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,070
They picked up this disease
from a beacon?

105
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,752
According to the Cylons.

106
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,879
Good to have the source of the pathogen.
Can you bring it aboard <i>Galactica?</i>

107
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,713
No, too dangerous.
l want to limit our exposure.

108
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,314
- <i>(Cottle)</i> What about the prisoners?
- Prisoners?

109
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,710
The disease is advanced in their systems,
so it'll give me an idea

110
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,995
of what to expect as it progresses.

111
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,198
And when they die, it'll tell me
how long our people have to live.

112
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,636
- How many prisoners?
- How many you got?

113
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,313
<i>(Helo) Apollo, "Galactica". Alpha check.</i>

114
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,269
<i>Galactica,</i> we have you in visual range.
Approaching starboard hangar.

115
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,920
<i>(Helo) Apollo, what was that?</i>

116
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,592
<i>(Gaeta)</i> Massive energy discharge
from the baseship.

117
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,870
- It exploded, sir.
- Are you all right out there?

118
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,394
Uh, yeah, affirmative.
We're still here.

119
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,189
- <i>What the hell happened?</i>
- Baseship exploded. Self-destructed.

120
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,952
You're lucky you got out.

121
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,758
<i>Roger that.</i>

122
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,156
- <i>(Baltar)</i> Nothing the matter, l trust?
- We have some questions.

123
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,358
How long have you
planned to betray us, Gaius?

124
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,439
Funny.

125
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,910
- You're joking, of course.
- You're making this harder on yourself.

126
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,632
Wait a minute. l have been more than
very accommodating since l arrived here.

127
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,952
l helped you find Sharon's baby.
l've helped you with a map towards Earth.

128
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,237
We know about the beacon, Gaius.
You knew it was out there.

129
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,709
You knew it contained a deadly virus.

130
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,109
No, l didn't. l didn't.

131
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,839
Was the virus created by <i>Galactica?</i>

132
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,037
<i>(Number Three)</i> Have you been in contact
since you've been on board?

133
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,396
Or did you plan this
before the evacuation of New Caprica?

134
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,916
This is the
most profound misunderstanding.

135
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,551
Uh, l had nothing to do
with the virus or the beacon.

136
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,119
Yes.

137
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,112
Yes, l did discover it
on the baseship,

138
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,919
and l should have told you sooner,
and l didn't.

139
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,788
because l thought, you'd try and link me,
you know, to the virus,

140
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,030
which is, hello,
what's going on right now.

141
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,476
l was wrong. It was a mistake,
and l fully admit my responsibility.

142
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,633
It will never happen again.
And l hope you'll accept my most, uh,

143
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,110
yeah, my most humble apology.

144
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,913
On a brighter note, l have a working
theory as to where this beacon may...

145
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,070
<i>(clunking footsteps)</i>

146
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,111
l'm sorry, Gaius.

147
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,716
Things would have been so much simpler
had you only told the truth.

148
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,839
We think you know more about this virus,
and we intend to find out.

149
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,392
Relax. Have a drink.

150
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,471
l can't.

151
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,717
The pain. The pain.

152
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,917
It's all in your head, Gaius.
Pain, pleasure...

153
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,798
they're just neural impulses
sent to the brain.

154
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,917
You decide how to interpret them.

155
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,797
They can be pleasant...

156
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,996
or unpleasant.

157
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,548
<i>(high-pitched electronic whine)</i>

No, please!

- <i>(whining stops)</i>

163
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,436
l don't want you to feel this pain.

164
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,751
And neither does Caprica. Do you?

165
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,751
No.

166
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,949

- You feel anything yet?
- Yeah, l feel sick. Sick of you buggin' me.

168
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,959
- <i>You</i> didn't touch any infected skin-jobs.
- It's not my fault you're clumsy.

169
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,589
- You can kiss my infected ass.
- You can kiss it, but it's not infected.

170
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,356
l got your blood work back. Humans are
immune to the virus. You're all healthy.

171
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,955
All right, people. Nice job.
Let's get outta here.

172
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,473
No. You stay put for a while.

173
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,670
Yeah!

174
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,435
No, no, no, no, no.
Please tell me she's OK.

175
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,159
- l haven't done her blood work yet.
- What?

176
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,277
Oh, l see.
She can wait because of who she isn't.

177
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,835
Sharon.

178
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,030
You're gonna be OK. l promise.

179
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,751
You come for me, godsdamn it.
You come for me the second you know.

180
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,468
Take him. He's the furthest gone.

181
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,231
No, no, no, no.

182
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,630
No, no, no.

183
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,436
- <i>(Roslin)</i> You can keep the Cylons alive?
- l can't cure them, but yes.

184
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,795
- How long?
- Indefinitely.

185
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,871
l identified the virus.
We know it as lymphocytic encephalitis.

186
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,076
The disease is carried by rats, mostly.

187
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,630
But a couple of hundred years ago,
humans developed an immunity.

188
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,711
Now l can create a simple vaccine

189
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,429
that will dramatically reverse
the effect of the virus on the Cylons.

190
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,239
But, uh, they have
an antibody in their blood

191
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,834
which breaks down
the RNA of the vaccine.

192
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,755
So they will need regular, close-interval
injections of the vaccine, or they will die.

193
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,152
Can l ask the ugly question here?
Is there a reason to keep them alive?

194
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,232
We could interrogate them
for intelligence.

195
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,756
l agree.
We have a lot of unanswered questions.

196
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,671
OK. But they're not gonna talk.

197
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,515
They might if we dangled the vaccine.
They don't know it's a stopgap, not a cure.

198
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,913
They prayed on the infected ship.
Karl's wife said it was something called

199
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,958
"The prayer to the cloud of unknowing",
whatever that is.

200
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,396
Anyway, the point is,
she said they only use it

201
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,789
when they're facing
a death that is final.

202
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,713
No possibility of downloading.
They're ready to die.

203
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,999
Maybe, but it doesn't mean one of them
won't jump at a second chance.

204
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,676
It infected everything -

205
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,431
baseship,

206
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,954
Centurions,

207
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,632
Raiders -

208
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,317
until we were finally abandoned...
by the other Cylon ships.

209
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,039
Why?

210
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,999
Why not just put you under quarantine
until they found a cure?

211
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,709
Fear... of spreading the disease.

212
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,471
They told us that there was a bioelectric
feedback component to the pathogen.

213
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,199
It corrupts how our brains
manage our immune systems.

214
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,669
<i>(chokes)</i>

215
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,389
If one of us dies...

216
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,516
and is resurrected,

217
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,556
the disease will follow,

218
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,236
infecting the resurrection ship
and... and the fleet.

219
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,118
Why were you in this area
in the first place?

220
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,113
We were sent.

221
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,433
We were sent here
to look for the Lion nebula.

222
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,277
Baltar...
said it would point the way to Earth.

223
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,909
- What did you just say?
- Baltar... Baltar's alive?

224
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,035
Baltar... is on our baseship.

225
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,951
He's helping us find Earth.

226
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,554
He's using our navigation charts,

227
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,870
along with our map of Kobol.

228
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,999
He's leading them to Earth.

229
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,479
We... want...

230
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,949
a new beginning.

231
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,956
Much like you.

232
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,957
l gave you i-information.

233
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,998
She said that there...
there was a cure.

234
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,749
Doc Cottle will be...
giving you the medicine.

235
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,400
- Take him back to the infirmary.
- <i>(man)</i> Yes, sir.

236
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,950
<i>(Apollo sniggers)</i>

237
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,109
What the hell's so funny?

238
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,879
l think l just thought of a way
to solve all of our problems...

239
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,357
to get rid of the Cylon threat
for once and for all.

240
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,510
We can wipe 'em out.

241
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,592
We can destroy the entire Cylon race.

242
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,629
We jump to an area
we know the Cylons use as a supply line -

243
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,312
NCD2539.

244
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,598
We stay there, exposed.
We look as if we're spoiling for a fight.

245
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,389
They'll send a fleet. Where there's a fleet,
there's a resurrection ship.

246
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,155
And once the resurrection ship
is within our reach,

247
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,879
we execute our infected prisoners.

248
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,715
We bug out. The prisoners download
into the ship, and with them, the virus.

249
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,155
You sure the virus
will download to a new body?

250
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,993
The Cylons are sure of it.

251
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,108
They left their wounded out here to die
alone, with no hope of being rescued.

252
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,553
Tells me all l need to know.

253
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,509
And once the virus is in the resurrection
ship... there will be no stopping it.

254
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,398
Rescuers become
carriers of the plague.

255
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,678
The Cylons themselves
don't believe that they'll develop a cure.

256
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,635
Oh, my gods.

257
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,917
- This could be the end of the Cylons.
- Forever.

258
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,198
Genocide?
So, that's what we're about now?

259
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,157
They're not human.

260
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,155
They were built, not born. No fathers,
no mothers, no sons, no daughters.

261
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,231
l had a daughter.
l held her in my arms.

262
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,629
And she was half-human.
These are things.

263
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,871
Dangerous things.
This is our one chance to be rid of them.

264
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,635
You can rationalise it any way you want.
We do this,

265
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,474
we wipe out their race,
then we're no different than they are.

266
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,835
<i>(Roslin)</i> Captain, l respectfully disagree.

267
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,233
The Cylons struck first in this war and, not
content with the annihilation of billions,

268
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,710
they pursued us relentlessly
through the galaxies to wipe us out.

269
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,519
They tried to live with us
on New Caprica.

270
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,036
- What did you say?
- They tried to live with us.

271
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,398
You weren't on New Caprica. To my
recollection, you didn't set foot there.

272
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,630
So out of respect
for the men and women

273
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,590
who suffered through that snake pit,
l'm gonna pretend l didn't hear that.

274
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,319
You would serve your fleet well
if you'd remember

275
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,312
that Cylons are a threat
to the survival of humans.

276
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,278
l'm talking about right and wrong.

277
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,830
l'm talking about
losing a piece of our souls.

278
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,430
But no one wants to hear that, right?

279
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,829
Let's keep it on me.

280
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,992
Yeah, l'm married to a Cylon...

281
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,152
who walked through hell for all of us
how many times?

282
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,913
And she's not half anything,

283
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,993
OK. How do we know there aren't
others like her? She made a choice.

284
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,155
She's a person.
They're a race of people.

285
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,279
Wiping them out with a biological weapon
is a crime against...

286
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,874
is a crime against humanity.

287
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,077
But they're not human.
They're programmed.

288
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,079
We will take your input
under advisement.

289
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,832
Thank you both.

290
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,195
Thank you, ma'am.

291
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,229

Then tell us what we want to know.

298
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,554
How was the virus invented?

299
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,915
Did they make a cure?

<i>(Number Six) Look at me. Look at me.</i>

301
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,511
When you make love to me, Gaius,
you don't always think about me.

302
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,989
Your mind wanders. l know that.

303
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,595
You think of equations,
puzzles, your laundry.

304
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,797
It's the nature of the mind
to disconnect from the body

305
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,348
and journey on its own.

306
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,669
Separate your mind from your body.

307
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,354
Keep your mind in that room.

308
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,271
Use your intellect against her.

<i>(whining slows)</i>

318
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,598
<i>(Number Three)</i> You see, Gaius,
this is what the absence of pain feels like.

319
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,872
It's easy to forget.

320
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,636
l had nothing to do with the virus.
It was a coincidence.

321

There's no such thing

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,789
Be a scientist.
Examine her faith.

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,112
l'm a scientist.

And as a scientist,

l believe that if God exists
our knowledge of him is imperfect. Why?

330
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,953

the passage of time.

332
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,154
The religion you practise is based
on a theory, impossible to prove,

333
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,030
yet you bestow it with absolutes like,
"There is no such thing as coincidence."

334
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,076
It's called faith.

335
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,119
Absolute belief in God's will
means there's a reason for everything.

336
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,997
Everything!

337
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,355
And yet...

338
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,560
you can't help but ask yourself how
God can allow death and destruction,

339
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,710
and then despise yourself for asking.

340
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,236
But the truth is, if we knew God's will,
we'd all be gods, wouldn't we?

341
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,436
l can see it in your eyes, D'Anna.

342
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,590
You're frustrated.
You're conflicted.

343
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,355
Let me help you.
Let me help you change.

344
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,035
Find a way
to reconcile your faith with fact.

345
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,350
Find a way
towards a rational universe.

346
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,353
l don't know what your game is,
but it's not going to work.

347
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,954
You intentionally led one
of our ships to that beacon, didn't you?

348
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,391
Give your body to me.

349
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,753
Only your mind is there.

350
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,150
Feel me. Feel this
where she wants you to feel pain.

351
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,392
Look at me. Look at me, Gaius.

352
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,199
Do you want me to believe
you're worth saving?

353
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,508
Do you?

354
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,636
Do you? Say it.

355
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,316
l want you to believe in me.

356
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,075
Don't stop! Don't stop!

357
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,355
Please, please, don't stop.

358
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,000
You have to believe in me.
You're all l have left.

359
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,196
<i>(moans)</i>

360
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,475
Now tell me you believe in me.

361
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,676
Tell me you believe in my strength.

362
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,108
l believe in you!

363
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,675
l believe in you.

364
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,149
l love you.

365
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,913
l love you with all my heart.

366
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,109
l love you with all my heart.

367
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,237
How?

368
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,756
Cottle said it had something to do
with carrying a half-human child.

369
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,071
How the foetal cells
enter the maternal circulatory system,

370
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,950
causing the mother to create antibodies.
Whatever. l'm immune!

371
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,349
Oh, my gods.

372
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,076
Our baby... saved my life.

373
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,798
She's gone forever,
and she saved my life.

374
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,598
Hera kept us together.

375
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,071
- To share this.
- This?

376
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,119
You mean us?
Together? You mean us?

377
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,953
Them. Them.

378
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,031
l mean them.

379
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,156
Who's "them?"

380
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,276
They're gonna execute
the infected prisoners.

381
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,992
But not until we jump into a Cylon region
with a resurrection ship present.

382
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,319
The infection's
gonna spread everywhere.

383
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,399
- There's a point l'd like to make.
- Mm-hm?

384
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,879
The law forbids me
to use biological weapons

385
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,791
without a presidential order.

386
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,269
Which means
you're passing the buck.

387
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,113
On this one, yes.

388
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,678
Helo's right on one thing.

389
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,596
We start destroying entire races,

390
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,353
even mechanical races,

391
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,353
we're liable to tear off
a piece of man's soul.

392
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,238
The Cylons are coming to Earth.

393
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,392
If they find us,
they are coming for us.

394
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,189
Those are the stakes.
They always have been, Bill.

395
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,275
We're talking about
the genocide of your entire race.

396
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,911
Yeah.

397
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,276
You think l don't know that?

398
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,114
l made a choice...
to wear a uniform,

399
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,758
to be a person.

400
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,037
You were a person
before you put on that uniform.

401
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,793
OK? You were a person
before l fell in love with you.

402
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,589
- You don't have to prove that.
- l have to prove it every day.

403
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,275
Let me tell you something, Helo.

404
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,239
My people may die.

405
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,118
My entire race may be wiped out.

406
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,113
But this Cylon will keep her word,

407
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,954
even if it means
she's the last Cylon left in the universe.

408
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,274
Can a human being do that?

409
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,191
Posterity really
doesn't look too kindly on genocide.

410
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,159
<i>(Roslin)</i> You're assuming
that posterity will define this as genocide.

411
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,358
If they do, at least there'll be
someone alive to hate us for it.

412
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,077
The Cylons are our mistake,
we created them.

413
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,315
All right, Admiral. As president, l have
determined the Cylons be made extinct.

414
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,234
The use of biological weapons
is authorised.

415
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,638
So say we all.

416
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,079
So say we all.

417
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,512
Jump complete.
DRADIS is clear. No Cylons, sir.

418
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,673
They'll be here soon enough.
Get our birds in the air.

419
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,671
Commence Viper
and nav Raptor launch.

420
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,595
Let's do this, Racetrack.

421
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,838
<i>(shouting)</i>

422
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,037
Move 'em back. Go.
Move, move. Come on.

423
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,108
CAP is away.
Nav bird has them on DRADIS.

424
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,234
DRADIS contact. A pair of Cylon Raiders.
Keeping their distance for now.

425
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,154
Didn't take 'em that long.
They're just scouts.

426
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,879
They'll jump away
and report back to their fleet.

427
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,678
Let's see if they take our bait.

428
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,796
Got it.
There's a resurrection ship with them.

429
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,872
<i>(Adama)</i> Then it's time
to execute our Cylon prisoners.

430
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,235
Call it in.

431
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,435
Terminate the prisoners.

432
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,709
- Head shots, OK?
- Yes, sir.

433
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,994
Let's do it.

434
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,593
All right, let's see if we can't frak up
some toasters on this joy ride, people.

435
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,631
<i>(Hotdog) l'm notching like hell!</i>

436
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,555
Hotdog, Starbuck. Quit your bitchin'
and continue to cover as fragged.

437
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,036
Out of the way.

438
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,313
Frak! They're already dead.
They're... they're already dead.

439
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,512
Sir, you should hear this.

440
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,955
<i>(Apollo) They were dead</i>
<i>before the ship was in range.</i>

441
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,079
<i>They didn't download the disease.</i>
<i>We've missed our window.</i>

442
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,196
<i>(Starbuck) A baseship just jumped in.</i>

443
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,670
Call our birds in.
Spool up. Let's get the hell outta here.

444
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,318
Commence FTL.

445
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,837
Sir, we lost time. We're gonna take
significant fire while we spool up.

446
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,156
Continue jump.
Take us back to our fleet.

447
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,798
Yes, sir.

448
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,916
They'll be coming for me.

449
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,991
You or me.

450
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,356
Seems like they're
always coming for one of us...

451
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,029
l'm not a traitor.

452
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,078
l love my people.
l love this ship.

453
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,155
Besides you, the first thing l wanna see
on any morning are the lights in that CIC.

454
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,759
l did what l thought was right.

455
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,628
If it was a mistake, fine.
l can live with that.

456
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,391
It's you l can't live without.

457
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,269
l'll always love you, Helo.

458
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,157
Mm. No, thanks.

459
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,434
The prisoners died of asphyxiation.

460
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,958
The air-purification system was reversed.
It sucked the oxygen out.

461
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,993
When this happens, the deadbolts
are automatically activated on the door.

462
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,554
- Someone did this manually.
- Someone?

463
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,033
Seems to me
there's only one or two likely suspects.

464
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,636
- Who will head the investigation?
- No one. l'm closing the book on this.

465
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,314
How convenient.

466
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,673
Cottle's report on the virus.

467
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,880
He thinks that it was simply
an accidental contamination

468
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,669
of the beacon we abandoned
on the sick baseship.

469
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,910
Somebody sneezed, maybe.

470
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,152
Yeah, an entire race
almost wiped out

471
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,516
because someone
forgot to wipe their nose.

472
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,750
According to Cottle,

473
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,913
the virus was an exact match

474
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,675
to one reported
over 3,000 years ago.

475
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,036
Right around the time
that the thirteenth colony left Kobol.

476
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,554
That beacon...

477
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,710
was a signpost to Earth.

478
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,553
l think we're on the right trail, Laura.

479
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,915
Yes, we are on the right trail, Bill.

480
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,119
So are the Cylons.

481
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,230
New scenery.

482
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,629
Whoa. Argh!
