00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,020
The Cylong Were Created By Man

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,420
They Evolved

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,890
They Rebelled

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,440
There Are Many Copies

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,460
And They Have A Plan

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,240
Previously on Battlestar Galactica...

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,320
There are survivors on Caprica

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,280
A resistance movement.

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,880
We've been fighting cylons.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,670
Hitting 'em as we can.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,000
*Coudn't understand it, sorry.*

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,840
Rebuilding Caprica

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,430
First Sharon was a sleeper agent.

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,540
Didn't realize she was a cylon.

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,860
Until a program in kick vision.

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,410
I'm Sharon, but I'm a different Sharon.

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,930
And I'm here to help.

18
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,530
No, I've decided you're an expression of my, uh...
subconscious mind playing itself out during my waking states.

19
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,460
So I'm only in your head?

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,110
I'm pregnant, Helo.

21
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,660
We can have a child.

22
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,070
Sharon is going to bear our child?

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,860
An honor for which she is hardly deserving
but one doesn't question God's will.

24
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,080
Cylons reincarnate.

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,320
Makes sense, doesn't it?

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,630
All of memories are downloaded
into a brand new body

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,590
Death then becomes a
learning experience.

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,380
Nine Months Ago

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,400
Caprica

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,170
Wait, there has to be another way out of here! I
mean.. I mean you.. you must have an escape plan.

31
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,100
You're not about to be destroyed by your
own bombs, are you? How are you leaving?

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:55,900
Oh!

33
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,930
Gaius, I can't die.

34
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,570
When this body's destroyed, my memory, my
consciousness will be transmitted to a new o­ne.

35
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,400
I'll just wake up somewhere
else in an identical body.

36
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,030
You mean there's more
out there like you?

37
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,010
There are 12 models.

38
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,490
I'm number 6.

39
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,140
- I don't want to die.
- Get down.

40
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,330
Do you love me?

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,910
Where.. where..

42
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,570
I was in a house.

43
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,190
But you're not in a house any longer.

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,660
You're back with us.

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,310
You've been reborn.

46
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,130
I died.

47
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,270
I died.

48
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,750
hat's right. You were in
a house.  It was destroyed.

49
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,690
A nuclear blast.

50
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,910
But that is all over now. You have
been downloaded into a new body.

51
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,830
Gaius?

52
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,410
Gaius was in the house.

53
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,490
Gaius Baltar.

54
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,990
Yes. Is he alive?

55
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,780
Is he?

56
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,380
Shhhhhh.

57
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm not really here.

58
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,190
No one can see me but you.

59
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,890
Don't let them know.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,020
Six.

61
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,550
Would it trouble you if
doctor Baltar were dead?

62
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:19,720
If they know how you feel
about me, it'll be a problem.

63
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,670
It would be unfortunate..

64
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,290
..  if he died.

65
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,920
He was so helpful.

66
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,200
Very helpful.

67
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,410
Your mission was a resounding success.

68
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,690
It completely disabled
the colonial defenses.

69
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,230
he attack succeeded beyond our most
optimistic projections, thanks to you.

70

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,590
You're a machine, I'm not.

73
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,700
I know there's pain, but
breathe.. ride through it.

74
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,200
You're going to be okay.

75
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,490
Trust me.

76
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,740
You're in god's hands.
We're all here with you.

77
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,290
That's it.

78
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,280
This will pass. Trust me.

79
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,800
Everything's gonna be all right.

80
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,700
Welcome home, sister.

81
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,190
We're here.

82
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,370
We're going to take care of you.

83
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,950
We're proud of you, Sharon.

84
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,740
And we love you.

Present Day Cylon Occupied Caprica

92
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,180
I was thinking it symbolized
rebirth, a new beginning.

93
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,210
It's a memorial.

94
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,810
Do you know how many people died
in this park during the attack?

95
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,840
How many people in this park alone?

96
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,240
It's gonna be lovely, isn't it?

97
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,620
Sorry.

98
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,850
A place to relax and
collect your thoughts.

99
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,540
How are you doing?

100
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,940
I'm a little stiff.

101
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,830
I'm still trying to
get used to this body.

102
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,280
I mean, I know it's identical, but...

103
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,500
...  even after all this
time, I still feel awkward.

104
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,320
I was a klutz too.
Always knock things over.

105
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,270
Forever tripping over things.

106
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,240
And, you know what? You get over it.

107
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,100
And you know what, this is
a great chance to cleanse.

108
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,930
You got a new body, a new life.

109
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,640
And anything that you've built up
like anxieties or remorse or guilt..

110
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,560
... just let it wash away.

111
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,830
I can't tell you how thankful I am.

112
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,950
You've.. you've been a
really big help to me.

113
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,800
No, it's me who's thankful.

114
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,840
We all are.

115
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,740
You are a warrior. We could
not have won without you.

116
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,050
Excuse me.

117
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,480
I just wanted to say it's an honor
to have you here on Caprica with us.

118
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,230
What you did..

119
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,930
.. well, it's inspiring.

120
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,080
Thank you.

121
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,820
Present Day Battlestar Galactica

122
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,820
Hey. How you doing?

123
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,620
Freezing.

124
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,480
I can't feel my legs.

125
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,330
That's the epidural.

126
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,210
What happened?

127
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,930
You passed out and started bleeding again,
but everything's going to be all right.

128
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,360
Like hell it is.

129
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,470
I find it absolutely amazing. You people went to all the
trouble to appear human and didn't upgrade the plumbing.

130
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,460
You have a detached placenta.

131
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,430
Baby's gotta come out now
or we will lose you both.

132
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,910
Okay, sir, I'm going to have
to ask you to step back, please.

133
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,230
She's tachycardiac, and her
blood pressure's dropping.

134
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,110
Yeah, she's hemorrhaging again.
We're gonna have to make the cut now.

135
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,220
Sharon? can you hear me?

136
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,410
Helo.

137
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,360
Still can't get used to this.

138
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,920
Well, you're a hero of the cylon now.

139
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,960
You're our first celebrity.

140
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,550
No, I'm just another Six.

141
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,630
You're too modest. I'm just another
Three. And there are Fives and.. or Eights.

142
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,700
But you, everyone
calls you Caprica Six ..

143
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,870
..like you're the
only Six on the planet.

144
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,250
And.. and what you did
was incredibly difficult.

145
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:21,920
Seduce a man, so emotionally and
physically so that he grants you access to..

146
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,830
... all the most closely
guarded secrets of his people.

147
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,350
That mission could be
profoundly disturbing.

148
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,620
Disturbing?

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,140
She sleeping with me and
killing billions of people?

150
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,160
'Cause I rather thought you
enjoyed sleeping with me.

151
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,340
It was difficult at times.

152
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,660
So nobody here can possibly understand what you've
been through. Which is why we need your help.

153
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,010
There's another cylon who's been having
trouble re-integrating after a download.

154
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,310
Another hero, actually.

155
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,610
An Eight.

156
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,590
-  She still insists on calling herself Sharon.
- And you thought I could help.

157
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,500
I'm still having... I'm
having problems of my own.

158
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,330
Caprica, you don't understand.
She really needs your help.

159
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,980
If we don't turn her around
soon, there's talk of boxing her.

160
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,550
Putting her memories in cold
storage? You can't be serious.

161
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,790
Well, that's a charming way to
deal with emotional problems.

162
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
One might almost call it inhuman.

163
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,980
Oh, that's right, you are.

164
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,630
All right, look, it is a last
resort, but she has been regressing.

165
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:25,900
Please.

166
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,280
She's living up there in that apartment. It's
the one she had when she thought she was human.

167
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,120
Security's minimal.

168
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,830
Two centurions patrol out front.

169
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,050
The third bullet-head
watch the perimeter.

170
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,880
Bullet-head walking perimeter
makes random changes to his patrol.

171
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,260
Be tough to get past him.

172
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,270
All right, so we go under him.

173
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,760
The storm drain leads directly
to the garage underneath the cafe.

174
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,480
They'll be dozens of skin jobs inside.

175
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,840
She's not breathing.

176
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,310
Suction it.

177
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,090
What's going on? Where
are you taking her?

178
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,180
Her lungs aren't fully developed.
She needs oxygen support.

179
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,360
But she's alive, right?

180
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,210
Right?

181
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,640
There's your answer.

182
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,140
Now you get the hell out of here. We have to
stop the mother bleeding or she won't be alive.

183
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,990
You here to kick me out?

184
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,460
No.

185
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,220
You're here to help me
with my adjustment problems.

186
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,910
I could save you some time.

187
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,180
This is home.

188
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,470
I'm not leaving.

189
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,870
I lived o­n caprica for two years.

190
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,560
I knew what I was.

191
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,800
Pretended to be human, but I knew.

192
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,590
If you knew what you were and you lived
on Caprica, you know what that makes you.

193
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,960
A really good liar.

194
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,510
Start with the elephants.

195
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,610
These are beautiful.

196
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,120
Ithacan?

197
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,870
Hand-carved.

198
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,740
My mother gave them to me the
day I left for the fleet academy.

199
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,610
Is this her?

200
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,590
Supposed to be.

201
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,020
'Course none of it's real.

202
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,240
All fabricated for my mission.

203
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,350
It's all a lie.

204
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,790
Following god's path is never easy.

205
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,450
Don't get religious with this one.

206
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,740
Do you think I care, about your god?

207
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,110
Look, god loves you.

208
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,170
This is love.

209
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,750
These people love me.

210
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,440
I love them.

211
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,540
I didn't pretend to feel something
so I could screw people over.

212
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,750
I loved them.

213
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,840
And then I betrayed them.

214
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,720
I shot a man I loved.

215
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,630
Frakked over another man,
ruined his life. And why?

216
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,100
Because i'm a lying machine.

217
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,520
I'm a frakking Cylon!

218
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:14,750
Sorry.

219
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,390
I didn't mean to...

220
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,660
I've got bandages in there.

221
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,310
Nicely done.

222
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,990
You timed it perfectly.

223
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,030
Scratch your face with the side of your
fingernail the moment the glass hits the wall.

224
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,430
Never saw a cylon show fear before.

225
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,860
Especially the Sixes.

226
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,740
Usually so hardcore.

227
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,130
Feign fear and emotional
vulnerability.. you're very good.

228
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,450
But I'm better.

229
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,990
Let me help you.

230
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,550
"I'm different."

231
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,800
I'm different.

232
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,430
"I'm more like you."

233
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,700
I'm more like you.

234
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,090
"I had someone I met here."
I had someone I met here.

235
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,600
"A Man." A Man.

236
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,810
"I loved him and I think he could've loved me eventually."
I loved him and I think he could've loved me eventually.

237
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,910
Half a cigarette should give us two or
three minutes to get the frak out of there.

238
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,140
Any longer and we risk them finding
the charges before they go off.

239
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,900
Is it two minutes or three?

240
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,290
About to find out.

241
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,670
This is a risky operation just
to nail a couple dozen skin jobs.

242
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,900
I mean, we can't kill them.

243
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,560
They'll just download
into a new body and...

244
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,490
I mean, what's the point?

245
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,450
That skin job with Starbuck..
"Sharon".. they called her..

246
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,250
... she said that when they
download, they remembered everything.

247
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,030
Right up until the end.

248
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,600
These skin jobs are going to remember
being blown into tiny little pieces.

249
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,050
- It's gotta hurt.
- Yeah.

250
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,350
I hope it hurts a lot.

251
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,630
Because sooner or later, the message sinks
in. There is no safe place, not even a cafe.

252
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,430
So if you want to quit living through hell and dying
over and over again, then get the frak off our planet.

253
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,860
Three minutes, ten seconds

254
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,880
Bum.

255
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,770
This house was on a bluff over a lake.

256
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,070
I always loved the view.
Sunlight on the water.

257
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,880
It's my favorite spot in the universe.

258
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,590
Yeah, it's magical.

259
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,230
Too bad you nuked it.

260
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,770
After I downloaded, I went
back to the ruins of his house.

261
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,890
Why?

262
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,710
Like you, I was looking for
some sort of connection to him.

263
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,470
Found a few of his things. Even
held onto them for awhile. But..

264
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,840
...  I realized they were keeping
me from truly embracing my new life.

265
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,420
So what you did with them?

266
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,570
I burned them.

267
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,940
But I felt liberated.

268
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,910
Yeah, it's a beautiful story, isn't it?

269
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,580
Shame it's all a pack of lies.

270
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,550
So who was he? This man you loved.

271
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,390
Maybe you've heard of him.

272
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,720
Gaius Baltar.

273
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,220
Doctor Baltar?

274
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,880
Yeah.

275
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,760
He gave you access to
the colonial defense grid.

276
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,630
He was the one who betrayed us?

277
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,810
"Us".. Oh, I love it.

278
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,610
This one thinks she's
more human than Cylon.

279
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,350
Just like someone else I know.

280
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,640
Does he still work for the cylons?

281
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,760
What?

282
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,720
On Galactica?

283
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,290
He's..

284
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,890
.. He's alive?

285
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,150
He's the vice-president
of the colonies.

286
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,520
You didn't know that?

287
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:28,080
If her baby does survive, the
question is what do we do with it?

288
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,940
Do?

289
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,720
What are you suggesting?

290
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,520
That we throw it out of an air lock?

291
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,230
I don't make suggestions, Mr. Baltar. If I
want to toss a baby out an air lock, I'd say so.

292
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,180
Well, it's really gratifying to know
that infanticide's not on the table.

293
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,490
Do I have to point out
that this is not a baby?

294
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,660
It's a machine.

295
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,210
No, it's half machine, half human.

296
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,540
I suggest we all keep that half in mind.

297
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,360
Cylons went through a great deal
of trouble to create this thing.

298
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,730
Should go without saying that if it's
good for them, it's gonna be bad for us.

299
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,700
I completely agree.

300
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,750
And I take it as a given we can't turn it over
to Sharon to raise. That would be disastrous.

301
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,310
There's still another
factor to consider here.

302
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,920
There's cylons aboard this fleet.

303
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,130
If they find out this
thing's been born..

304
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,680
... they're gonna make a play for it.

305
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,230
You can see where this is headed, Gaius.

306
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,070
We're going to have to take our child.

307
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,810
Hello, Hera.

308
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,050
She's got quite a grip on her.

309
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,990
You don't like it in
there, do you, Hera?

310
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,320
You gotta stay in till
your lungs get stronger.

311
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,060
She's our little girl.

312
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,910
We made her.

313
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,800
It almost makes you want
to believe in the Cylon God.

314
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,630
Almost.

315
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,650
I love you so completely.

316
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,380
It's clear.

317
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,830
Hilliard, take this.

318
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,630
Let's move.

319
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,230
Here you go.

320
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,290
Why do you think they kept it from you?

321
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,230
Is the wrong question.

322
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,950
The right question is why did she get me to work
with you knowing that you'd tell me the truth?

323
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,090
She knew I had feelings for Gaius.

324
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,490
Knew that I had trouble
letting go of him.

325
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,620
She must've known it would trigger
those feelings and those memories.

326
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,320
- She's frakking with you. Can't you see that?
- But why?

327
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,260
Oh, it's so perfectly obvious.

328
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,940
You know, for a self-aware cybernetic life-form,
sometimes you can be unbearably obtuse.

329
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,590
- Oh for god sake.
- Careful.

330
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,690
Everything okay?

331
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,180
Fine.

332
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,020
Just talking with Sharon here.

333
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,090
Yeah? What about?

334
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,220
She...

335
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,740
... asked me to move out.

336
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,930
You know what? Which is what
we've been asking her for weeks.

337
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,900
I was kind of hoping that you'd see the
light after talking to our friend here.

338
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,780
She is lying, unfortunately.

339
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,100
She has no wish to see Sharon cured.

340
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,410
They're just going to do it.

341
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,270
They're going to box her.

342
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,650
How many Cylons up in the cafe?

343
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,570
Full house. At least 40.

344
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,270
Three minutes, ten seconds.

345
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,660
We've just made a breakthrough.

346
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,980
She's agreed to move
out of her apartment.

347
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,030
Didn't you, Sharon?

348
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,680
Yeah.

349
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,490
I'm moving out of the apartment.

350
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,900
When?

351
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,110
Whenever.

352
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,250
What about now?

353
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,860
I'll help. The apartment
is right upstairs.

354
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,020
Sure.

355
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,940
Let me.. Let me just get some things.

356
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,590
- Good work Six, must've been some chat, huh?
- Yes, we had a lot to talk about.

357
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,560
- She's right behind you.
- I know.

358
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,630
This is not a debate.

359
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:08,900
This child will not be raised by the cylon, and I cannot risk
cylon agents getting their hands on it. I've made my decision.

360
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,950
What I need from you,
Doctor, is your help.

361
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,160
Fine. I don't like it,
but have it your way.

362
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,700
- I need it immediately.
- We'll have to find somebody suitable.

363
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,850
I'll have to work up a list of names.

364
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,990
Each of them is capable.

365
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,410
Each of them is anonymous.

366
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,890
And each can be trusted.

367
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,900
Thought of everything, haven't you?

368
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,630
I hope so.

369
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,660
Are you all right, Sharon?

370
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,800
What happened?

371
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,090
An explosion.

372
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,860
Building came down on us.

373
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,150
Looks like the stairwell saved us.

374
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,170
Where's Six?

375
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,990
Her body's dead.

376
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,850
No, not yet.

377
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,000
Help me out here.

378
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,770
Would've been better if the
explosion had killed her.

379
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,450
There's nothing we can do about the
pain until we get her out of here.

380
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,090
Six

381
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,650
I can get a cross beam and
put you out of your misery.

382
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,400
I'm not going to get my own life again.

383
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,560
It's your choice.

384
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,690
Where the heck are we anyway?

385
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,250
Must be in the garage.

386
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,810
North entrance must be that way.

387
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,210
I'm start digging.

388
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,610
Hang in there.

389
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,130
You're gonna be okay.

390
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,410
A survivor.

391
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,610
Hang on, buddy.

392
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,760
We'll get you out.

393
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,360
Fresh air coming from down there.

394
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,070
Thanks. I'd almost gone there.

395
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,340
Frakkin' human. You know he
probably set that explosion.

396
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,020
What, from the resistance? Why?

397
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,400
No military value to the cafe.

398
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,510
- But humans don't respect life the way we do.
- No!

399
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,530
I  won't let you kill him.

400
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,970
She's right.

401
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,000
- Don't kill him.
- Why not?

402
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,920
Why not kill him?

403
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,500
You've already killed
billions of people.

404
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,360
Do you honestly believe one more body's going
to weigh any heavier on your conscience..

405
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,360
which is something that you don't have..

406
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,920
Do you?

407
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,740
We should interrogate him.

408
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,670
Find his accomplices.

409
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,520
Okay.

410
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,890
You can let go now, Sharon.

411
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,380
What's this?

412
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,770
Looks like colonial fleet ID.

413
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,430
Thrace, Kara.

414
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,120
Starbuck?

415
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,190
She was o­n caprica
a couple of weeks ago.

416
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,090
She escaped with the
help of another Sharon.

417
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,320
If she gave him this, he
meant something to her.

418
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,060
Well, then it's sweet.

419
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,010
You have it in your hand.

420
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,300
Hard physical proof of one
person's love for another.

421
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,810
If only you felt this deeply about us.

422
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,980
I did.

423
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,520
I do.

424
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,890
I love you, Gaius.

425
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,240
Where's the tangible proof?

426
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,800
I don't understand.

427
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,670
She was doing so well.

428
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,290
No, she wasn't.

429
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,560
I tried to tell you that.

430
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,870
Her lungs never fully developed.

431
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:04,290
She finally went into respiratory  distress.
We couldn't get her intubated in time.

432
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,310
We lost her.

433
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:08,760
I'm sorry.

434
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,400
I should've been here.

435
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,070
Sharon.

436
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,090
Listen. You've lost a lot of blood.

437
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,240
You murdered her.

438
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,830
Sharon. Come on.

439
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,880
Who ordered it?

440
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,980
Adama? The President?

441
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,770
Who?

442
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,320
I don't kill patients.

443
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,060
We did the best we could..

444
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,930
.. but she's dead.

445
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,960
And that's all there is to it.

446
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,590
I should be able to release
the ashes to you in a few hours.

447
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,530
Murderer.

448
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,590
- Sharon!
- Die!

449
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,890
You're all murderers!
You're all murderers!

450
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,100
Get her out of here.

451
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,000
Give me my baby back!

452
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,300
You let them murder our child.

453
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,360
I am so sorry.

454
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,840
I tried.

455
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,570
I tried my best.

456
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,770
God's will was that our
child should survive.

457
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,960
His will was that she would lead the
next generation of god's children.

458
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,340
His will was that you would protect her.

459
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,690
Yes.

460
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:51,110
You have committed a monstrous and unforgivable sin and now you
and your entire wretched race are going to suffer god's vengeance.

461
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,090
She's so beautiful.

462
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,800
I don't know how to thank you.

463
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,660
When I lost my baby, I
didn't know how I could go on.

464
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,930
Well, I'm glad things worked
out for you and this little girl.

465
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,410
I can't believe somebody would
give up this little angel.

466
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:22,300
You understand, Maya, that this
adoption requires absolute secrecy.

467
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:27,600
The mother is a pegasus officer and must remain
anonymous for political and religious reasons.

468
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,790
You have my word.

469
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,950
Maya, you won't mind if
I drop in occasionally.

470
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,780
Oh, of course not.

471
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,180
Good.

472
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,740
Go.

473
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,300
Thank you.

474
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:05,290
I know how awful this was for you.
But trust me, it was imperative.

475
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:12,670
As far as the cylons know, this child no
longer exists. That is a good, good thing.

476
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,480
Is this what you're looking for?

477
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,040
You can have it.

478
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,030
Here.

479
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,490
What are you doing?

480
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,560
Just making it easy for
him to get what he wants.

481
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,180
Come on. I'll give you a head start.

482
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,980
I'm fine where I am.

483
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,710
Hey, they're coming for us.

484
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,560
And you.

485
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,880
They're very interested
in you, aren't they?

486
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,670
Leave him alone.

487
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,400
Sharon.

488
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,980
You're a hero of the cylon.

489
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,240
Now you're just a broken
machine who thinks she's a human.

490
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,130
But you're not a human, Sharon..

491
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,440
.. and you never will be.

492
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,750
Yeah, well at least I'm not a murderer.

493
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,490
I have a conscience.

494
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,520
And I know the difference
between right and wrong.

495
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,000
A murderer is exactly what you are.

496
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,470
Life is short.

497
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,790
But the next one's not.

498
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,920
Let your heart adrift and
your soul will get caught.

499
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,740
I love you, Gaius.

500
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,560
My heart and soul are yours.

501
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,200
They're nearly here.

502
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,870
You know why they wanted
you to work with Sharon?

503
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,830
So you'd lose your mind.

504
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,940
They're gonna box you, darling.

505
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,080
Just like they're going to box Sharon.

506
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,090
We're dangerous.

507
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,930
What?

508
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,620
Sharon and I.

509
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,130
We're celebrities in a
culture based on unity.

510
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
No.

511
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,560
Our voices count.

512
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,760
More than hers.

513
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,260
More than others'.

514
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,020
We're two heroes of the cylon, right?

515
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,480
Two heroes with different
perspectives on the war.

516
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,560
Perspectives based by our
love of two human beings.

517
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:51,520
That's why she wanted me to work with you so
that you'd tell me that Gaius was still alive.

518
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,530
She wanted me to lose my mind.

519
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,040
No, you're corrupted
by your experiences.

520
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,850
You're a waste.

521
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,090
Believe the lies.

522
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,670
Ignore the truth. Listen to
me. I will show you the proof.

523
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,290
Speak from your heart.

524
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,120
Say the things that you know to be true.

525
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:27,410
Jealously, murder, vengeance..
they're all sins in the eyes of god.

526
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,830
That's what you and I know.

527
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,400
That's what they don't want to hear.

528
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,260
Because then they'd have to
rethink what they're doing.

529
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,300
They'd have to consider that maybe
the slaughter of mankind was a mistake!

530
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,930
God loves me.

531
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,390
See you again soon.

532
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,070
Looks like they're almost here.

533
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,470
You should get out
of here while you can.

534
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,010
The fresh air coming
in should lead you out.

535
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,670
Is this some kind of trick?

536
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,490
You can stay and be
tortured if you want.

537
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,190
Your call.

538
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,740
Who are you?

539
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,800
What kind of people are you?

540
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,190
I don't know.

541
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,710
Hey, wait!

542
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,140
How long till she downloads
and tells them what happened?

543
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,550
We had a lot of people in the cafe.

544
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,170
At least 36 hours till they get to her.

545
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,200
Long enough.

546
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,050
Long enough for what?

547
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,360
To change things for the better.

548
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,290
What are you talking about?

549
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,840
I have never..

550
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,340
...  loved anyone more in my life ...

551
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,150
.. than I love you now.

552
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,400
Our people need a new beginning.

553
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,760
A new way to live in God's love.

554
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,150
Without hate.

555
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,730
Without all the lies.

556
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,220
All they need is for
someone to show them the way.

557
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,960
Someone like two heroes of the cylons.

558
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,150
I'm with you.

559
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,100
We found them!

560
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,830
They're alive!

561
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,370
Yes, we are.

562
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,040
We're alive.
