- That's it, the Ionian Nebula.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,476
So what do you think we'll find?
A beacon? A temple? A signpost to Earth?

4

How many more jumps
before we find the nebula?

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,199
l'm estimating an even dozen.
We're getting close.

6

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,154
You are saying that the defendant,
Gaius Baltar,

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,789
ordered your execution
and the execution of 200 other people?

17

That's exactly what l'm saying.

18

This is a death warrant. Have you seen
the names on this list? Do you have...

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,435
Gaius Baltar chose
to side with the Cylons

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,149
and to actively seek the deaths
of his fellow citizens.

21

chamalla at this time?

22

Don't answer.
l'm putting a stop to this now.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,112
If she is on drugs,
it goes to her credibility as a witness.

24

l am taking chamalla again
because my cancer has returned.

25

They'd already selected the names.

166
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,511
One of them,
l believe it was a Three,

167
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,388
gave the list to the president and said:

168
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,553
"Here are the people that are going
to be executed. Please sign this."

169
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,317
He looked at the list, he saw
all the names... and then he signed it.

170
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,679
Did he protest? l mean, did he argue?
Did he offer any resistance whatsoever?

171
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,879
- <i>(man)</i> Sign it!
- <i>(Baltar)</i> l won't do it.

172
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,191
You're going to have to solve
your consciences some other way.

173
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,432
Sign it! Sign your name!
Sign it!

174
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,669
No. He never did.

175
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,548
Oh, Felix. Oh, Felix.
What are you doing?

176
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,076
Get that out of my face.

177
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,720
- We'll get him in the cross.
- Control your client.

178
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,271
It's no secret. The whole fleet knows this
man tried to stab me through the neck.

179
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,352
And you missed!
Butter fingers!

180
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,035
- Sorry, Your Honours.
- No further questions.

181
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,037
Your witness, Counsellor.

182
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,075
- No questions.
- <i>(Baltar)</i> What?!

183
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,833
<i>(muttering/gavel bangs)</i>

184
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,229
- What are you?
- Witness is dismissed.

185
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,232
<i>(Baltar)</i> Oh! Oh, great.

186
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,392
- What the hell are you doing?
- It's your word against his.

187
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,995
If he's decided to perjure himself,
there's nothing we can do.

188
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,595
We're going to have to
adjust our strategy.

189
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,148
Is the defence prepared
to present their case?

190
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,953
Your Honours, at this time,
if it please the court...

191
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,512
uh...

192
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,636
l would like to offer a motion.

193
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,632
The defence would like to move
for a mistrial.

194
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,759
No, we do not want a mistrial!
l do not want a mistrial!

195
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,274
<i>(Franks)</i> Gaius Baltar!

196
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,114
Behave, Dr Baltar.
On what grounds, Counsellor?

197
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:47,594
On the grounds that one of the panel has
already prejudged the outcome of this trial

198
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,196
and determined the guilt
of the defendant.

199
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,716
That's a very serious charge,
Mr Lampkin.

200
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,189
Which judge?

201
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,078
- That would be you, Admiral.
- <i>(muttering)</i>

202
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:09,357
And to prove it, l need to take the unusual
step of calling Mr Lee Adama to the stand.

203
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,431
<i>(muttering)</i>

204
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,673
- You've gotta be frakking kidding me!
- This is the only way we're gonna win.

205
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,878
- l will not testify against my father.
- That is your choice.

206
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,793
Either way,
l'm putting you on the stand.

207
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,432
Your Honours, this is completely
improper. Counsel cannot testify at trial.

208
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,274
l can cite at least seven precedents
off the top of my head.

209
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,675
- Call your witness, Counsellor.
- Thank you.

210
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,514
Mr Adama.

211
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,309
Mr Adama, did you meet with your father,
Admiral Adama, four days ago?

212
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,472
Yes.

213
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,235
At that meeting,
did Admiral Adama express an opinion

214
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,154
as to whether the defendant
deserved a trial?

215
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,793
All l'm looking for is the truth here,
Mr Adama. Let's have it.

216
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,598
l'm waiting.

217
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,671
Answer the question.

218
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,794
You swore an oath
as an officer of the court.

219
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,919
If you don't answer the question,
you hold the entire system of justice...

220
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,468
- What frakking system?!
- Mr Adama.

221
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,753
l'm sorry, Your Honours.
Please excuse my associate.

222
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,997
All right, all right.
l'll try something else.

223
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,712
Do you believe that the defendant
deserves a fair trial?

224
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,432
- As a matter of fact, l do.
- Why?

225
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,114
Aside from the fact
everyone deserves a fair trial,

226
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,634
l also happen to believe
that he is not guilty...

227
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,110
Your Honours,
l must insist on an exception here.

228
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,431
- He can't testify in this way. It is improper.
- l agree.

229
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,478
He can make his argument
in closing statements.

230
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,790
l'm inclined to agree
with the prosecution.

231
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,552
Thank you.

232
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,838
You can appeal to the president
if you feel that this influences the verdict,

233
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,514
but I, for one,

234
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,558
would like to hear
this witness testify.

235
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,552
<i>(male judge)</i> l would second that.

236
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,791
- Continue.
- Thank you, Your Honours.

237
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,397
Mr Adama?

238
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,994
- Mr Adama?
- Yes?

239
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,272
Why do you believe that the defendant,
Gaius Baltar,

240
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,158
deserves to be acquitted?

241
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,389
Well, because the evidence
does not support the charges.

242
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,675
Come on.

243
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,275
Did the defendant make mistakes?

244
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,238
Sure, he did.
Serious mistakes.

245
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,235
But did he actually commit any crimes?
Did he commit treason? No.

246
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,034
It was an impossible situation. When
the Cylons arrived, what could he do?

247
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,429
What could anyone have done?

248
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,557
Ask yourself,
what would you have done?

249
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,631
What would you have done?

250
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,557
If he had refused to surrender, the Cylons
would've nuked the planet then and there.

251
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,316
So did he appear to cooperate
with the Cylons? Sure.

252
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,952
So did hundreds of others. What's
the difference between him and them?

253
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,594
The president issued a blanket pardon.

254
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,355
They were all forgiven,
no questions asked.

255
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,079
Colonel Tigh...

256
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,472
Colonel Tigh used suicide bombers,
killed dozens of people. Forgiven.

257
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,473
Lieutenant Agathon and Chief Tyrol,
they murdered an officer on the <i>Pegasus.</i>

258
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,198
Forgiven.

259
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,752
The admiral. The admiral instituted a
military coup d'état against the president.

260
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,637
Forgiven.

261
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,234
And me?

262
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,234
Well... where do l begin?

263
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,319
l shot down a civilian passenger ship -
the <i>Olympic Carrier.</i>

264
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,868
Over a thousand people on board.
Forgiven.

265
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,556
l raised my weapon to a superior officer,
committed an act of mutiny. Forgiven.

266
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,632
Then, on the very day
Baltar surrendered to those Cylons,

267
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,790
I, as commander of <i>Pegasus,</i>
jumped away.

268
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,793
l left everybody on that planet alone,
undefended, for months!

269
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,839
l even tried to persuade the admiral
never to return,

270
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,480
to abandon you all there for good.

271
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,519
If l'd had my way,
nobody would've made it off that planet.

272
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,079
l'm the coward.
l'm the traitor.

273
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,276
l'm forgiven.

274
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,435
l'd say we're very forgiving of mistakes.

275
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,399
We make our own laws now, our own
justice, and we've been pretty creative

276
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,155
at finding ways to let people off the hook
for everything - theft, murder.

277
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,509
And we've had to be. Because... because
we are not a civilisation any more.

278
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,118
We are a gang. And we're on the run.
And we have to fight to survive.

279
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,354
We have to break rules, we have to
bend laws, we have to improvise.

280
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,268
But not this time, no.

281
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,635
Not this time.

282
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,359
Not for Gaius Baltar.

283
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,750
No. You... you have to die.

284
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,630
You have to die because... Well,
because we don't like you very much.

285
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,473
Because you're arrogant.
Because you're weak.

286
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,676
Because you're a coward.

287
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,594
We wanna throw you out the airlock
because you didn't stand up to the Cylons

288
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,719
and get yourself killed in the process.
That's justice now!

289
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,950
You should've been killed
on New Caprica.

290
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,511
But since you had the temerity to live,
we'll execute you now. That's justice!

291
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,591
<i>(muttering)</i>

292
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,999
<i>(gavel bangs)</i>

293
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,594
Order. Order!

294
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,108
This case...

295
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,350
this case is built on emotion,

296
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,399
on anger, bitterness, vengeance.

297
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,836
But most of all
it is built on shame.

298
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,997
It's about the shame of what we did
to ourselves back on that planet.

299
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,509
And it's about the guilt

300
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,797
of those of us who ran away.

301
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,471
Who ran away.

302
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,471
And we are trying to dump all that guilt
and all that shame onto one man.

303
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:23,032
And then flush him out the airlock
and hope that that just gets rid of it all,

304
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,634
so that we can live with ourselves.

305
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,432
That won't work.

306
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,432
That won't work.
That's not justice.

307
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,511
Not to me.

308
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,749
Not to me.

309
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,590
No further questions.

310
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,753
Your Honours, l wish to reiterate my
strong exception to counsel's testimony.

311
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,876
- <i>(Franks)</i> Exception noted.
- Thank you.

312
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,316
Did you want to cross-examine
the witness?

313
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,597
l have no questions
for defence counsel.

314
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,592
<i>(Franks)</i> Witness is excused.

315
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,240
Do you want to call
any other witnesses?

316
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,108
Your Honours,
l don't wish to belabour this any longer.

317
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,033
The defence rests.

318
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,511
Very well. This court will adjourn
to consider a verdict.

319
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,310
What a glorious moment
in jurisprudence.

320
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,155
You did a great job.

321
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,915
<i>(man)</i> All rise.

322
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,673
Before l read the verdict,
l'd like to make one thing clear.

323
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,198
Like everything human,
justice is imperfect.

324
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,589
It's flawed.

325
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,596
But it's those very imperfections
that separates us from the machines,

326
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,672
and maybe even makes us
a species worth saving.

327
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,315
The defendant will rise.

328
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,991
Gaius Baltar,

329
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,550
after carefully weighing the evidence,
this tribunal,

330
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,598
on a vote of three to two...

331
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,709
finds you not guilty.

332
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,394
<i>(uproar)</i>

333
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,038
You won.

334
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,112
Let's go.

335
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,636
l knew l would be acquitted,
but the fact that l was found innocent

336
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,316
shouldn't disguise in any way
that this trial has been a total pantomime.

337
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,914
Admiral, you've gotta
get him out of here.

338
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,440
Down! Bring him down!

339
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,549
Stand back! Get him out of here!
Get him away!

340
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,633
l knew right from the very start
that if there was a way to demonstrate

341
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,280
the sheer...
What's the word l'm looking for?

342
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,477
Hypocrisy.
"Hypocrisy" is the word l'm looking for.

343
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,835
...hypocrisy of the prosecution's case,

344
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,435
then the judges had no other option
but to find me not guilty.

345
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,195
Your boundless confidence
provided us with great solace throughout.

346
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,397
Look, l wanna thank you both.
Truly.

347
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,679
From the bottom of my heart, l am very,
very grateful for all you've done.

348
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,356
If l could've seen the admiral squirm
a little bit more, it wouldn't have hurt.

349
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,271
Now, you listen.

350
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,349
Don't push it, Doctor.

351
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,877
Fine.

352
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,238
Romo, um...
perhaps we could have a chat.

353
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,075
l've thought about a book tour around
the fleet, and there's the publishing rights.

354
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,072
There are issues about my security -
where l'm gonna live.

355
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:02,190
Since we forged this great relationship
during the trial, l thought who better to...

356
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,193
Actually, now that the fleet's
legal system is in place,

357
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,831
my not-so-inconsiderable talents
are required elsewhere.

358
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,549
So l'm afraid
this is the end of our journey.

359
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,791
What?
Wait a minute, what?

360
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,350
What about me?
Wait a minute. Wait, please.

361
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,908
Think about this for a second.

362
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,997
Where am l going to live? What am l
going to do? How am l going to survive?

363
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,631
Much as l hate to use
a cat metaphor, Doctor...

364
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,472
l think you'll land on your feet.

365
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,993
<i>(chuckles)</i>

366
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,469
Close the door on your way out.

367
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,038
Romo, one thing.

368
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:01,114
When you put me on the stand,
did you know what was gonna happen?

369
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,953
l knew you were an honest man,
Mr Adama, much unlike your grandfather.

370
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,316
Gaius Baltar is innocent.

371
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,718
Just the sound of it
makes my skin crawl.

372
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,310
Not guilty is not the same
as innocent.

373
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,398
It must have been
particularly difficult for you.

374
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,678
What? You just couldn't get
the other two guys to budge?

375
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,557
You voted for his acquittal,
didn't you?

376
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,390
l hate to say it.

377
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,359
Defence made their case.
Prosecution didn't.

378
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,751
Gaius Baltar is a traitor.

379
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,638
We both know that,

380
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,030
regardless of the outcome
of this trial.

381
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,868
No one's asking anyone to forget,

382
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,190
or to forgive.

383
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,229
But we have to look to the future.

384
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,758
- Mr Gaeta.
- Yes, sir?

385
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,274
Commence jump prep.

386
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,148
- We're going to the Ionian Nebula.
- Yes, sir.

387
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,711
Excuse me.

- Very well, Mr Gaeta.

After all this time,

Two wars.

Combat.

No, no, no, no, no.

Not after all this.

Not after the Resistance...
and the occupation.

455
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,079
The power outage
was fleet-wide, Admiral.

456
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,234
It was also simultaneously
restored to all ships.

457
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,392
- Admiral, admiral.
- DRADIS contact.

458

Sir, all fleet ships
were powered down during the outage.

We just don't have 20 minutes.

Action stations.
Set condition one throughout the ship.

<i>l repeat. Action stations. Set condition one</i>
<i>throughout the ship. This is not a drill.</i>
