00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,355
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,269
l was burnt out.

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,316
l started taking... stims.

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,550
- What are these?
- Stims.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,553
And by the look of it,
she's been taking them by the handful.

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,635
Coming in late cos you're hungover is
bad, but when you back out on a mission?

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,915
Unlike you,
l don't take a bunch of pills

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,994
and then climb in my cockpit so wired
that l can't land the frakking ship.

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,872
Starbuck, you're an embarrassment.

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,236
l need you back in the CIC.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,552
It just ain't the same without you in there...
intimidating the inmates.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,710
No, no.

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,190
There are 12 Cylon models. But in the
occupation on New Caprica, l saw seven.

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,590
- Who are the final five?
- l can't talk about that.

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,671
<i>(Baltar)</i> What is it talking about?

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,230
<i>(Number Six)</i> Most Cylons think
the mind of the hybrid has gone mad

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,515
and the vocalisations
are meaningless.

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,034
But not everyone thinks that.

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,795
You'll delete the order from your logs.
Execute.

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,199
<i>(gunshot)</i>

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,838
<i>(gasps)</i>

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,480
It's OK. It's OK.

23
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,117
There is something beautiful...

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,556
miraculous,
between life and death.

25
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,112
There's no food to be salvaged?
What about the good food we had stored

26
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,476
before we started
churning out the contaminated stuff?

27
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,357
The newly processed bad food

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,115
went into the depleted storage system.
Everything's tainted.

29
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,998
<i>(Cottle) Sharon's finding algae</i>
<i>for us to process.</i>

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,913
It's tough to choke down,
but it's almost pure protein.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,313
What if Sharon comes back and reports
there is no clear passage to this planet?

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,790
Then the question is, Doc,
how long can we survive?

33
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,431
With the rations we've been on?
l'd say seven to ten days.

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,796
- <i>(Roslin) When is she due back?</i>
- She was due three hours ago.

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,873
The, uh, radiation levels are high,
but she's strong and...

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,399
she's, uh...

37
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,232
She'll be here any moment.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,719
- No, l'm sorry. l don't have anything.
- To share.

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,837
l told you, Starbuck, l don't have anything.
Get off my back.

40
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,150
- l saw a protein bar.
- l gave it to Cottle.

41
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,151
Right. Right after l gave him head.

42
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,196
- Now l'm a liar?!
- If the shoe fits...

43
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,952
All right, can it!

44
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,474
Kat, get down here.

45
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,033
All right. For frak's sake, everybody eat.
We're getting paranoid over this hunger.

46
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,835
<i>(Kat)</i> Here, baby. Eat this.

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,753
<i>(Starbuck)</i> Oh, my gods, that's good.

48
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,471
<i>(alarm)</i>

49
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,554
<i>(Baltar)</i> Somewhere to be, D'Anna?

50
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,155
<i>(Number Three)</i> Ssh. You'll wake Caprica.

51
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,595
l'd love to hang around with you two
all day, but... l got things to do.

52
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,556
l'll never understand
what you all do all day long,

53
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,837
living on this thing
like fleas on a cat.

54
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,751
Where do you suppose
she takes herself off to, then?

55
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,391
- You're not the only one asking that.
- l'm not?

56
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,357
What do you mean?

57
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,150
- She's been doing things.
- "Doing things"?

58
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,438
What things?

59
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,715
<i>(loud hissing)</i>

60
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,555
<i>(talking drowned out by noise)</i>

61
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,072
<i>(man)</i> Go ahead,
l've got your helmet.

62
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,791
- There you go. Got you.
- <i>(man #2)</i> Easy.

63
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,716
<i>(man)</i> Prepare the starboard side
for wash down.

64
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,749
- All the way down to fifth.
- <i>(man #2)</i> Right through here, Lieutenant.

65
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,354
Radiation negative.

66
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,710
There's a way
through the star cluster.

67
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,558
And l found the planet,
on the other side.

68
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,313
l skimmed it, l took photos.

69
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,949
There's huge swaths of algae,
just like we thought.

70
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,511
- It's black.
- <i>(Apollo)</i> She's a Cylon.

71
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,670
She can handle
a radiation dose that big.

72
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,309
- We think. Someone call Cottle!
- l'm fine.

73
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,678
Maybe you are, but...
a human might not be able to make it.

74
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,197
So then how do we get tens of thousands
of humans through there?

75
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,432
<i>(Sharon)</i> So we can make it through
in two jumps with a stop right there.

76
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,796
- There's no solution with a single jump?
- The cluster's too big.

77
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,518
It's too big to go around, too.

78
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,388
Civvy ships aren't shielded enough
to jump in the middle of that radiation.

79
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,994
l would say 80% of the people
on board would die.

80
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,231
- Can we send <i>Galactica</i> for food?
- And put it where?

81
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,117
- What?
- It'd take dozens of trips.

82
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,318
Each time we'd leave the fleet vulnerable.
We can't bring the food to the people.

83
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,109
What if we bring the people to the food,
put the people on <i>Galactica?</i>

84
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,352
Send the civilian ships with skeleton crew,
give them radiation meds.

85
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,910
Except that the radiation
would fry the civvy ships' nav systems.

86
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,471
They wouldn't be able to see squat. There
wouldn't be a way to calculate a jump out.

87
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,872
It's worse than that. Once you jump in,
the light is so blinding you begin to drift,

88
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,839
and before you can get your bearings...
you're over there.

89
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,196
<i>(Apollo)</i> No visual contact.
Instruments blinded by radiation.

90
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,192
They'd get lost, they'd burn up.

91
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,993
Pilot ship.

92
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,709
We pair a Raptor
with each civilian ship.

93
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,157
Raptor navigation systems are hardened.
They could handle the radiation.

94
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,198
Each Raptor leads a civilian ship
through the cluster,

95
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,350
then they both jump out together.

96
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,519
The question is...
how many jumps will it take?

97
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,951
Five round trips.

98
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,429
You heard. Five round trips.

99
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,988
On our outbound jumps,
we'll each be responsible

100
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,390
for relaying jump coordinates
to our own specific civilian ship,

101
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,756
nailing them to jump points
and ensuring they don't drift off.

102
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,831
Sir, will we get fed
when we get there?

103
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,833
Eventually, yes, but only after
we find the algae and get it processed.

104
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,148
Oh!

105
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,438
But the truth is, nausea from radiation
exposure will take care of our appetites.

106
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,830
You'll all be issued with
radiation badges to track our exposure.

107
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,118
White, like this, you're OK.
As your exposure increases, it'll darken.

108
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,714
If it approaches this,
you'll be pulled from duty.

109
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,156
Keep checking your badges.
It's every pilot's own responsibility

110
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,277
to monitor their own badge.
Starbuck.

111
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,434
Remember, we're all flying solo
on this mission.

112
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,398
So there'll be nobody
to bitch slap you if you get tired

113
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,519
or start seeing toasters on your wing.
We'll be issuing stims, so use them.

114
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,511
Are you crazy?
We can't use stims.

115
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,830
- Problem?
- Stims amp up your metabolism.

116
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,469
We've got nothing to burn.
We'll be flying into the sides of the ships.

117
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,994
- They'd mess us up?
- You used to like stims, Kat.

118
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,196
Personal discretion on the stims.

119
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,636
We're taking the first load of civilians
on board as we speak.

120
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,029
That's it.
Skids up in four hours.

121
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,671
<i>(Dualla)</i> There is no food here. There are
no rations anywhere on this ship.

122
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,718
If someone told you there was food,
they were lying!

123
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,792
If you leave this area,
force will be used.

124
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:30,228
Once we get through the star cluster, you
will be returned to your designated ships.

125
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,237
Sacha!

126
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,594
<i>(man)</i> Keep following.
Down to the front.

127
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,274
My name isn't "Sacha".

128
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,591
My name is Captain Louanne Katraine,
you understand me?

129
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,319
Sacha and you
were a lifetime ago.

130
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,870
Right, right.
Cos you got this now, right?

131
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,760
No more hanging
with the sinners, huh?

132
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,071
Stay away from me.
Do you understand me?

133
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,078
Do they even know
who you really are?

134
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,151
Fancy bumping into you here.
Can you believe l'm lost again?

135
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,199
l can never find my way around this place.
Where have you been?

136
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,239
l've been talking with Simon about our
move toward Earth. There's some debate.

137
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,633
Of course, if l spoke to the relevant Simon
he'd ascertain you were at this meeting?

138
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,796
Beg your pardon?

139
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,356
l hear that you've been
going off by yourself, "doing things".

140
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,839
Really?

141
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,675
Now, who would tell you
anything about <i>my</i> business?

142
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,070
- So it's true?
- Caprica?

143
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,756
Did you know you have
some dried goo in your hair?

144
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,513
That can happen
when you resurrect.

145
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,639
Now l understand what you've been
doing with yourself all these afternoons.

146
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,429
Do you have any idea
what you are accusing me of?

147
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,351
Yes...

148
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,514
Intentionally killing yourself over and over
so you can download over and over.

149
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,478
But death's just
a revolving door, isn't it?

150
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,597
Come here!

151
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,795
Ooh!

152
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,474
What do you want?!

153
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,190
Take it down a notch, baby. Relax.
l'm not looking for a business partner.

154
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,271
l told you to stay the frak
away from me.

155
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,480
Yeah, cos if they find out who you are,
they'll kick you out the service, or worse.

156
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,074
Now, do you think l want that?

157
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,709
l don't want that,
cos if that happens...

158
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,950
who's gonna feed me? <i>(sniggers)</i>

159
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,600
Oh, come on,
you're getting three squares.

160
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,672
We don't.
And l don't have anything stashed, Enzo.

161
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,637
Yeah, sure you don't.

162
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,635
Oh, we go back, baby.

163
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,555
Since when is it a crime to...
take care of your own? Hm?

164
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,555
Remember, l know who you are,
and l know how to make you happy.

165
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,110
Get your hands off of me.

166
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,717
Colonel.

167
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,031
Go ahead.

168
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,518
- <i>(man)</i> Welcome back, sir.
- <i>(woman)</i> Good to see you, sir.

169
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,397
<i>(man #2)</i> Colonel's back on board.

170
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,439
- <i>(man #3)</i> Welcome, sir.
- <i>(man #4)</i> It's good to see you, sir.

171
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,437
- <i>(man #5)</i> We're with you, sir.
- <i>(man #6)</i> Welcome back.

172
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,910
Enough!
Don't you people have jobs to do?

173
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,038
- Welcome back, Colonel.
- Admiral.

174
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,275
Apollo, <i>Galactica.</i>
Launch Raptors on your orders.

175
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,796
<i>(Apollo) Shepherds, find your sheep.</i>
<i>Stay close. Never let them go.</i>

176
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,677
<i>These crews are counting on us.</i>

177
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,991
- <i>Apollo, Starbuck on station.</i>
- <i>(Kat) l got visual on "Chiron".</i>

178
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,719
<i>(Apollo) Hotdog.</i>
<i>"Adriatic" in sight. OK.</i>

179
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,360
When you jump in,
you'll be disoriented.

180
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,237
<i>Take it one step at a time.</i>

181
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,711
<i>Find your sheep, work the jump</i>
<i>calculations and get them out.</i>

182
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,032
<i>Remember, we do not stay</i>
<i>beyond our radiation-dose limit.</i>

183
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,793
<i>(Hoshi)</i> Apollo reports
pilots in position, sir.

184
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,236
Initiate jump on his command.
<i>Galactica</i> will follow.

185
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,470
<i>(man)</i> Aye aye, sir.

186
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,389
Raptors, Apollo.
We jump on my mark.

187
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,550
- <i>Three, two...</i>
- Jumping...

188
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,631
<i>... one. Mark.</i>

189
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,599
Whoa!

190
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,319
What is this?
l can't see anything.

191
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,672
Frak!

192
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,032
Oh!

193
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,714
Ah! Got you!

194
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,473
- Kat, you got yours?
- <i>Affirmative, Apollo.</i>

195
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,996
Only got eyes for the <i>Chiron.</i>
Relaying coordinates.

196
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,913
Squadron, Apollo.
l have <i>Thera Sita.</i>

197
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,595
<i>Relaying jump coordinates</i>
<i>to her right now.</i>

198
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,037
Apollo, Starbuck. l got mine.
Frak. l'm just barely holding on here.

199
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,318
l lost mine! Has anyone seen <i>Adriatic?</i>
She has lost her jump coordinates.

200
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,358
<i>(Helo) Hotdog, negative!</i>
<i>Negative on Adriatic.</i>

201
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,034
Hotdog, ease off
on the control, man!

202
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,190
Ease up with the stick.
It's a Raptor.

203
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,191
Frak it, frak it!

204
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,350
Apollo, it's <i>Galactica</i> actual.

205
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,035
<i>You've reached your radiation-dose limit.</i>
<i>You've got to jump.</i>

206
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,236
- Count us down.
- <i>(Apollo) Roger that.</i>

207
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,675
No! Hold on!
Apollo, please wait.

208
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,876
<i>Hotdog, listen!</i>
<i>We have to get out of here!</i>

209
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,635
l can find them!
l can find them! Hold on!

210
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,439
- Please wait!
- <i>(Apollo) Jump on my mark!</i>

211
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,670
- <i>Please, wait!</i>
- <i>(Apollo) One, two...</i>

212
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,955
- No! Please! Wait!
- <i>Mark!</i>

213
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,237
<i>(Hotdog)</i>
<i>We can't leave without them!</i>

214
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,594
Frak! Frak!

215
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,309
Jump complete.

216
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,075
DRADIS is back online.
Ship reports moderate hull damage.

217
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,833
<i>"Galactica", Apollo.</i>
<i>First trip complete.</i>

218
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,718
Raptors, land your birds
and prepare to jump back

219
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,189
for the second group of civilians.

220
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,392
We lost the <i>Adriatic.</i>

221
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,870
- It's only our first jump.
- Yes, it is.

222
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,631
<i>(alarm)</i>

223
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,239
<i>Carina,</i> Kat!
Report your location!

224
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,430
Kat, Apollo.
Do you have the <i>Carina?</i>

225
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,513
Negative!
Radiation's pissing on my nav.

226
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,591
l can't see jack!

227
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,278
OK. l found her.

228
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,913
- No! Frak!
- <i>(Apollo) Kat! Kat, report!</i>

229
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,752
Godsdammit!

230
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,116
<i>(Apollo) All right, Kat!</i>
<i>Time's up. We're jumping on my mark!</i>

231
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,795
- <i>Three, two, one... Mark!</i>
- Godsdammit! The <i>Carina!</i>

232
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,348
l lost...

233
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,431
l lost her.

234
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,515
<i>(Apollo)</i> All right. We managed
to get another eight ships through,

235
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,194
but we still lost one.

236
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,437
We gotta get better
at tracking our sheep.

237
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,714
Quicker reaction times
out of the jumps.

238
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,356
Racetrack, don't be calling out
coordinates to the wrong ship.

239
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,635
l got mixed up.

240
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,473
Keep checking your instruments,
and recheck them.

241
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,028
The instruments are crap.

242
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,550
All right.

243
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,676
That concludes Outbound Four.

244
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,353
This is Return Four.

245
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,954
One to go.

246
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,270
All right, get some rest.

247
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,831
Come on.

248
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,714
Here's the report from the doc.

249
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,680
A hundred marines too weak to work.
Two hundred more are ready to drop.

250
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,911
That's gonna
slow down the harvest.

251
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,673
Last batch of passengers
kicked up some trouble.

252
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,194
You... you get these people
to the other side

253
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,034
and they think there's a diner and a chef
waiting to take their order.

254
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,554
l know.

255
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,394
When they gonna learn they gotta
process the thing first, for frak's sake?

256
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,597
Try telling that
to a bunch of empty stomachs.

257
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,195
l hear they're still eating paper.
Is that true?

258
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,158
No... Paper shortage.

259
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,115
Not a good sign.

260
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,271
No, sir.

261
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,551
So, while you resurrect
do you see the faces of the final five?

262
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,870
The ones that no one's seen.

263
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,032
What do you want
to know about them?

264
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,350
l could be a Cylon.

265
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,910
l would stop being a traitor
to one set of people...

266
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,639
and be a hero to another.

267
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,309
l'd have a place to belong.

268
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,553
You would help me
understand my destiny.

269
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,032
- Have you seen my face?
- Your face?

270
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,157
Yes, my face.

271
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,674
Can't remember.

272
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,312
l've been trying to get it all down on paper
while it's still fresh in my mind,

273
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,868
but nothing much comes out.

274
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,229
It's rubbish. l can't remember.

275
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,835
Cylons, humans...

276
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,115
We're all just trying to discover...

277
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,953
who we are.

278
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,031
Aren't we?

279
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,720
Hey, Enzo.

280
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,472
Yeah.

281
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,079
l took the name Louanne Katraine
from a girl who died

282
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,197
two days before
the attack on Caprica.

283
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,148
It got me through
the background checks.

284
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,312
Yeah, times were rough.
Keep going.

285
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,274
l was a drug runner.

286
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,874
Enzo was my supplier.

287
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,116
What do you want? We were truckers,
OK? We just moved stuff.

288
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,634
People?

289
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,431
You see, some think that that's the way
that the Cylons infiltrated Caprica.

290
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,318
They seeded themselves in the colonies,
then used criminals

291
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,551
to get them into the capital.

292
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,355
Anyone who's found guilty of helping
the Cylons is considered a traitor.

293
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,476
- We didn't carry Cylons.
- How do you know?

294
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:14,032
- Cos nobody knew they looked like us.
- Then how do you know you didn't?!

295
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,233
- How do you know?
- You think l'm a traitor?

296
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,629
You think l'm a traitor?

297
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,759
No.

298
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,028
l don't think you're a traitor.

299
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,715
You're a "smart young woman".

300
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,758
That's what the old man said.

301
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,628
You're just not smart enough
to accept who you are.

302
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,470
You see, you lied your way
into the company of good people.

303
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,949
Starbuck, don't tell the admiral.

304
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,396
Please... Please don't, or I...

305
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,357
Or what?

306
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,069
Starbuck, please.
Just let me tell him myself.

307
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,310
Please just let me.

308
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,751
Can you do that?

309
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,037

l don't think
anything it says is nonsense.

332
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,192
"The husband of the eye."

333
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,350
"The eye of the..."

334
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,237
Hera.

335
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,757
Hera is sometimes referred to
as "cow-eyed Hera".

336
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,518
- And the husband of Hera...
- Is Jupiter.

337
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,878
The Eye of Jupiter.
That's written about in the ancient texts.

338
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,476
Oh, gods.

339
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,190
Could there be a connection
between their gods and ours?

340
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,113
What does it mean?

341
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,589
It's a location.

342
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,959
A planet hidden in the shadow of light -
probably a cluster of stars.

343
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,600
That will lead us
to the Eye of Jupiter.

344
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,272
And to the hand...

345
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,432
"hidden in the shadow of light".

346
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,398
It's probably
some type of artefact.

347
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,791
A hand.

348
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,231
As in five.

349
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,831
Five faces.

350
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,996
Now all we have to do
is find the right planet...

351
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,477
the right star cluster.

352
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,509
Accept who you are.

353
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,510
<i>Accept who you are.</i>

354
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,037
Yeah.

355
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,190
Remember me?

356
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,669
Yeah.

357
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,354
Yeah, l remember you.

358
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,795
Thieving bastard.

359
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,031
You'll ruin everything l've got.

360
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,111
Come here.

361
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,438
<i>Faru Sadin,</i> report your location.

362
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,909
Kat! You got <i>Faru Sadin?</i>

363
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,598
<i>Kat, have you got "Faru Sadin"? Kat?</i>

364
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,199
<i>Kat, report.</i>

365
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,198
Negative.

366
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,430
Kat.

367
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,080
Frak! l've lost the <i>Faru Sadin.</i>

368
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,312
Sir. Escalating damage reports,
ship-wide.

369
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,392
Engineers are reporting
a cascade of pressure failures.

370
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,552
Jump spot's become unstable.
We gotta get out of here.

371
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,949
- Open line.
- <i>(Hoshi)</i> Aye, sir.

372
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,593
Channel open.

373
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,955
Apollo, <i>Galactica</i> actual.

374
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,314
Jump all.

375
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,277
<i>Repeat, jump all.</i>

376
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,069
All right, admiral's calling it.
Everyone, jump on my mark.

377
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,159
- l'm not losing another one.
- Three, two, one... Mark!

378
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,351
Apollo, Starbuck.
l don't see Kat.

379
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,871
Report.

380
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,272
We're missing <i>Faru Sadin</i>
and one Raptor.

381
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,956
It's Kat. She must have missed the order.
She's still out there.

382
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,632
Damn.

383
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,550
<i>Faru Sadin,</i> this is Kat.
Report your location.

384
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,115
Frak!

385
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,917
<i>(Tigh)</i> Come on, kid.
Come on home.

386
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,669
<i>(Hoshi)</i> It's them!

387
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,638
She brought 'em home!

388
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,670
<i>Galactica,</i> Kat.

389
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,751
Mission accomplished.

390
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,232
- They said you wanted to see me.
- <i>(weakly)</i> Yeah.

391
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,234
l don't think we should end
the way we ended.

392
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,197
Listen, um...

393
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,396
everybody is...

394
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,879
Everybody is stuck...
with the things that they're not proud of.

395
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,992
And that, uh...
that thing about "good people", I, uh...

396
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,070
l didn't mean that.

397
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,516
Yeah, l know.

398
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,955
Here.

399
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,713
Take these. Sleeping pills.

400
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,557
Enough.

401
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,270
So, uh... take them if you want.

402
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,390
Thank you.

403
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,390
l got to go.

404
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,391
Admiral, I...

405
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,755
l know. l'm... l'm sorry.

406
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,668
l'm not here to lecture.

407
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,315
l'm letting you know
about a promotion.

408
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,868
l'm making you CAG again.

409
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,909
Sir, you know
l'm not getting out of here, right?

410
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,275
But you earned it.

411
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,158
What you did
was harder than facing a bullet,

412
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,394
and you did it without
putting one other soul in harm's way.

413
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,715
l don't know
if l could've done that.

414
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,430
l wish there was
something more l could give.

415
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,590
No.

416
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,591
It's good.

417
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,152
l would like to be CAG very much.

418
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,390
Thank you.

419
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,908
Listen... There's a...

420
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,670
There's a thing...

421
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,836
a reason why
you might not want to do this.

422
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,469
Kara knows what it is...

423
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,914
but l wanted to tell you myself.

424
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,357
l don't need to know anything
other than what l already know.

425
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,318
When you were CAG,

426
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,550
you protected your people,

427
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,518
made them feel safe enough
to be brave.

428
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,630
What you were gonna say
doesn't change that.

429
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,072
Are you... staying?

430
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,755
Oh, l'm staying.

431
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,794
l love this sickbay, in a way.

432
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,197
It reminds me of
where my son Zak was born.

433
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,478
Carolanne was so happy.

434
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,429
She was convinced,

435
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,956
both times,
that she was having a girl.

436
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,596
So it was a surprise at the end.

437
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,319
Did you want a girl, too?

438
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,031
Yeah.

439
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,509
Three's a good round number.

440
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,433
l need your verdict on this one.
What if?

441
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,999
- l hate it.
- Ah.
