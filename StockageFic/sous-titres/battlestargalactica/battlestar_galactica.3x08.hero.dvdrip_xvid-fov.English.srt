<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>

2
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,919
You cannot play God then wash your
hands of the things that you've created.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,672
Sooner or later,

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,276
the day comes when you can't hide from
the things that you've done any more.

5
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,112
Attention, all Colonial units.
Cylon attack underway.

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,636
- <i>This is no drill.</i>
- l'll be right there.

7
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,429
"How", "why" doesn't really matter now.

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,719
What does matter is that,
as of this moment, we are at war.

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,992
You're full of bile, hatred... poison.

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,437
And l'm sorry for what happened to you
down there, but l've gotta run a ship.

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,913
The last thing l need is a one-eyed drunk
sowing discontent and disobedience.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,070
You can get your ass
back to your quarters

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,836
and not leave till you're ready to act like
the man l've known for the past 30 years.

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,673
That man doesn't exist any more, Bill.

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,990
You won't be seeing me again.

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,070
<i>(heartbeat/heavy breathing)</i>

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,836
Is there really any place left
in the universe

18
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,151
deserving of such a rare
and distinguished item?

19
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,199
l was thinking of putting it
in the bathroom right over the toilet.

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,510
Excellent choice.

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,830
<i>(gasps)</i> Oh, my gods.

22
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,638
Oh, Tory, come look at this. This is
the dossier that Billy prepared for me

23
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,234
my first day aboard <i>Galactica.</i>

24
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,994
l can't believe l was about
to throw this out in the trash.

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,070
<i>(Tory)</i> The <i>Valkyrie.</i> This was Adama's
command before <i>Galactica?</i>

26
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,594
- Mm-hm.
- Look at that.

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,232
This year marks Admiral Adama's
45th anniversary in the Colonial fleet.

28
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,350
In fact, his commissioning date's
only a few days from now.

29
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,871
Here.

30
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,349
l think l want to have a ceremony.

31
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,035
Let's give the admiral a medal...

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,069
- for 45 years of devoted service.
- Couldn't have come at a better time.

33
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,233
Give the people something
to feel good about for a change.

34
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,471
<i>(alarm)</i>

35
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,274
<i>(Helo)</i>
<i>Set condition one throughout the ship.</i>

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,592
l repeat, set condition one
throughout the ship. This is not a drill.

37
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,557
- What's the problem?
- Three Raiders.

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,359
CBDR, bearing 145, carom 33.

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,876
- This isn't standard wedge formation.
- Where's the CAP?

40
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,954
Starbuck and Kat intercept in 98 seconds.
Looks like a pursuit. Weapons exchanged.

41
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,349
- Pursuit?
- Yes, sir.

42
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,318
We've got two Raiders... chasing a third.

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,714
- Have they fired on any of ours yet?
- No, sir.

44
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,394
What the hell are they doing?

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,157
Let's see if we can climb up their asses
without drawing fire.

46
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,310
They seem preoccupied
with the other one.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,994
Any idea why Cylons
would be chasing Cylons?

48
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,559
Don't know, don't care.

49
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,996
Wait till we close. l don't wanna
chase them longer than l have to.

50
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,149
Yeah, roger that.

51
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,073
- <i>(Kat) Two down, one to go!</i>
- <i>(Starbuck) Kat, check six.</i>

52
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,357
<i>Damn. Kat, flank right.</i>
<i>This guy's heading for "Galactica".</i>

53
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,509
<i>l'm on it, Starbuck!</i>

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,512
<i>(man) Krypter! Krypter! Krypter!</i>

55
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,309
<i>This is Bulldog.</i>
<i>Get me the hell out of here. l'm wounded.</i>

56
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,315
<i>- (Starbuck) Who the frak is that?</i>
<i>- (Kat) Target in range. Closing in.</i>

57
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,472
- <i>This is Bulldog.</i>
- <i>(Kelly)</i> Audio lock-on enabled.

58
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,473
- Where is that coming from?
- It's the Raider, sir.

59
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,439
- <i>(Starbuck) Take the frakking shot, Kat.</i>
- <i>(Kat) Give me one sec.</i>

60
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,593
<i>Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.</i>

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,717
<i>(Starbuck) Kat, take the frakking shot!</i>

62
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,237
Order the Vipers
to hold their fire immediately.

63
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,436
Have them escort the Raider in.

64
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,313
Prisoner drill. l want the alert guard
in the hangar deck in five minutes.

65
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,391
Yes, sir.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,551
Park that bird. Let's grab this Raider.
Let's go, people. Move with a purpose.

67
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,995
Make some room for the marines.

68
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,957
Is it really you, sir?

69
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,277
Yeah.

70
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,794
It's me.

71
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,838
Welcome home, Bulldog.

72
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,957
We may never have
this opportunity again.

73
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,997
l'm assuming you appreciate
the consequences if you're discovered.

74
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,070
And you understand, Commander,
that this conversation did not happen.

75
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,355
Are you prepared for this?

76
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,834
Of course, sir.

77
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,790
On one condition - l need my men,
especially for the stealth ship.

78
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,395
- There's only one pilot l trust.
- Who?

79
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,196
Well, the conspiracy theorists
are gonna be disappointed.

80
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,718
l checked your DNA signature against
your military records and it's conclusive.

81
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,791
You're not a Cylon.

82
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,476
Smoke?

83
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,836
That's right. He's one of mine.

84
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,390
<i>Disappeared about three years ago.</i>
<i>We think that he was captured.</i>

85
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,756
- l'd like to meet him.
- <i>Of course. l'll arrange it.</i>

86
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,676
He checks out fine.

87
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,676
Whatever they did to him out there,
they kept him fed and relatively healthy.

88
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,751
Physically, anyway.

89
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,080
l know you've been through a lot.

90
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,594
l realise that.

91
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,478
But you've got to talk to me, Danny.

92
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,915
How the hell did you escape
off a Cylon baseship?

93
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,079
Well, sir. It's like this...

94
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,874
The enemy had me
locked in a cell for three years.

95
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,272
The accommodations were lousy,
the service was slow,

96
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,797
and, after a while, l felt the institution
no longer had anything to offer me.

97
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,758
So l left.

98
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,954
You had me worried there for a moment.

99
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,477
l thought maybe the Cylons had beaten
the bullshit attitude out of you.

100
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,555
How did you get out?

101
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,468
l thought l was gonna die in there, Bill.

102
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,436
But a while ago,
they all started getting sick.

103
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,988
l <i>mean... really</i> sick.

104
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,752
- You mean a virus?
- Yeah.

105
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,831
We've seen that too.

106
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,435
l heard them say it was spreading,
getting worse.

107
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,794
But eventually l realise...

108
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,590
l'm not catching it.

109
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,269
- l'm immune.
- So what did you do?

110
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,271
l was smart... patient. l waited.

111
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,396
<i>(metallic clanging)</i>

112
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,596
<i>(Number Three)</i> Well, well.

113
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,591
You're looking good.

114
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,111
<i>Strong. (chuckles)</i>

115
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,350
Me, l've felt better.

116
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,319
l don't know why you guys
do all that exercising.

117
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,710
What, are you trying
to stave off getting old?

118
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,671
Doesn't seem such a tragedy to me,

119
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,228
given the alternatives.

120
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,390
<i>(bars clang)</i>

121
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,471
Know what l'm saying?

122
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,111
Do l look that bad?

123
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,036
You know what l think?

124
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,680
l think you're afraid.

125
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,159
<i>(bars clang)</i>

126
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,990
Argh!

127
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,674
Let me try and understand exactly what
happened. l'm just gonna go back a little.

128
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,833
About a year prior
to the Cylon attack on the Colonies,

129
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,038
you were on a mission
with Admiral Adama. Is that correct?

130
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,074
It was a... a black ops mission.

131
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,719
You remember the Tauron Colonists
were such outlaws,

132
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,793
always... pushing their luck
with the admiralty every chance they got?

133
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,393
<i>(Roslin)</i> Right.

134
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,598
The Taurons were drilling for tylium ore

135
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,309
on a moon that was too close
to the Cylon armistice line.

136
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,435
We knew that they had to get out of there
or risk provoking the Cylons.

137
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,955
l'm sorry, but how did this result
in his ship being shot down?

138
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,670
He was my recon pilot.
He was there to gather evidence.

139
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,230
The Taurons must've seen us coming
because they ambushed him.

140
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,438
Lieutenant Novacek was shot down
by the Taurons in cold blood.

141
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,192
<i>(Bulldog) Krypter!</i>
<i>l've got damage to the port engine.</i>

142
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,989
<i>Bird is down.</i>
<i>Repeat, bird is down. Request rescue!</i>

143
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,640
<i>Krypter! Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.</i>

144
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,315
<i>Bird is down.</i>
<i>Repeat, bird is down. Request rescue!</i>

145
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,434
So what did you do?

146
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,511
l made a bad call.

147
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,112
His ship was gone.
No ejection on DRADIS, no distress call.

148
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,990
He was dead.

149
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,070
So l left.

150
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,350
But the lieutenant did eject, obviously,

151
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,276
and somehow survived in his ejection seat
long enough for the Cylons to find him.

152
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,078
Wow.

153
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,120
Could you both give us a moment?
Thank you, Tory.

154
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,509
And thank you very much, Lieutenant.

155
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,192
Madam President.

156
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,912
Why don't we check the fleet registry, see
if any of your family might have survived?

157
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,832
So are you gonna tell me
what really happened?

158
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,480
You're gonna have to trust me
on this one, OK?

159
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,630
It's my mess.

160
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,551
l'll fix it.

161
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,151
This is the last one.

162
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,669
Fire.

163
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,310
<i>(Tigh)</i> l see it.

164
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,791
l see it.

165
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,514
- l see it.
- <i>(door opens)</i>

166
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,034
l see it.

167
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,592
Daniel Novacek just escaped
from a POW cell on a Cylon baseship.

168
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,672
Stole a Raider, flew it here.

169
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,830
l just finished debriefing him.

170
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,195
- Bulldog's alive?
- Yeah.

171
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,270
My gods.

172
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,874
How could he be alive?

173
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,872
That tough son of a bitch.
He actually made it, didn't he?

174
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,190
Yeah, l guess he did.

175
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,796
So, are you here to talk to your friend
or to your XO?

176
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,316
Last time l checked, l was neither.

177
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,314
Oh, l get it.

178
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,311
Oh, yeah.

179
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,872
This is gonna be a little complicated
for you, isn't it, Admiral?

180
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,270
- Are you gonna tell him what you did?
- l did what l had to do.

181
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,351
So tell him.

182
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,074
It won't make any difference.
The past is the past.

183
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,789
- You're equivocating.
- l don't know why the frak l came here.

184
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,510
Tell him. He's gonna find out...
sooner or later.

185
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,555
l see it.

186
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,792
<i>(banging on door)</i>

187
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,632
Go away.

188
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,631
<i>(banging on door)</i>

189
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,669
Godsdamn son of a bitch.

190
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,998
l can't believe it. It's really you.

191
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,471
Danny Novacek. l heard you'd made it.
Good for you, Bulldog.

192
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,077
Saul.

193
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,070
- Drink?
- You have no idea.

194
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,991
Yes, l do.

195
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,554
Dad?

196
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,998
- Hey, l just got your message.
- Thank you for coming. Sit down.

197
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,196
It's time for us to talk.

198
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,556
Let me ask you something.
How often do you get out of here?

199
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,949
All the time.

200
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,639
Been a little under the weather,
that's all.

201
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,838
How did you wind up on this old bucket,
anyway? What happened to the <i>Valkyrie?</i>

202
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,832
Well, let's just say...

203
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,152
that last mission wasn't exactly a boon
to the old man's career.

204
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,073
<i>Galactica</i> was his graceful retirement.

205
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,553
Heard you and the old man
haven't spoken in a while.

206
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,553
What's wrong? He won't cover your ass
day and night like he used to?

207
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,394
Oh, no.
He still does his share of ass covering.

208
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,631
Problem is, it's his main function now.

209
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,748
Of course, considering how you wound up
getting captured in the first place,

210
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,470
l guess you found that out the hard way
yourself, didn't you?

211
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,915
What's that supposed to mean?

212
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,235
My gods.

213
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,550
He didn't tell you, did he?

214
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,594
- Did he?
- Tell me what?

215
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,871
That son of a bitch.

216
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,233
l shot him down.

217
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,512
Well, uh, if you shot him down, you had
your reasons. You were following orders.

218
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,194
Preventing something worse, right?

219
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,191
No.

220
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,510
l shot him down to avoid...

221
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,431
detection.

222
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,753
Protect the mission... so it wouldn't be
discovered by the Cylons.

223
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,356
It was a black ops mission.

224
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:09,152
Its sole purpose was to ascertain
the likelihood of a Cylon strike.

225
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,191
Cy-Cylon strike?

226
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,830
So, you're saying that...

227
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,152
that we knew they were out there?

228
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,119
That they could launch
an attack on the Colonies?

229
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,668
We didn't know anything for sure.

230
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,274
There were theories in some circles

231
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,115
that the reason that the Cylons
had stayed dormant for so long

232
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,079
was because they were building
a war machine,

233
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,276
preparing a strike.

234
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,633
But l thought... l thought no one had seen
or heard from the Cylons in over 40 years.

235
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,359
That's true... partially.

236
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,193
The admiralty had grown restless
with the Adar administration.

237
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,599
<i>They felt we were resting on our laurels,</i>
<i>unprepared to protect against an attack.</i>

238
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,913
My mission was to escort a stealth
recon ship just beyond the armistice line.

239
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,434
Stick our nose over, gather evidence,

240
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,957
and... see if there was
any suspicious activities.

241
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,750
And if the Cylons discovered you
across the line,

242
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,718
breaching the armistice,
then they would see that as...

243
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,870
An act of war.

244
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,915
<i>(man) Stealth-Star, Valkyrie.</i> We register
you on DRADIS past the armistice line.

245
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,275
<i>You're on full alert. Proceed with caution.</i>

246
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,828
<i>Valkyrie,</i> Bulldog.

247
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,195
l'm exactly two clicks past the line.

248
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,796
Repeat, two clicks.
And l've got negative DRADIS contact.

249
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,273
Sir, there's nothing here, sir.
Which is fine by me.

250
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,115
Company wants to pay me for a joyride,
they came to the right driver.

251
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,349
Hell of a moon.

252
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,908
<i>(man)</i> DRADIS contact.
Unknown vessel jumped in.

253
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,192
Frak!

254
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,598
Krypter! Krypter!
l've got damage to the port engine.

255
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,309
Bird is down.
Repeat, bird is down. Request rescue!

256
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,473
- <i>Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.</i>
- <i>(man)</i> Vessel just jumped out, sir.

257
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,313
<i>Bird is down. Request rescue!</i>

258
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,598
<i>Krypter! Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.</i>
<i>Bird is down. Repeat, bird is down.</i>

259
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:43,118
<i>(man)</i> Two more DRADIS contacts. Sir,
please instruct. What are your orders, sir?

260
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,079
- Sir, what are your orders?
- <i>(Tigh)</i> Don't do this.

261
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,993
Think about it, Bill.
You don't wanna do this.

262
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,676
Do you want his ship discovered?
Do you know where we are?

263
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,630
Do you have any idea
what this could mean?

264
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,795
<i>(man)</i> Bogeys on intercept course. Will
merge with <i>Stealth-Star</i> in 20 seconds.

265
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,348
- Sir!
- Weapons.

266
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,711
Launch ship-to-ship missile... now.

267
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,716
<i>(alarm)</i>

268
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,433
- <i>(console beeps rapidly)</i>
- No!

269
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,035
- There is no way.
- It's true. And you know it's true.

270
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,192
You've known it every second
of every day since it happened.

271
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,400
The sooner you admit it, the sooner you
get that haunted look out of your eyes.

272
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,869
Listen to me.

273
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,509
Sometimes surviving
can be its own death sentence.

274
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,953
l know that.

275
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,430
So the attack on Novacek's ship,
the one that winged him,

276
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,355
and the two DRADIS contacts that were
following him, they weren't Taurons.

277
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,749
Those were the Cylons.

278
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,829
All those years l told myself
that l didn't know what they were.

279
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,469
l was just lying to myself,

280
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,358
pretending that it couldn't be true.

281
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,031
It is true.

282
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,711
l started it...

283
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,911
initiated it.

284
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,197
Wait a minute. Started what?

285
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,876
- Started what?
- The attacks on the Colonies.

286
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,836
By crossing the line,

287
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:19,359
l showed them that we were
the warmongers they figured us to be.

288
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,871
And I...

289
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,875
l left them but one choice.

290
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,792
To attack us...
before we attacked them.

291
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,838
No. No.

292
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,912
Because it wasn't just you.

293
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,676
They put you there. They put you there,
across the line. You had no choice.

294
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,309
That was the admiralty.
That was the... that was the military.

295
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,710
You were one mission.
You were one man.

296
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,591
One man.

297
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,071
It only takes one.

298
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,077
- <i>(Number Six)</i> You all right?
- Yeah, of course.

299
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,229
- More nightmares?
- Dreams.

300
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,598
Something different this time, though.

301
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,795
l think God's trying to tell me something.

302
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,394
- It's about Gaius, isn't it?
- No.

303
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,759
It's not.

304
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,711
It's about something
much bigger than that.

305
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,915
After you execute this command,

306
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,117
you'll delete the order from your logs,

307
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,113
then overwrite
the corresponding memory locations.

308
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,830
Execute.

309
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,592
<i>(gunshot)</i>

310
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,915
It's OK. It's OK.
Relax. Try to breathe through it.

311
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,553
- Breathe.
- <i>(gasps)</i>

312
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,997
<i>(whispers)</i> There's something beautiful -

313
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,513
miraculous - between life and death.

314
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,989
Huh.

315
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,832
That's weird.

316
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,794
Why the hell do they keep missing?

317
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,751
Frak.

318
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,631
<i>(phone buzzes)</i>

319
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,717
- Adama.
- <i>(Dualla) A call from Lieutenant Novacek.</i>

320
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,392
- Put him through.
- <i>Bill.</i>

321
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,199
- Yes?
- <i>This is Danny. We need to talk.</i>

322
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,475
- Hold on.
- <i>l need to see you right now.</i>

323
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,710
Hold on, l'll be right there.

324
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,749
The Cylons are saddled up on him.

325
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,515
They've got a perfect
point-blank, no-deflection shot.

326
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,478
- They had him dead to rights.
- l'd say so.

327
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,348
Look, Novacek was hit and smoking,
flying straight and level.

328
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,271
Any nugget could've made that kill.

329
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,990
The Cylons could've wasted him
any number of times, and they didn't.

330
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,435
They didn't. They let him escape.

331
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,549
Cylons don't do anything by accident.

332
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,632
Yeah, that's what l was thinking, too.

333
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,554
Did Novacek say how he was able
to overcome the Cylons that held him?

334
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,393
They were sick, had a virus.

335
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,796
How many viruses
do the Cylons have, sir?

336
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,032
Who knows? Maybe it was the same virus
those Cylons we found were suffering...

337
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,680
Yeah, or maybe they just told us
a story we'd buy.

338
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,558
Something that was credible, familiar.

339
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,750
<i>Novacek was held prisoner</i>
<i>on a baseship for three years,</i>

340
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,434
<i>escapes,</i>
<i>and then conveniently finds our fleet,</i>

341
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,557
<i>with no agenda and no reason to be here.</i>

342
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,238
Hey, Dan.

343
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,438
It's funny how
all the training comes back, huh?

344
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,956
Why did you lie to me, Bill?

345
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,237
All those years...

346
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,149
You know what l kept telling myself?

347
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,550
What stupid frakked-up dream
l held on to?

348
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,156
l kept thinking,
"Just hang in there, Bulldog."

349
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,199
"Bill Adama's coming. He won't leave you
to rot in here, not him."

350
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,556
"He won't leave a man behind.
Just hold on."

351
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,632
But you weren't coming.
You didn't think l was alive.

352
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,109
You weren't even hoping
l was alive!

353
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,913
And if l hadn't figured a way to escape,
if l didn't make my move

354
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,356
when l saw they'd left that door
wide open for me,

355
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,228
l'd be as good as dead right now!

356
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,636
Is that what they did?

357
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,757
Did they leave the door open?
Did they let you escape?

358
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,391
<i>(Bulldog) That's not what l meant.</i>
<i>l know the truth!</i>

359
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,316
l beat them. Do you understand?
l beat them at their own game.

360
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,517
l frakkin' killed her, and l escaped.

361
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,034
You trying to take that away from me?

362
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,475
Bulldog! <i>(cocks gun)</i>

363
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,517
Stay down!

364
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,909
- Are you all right, Bill?
- Yeah, l'm OK.

365
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,718
You don't wanna believe it, do you?
l know. The truth hurts, Bulldog.

366
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,110
But it's better to know the truth
than to live a lie.

367
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,112
We're all soldiers, Danny.
We're all expendable.

368
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,760
And we did what we had to do
to protect the mission.

369
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:52,198
It's ugly, but there it is. The Cylons
let you go. The question is, why?

370
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,350
Ask yourself that, Danny.

371
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,433
Because up until a minute ago, you were
doing exactly what they wanted you to:

372
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,956
come here and learn the truth,
and seek revenge.

373
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,556
And that's exactly what you did.
You almost gave them what they wanted.

374
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:20,552
Tell you a dirty little secret - the toughest
part of getting played is losing dignity...

375
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,755
feeling like you are not worth
the oxygen you are sucking down.

376
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,228
You get used to it.

377
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,993
You start to believe it.

378
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,993
You start to love it.
It's like a bottle that never runs dry.

379
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:42,074
You can keep reaching for it
over and over and over again.

380
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,751
So, how do you put that bottle away,
Saul?

381
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,237
l don't know.

382
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,752
One day, you just decide to...

383
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,273
get up and walk out of your room.

384
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,630
<i>(Roslin)</i> What is this?

385
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,872
Your resignation.
You've got to be kidding me.

386
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:31,320
l've said before,
we can't hide from the things we've done.

387
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,631
l see no other way around this situation.

388
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,395
- Maybe it's time, Laura.
- Sit down, Bill.

389
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,668
l think you're being naive.

390
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,671
Naive?

391
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,911
Did it ever occur to you
that the admiralty may have set you up

392
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,195
to provoke a war they wanted?

393
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,640
It's naive to think horrible things we can't
understand have simple explanations.

394
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,431
Because simple explanations make us
feel like we have control when we don't.

395
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:17,437
We know why the Cylons attacked us
and it wasn't any one thing. Oh, my gods.

396
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,038
We did a thousand things,
good and bad, every day for 40 years,

397
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,714
to pave the way for those attacks.

398
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,910
Something has to be done.

399
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,111
You know what that is?

400
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,910
Medal of Distinction.

401
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:58,234
This is before l heard about
this resignation of yours. So, hm...

402
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,471
l'd like to propose this:

403
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,999
you seem hellbent on paying penance
for whatever it is you think you've done,

404
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,197
so instead of resigning,
why don't you walk out of here,

405
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,511
meet me on the port hangar deck
tomorrow for this ceremony,

406
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,910
and let me pin
a frakkin' medal to your chest?

407
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,231
- l can't.
- It's not for you.

408
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,232
It's for them.

409
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,155
Stand up there, acknowledge your fleet,
and give them what they need -

410
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,196
a hero.

411
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,910
That'll be your penance,

412
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,991
even if it kills you.

413
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,028
On behalf of everyone here, it is my
pleasure to present you, Admiral Adama,

414
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,752
with the Medal of Distinction for 45 years'
courageous service to the Colonial fleet.

415
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,149
Congratulations.

416
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,629
<i>(man)</i> All right, sir!

417
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,997
Have Dr Stoffa call me
as soon as you arrive.

418
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,674
And, Bulldog, you're gonna be fine.

419
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,719
Just remember
it'll take some time, all right?

420
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,791
Lieutenant.

421
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,115
You forgot something.

422
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,232
- l can't. Bill, I...
- Take it.

423
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,356
You're not getting off that easy.

424
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,918
Once a pilot, always a pilot, Bulldog.

425
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,391
Yes, sir.

426
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,634
<i>(knock on door)</i>

427
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,711
Come in.

428
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,151
l heard you won a medal.

429
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,831
Yeah.

430
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,071
They give them out
for anything these days.

431
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,039
Good behaviour...

432
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,478
attendance,
playing well with others.

433
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,038
l need you back in the CIC.

434
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,669
It just ain't the same without you in there,
intimidating the inmates.

435
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,751
No, no.

436
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,997
That's not what l came here
to talk to you about.

437
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,548
OK.

438
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,792
- So why are you here?
- l don't know. Nothing.

439
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,992
You wanna tell me
what happened to Ellen?

440
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,991
<i>(sighs)</i>

441
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,670
l could use a drink.

442
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,191
Me too.

443
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,633
Back masking.

444
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,711
It's turning me on, Dead Man.
