1
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,884
Okay, Piper, I can't be late
getting to the office today.

2
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,678
I have a radio interview with
those morning guys, Pip and Skeeter.

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,096
That's Skip and Peter.

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,391
Could you forget about
your advice column for two seconds?

5
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,143
Come see where
we're putting the nursery.

6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,521
You're putting it in your closet.
I've seen your closet.

7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,022
There's a lot of shoes, honey.

8
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,649
No, not anymore.

9
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,943
Look, it's perfect.

10
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,945
It's a little cramped, though,
don't you think?

11
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,656
That's why I'm adding a window,
to bring in light

12
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,408
and create a sense of space.

13
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,036
You guys are very cute.

14
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,206
But why are you doing all this now?
Your due date's not for months.

15
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:43,043
Well, demon activity has been light,
so it's a good time to get ahead.

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,920
Speaking of ahead,

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,298
I can't believe you guys didn't notice
my billboards downtown.

18
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,301
Oh, honey, of course
we noticed them.

19
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:55,013
You can see them
from a passing 747.

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,723
We'd have told you
how proud we are,

21
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,851
but you never slow down
to give us a chance.

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,936
Well, you know,
nothing perks up a girl's career

23
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,272
like sending her husband
straight to hell.

24
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,608
Okay, well, I've seen the nursery,
and it's absolutely beautiful,

25
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,610
but I really have to go
to that interview.

26
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,822
Honey, I know your work
is very important to you.

27
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,116
But guess what. I'm having a baby.

28
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:15,492
I know.

29
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,662
Yeah, so how about you take
a couple minutes to be Aunt Phoebe?

30
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,789
Oh, my God, you're so right.

31
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,917
I'm so sorry.
Okay, what do you need?

32
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,752
An opinion.

33
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,963
I'm thinking...

34
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,509
Positions! Bogey in three, two, one!

35
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,104
So much for the theory
that Borneo demons

36
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,814
are impervious to magical powers.

37
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,858
I can't wait to tell
the local witch doctors.

38
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,861
Excuse me, can we refrain from
blowing up demons in the nursery?

39
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,238
Oh, honey, it was just one.

40
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,823
Piper, you're going to be a mom.

41
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,367
You need to start thinking
about the safety of our daughter.

42
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,206
And you, you're getting so caught up
with this magical kick.

43
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,250
Look at your hair. It's still red
from the potion you blew up last night.

44
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,337
Do you have any idea how much
this would cost in a salon?

45
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,840
I love your new 'do, honey.
I think you look beautiful.

46
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,425
Okay, bye.

47
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,843
Thank you.

48
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,595
Honey, sweets, toots?

49
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,597
I appreciate that you're
very concerned,

50
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,140
but I am still a witch,

51
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:24,228
and we do still have innocents
to protect and demons to fight.

52
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,812
I can't just crawl in a hole.

53
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,989
It's too bad, Mylie,
but your time is up.

54
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:41,745
You had 30 days to find love
or the penalty would be death.

55
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,916
But he does love me.
I know he does.

56
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,668
Oh, really?

57
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:48,919
Did he tell you?

58
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,963
He doesn't have to tell me
he loves me.

59
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,216
Well, actually, he does.

60
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,719
But he'll never say he loves you
until he trusts you.

61
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:03,100
And he'll never trust you
until you tell him what you really are.

62
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,228
You see why I always
win these bargains.

63
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:12,818
As an immortal being, I'm afraid
only you can give up your life.

64
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,697
Place this auger shell
over your heart.

65
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,994
It will draw your immortality inside.

66
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,163
And if I don't?

67
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,418
Then you can rot for eternity
right here.

68
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,019
You're wrong. He does love me.

69
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,354
And I'm gonna prove it.

70
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:40,864
Leo, I can't believe you found
all our old baby stuff.

71
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,784
Grams was a bit of a pack rat.

72
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,453
Baby book.

73
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,997
My baby book.

74
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,959
Oh, look how squishy I was.

75
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,044
You were so adorable.

76
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,922
Leo, you can't even see the picture.

77
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,841
I'm your whitelighter.

78
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,844
I've been watching you
ever since you were a baby.

79
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,805
Yeah, see, that's too creepy
to think about.

80
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,809
I never knew that Mom
kept a baby book for me.

81
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,396
Why not? I mean,
you started one for our daughter.

82
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,899
I always thought you
and your mom were a lot alike.

83
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,488
It's strange to think that
she went through everything

84
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:22,781
I'm going through right now.

85
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,951
I don't think you ever really know
how much your mother loves you

86
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,828
until you become one yourself.

87
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,795
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

88
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,048
Here.

89
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,093
- Why don't you let me help you?
- It's heavy.

90
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,972
Well, see, that's kind of why
I wanted to help you with it.

91
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,058
Piper, when are you gonna
accept the fact that you're pregnant?

92
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,352
When are you gonna stop
being so overprotective?

93
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,105
All I'm suggesting
is that you slow down.

94
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,399
Okay, Leo, I'm not gonna be
one of those women

95
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:01,320
that sits on her ass and eats bonbons
throughout her entire pregnancy.

96
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,197
That's just not the woman
you married.

97
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,824
Besides, generations
of Halliwell women

98
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,744
raised perfectly normal children
before me.

99
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,913
They all got through it, and so will I.

100
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:12,789
Not all of them.

101
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,875
What's that supposed to mean?

102
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,668
How far along in the book
have you gotten?

103
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,974
There was no one there to finish it
after your mother died.

104
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,568
Like I said,
you're a lot like your mother.

105
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,571
She was careless too.

106
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,324
She thought she was invincible.

107
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,118
She was wrong.

108
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:06,134
Hello. Begging your evil pardon.

109
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:09,137
I bear a message from my master.

110
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,557
Necron?

111
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,601
He wants the immortality
you promised him,

112
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,353
and he wants it now!

113
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,772
His words, not mine.

114
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:23,360
Tell your master he'll get what
he wants, but he must be patient.

115
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,195
Oh, no.

116
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,239
I can't tell him that.

117
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:32,995
No disrespect, but skeletal beings
aren't known for their patience.

118
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,706
Then you best hurry along.

119
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,250
I'll do as you ask.

120
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:43,797
But it'll be the last thing I do
before Necron eats my life force.

121
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,467
Then comes for yours.

122
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,021
Water

123
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:02,191
Rise up from the sea

124
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,360
Find the one who fled from me

125
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,323
Follow where the winds are cold

126
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:14,328
Then fall tenfold like days of old

127
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,975
Mylie.

128
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,395
- Mylie, hey.
- Hey.

129
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,314
I'm so sorry to pull you out
of your meeting.

130
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,650
They said it was important.
What's going on?

131
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,194
I need to know
how you feel about me.

132
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,614
What's so funny?

133
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,616
- You know what I love?
- No, what?

134
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,911
Your enthusiasm.

135
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,580
What else?

136
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:03,585
Well, l... I love this dimple
right here when you smile.

137
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,548
Mylie, what's going on here?

138
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:14,763
Look, I told you, I need to know
how you feel about me deep inside.

139
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,306
It's important.

140
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,184
Well, listen, I'm gonna be on a plane
in two hours to go to New York.

141
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,686
When I get back, we'll go out...

142
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,772
No, before you get on the plane.

143
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,858
I can't explain right now,

144
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,486
but unless you tell me
how you feel about me,

145
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,155
I may not be here
when you get back.

146
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,199
What's that supposed to mean?

147
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,910
I'm sorry, this isn't a threat.

148
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,620
It just... It is what it is.

149
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,498
Look, Mylie, this isn't the time
or the place for this.

150
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:44,001
Whatever I feel for you
should come out when I'm ready.

151
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,878
But we're running out of time.

152
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:54,428
Look, Craig, I admit that
this isn't fair, what I'm asking you.

153
00:09:54,595 --> 00:10:00,475
But it's what I need right now
if you want to keep me in your life.

154
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,438
Okay.

155
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:08,150
If it's that important, okay.

156
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:10,861
When I first met you...

157
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,865
...I felt a wall come down.

158
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,284
A wall around my heart.

159
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,583
I mean, I don't know
how to say this, but...

160
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,335
- I gotta go.
- What?

161
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,171
- Wait a minute, you just...
- I'm so sorry. I've gotta go.

162
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,136
Matthews!

163
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,806
In my office, now!

164
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:28,230
Weather advisory: If you're gonna
go outside, bring a paddle.

165
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,898
Where were you?

166
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,401
I had to run the McKenzie papers
over to the courthouse.

167
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,944
You've been gone an hour.

168
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,864
Yeah, well, there's a freak rainstorm.
The entire city's flooded.

169
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,991
You should've let someone know
where you're headed.

170
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,869
You have this habit
of coming and going as you please.

171
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,412
As I please?

172
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,582
No, I come and go
as other people please.

173
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:50,127
That's what assistants do.
They run errands.

174
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:53,172
I'll tell you a little secret.
They don't like it.

175
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,923
Well, your behaviour
has got to change.

176
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,426
Maybe it'll change if you promote me
to social worker.

177
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,844
I already did.

178
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,014
You start tomorrow.

179
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,017
He promoted you?

180
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:06,894
Congratulations.

181
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,479
- Thanks, I guess.
- What do you mean, you guess?

182
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,107
Paige, you've worked
so hard for this. It's your dream.

183
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,985
Yeah, Cowan already gave me
the big responsibility speech.

184
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,738
No more coming to work late,
no more long lunches.

185
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:18,989
Hold on a second, sweetie.

186
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,699
Nancy O'Dell's producer's
on the phone.

187
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,701
They want to know
if you want hair and makeup.

188
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,620
No, I will do my own. Thanks.

189
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,580
- Hi.
- Nancy O'Dell?

190
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,583
Yeah, she wants to interview me
on TV tomorrow.

191
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,170
Look at you, blowing up around town.
Billboards, radio, TV.

192
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,130
What's next?
Phoebe, the world tour?

193
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:38,425
Oh, no, even better.

194
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,469
- Divorce court.
- What?

195
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:44,264
I can't believe you found time
to push a divorce through the system.

196
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,517
I just want my life back.

197
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,477
I don't want to have to look
over my shoulder,

198
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,312
praying that Cole
isn't gonna find a way

199
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,189
out of the demonic wasteland,
you know?

200
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:53,899
- Do you think he will?
- You know what?

201
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,735
I don't care.
Because even if he does,

202
00:12:56,944 --> 00:13:00,280
after today, I'll be free.

203
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,008
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

204
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:23,679
It's just that I recognize you
from your billboard.

205
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:26,139
- I need your help.
- Oh, that's sweet, sweetie.

206
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,642
But if you write a letter,
then I respond to everyone.

207
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,310
No, you don't understand.

208
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,522
I recognized you
as a Charmed One.

209
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,400
You're very famous
where I come from.

210
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:37,818
I'm not evil or anything.

211
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,071
- I've heard that one before.
- No, honestly.

212
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,295
- We need to go.
- Well, yeah!

213
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,671
The Sea Hag can track my tail.

214
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,132
- Well, then make it go away.
- I can't.

215
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,986
All right. Okay.

216
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,414
Okay, hang on!

217
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,439
Okay, I just cut work on the day
of my big promotion

218
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,233
and sped through a rainstorm
to get here.

219
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:03,612
- What is the 911?
- Phoebe found a mermaid.

220
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,364
Actually, she found me.

221
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,158
On the way to a very important
court date, I might add.

222
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,077
Hi, I'm Mylie.

223
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:11,578
You must be Paige.

224
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,622
You have a very big
underwater fan base.

225
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:18,210
You're a mermaid?
You guys actually exist?

226
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,880
Excuse me,
when you said Sea Hag,

227
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:25,092
did you mean like old-woman hag
or evil-magic hag?

228
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,095
Because, see, I'm not really
in the battle mood today.

229
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,264
She's kind of both.

230
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,475
Forget that,
what's life like under the sea?

231
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,853
Does your skin get wrinkly?

232
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,564
Does algae pose
a personal-hygiene problem?

233
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,233
Okay, guys, why don't we
let her up for a little air?

234
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,734
No, it's okay, I don't mind.

235
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,736
Actually, there's nothing like
being a mermaid.

236
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:48,866
You get to swim in the open sea
all day, explore endless wonders.

237
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,159
- It's pure freedom.
- Sounds like heaven.

238
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,745
I'm sure you wanna get back.
I can drop you off at the beach...

239
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,038
No, you don't understand.

240
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,959
It was a great life
for the first few hundred years.

241
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,671
Mermaids are immortal.

242
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,507
Yeah, we can spend eternity at sea.

243
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:09,803
Because our hearts are, well,
some say, as cold as the water.

244
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,723
But sometimes
a mermaid gets Ionely,

245
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,185
and her heart warms,
and she wants more.

246
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,103
Is that what happened to you?

247
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,024
The ocean's floor is littered with bones
of mortals who died for love.

248
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,734
I had to know why.

249
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,653
Now, these bones,

250
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,949
could they be bones of mortals
that perhaps the Sea Hag killed?

251
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,951
- Piper.
- What?

252
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:36,371
So you said you wanted to feel love.
Is that why you saw the Sea Hag?

253
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:40,751
Yes. If a mortal professes his love
to a mermaid, she becomes human.

254
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,794
The Sea Hag agreed to give me legs,

255
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,755
but if I didn't find love
before her deadline,

256
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,590
I would have to give her
my immortality.

257
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,800
All that for a guy?

258
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,761
Boy, did you get taken for a ride.

259
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:51,970
- Phoebe.
- What?

260
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,805
But I did find love.

261
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,850
I mean, I think I did.

262
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:01,396
But I might be dead
before I get to find out for sure.

263
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,983
Craig's getting on a plane
to New York soon.

264
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,152
Oh, no, no, no. This is good.

265
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,321
Because all we gotta do
is find the fish lover,

266
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,407
get him to spill his guts, and then
we don't have to face the Sea Hag.

267
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,867
- Piper.
- What?

268
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,370
If your boyfriend's love
can make you human,

269
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,372
why don't you just tell him
you're a mermaid?

270
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,833
You mean that I'm a genetic freak

271
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,335
with a fish tail
coated in glandular slime?

272
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:26,004
- She raises a good point.
- Yeah.

273
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,006
You may be half fish,
but you're still a woman.

274
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,592
And women, you know, they generally
know when a man's in love

275
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:31,969
even before he does.

276
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,929
Oh, please.

277
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:37,599
If I wrote that slop in my column,
I'd be driven out of town.

278
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,728
Okay, that is it.
Can I see you two in the kitchen?

279
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,442
Okay, what is going on
with you guys?

280
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,778
I'm sorry. Like you need a man
to be complete.

281
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:52,906
That kind of thinking dates back
to the days we all had tails.

282
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,199
Maybe Phoebe's right.

283
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,326
Maybe we just throw the mermaid
back into the ocean

284
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,995
and we keep the manor
a hag-free zone.

285
00:17:58,162 --> 00:17:59,371
Who are you people,

286
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,832
and what have you done
with my sisters?

287
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,084
Let's start with you.
What is going on in that head?

288
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,170
I keep thinking about
the court date I'm missing.

289
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,422
Okay, so you're dumping
all over our innocent?

290
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,090
I don't mean to be.

291
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,968
Paige, I've been fighting so hard
to get my life back.

292
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,179
If Cole shows up
and we're still married,

293
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,055
then it was all for nothing.

294
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,432
I need my freedom.

295
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,100
Okay, fine, go meet the judge.

296
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,311
Just hurry back,
and we'll deal with Mylie.

297
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,066
Where's she going?

298
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,651
Everything okay?

299
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,695
Yeah, Piper and I
were just about to discuss

300
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,113
how best to vanquish
the Sea Hag.

301
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,532
No, you said we were
gonna deal with Mylie.

302
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,160
You didn't say anything about
doing anything with the Sea Hag.

303
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:39,703
What is up with you

304
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,414
and these demon-avoidance issues
you've suddenly got?

305
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,458
I think if we can protect Mylie

306
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,544
and avoid a run-in with the Sea Hag,
I'm all for that.

307
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,296
What is going on with everybody?

308
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,256
We're talking about the Sea Hag,

309
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,966
mysterious monster
of the deep blue sea,

310
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,511
whose name strikes fear
in the hearts of sailors everywhere.

311
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,263
Okay, somebody's been watching
way too much Discovery Channel.

312
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,891
You're probably right,
but she's an interesting evil specimen.

313
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,477
Reminds me of this water demon
I read about in the Book.

314
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,354
She kills in the most
fascinating way.

315
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,940
- Paige.
- What?

316
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,193
We know how it kills.

317
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,322
What'd I say?

318
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,866
It killed Mom.

319
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:21,829
It's okay, you didn't know.

320
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,664
Look, I just don't see any sense

321
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:27,459
in going up against a demon like this
if we don't have to.

322
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:32,214
Okay, maybe we can get Craig
to confess his love for Mylie.

323
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,715
I'll ask her what flight he's on,

324
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,176
and maybe I can stop him
from getting on that plane.

325
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,803
But if it doesn't work,

326
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,681
we're gonna have to come up with
a plan B to vanquish the Sea Hag.

327
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,308
I know. I will check
the Book of Shadows.

328
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:50,482
You okay?

329
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,193
Yeah.

330
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,620
Hello, begging your evil pardon.

331
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,789
I see you're still alive.

332
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,887
Six months ago,
I came to this cavern to feed on you.

333
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,890
You talked me out of it.

334
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,558
What was it you said?

335
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,519
I promised you an immortal being

336
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:30,272
to give you permanent
and everlasting life.

337
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,816
Yes. That was it.

338
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,484
A mermaid, I believe.

339
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,529
Did you capture her for me?

340
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,200
No. Not yet.

341
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,038
It's not too late.

342
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,915
I can cast a new spell,

343
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,834
conjure a storm like
San Francisco has never seen.

344
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,670
Think what you're giving up
if you kill me.

345
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,385
Now, this isn't right.

346
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:18,654
I'm so tired of feeding
on lower life-forms.

347
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,532
The mermaid
won't get away this time.

348
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:22,783
She better not.

349
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,160
For your sake.

350
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:36,588
Flight 83 to Palm Beach, Florida
will be boarding in 15 minutes.

351
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:42,719
Flight 83 to Palm Beach, Florida
will be boarding in 15 minutes.

352
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:47,099
Thank you, Mr. Wilson.
Have a nice flight.

353
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,643
Craig? Craig Wilson?

354
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,311
- Yeah?
- I have a message for you.

355
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,021
Mylie sent me.

356
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,274
Let me guess,
she sent me a singing telegram.

357
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,652
No, no, a stripagram,
that's more Mylie's style.

358
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,904
Shocking and unexpected.

359
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,114
I'm a friend of Mylie's.

360
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:04,616
She sent me here
because she needs to speak with you.

361
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:06,201
Why didn't she come herself?

362
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,453
That's a good question.

363
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,707
There's a good answer,
I just can't tell you what it is.

364
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,083
But it's good.

365
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,335
Let me get this straight.
You're a friend of Mylie's.

366
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,212
I've never met you,
never even heard of you,

367
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:18,881
and you know more about her
than I do?

368
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,259
No, not more about her
than you do, just a little secret.

369
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:24,344
Well, a big secret.

370
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:26,096
Well, I'm tired of Mylie's secrets.

371
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:29,141
Okay, I'm tired of her moving closer
to me, and then running away and...

372
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:31,602
I'm just tired.

373
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,520
There's a really good reason
for all of this,

374
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,273
and one day you guys are gonna
sit down at a nice seafood dinner

375
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,068
and laugh about this, but until then,
you really need to trust her.

376
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,696
No, right now, I need to catch a plane.
Excuse me.

377
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:46,033
Craig, her life is in danger.

378
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:56,835
I sent a sheriff to his apartment,
to his work, even his dry cleaners.

379
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:59,171
Trust me, Your Honour,
I didn't make a good faith effort

380
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:01,048
to try to notify my husband
of our divorce,

381
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:02,799
I made a great faith effort.

382
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,636
But to grant a default divorce,

383
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,597
the court requires that you
put a notice in the local newspaper

384
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,642
saying where the missing spouse
was last residing.

385
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,268
Did you do that?

386
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:16,313
I made the notice
larger than legally required.

387
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,233
I even used a 12-pica bold font
to make sure it really popped.

388
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,444
You see there how it really pops?

389
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,073
What is your business here,
inspector?

390
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,660
I led the investigation into
the disappearance of Mr. Cole Turner.

391
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:32,621
We used every method at our
disposal to locate his whereabouts,

392
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:34,665
and we still came up empty.

393
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:37,167
It's my belief that Mr. Turner
has left the country.

394
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,503
I must say, young lady,

395
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,255
in all my years on the bench,

396
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,383
I have never seen a divorce
pushed through this fast.

397
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,301
Please sign here.

398
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:50,889
- Free at last.
- Is this the right office?

399
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:53,433
Cole Turner, Your Honour.

400
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:58,188
Nice ad.
Thanks for letting me know.

401
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:02,192
You evil bastard. Why didn't you
just stay where you belong?

402
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:03,819
Wait a minute, I'm not evil.

403
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:06,363
Do you have any idea
what you just did to me in there?

404
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,116
Hold on. I'm not evil. I'm good.

405
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,368
You're good at crushing
my every hope and dream.

406
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:12,870
Well, I'm gonna make up for that.

407
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,872
Made me look like a fool
in front of the judge.

408
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,457
You are like a pit bull
with a death grip.

409
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,585
You know,
I should arrest you on principle.

410
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,091
Too many people talking at once.

411
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:29,052
You see, Cole, this is
exactly what I'm talking about.

412
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,097
Good people don't turn other people
into water coolers.

413
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:33,891
- I needed you to hear me.
- Go to hell.

414
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:36,185
I was just there.
I didn't mean to stay so long,

415
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,270
but I needed to gather
enough powers to execute...

416
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:40,981
Execute who, huh? Execute who?

417
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:43,984
My plan. I'm here to redeem myself.

418
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,485
You better be careful.

419
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:50,032
You are stepping down
a very dangerous road right now.

420
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,992
I'm already on it.

421
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,286
I got my job back at the law firm.

422
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:57,331
I'm gonna use my powers
to help people.

423
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,666
Make up for my past.

424
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,668
You'll see we're meant to be together.

425
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,755
Cole, if you say that again,
I swear I'll scream.

426
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,425
I want you out of my life.

427
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,594
I'll keep my distance.

428
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,262
But I'm not going away.

429
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,598
My love for you hasn't changed.

430
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:18,060
It kept me alive in the wasteland...

431
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:19,853
...and led me back to you.

432
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,650
You won't use that.

433
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:28,237
I know you still love me,
on some level, deep inside.

434
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:37,788
You are seriously mistaken
if you think I still love you in any way.

435
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,331
I wasn't expecting a warm welcome,

436
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:42,584
but don't you think
this is a little extreme?

437
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:51,927
Wait.

438
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:53,637
You stay away from me,

439
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,764
whatever you are.

440
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:07,276
What happened?

441
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:09,403
Where's Phoebe?

442
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,697
She ran off.

443
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,909
You're lucky that's all she did.

444
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:23,667
Pounding the coastline
and leaving weary residents...

445
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,586
Now, the Book says
that the Sea Hag

446
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,880
has power over
her natural environment.

447
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:31,800
Would that be, like, rainstorms?

448
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:35,846
- Yeah, rainstorms, hurricanes.
- Hurricanes?

449
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,598
Even tidal waves.

450
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:41,018
Leo, she said tidal waves.
How far do tidal waves travel?

451
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:42,311
Excuse us.

452
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:45,314
What has gotten into you?

453
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,025
I don't know.
I just don't feel like myself.

454
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,444
Well, our job is
to keep the innocent calm.

455
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,362
Can you do that
while I go talk to the Elders

456
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:54,364
and see if they
can help control the Sea Hag?

457
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,074
Sure.

458
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:04,082
Hey.

459
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:05,667
You came.

460
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,253
Yeah, Paige told me your life
was in danger. What's going on?

461
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:11,173
I really need to know
how you feel about me.

462
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,301
I can't believe we're back on this.
What, you two in on this joke, or what?

463
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,845
It's no joke. You have to tell her
how you feel about her.

464
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,514
Her life depends on it.

465
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:21,558
What is this?
The Delusional Girls' Club? Come on.

466
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,727
Tell me what's happening.

467
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:27,314
- I can't.
- You can't?

468
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,775
You yank me out
of a business meeting,

469
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,985
you have your friend ambush me
at the airport,

470
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,988
I miss my plane,
and you can't tell me why?

471
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:36,949
No.

472
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:40,160
Okay, buddy, look. You obviously
wouldn't be here if you didn't care.

473
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:43,622
So why don't you just tell her
that you love her, for crying out loud.

474
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:44,832
- Piper, relax.
- What?

475
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:48,001
If he does not do this,
then we gotta fight the evil...

476
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,463
Person.

477
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,757
- Know what, I'm out of here.
- Craig, wait!

478
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:59,721
You want to know
what I'm hiding from you?

479
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:02,349
Okay.

480
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:05,644
Mylie.

481
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,063
No, don't!

482
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,905
Please don't be afraid.

483
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:18,782
It's still me.

484
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:22,327
What are you?

485
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,342
Did you find a vanquishing spell?

486
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,722
Piper, freeze her!

487
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:45,726
I can't.

488
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:02,659
Piper!

489
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:06,330
Piper, help me! Piper!

490
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,207
Help!

491
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,674
What happened to you?

492
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:36,318
She took our innocent?
How could you let that happen?

493
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:39,905
I don't know.
I think I had a panic attack.

494
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:41,907
I couldn't breathe or move.

495
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,201
Okay, but she took our innocent.

496
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:45,744
Let's give Piper a break, okay?

497
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:49,957
No, she's right. I froze up.
Mylie's gone, and it's my fault.

498
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:52,960
No, it's not your fault.
It's your hormones.

499
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:55,003
Your maternal instincts
are kicking in.

500
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,296
More like taking over.

501
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:59,633
It's natural for a mother
to feel protective of her baby.

502
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,219
But she's been handling demons
ever since she got pregnant.

503
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:03,554
Why the sudden change today?

504
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,722
I don't know. I just...

505
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,182
I don't.

506
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,186
Let's just focus on finding Mylie.
What'd you get on the Sea Hag?

507
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,399
There's a vanquishing spell,
power of three.

508
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,025
I have it somewhere.

509
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,903
Okay, what about a location?

510
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,947
Did the Book say
where we could find her?

511
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,828
The Elders say she keeps
a cavern on a remote island.

512
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:30,539
She keeps it hidden
with charms and spells.

513
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:32,541
The only way to track her
is with a mermaid.

514
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:35,002
Well, unfortunately,
we're fresh out of those.

515
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:38,255
Okay, yeah, well, where were you
when this all went down?

516
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:42,217
I had my own demon to deal with.

517
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:45,470
The good news is, is that the Sea Hag
can't steal Mylie's immortality

518
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:47,139
unless she's willing to give it up.

519
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:48,682
Which could be any minute.

520
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:52,144
It's true. If she gives up hope,
she might wanna die.

521
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:53,896
Well, I'll find Craig.
We may need him.

522
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:55,814
Try the airport.
He was headed to New York.

523
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:01,111
I'll try to locate the Sea Hag.

524
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:03,947
Oh, honey.

525
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:05,866
I'm sorry.

526
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,202
I might have been pushing too hard.

527
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:11,246
Why don't you let me and Paige
worry about the Sea Hag?

528
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:14,666
- No, this I've got to...
- Rest.

529
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,461
If not for your sake,
then for my niece.

530
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:19,755
All this stress can't be good.

531
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:22,007
She's right.

532
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:37,940
I underestimated you.

533
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:40,651
They always come back to me
with empty hearts,

534
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,237
begging me to end their lives.

535
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,364
But you...

536
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,244
You almost found love.

537
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:52,538
I did find love.

538
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,832
Maybe he did love you.

539
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,793
But I'm afraid that's over,
my dear child,

540
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,753
now that he knows what you are.

541
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:07,052
It's time to embrace your fate.

542
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:16,520
The pain you're feeling
won't go away.

543
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:21,108
As an immortal creature...

544
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:25,195
...can you bear to live with it
for eternity?

545
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:38,500
Inspector 43 in need of assistance.

546
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:41,336
216 in progress. I have shots fired.

547
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:44,756
Ten-four.
Inspector 43 requesting backup.

548
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,719
Last time I come to this place
for lunch.

549
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:06,528
Thought you could use a little help.

550
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,906
You thought right.

551
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:11,325
Let's go get the bad guy.

552
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:15,037
- What did you do?
- Gave us a little extra time.

553
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:17,080
Yeah, I can see that. Why?

554
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:18,999
You mean, other than
to save your ass?

555
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:22,211
Well, I need to show Phoebe
that I am good.

556
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:24,630
I help you make this collar,
you look good to your bosses.

557
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,298
It's a win-win proposition.

558
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,091
What if I don't want your help?

559
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:31,345
I could always turn you
into a water cooler.

560
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:34,806
Got cuffs?

561
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:39,436
Thanks.

562
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:40,938
Here, hold this.

563
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:46,276
So anyway, if you need help
on any cases,

564
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:49,905
supernatural or otherwise,
I'm at your service.

565
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:53,492
I'm gonna prove to everyone
that I'm not evil.

566
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:02,709
Whether they like it or not.

567
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:05,754
Look, she doesn't want you.

568
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,339
Why don't you just give it up?

569
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:09,341
Because I'm in love.

570
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:14,596
Don't forget to tell her what I did.

571
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:20,018
This is really good.

572
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:22,771
Adding Eastern thinking
to Western Wicca.

573
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:25,232
It should break through
the Sea Hag's protective charms.

574
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:28,777
- Are you gonna answer your phone?
- No. It's my boss.

575
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:31,446
- I've been gone all afternoon.
- Okay, then can we turn it off?

576
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:34,366
Do you think it's possible to get
promoted and fired in the same day?

577
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,660
Paige, please,
just turn off the phone.

578
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:40,247
You know, maybe in our new destiny,
this job just isn't meant to be.

579
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:42,082
Okay.

580
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,836
Okay. Interesting.

581
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:48,172
Phoebe.

582
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,966
What is going on?

583
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:54,178
He's back.

584
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,305
- Who?
- Cole.

585
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:58,307
What?

586
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:03,604
This is his blood.

587
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,647
Blood is not supposed to do that.

588
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:09,401
- You stabbed him?
- Yeah.

589
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:12,821
- Good.
- He wants me back.

590
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:17,534
He wants me back,
and I just want to run.

591
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:20,245
As fast and far as I can.

592
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:22,039
I swear, if I had your power,

593
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:25,542
Paige, I would orb myself to a rock
in the middle of the sea.

594
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:29,880
He has put me through
so much, and I just...

595
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:31,548
I don't wanna go through it again.

596
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,967
Okay, running is not the answer.

597
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:35,928
Don't give him that power over you.

598
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:38,680
You have built
a great life for yourself.

599
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,933
But it doesn't matter.

600
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:42,768
I'm too tired to fight him.

601
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:46,605
And I don't even know if I could.

602
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:50,275
He's got all these
new demonic powers now.

603
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:53,487
You know what,
turn your anger towards the Sea Hag.

604
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:57,032
After we deal with her,
I'll test Cole's blood

605
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:00,744
and come up with a magic way
to keep him from you, okay?

606
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:03,747
Okay.

607
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:07,167
Thank you.

608
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:10,587
Let's see if the spell
that you wrote works.

609
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:12,256
I will go find Piper.

610
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:15,717
Oh, Piper.
I'm kind of worried about her.

611
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:17,261
She picked maybe the worst time

612
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:19,263
to come up with
a massive demon phobia.

613
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,516
You think she's gonna be okay
to take on the Sea Hag?

614
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:26,186
Well, I think pregnancy's
an emotional time,

615
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:27,646
and anything can happen.

616
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:29,481
I'll be fine.

617
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:33,569
Okay, let's go. We got a job to do.

618
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:36,321
- Are you sure you're up to it?
- Well, I don't have a choice.

619
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:38,699
It's a power-of-three spell, right?
One, two, three.

620
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:41,160
Should we wait for Leo
to find Craig before we go?

621
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:43,787
No, Mylie needs us now.

622
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:50,210
Okay, if this spell works,
it should take us right to the Sea Hag.

623
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:52,546
Powers of the witches rise

624
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:55,632
Find the hag who speaks in lies

625
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:58,552
Balance chakras, focus chi

626
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,805
Lead us through the cruel, cruel sea

627
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:32,628
Hey!

628
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:34,004
Sorry, I couldn't hold you.

629
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:39,343
Phoebe, you can't stand,
you don't have legs.

630
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,888
Okay, well, why me?
Why did I get the tail?

631
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:45,182
We all read that spell together.

632
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:47,017
Maybe because
you're the best swimmer?

633
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:49,728
Yeah, at the Y.
But this is the ocean.

634
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:52,981
It is very cold,
and I'm allergic to shellfish!

635
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:56,693
Okay, forget that. Do you sense
the Sea Hag? Is she close?

636
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,320
How should I know?

637
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:01,240
Well, maybe if you put
your head underwater.

638
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:02,699
And get my hair wet?

639
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,451
Phoebe, you're a mermaid.

640
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:06,453
You should be able
to sense the Sea Hag.

641
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,582
My spell worked,
just not the way I envisioned it.

642
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:19,550
I found Craig. He was on a plane
on his way to New York.

643
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:22,970
Why am I standing in the ocean?

644
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:24,721
Phoebe's a mermaid.

645
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:28,350
Oh, well, that would explain it.

646
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:31,353
Dive in. The water's great.

647
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,314
Phoebe, get back here this instant.

648
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,780
The call of the sea is intense.
Just like Mylie said it was.

649
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:43,824
Well, ignore it.
Did you find the Sea Hag?

650
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:46,869
Now that you mention it,
there was a stench under the water.

651
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,871
That could be
the sewage treatment plant.

652
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:50,789
We'll take our chances.
Follow the stench.

653
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,416
- How?
- I don't know.

654
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:54,209
Get in touch with your inner fish.

655
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:58,255
And then when you find the cavern,
call for Leo and we will orb there.

656
00:38:58,463 --> 00:38:59,506
Okay.

657
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:07,389
That's actually the most fun I've seen
Phoebe have since Cole died.

658
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:10,475
- Which time?
- Good point.

659
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,228
Okay, you guys ready?
T minus Sea Hag and counting.

660
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:15,147
Piper, you got
the power-of-three spell?

661
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:22,988
Piper, are you okay?

662
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:29,244
I'm fine. Everything's under control.

663
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:41,798
Are you ready
to make your pain go away?

664
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,717
Yes.

665
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:49,723
Necron will be pleased.

666
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:55,479
It doesn't hurt. I promise.

667
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:58,190
The auger shell brings peace.

668
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:33,851
She's calling, let's go.

669
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:36,270
Come on, come on, let's go!

670
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:01,962
- Where's Piper?
- She let go of my hand.

671
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:03,589
What?

672
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:07,759
Enough with the water! Shell!

673
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,805
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.

674
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:55,933
No, she's dying.

675
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:58,560
Can you heal her?

676
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:01,980
It's no use. She's not human.

677
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:03,732
No, not yet. Get Craig. Hurry.

678
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:07,820
She should have stayed
in the water.

679
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:11,031
- She could have avoided all of this.
- Can we stay positive, please?

680
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:12,825
Get your hands off me. What...?

681
00:42:14,576 --> 00:42:17,204
What just happened? Where am I?

682
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:20,499
Somewhere off the North Atlantic
would be my gut instinct.

683
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:24,795
What...? Who are you people?

684
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,047
- Witch.
- Angel.

685
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,508
- Mermaid.
- Don't you mean witch?

686
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:34,263
I know this is hard to accept.

687
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:36,682
But all that matters is she's dying,
and you can help.

688
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:38,141
What can I do?

689
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,561
Tell her how you feel.

690
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:42,980
Your love can save her.

691
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:45,691
My love? Hey, how can I love her?

692
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:48,527
- Look at her, she's got a...
- Really beautiful heart?

693
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:53,657
Now you know what she is,
but who she is,

694
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:55,367
you've always known that.

695
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:10,007
I do love you.

696
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:07,314
Thank you.

697
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,108
Thank you for everything.

698
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,278
Okay, I hate to cut this short,
but I can sense Piper's panic,

699
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:16,532
and I think we should get back to her
and let her know everything's all right.

700
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:18,492
Phoebe, take my hand,
I'll orb you back.

701
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:20,994
Nope. I'm staying in the ocean.

702
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:22,621
Okay, just meet us
back at the beach.

703
00:44:22,788 --> 00:44:24,915
You swim so fast, you'll probably
beat us there anyway.

704
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:29,086
No, I'm staying in the ocean.
I'm not going back.

705
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:31,004
I don't understand.

706
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:33,090
Paige, it's everything
that Mylie said it was.

707
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:35,843
It's complete freedom.

708
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:39,304
The call of the sea.
It'll turn her heart cold if she lets it.

709
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:43,308
- Phoebe, get out of the water.
- No.

710
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,727
- Phoebe, take my hand.
- No!

711
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:47,855
Phoebe, fight it!

712
00:44:48,272 --> 00:44:49,982
I don't want to fight it.

713
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:52,234
I just want to be free.

714
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:56,738
Phoebe!

715
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:53,212
Leo, the Persian.

716
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,090
I found Phoebe.

717
00:45:57,299 --> 00:45:59,843
You did?
Well, why didn't you bring her?

718
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,554
She's too fast. And slippery.

719
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,599
It's official, Phoebe's on the run.

720
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,309
On the swim, technically.

721
00:46:07,476 --> 00:46:09,394
Well, what the heck
is she swimming from?

722
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:13,023
She's got billboards, TV interviews,
she got her divorce,

723
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:15,067
she should be loving life.

724
00:46:15,526 --> 00:46:18,320
- That's right, you don't know.
- I don't know what?

725
00:46:18,487 --> 00:46:19,905
Well, I didn't want
to make you mad,

726
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:21,698
you know, you getting
so panicky and all...

727
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:23,200
Yes, we've established

728
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:25,494
I was a spineless coward
in the face of evil.

729
00:46:25,661 --> 00:46:27,204
Now, what don't I know?

730
00:46:29,122 --> 00:46:30,833
Cole's back.

731
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:33,961
What? Why don't I know about this?

732
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:37,548
- Well, Phoebe told me confidentially.
- Yes, but I'm your whitelighter.

733
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:39,758
As a witch, you have a duty
to let me know this.

734
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:41,969
I have a greater duty to my sister.

735
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:44,388
Excuse me, but he's
the former Source of All Evil.

736
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:47,766
This is not something
you just sweep under the rug.

737
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:54,773
Breathe. Take a deep breath.
Take a deep breath.

738
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:57,401
Does he want my baby?

739
00:46:57,985 --> 00:47:00,237
No, honey, of course not.

740
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:02,573
He's in love. He wants Phoebe back.

741
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:06,451
Hey, that's it. If Cole and Phoebe
declare their love...

742
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,329
Cole's love is the problem,
not the solution.

743
00:47:09,705 --> 00:47:11,331
Paige, I know you hate Cole, but...

744
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:14,710
Yeah, I do. I loathe and despise him,
but that's not the point.

745
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:17,296
Mylie said that mermaids are
cold-hearted. Maybe that's why

746
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:20,591
my spell turned Phoebe into
a mermaid in the first place.

747
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,801
Wait a minute,
we're talking about Phoebe here.

748
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:25,095
Since when did Phoebe
become cold-hearted?

749
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:27,472
Well, maybe she's been in
the deep freeze

750
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:29,141
ever since Cole came back.

751
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:31,894
All right, so where do we go next?

752
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,688
I don't know, Book of Shadows,
Library of Congress, Internet.

753
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:37,608
Anywhere we can
to get rid of Phoebe's tail.

754
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:51,788
Hag?

755
00:47:57,419 --> 00:48:00,172
I want my eternal life!

756
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:05,636
Or your life, it's your choice.

757
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,338
Who are you?

758
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:44,007
You have something I want.

759
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:46,969
They're all yours!

760
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:59,064
I am so sorry I am missing work,
Mr. Cowan.

761
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:04,403
L... It's just my sister,
she's had a fishing accident.

762
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:09,283
Well, of course I'm grateful for
the promotion. Of course I am.

763
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:11,827
And I'm gonna prove to you
just how grateful I am

764
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:14,955
as soon as I get there, and...

765
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:16,582
Mr. Cowan?

766
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:18,292
Hello?

767
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:21,378
I lost Phoebe.

768
00:49:22,254 --> 00:49:23,380
- You lost Phoebe?
- Yeah.

769
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:24,840
Somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico.

770
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:28,177
I was tracking her and...
She's getting harder to sense.

771
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:31,096
I think the mermaid in her
is starting to take over.

772
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,724
I'll just have to find a way
to turn her back.

773
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:35,976
Look through these books.

774
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:38,812
You've been working on this
all night?

775
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:40,397
Yeah.

776
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:42,024
Well, what have you learned so far?

777
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:44,026
I have learned that mermaids
are cold-blooded,

778
00:49:44,193 --> 00:49:47,154
they like shiny baubles, sea chanteys
are the only songs they know,

779
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:50,699
and my adoption file
is short one document.

780
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:52,201
You lost me with that last one.

781
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:54,119
Leo, it's my first day
as a social worker,

782
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:56,955
and I'm already screwing up
and failing bigtime.

783
00:49:57,122 --> 00:49:59,166
This kid's adoption
is gonna fall apart without me.

784
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:00,876
You can't let that happen.

785
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,086
I'm so glad you agree.

786
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:06,048
I was thinking I'd just cast a spell
from here and create a file...

787
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:08,091
That's not what I meant.
Go to work.

788
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,927
- But what about...?
- But what about what?

789
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:11,428
You're just an orb away.

790
00:50:12,262 --> 00:50:15,224
- You sure you can handle this alone?
- I'm not alone. I have Piper.

791
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:17,768
Piper.

792
00:50:18,977 --> 00:50:23,065
Okay, Leo, I don't know if it's because
she's afraid of the demons

793
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:26,026
or she has guilt over Phoebe,
but she's not doing so well.

794
00:50:26,235 --> 00:50:28,529
I had to come down here
to get any work done at all.

795
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:30,572
What do you mean?

796
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:32,699
Go up to the attic
and see for yourself.

797
00:50:57,724 --> 00:51:01,019
Your scales...

798
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:04,398
- No.
- Honey, it's okay.

799
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:06,859
No, let go, I'm almost done.

800
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:08,777
Piper, you need to take a break.

801
00:51:08,986 --> 00:51:11,989
I just need one more verse.

802
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:15,117
Piper, this is not helping Phoebe.

803
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:21,498
Leo...

804
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:23,709
...I'm scared.

805
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:28,172
- I know.
- No, you don't.

806
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:30,591
I'm scared all of the time.

807
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:32,217
Piper, you're pregnant.

808
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:34,636
Your hormones and adrenaline
are running very high.

809
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:36,054
It's okay to be afraid.

810
00:51:36,221 --> 00:51:38,223
No, it's not.

811
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:40,726
Did you see what my fear
did to Phoebe?

812
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:43,729
I'm supposed to be stronger than ever
now that I'm pregnant,

813
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:45,606
for our daughter and my sisters.

814
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:48,400
It's my job to take care of this family.

815
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:51,236
Sometimes it's this family's job
to take care of you.

816
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:55,574
You know, sometimes it's my job.

817
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:00,412
Well, what do I do?

818
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:02,581
You need to figure out
what's behind your fear.

819
00:52:02,748 --> 00:52:06,627
Okay, well, therapy takes years,
and Phoebe needs me now.

820
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:10,756
Well, the only way you can help
Phoebe is by removing your fear.

821
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:13,759
What did you say?

822
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:17,471
I said you need to remove your fear,
and I can help you do that.

823
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:20,933
I think you just did.

824
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:26,355
Right now, I just need some...
Some time to figure this out.

825
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:28,148
Alone.

826
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:09,773
What's that?

827
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:17,990
So how's your sister doing
after the fishing accident?

828
00:53:18,157 --> 00:53:20,951
Well, we're not sure,
we haven't found her yet.

829
00:53:21,118 --> 00:53:23,412
What, is she lost at sea?

830
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:25,289
You could say that.

831
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:28,542
- Paige!
- Look, Mr. Cowan,

832
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:30,961
I may be stubborn at times,
and late to work often,

833
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:33,463
and I don't always know
when to shut up, like right now,

834
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:35,007
but trust me,

835
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:37,259
even if I told you the truth,
you wouldn't believe me.

836
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:40,053
So if you'll excuse me,
I have an adoption to save.

837
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:43,056
You forgot insolent.
You're very insolent.

838
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:46,685
You're right. Can I go now?

839
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:49,062
Don't make me regret
giving you this promotion, Paige.

840
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,694
Wait. Before you say anything...

841
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:58,322
Not say. Do.

842
00:53:58,489 --> 00:54:02,326
Because I'm about to orb
your family jewels far, far away.

843
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:04,161
Yeah, that would hurt.

844
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:07,331
But you don't want to use your powers
in front of all these people, do you?

845
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,877
- What do you want?
- I want to prove that I've changed.

846
00:54:12,294 --> 00:54:14,505
Not just to Phoebe,
but to you and Piper as well.

847
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:18,342
The copies of the adoption application
and police clearances.

848
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:20,302
Fax them ASAP.

849
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:22,387
It might sway the agency's decision.

850
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:26,433
I'm familiar with family law.
Maybe I could do some good here.

851
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:28,143
Didn't we fire you?

852
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,895
Actually, I quit.

853
00:54:30,062 --> 00:54:33,148
But now I'm a partner
at Jackman, Carter and Kline.

854
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:37,152
- So, what are you doing here?
- Came to help Paige.

855
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:40,113
Who doesn't want or need his help.

856
00:54:41,156 --> 00:54:43,951
A good social worker knows
when to use outside resources.

857
00:54:44,743 --> 00:54:48,580
They don't get much better
than Jackman, Carter and Kline.

858
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:53,043
Well, you heard him.

859
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:55,671
They don't get much better than me,
so let me help you.

860
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:57,089
It won't be any trouble at all.

861
00:54:57,256 --> 00:54:59,675
No trouble?
You've been nothing but trouble.

862
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:02,636
Phoebe was finally happy, and now
you're back, and suddenly she's a...

863
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:04,638
Yellowtail?

864
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:07,307
Your usual lunch order?

865
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:12,354
No fish. Not now, not ever.

866
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:19,319
Phoebe's a what?

867
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,365
You wanna know what Phoebe is?

868
00:55:23,532 --> 00:55:25,576
She's a mermaid.
And do you want to know why?

869
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:28,871
- I'm sorry, did you say "mermaid"?
- Yeah, gills, fins, scales and all.

870
00:55:29,037 --> 00:55:30,622
Well, you can fix that, right?

871
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:33,250
No, Cole, we can't fix that,
because she wants to be a mermaid

872
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:36,170
- because you broke her heart.
- I never meant to hurt her.

873
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:38,505
You didn't mean to do lots of things,
but they happened.

874
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:39,882
You are a one-man death squad.

875
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:42,134
Bodies, blood and pain
follow you wherever you go.

876
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:45,012
Well, there may be some truth to that,
but it's in my past.

877
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:47,139
- I came back to make up...
- Make up for it?

878
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:49,141
If you want to make up for it,
go to Tibet,

879
00:55:49,308 --> 00:55:52,144
join a monastery, pray for absolution,
but don't put your guilt on us.

880
00:55:52,352 --> 00:55:54,563
- You don't understand, I love...
- Love Phoebe?

881
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:58,442
What is it with you guys? Like it's all
about you and your feelings.

882
00:55:58,609 --> 00:55:59,776
What about Phoebe's feelings?

883
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:01,945
- She still loves me.
- Wrong, she doesn't love you.

884
00:56:02,154 --> 00:56:04,406
She thinks you're an evil freak
with super powers from hell

885
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:05,699
and battery acid for blood.

886
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:08,327
She doesn't love you.
She wishes you'd stayed dead.

887
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:10,704
She told you this?

888
00:56:10,913 --> 00:56:13,207
Told me? She didn't have to tell me.
She's a mermaid.

889
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:15,083
Her body erupted in scales.

890
00:56:15,292 --> 00:56:18,212
She had to turn into a fish to get away
from you. Do you get it now?

891
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:21,423
Listen, the only way
you can help us get our sister back

892
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:23,217
is for you to disappear.

893
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:24,885
Forever.

894
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,395
Locked in, boxed in, full of fear

895
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:38,357
My panic grows manic till I can't hear

896
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:40,692
In need of reprieve
So that I can breathe

897
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:44,238
Remove my fear
Please make it leave

898
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,857
What the hell?

899
00:57:32,661 --> 00:57:34,329
Watch it!

900
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:36,206
No, get your filthy meat hooks
off me!

901
00:57:36,707 --> 00:57:38,083
Check out the mouth on her.

902
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:40,210
All I care about is the tail.

903
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:44,798
How much do you think the tabloids
would pay to see this?

904
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:48,010
I don't know about you guys, but I don't
wanna spend my life on that boat.

905
00:57:48,177 --> 00:57:50,262
Maybe we should be thinking
bigger than tabloids here.

906
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:51,513
- Bigger?
- Yeah.

907
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,057
If we bring her in like this,
sure, we'll get a small fee.

908
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:56,852
But mostly we'll just get credit
for finding her.

909
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,438
Now, on the other hand,
if we say we found her dead,

910
00:57:59,855 --> 00:58:02,774
we could sell the body for a fortune.

911
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:08,238
Sorry, her life belongs to me.

912
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:33,096
Mermaids are such
poor, defenceless creatures.

913
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:34,681
I almost feel pity.

914
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,975
Pity this!

915
00:58:43,232 --> 00:58:47,152
Leo! I'm ready to go home now!

916
00:58:47,903 --> 00:58:49,696
I'm glad you finally
came to your senses.

917
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:54,034
No!

918
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:02,167
Go. Find the mermaid.

919
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:17,933
Sorry. I was a medic, not a vet.

920
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:20,394
Here's your water.

921
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:27,985
Could use a little salt.

922
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:31,822
- That's about all I can do for it.
- Okay, well, good enough.

923
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:33,907
Will one of you orb me
back to the ocean, please?

924
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:35,993
Wait, isn't there a demon after you?

925
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,495
Demon?
Did somebody say demon?

926
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:41,456
Yeah, one chased Phoebe
back home.

927
00:59:41,623 --> 00:59:44,084
Well, that was nice of it.
Welcome home.

928
00:59:44,251 --> 00:59:45,752
This isn't my home anymore.

929
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:49,131
So, what about this demon?

930
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:52,134
Where is it?
I'd like to thank it and then kill it.

931
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:55,554
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, never better.

932
00:59:56,013 --> 01:00:00,100
Ready to face my fears,
like that painting.

933
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:03,479
I hung it on the wall because
I was afraid to tell Leo that it was ugly,

934
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:04,980
but now...

935
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:11,904
No offence, honey.

936
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,031
So, what does this demon look like?

937
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:16,742
Tall, dark and skeletal,
shoots electricity.

938
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:19,912
Paige, we need the Book of Shadows.
Can you orb it down here?

939
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:23,415
You want me to use magic
for household chores?

940
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:25,459
I thought you had a total fear
of personal gain.

941
01:00:25,626 --> 01:00:28,378
See, there's that word again. "Fear."
It's very debilitating.

942
01:00:28,545 --> 01:00:29,713
Just do as I ask.

943
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:33,342
Book of Shadows.

944
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:40,599
Okay, I told you everything I know.

945
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:42,684
- Can I go home now?
- You are home.

946
01:00:42,893 --> 01:00:46,146
And you're insane if you think
that I am gonna take you anywhere.

947
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:48,816
Relax, Paige, everything will be fine.

948
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:51,902
Glad you're so calm.

949
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:54,988
Why are you so calm?

950
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:58,784
Well, I just did as you suggested,
and now I feel fine.

951
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:00,327
So can we save Phoebe?

952
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:03,413
Okay, you guys, I don't need saving.

953
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:08,210
Okay, all I need are my sea friends
and little shiny objects

954
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:11,713
and to lay on a rock
and comb out my hair.

955
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,298
I need water.

956
01:01:13,966 --> 01:01:15,551
Got him.

957
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:17,678
- Yeah, that's him.
- "Necron.

958
01:01:17,845 --> 01:01:21,265
A skeletal being who hovers
between life and death.

959
01:01:21,431 --> 01:01:24,226
Has the power to incinerate any
living creature and feed on its life..."

960
01:01:24,393 --> 01:01:26,270
Yadda yadda yadda.

961
01:01:26,436 --> 01:01:29,648
No wonder he's after Phoebe.
If mermaids are immortal,

962
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:31,316
and he's stuck between
life and death,

963
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:34,027
then immortality would place him
squarely in the "life" column.

964
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:38,031
Well, he cannot have
my immortality.

965
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:41,493
Will someone please get me
back to the ocean before I suffocate?

966
01:01:41,702 --> 01:01:43,203
I need the water.

967
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:46,623
You want water?
I'll get you some water.

968
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:49,418
You are holding me hostage!

969
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:50,752
Yep, looks like it.

970
01:01:50,919 --> 01:01:54,214
Look, I am not a common goldfish.
I cannot ignore the call of the sea.

971
01:01:54,756 --> 01:01:58,051
Well, the call of the common bathtub
is just gonna have to do.

972
01:02:01,346 --> 01:02:03,015
Why are you being so difficult?

973
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:05,517
The regulations
concerning this matter are clear.

974
01:02:05,684 --> 01:02:08,228
We cannot accept anything
but the original medical report

975
01:02:08,395 --> 01:02:09,688
for a legal adoption.

976
01:02:09,855 --> 01:02:12,566
Well, that really just
doesn't work for me.

977
01:02:15,027 --> 01:02:19,072
Are you absolutely sure
you can't use the fax copy I sent you?

978
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:20,866
Of course we can, Mr. Turner.

979
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:22,951
I'll finalize the adoption immediately.

980
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:25,662
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

981
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,210
What was that?

982
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:34,630
Just helping Paige
cut through some red tape.

983
01:02:34,796 --> 01:02:38,217
And she's okay with you using
voodoo powers to cheat the system?

984
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:40,719
Well, she doesn't know
that I'm helping her.

985
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:43,222
And they're not voodoo powers.

986
01:02:43,388 --> 01:02:46,558
Oh, what powers
are you packing these days?

987
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,977
Maybe the power
to turn men into dust?

988
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:50,938
What's that supposed to mean?

989
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:53,565
Three fishermen
mysteriously vanished today

990
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:56,443
and left behind what
the medical examiner believes to be

991
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:58,195
piles of bone dust.

992
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:01,240
- You think I killed them?
- Damn right I do.

993
01:03:01,406 --> 01:03:02,574
You think I killed them, me,

994
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:05,828
the guy who saved your surprisingly
small brain from a bullet yesterday?

995
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:10,082
You don't expect me to believe
that you did that for me?

996
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:13,627
I'm just a pawn in your twisted scam
to win Phoebe back.

997
01:03:13,836 --> 01:03:16,046
I realize that people's reputations
precede them,

998
01:03:16,213 --> 01:03:19,716
but contrary to popular opinion, I am
not The Source of All Evil anymore.

999
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:22,719
In fact, I'm not
the source of any evil anymore.

1000
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:29,643
I just want my wife back.

1001
01:03:39,236 --> 01:03:41,655
Let's pretend for a second here,

1002
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:43,448
just for the sake of argument,

1003
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:47,995
that you saved my butt
because you are my friend.

1004
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:52,666
So as your hypothetical friend,
can I give you some advice?

1005
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:55,711
- Yeah.
- Don't do this to yourself.

1006
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:57,212
I can't help it.

1007
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:00,215
You love her. I get it.

1008
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:03,886
And your love, it's epic. Okay.

1009
01:04:04,094 --> 01:04:06,013
Look what it's doing to you.

1010
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:11,977
Paige says she hates me.

1011
01:04:12,853 --> 01:04:16,106
She says I should leave for good.

1012
01:04:16,273 --> 01:04:19,401
You've known her for a long time,
Darryl. What do you think?

1013
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:21,320
Should I leave?

1014
01:04:26,283 --> 01:04:28,535
I know you don't want to.

1015
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:34,208
But what you want
really doesn't matter, right?

1016
01:04:37,628 --> 01:04:38,754
Right.

1017
01:04:38,921 --> 01:04:41,340
Well, there you go.

1018
01:05:04,488 --> 01:05:06,073
What is going on? Are you okay?

1019
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:08,408
Minor setback. It's fine.

1020
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:13,956
Minor setback?

1021
01:05:14,498 --> 01:05:16,416
The room is on fire.

1022
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:20,212
You're supposed to be figuring out a
way to vanquish Necron, not yourself.

1023
01:05:20,462 --> 01:05:22,840
Oh, come on, we weren't using
any of this junk anyway.

1024
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:24,508
Where's the fish girl?

1025
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:26,593
She's downstairs
cooling off in the tub.

1026
01:05:27,094 --> 01:05:28,887
What are you
mixing up here anyway?

1027
01:05:29,054 --> 01:05:32,975
Oh, a little burdock root
and some eye of newt.

1028
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:37,146
What? You're never, ever supposed
to mix those two things together.

1029
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:39,189
That is a volatile combination.

1030
01:05:39,356 --> 01:05:42,901
Well, Necron's a serious threat,
we need a serious potion.

1031
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:44,319
Did you know, in the Book,

1032
01:05:44,486 --> 01:05:46,655
there's a "witches be warned"
on skeletal beings?

1033
01:05:46,822 --> 01:05:48,198
The last two that vanquished him...

1034
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:50,033
Actually, the only two
that vanquished him.

1035
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,285
- Died in the process.

1036
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:53,745
Great. So the rate you're going,
you'll be number three.

1037
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:56,456
You know, you ought to be
more careful.

1038
01:05:56,623 --> 01:05:58,959
Hey, "A good plan
violently executed this week

1039
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:02,296
is better than a perfect plan
executed next week."

1040
01:06:02,504 --> 01:06:04,047
That's Patton.

1041
01:06:04,715 --> 01:06:06,049
Why are you quoting Patton?

1042
01:06:06,258 --> 01:06:09,386
So I figure
if I just double the burdock root...

1043
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:11,388
Hey!

1044
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:16,685
No touch. I don't want you
or my unborn niece around that.

1045
01:06:19,897 --> 01:06:23,150
You shouldn't be inhaling all this
smoke when you're pregnant anyway.

1046
01:06:23,317 --> 01:06:25,611
Paige, you're such a worrywart.

1047
01:06:25,777 --> 01:06:27,446
What happened?

1048
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:29,531
We're just getting ready
to kick some demon ass.

1049
01:06:29,698 --> 01:06:31,366
That's what we do, right?

1050
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:33,368
I'll get it. It's probably
Phoebe's interview.

1051
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:35,746
Well, send them away.

1052
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:40,459
Don't look at me, she's your wife.

1053
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:43,587
Does it seem like she overcame
her fear a little quickly to you?

1054
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:46,757
I don't know, I guess it's better than
her having a nervous breakdown

1055
01:06:46,924 --> 01:06:48,675
like she was this morning.

1056
01:06:48,842 --> 01:06:50,844
I'm not so sure.

1057
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:55,516
What are you looking at?

1058
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:57,351
To see if she had any help.

1059
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:01,230
Magical help?
Piper would never do that.

1060
01:07:02,356 --> 01:07:04,149
Oh, no.

1061
01:07:04,316 --> 01:07:06,735
It's a fearless spell.

1062
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:11,573
- Piper wrote a fearless spell.
- Paige!

1063
01:07:12,658 --> 01:07:13,992
Gosh, I am so sorry.

1064
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:16,495
Your sister said we're doing
the interview in the bathroom.

1065
01:07:16,662 --> 01:07:18,080
That should've been
your first clue

1066
01:07:18,288 --> 01:07:20,916
that my sister sprang from
the shallower end of the gene pool.

1067
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:23,210
Oh, come on, Phoebe,
you wanted fame.

1068
01:07:23,377 --> 01:07:25,170
Go ahead and grab it.
Carpe diem.

1069
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:27,089
Don't mention carp
around me, please.

1070
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:30,717
I am doing you a favour. People will
think you're bold and daring.

1071
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:33,762
What's better than a celebrity who
wants to do an interview in the nude?

1072
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:37,641
I could be just as fascinating with my
clothes on in a TV studio, thank you.

1073
01:07:37,808 --> 01:07:39,101
Well, actually you can't.

1074
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:42,229
My show is called
At Home With Nancy O'Dell.

1075
01:07:42,563 --> 01:07:44,690
See? Fabulous.

1076
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:46,608
Fire away.

1077
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:49,653
Piper.

1078
01:07:51,864 --> 01:07:54,491
What is going on?
We heard Phoebe scre...

1079
01:07:54,658 --> 01:07:56,118
She's going a TV interview.

1080
01:07:56,827 --> 01:07:57,911
In the bathtub?

1081
01:07:58,078 --> 01:07:59,580
Don't worry,
she's not showing any tail.

1082
01:08:00,164 --> 01:08:02,791
That Nancy O'Dell
has, like, perfect teeth.

1083
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:06,253
You can't be serious.
You're risking exposure to all of us.

1084
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:10,007
Now, see, there's your risk-aversion
side rearing its ugly head again.

1085
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:12,134
Piper, we know you cast
a fearless spell.

1086
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:14,928
Not a fearless spell, a freedom spell.

1087
01:08:15,095 --> 01:08:17,931
You told me to get rid of my fears,
so that's what I did.

1088
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,225
But you didn't get rid of it,
you just suppressed it.

1089
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:21,643
Well, what's the difference?

1090
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:25,230
I'm free to be myself
and to help others be themselves.

1091
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:27,191
Okay, but Phoebe's self
is a mermaid,

1092
01:08:27,357 --> 01:08:31,737
and that self is about to be broadcast
on the 6:00 news unless we stop it.

1093
01:08:31,904 --> 01:08:34,031
Now, see, you're only seeing
the downside here.

1094
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:35,282
What's the upside?

1095
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:38,577
The upside is Phoebe loves her job
more than anything else

1096
01:08:38,744 --> 01:08:40,913
and doing this interview
will remind her of that

1097
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:43,373
and help bring her to her senses.

1098
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:48,795
People are chewing
entire species into extinction.

1099
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:51,798
Take Chilean sea bass.
I have yet to even spot one.

1100
01:08:52,007 --> 01:08:56,428
And swordfish, for example, you might
as well be munching on a bald eagle.

1101
01:08:57,554 --> 01:09:01,183
I didn't realize you had
such a passion for fish.

1102
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:02,684
Yeah, I do.

1103
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,605
Okay, we're gonna
have to end this now.

1104
01:09:06,814 --> 01:09:08,065
It's okay. Ask one more question.

1105
01:09:09,107 --> 01:09:10,442
So back to your advice to lovers.

1106
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:14,071
It's so real, so heartfelt,
especially lately.

1107
01:09:14,404 --> 01:09:17,616
Is there a lucky guy in your life
that you get your inspiration from?

1108
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:21,078
- No, there's not.
- Really?

1109
01:09:21,245 --> 01:09:22,830
Then what's with
all the love columns?

1110
01:09:25,123 --> 01:09:26,834
I don't know.

1111
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:28,794
I think I do.

1112
01:09:29,419 --> 01:09:32,548
Okay, I'm sorry, we're really gonna
have to wrap this up. Leo?

1113
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:34,258
Okay, come on,
I'll show you downstairs.

1114
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:37,344
- But we're not finished yet.
- I think you are.

1115
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:39,972
We'll reschedule. I'll have my people
call your people, okay?

1116
01:09:40,139 --> 01:09:41,390
- Thanks.
- All right, bye-bye.

1117
01:09:41,557 --> 01:09:43,016
- Bye, Nance.
- Bye-bye.

1118
01:09:46,103 --> 01:09:47,312
So how you feel?

1119
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:49,356
Actually, thanks to you, I feel free.

1120
01:09:50,065 --> 01:09:52,317
Free from the shallowness
of human pursuit.

1121
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:56,613
From craving wealth and fame. Now all
I crave is the serenity of the sea.

1122
01:09:58,031 --> 01:09:59,741
Good job on the fearless spell.

1123
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,410
What fearless spell?

1124
01:10:03,871 --> 01:10:06,456
What the heck is their problem?

1125
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:09,668
- Orb Phoebe to the attic.
- What about you?

1126
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:13,839
Just do it!

1127
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:23,015
Okay, static man, very impressive.

1128
01:10:35,027 --> 01:10:36,862
How long is that spell gonna take?

1129
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:39,448
I don't know, it's tricky.
There's a lot of factors involved.

1130
01:10:40,824 --> 01:10:42,826
Okay, why can't we just
orb to Necron

1131
01:10:42,993 --> 01:10:45,329
and try the vanquishing potion
that Piper was working on?

1132
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:48,415
Because Piper was under the
influence when she mixed that potion,

1133
01:10:48,582 --> 01:10:52,169
as you can tell by the lovely remains
of our burned-out attic.

1134
01:10:53,003 --> 01:10:56,048
Okay, so, what happened?

1135
01:10:56,673 --> 01:10:58,091
Well, thanks to her fearless spell,

1136
01:10:58,258 --> 01:11:01,553
she went straight to an offensive place
with her explosion potion,

1137
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,680
and I don't think that's the answer.

1138
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:05,349
Why not? It sounds good
to me right now.

1139
01:11:05,557 --> 01:11:08,185
Well, because the last two witches
that vanquished skeletal beings

1140
01:11:08,352 --> 01:11:09,895
were vaporized in the process.

1141
01:11:10,062 --> 01:11:12,689
I think a power-of-three spell
is our best chance of killing Necron

1142
01:11:12,856 --> 01:11:13,899
and staying alive.

1143
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:17,569
- Can you sense her?
- Yeah.

1144
01:11:17,736 --> 01:11:18,987
- Is she hurt?
- Who knows?

1145
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:22,366
All I can sense is courage,
lots and lots of courage.

1146
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:24,618
Well, don't worry, honey,
he's not gonna kill her.

1147
01:11:24,785 --> 01:11:26,870
He needs her alive
if he's gonna get to me.

1148
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:30,999
Yeah, well, we still have to hurry
before Piper does something stupid.

1149
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:34,127
Like get Nancy O'Dell
an exclusive with Necron.

1150
01:11:34,294 --> 01:11:37,881
I'm beginning to wonder if this whole
power-of-three spell is even worth it.

1151
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,591
- What do you mean?
- Well, firstly,

1152
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:41,301
it's not really
a power-of-three spell.

1153
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:45,764
More like a power-of-two-and-a-half
spell, considering you're half a witch.

1154
01:11:46,223 --> 01:11:48,934
Secondly, I'm worried
that my fearless wife

1155
01:11:49,143 --> 01:11:51,061
won't let us interfere
to take on Necron.

1156
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:53,730
She isn't exactly using
her best judgment right now.

1157
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:56,358
I don't even know why she cast
that spell, you know.

1158
01:11:56,525 --> 01:11:58,485
I could have helped her through it.

1159
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:00,279
Well, try to see
where she's coming from.

1160
01:12:00,445 --> 01:12:01,822
She's barely been able to function,

1161
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:05,576
and she blames herself
for what happened to Phoebe.

1162
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,537
Wait a minute, what do you mean,
"What happened to Phoebe?"

1163
01:12:09,163 --> 01:12:11,623
What happened to me is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1164
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:15,961
I am swimming with the dolphins now.
I'm basking with belugas.

1165
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:20,215
Leo, I actually think I've got something,
but I need to talk to you about it alone.

1166
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:23,677
Okay, you see? This is exactly why
I love being a mermaid.

1167
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:25,762
There are no secrets underwater.

1168
01:12:25,929 --> 01:12:28,682
You know, there are no walls
to keep you trapped.

1169
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:31,685
Okay, enough. Leo, stairs.

1170
01:12:33,395 --> 01:12:36,732
You guys, wait. Wait, you guys.

1171
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:38,066
If we orb Phoebe to the ocean,

1172
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:40,777
the second Necron is a pile of dust,
she's out of here for good.

1173
01:12:40,986 --> 01:12:42,446
Do we have another option?

1174
01:12:42,613 --> 01:12:45,741
I don't know. Something Nancy O'Dell
said in that interview got me thinking.

1175
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:48,160
What if Phoebe's heart
isn't as cold as we thought?

1176
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:50,370
Well, we don't have time to find out.

1177
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:52,539
Well, let's take the time, okay?

1178
01:12:52,706 --> 01:12:55,334
I don't want to save one sister
just to lose another.

1179
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:59,171
I'm sorry, Paige, but that is a risk
that we have to take.

1180
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:08,847
All right, what did you guys
say about me?

1181
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:11,642
I said I thought you were gonna swim
away the moment we save Piper.

1182
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:14,686
- Are you?
- Come on, we have to hurry.

1183
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:24,196
This better work.

1184
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:31,036
Where's Paige?

1185
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:39,878
I think we've given your sisters
enough time to worry about you.

1186
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:44,174
Now, call for your whitelighter.

1187
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,385
Or what?

1188
01:13:53,308 --> 01:13:55,435
Oh, please, please,
somebody help me.

1189
01:13:55,602 --> 01:13:59,356
The mean demon is dipping me
into the water and it's really cold.

1190
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:01,567
Attack!

1191
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:15,789
Is that the best you got?

1192
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:18,709
Again.

1193
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:25,883
Cole?

1194
01:14:26,091 --> 01:14:27,968
Paige, you don't have
to break into my apartment.

1195
01:14:28,177 --> 01:14:29,761
I'm leaving. I'm taking your advice.

1196
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,598
Don't. I've been known
to give very bad advice.

1197
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:35,642
- I beg your pardon?
- Phoebe needs your help.

1198
01:14:37,102 --> 01:14:41,440
I know. That's why I'm going away.
It's the best way to help her.

1199
01:14:41,607 --> 01:14:43,650
- Now, if you'll excuse me...
- No!

1200
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:47,821
- What are you doing?
- Please, I can't let you leave.

1201
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:50,449
What kind of game are you playing?

1202
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:54,536
I'm not playing any games.
I told you, Phoebe needs your help.

1203
01:14:55,245 --> 01:14:58,165
And you need psychological help.

1204
01:14:58,665 --> 01:14:59,917
Okay, that's probably true,

1205
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:02,336
especially because I cannot believe
what I'm about to say,

1206
01:15:02,544 --> 01:15:05,923
but I think Phoebe's
still in love with you.

1207
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:09,301
Oh, yeah, "Phoebe hates you so much
her body erupted in scales."

1208
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:11,303
That's what you said this morning.

1209
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:14,431
Okay, maybe
an unfortunate choice of words.

1210
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,017
I thought Phoebe was running away
because she hated you,

1211
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:20,312
but now I think
it's because she loves you.

1212
01:15:22,105 --> 01:15:25,484
- You think?
- It's a theory.

1213
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:30,197
Look, her advice column has been
obsessed with love ever since you left.

1214
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:33,033
You told me to go away.

1215
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:37,246
Phoebe said it, Darryl said it.
I got the message.

1216
01:15:37,412 --> 01:15:40,457
Now you're changing
your opinion based on a theory?

1217
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:44,044
What if I can prove it?

1218
01:15:45,546 --> 01:15:47,422
Only Phoebe can prove
that she still loves me.

1219
01:15:48,632 --> 01:15:50,717
You're right.

1220
01:15:50,926 --> 01:15:52,886
Open Phoebe's heart to Cole

1221
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:54,680
Reveal the secret that it holds

1222
01:15:54,888 --> 01:15:56,974
Bring forth the passion of love's fire

1223
01:15:57,141 --> 01:15:59,810
That he may feel her true desire

1224
01:16:02,187 --> 01:16:03,230
What did you do?

1225
01:16:12,573 --> 01:16:14,241
Phoebe.

1226
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:24,209
I guess she loves you more
than either of us realized.

1227
01:16:31,842 --> 01:16:34,011
Paige wasn't in the manor.
I don't know where she is.

1228
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:37,181
Okay, well, forget her.
Let's go find Piper.

1229
01:16:37,347 --> 01:16:40,476
Yeah, but you need
the power of three to take out Necron.

1230
01:16:42,436 --> 01:16:43,770
He's hurting her again.

1231
01:16:44,354 --> 01:16:46,482
- He wants me, I'm going alone.
- No!

1232
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:49,568
Leo, I can't let anything happen
to Piper or the baby.

1233
01:16:49,735 --> 01:16:52,237
- Yeah, but Phoebe...
- You wait here for Paige.

1234
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:54,072
I'm gonna go buy us some time.

1235
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:56,283
Phoebe!

1236
01:17:07,586 --> 01:17:11,298
Okay, I've had enough.

1237
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:13,634
Your treatment of me is shocking.

1238
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:16,929
Get it? "Shocking"?

1239
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:21,099
- Do you have a death wish?
- You're not demon enough to kill me.

1240
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:23,101
You would've done it already
if you were.

1241
01:17:23,268 --> 01:17:27,689
On the contrary.
I wasn't hungry until now.

1242
01:17:28,106 --> 01:17:32,069
But it's just about my feeding time.

1243
01:17:34,363 --> 01:17:36,657
Let her go! It's me that you want.

1244
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:41,954
Oh, look out, Phoebe,
he's packing a seashell.

1245
01:17:42,162 --> 01:17:45,165
- You know what this is?
- Yeah, auger shell.

1246
01:17:45,332 --> 01:17:46,625
Sucks eternal life.

1247
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:51,380
Look, I will give you my immortality
if you let my sister go.

1248
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:57,052
No!

1249
01:17:57,219 --> 01:18:00,931
And I promise I'll kill her
unless you give me what I want first.

1250
01:18:01,473 --> 01:18:02,975
Piper, are you okay?

1251
01:18:04,518 --> 01:18:06,186
My baby.

1252
01:18:07,938 --> 01:18:10,023
What did you do?

1253
01:18:17,239 --> 01:18:19,366
Keep your promise, witch.

1254
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:31,795
Where you been?

1255
01:18:32,546 --> 01:18:35,340
I forgot the vanquishing spell
in the attic.

1256
01:18:42,139 --> 01:18:43,515
Honey, it's okay. I'm right here.

1257
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:48,896
Phoebe!

1258
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,524
Shell!

1259
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:57,571
Piper, take Phoebe's hand.

1260
01:18:57,779 --> 01:18:59,865
Okay, prepare for a big blast.

1261
01:19:00,073 --> 01:19:01,408
Tide of evil, washed ashore

1262
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:04,077
Bring its darkness evermore

1263
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:06,079
With all our strength, we fight this fate

1264
01:19:06,246 --> 01:19:07,915
Make this evil obliterate

1265
01:20:04,805 --> 01:20:05,973
Paige, wake up.

1266
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:08,475
Paige! Wake up!

1267
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:14,982
No wonder those demons
carry warning labels.

1268
01:20:15,149 --> 01:20:16,984
Tell me about it.

1269
01:20:17,151 --> 01:20:20,821
- Leo, you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

1270
01:20:25,284 --> 01:20:26,451
Where's Piper?

1271
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:35,836
Piper.

1272
01:20:38,589 --> 01:20:40,924
I know why you've been afraid.

1273
01:20:41,091 --> 01:20:45,262
You don't want to leave your baby
the way I left you.

1274
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:51,393
But spells won't make
that fear go away, only faith will.

1275
01:20:52,311 --> 01:20:56,773
Have faith that your destiny
is different than mine.

1276
01:21:00,736 --> 01:21:02,070
Take my hand, sweetie.

1277
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:33,560
- Mom?
- No, it's okay, honey, it's us.

1278
01:21:33,936 --> 01:21:35,521
Leo, heal her stomach.

1279
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:42,569
How'd you do that?

1280
01:21:42,861 --> 01:21:43,946
I didn't.

1281
01:21:46,198 --> 01:21:48,283
- The baby did.
- What?

1282
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:52,287
I guess she takes
after her daddy.

1283
01:21:55,415 --> 01:21:56,959
That must have been
what Mom meant.

1284
01:21:57,709 --> 01:22:00,671
- Mom?
- She came to me in the water.

1285
01:22:00,838 --> 01:22:03,757
She helped me understand
why I've been so afraid.

1286
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:08,095
I don't wanna leave my baby
without a mother.

1287
01:22:08,303 --> 01:22:09,805
You have something that she didn't.

1288
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:12,850
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- Me.

1289
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:15,936
And me.

1290
01:22:20,023 --> 01:22:21,191
But not her.

1291
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:26,029
- What do we do?
- Nothing.

1292
01:22:26,196 --> 01:22:28,282
I have a feeling
she'll come back again.

1293
01:22:28,574 --> 01:22:30,075
How do you figure?

1294
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:33,787
Let's just say I have a pretty good idea
about what's going on inside her head.

1295
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:46,633
How did I get here?

1296
01:22:47,551 --> 01:22:49,052
I brought you here.

1297
01:22:49,553 --> 01:22:52,556
This isn't happening.
This can't be happening.

1298
01:22:52,723 --> 01:22:54,141
This goes beyond stalking!

1299
01:22:54,725 --> 01:22:57,102
I'm not stalking you. Paige sent me.

1300
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:01,523
I know why you ran, Phoebe.

1301
01:23:01,899 --> 01:23:03,650
You don't know anything about me.

1302
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:07,362
You thought you could escape
into this big ocean,

1303
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:09,448
that the waves
would wash away your pain.

1304
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:13,494
But they won't. Not until you admit
what drove you here in the first place.

1305
01:23:14,036 --> 01:23:16,997
I know what drove me here. You.

1306
01:23:17,164 --> 01:23:18,207
Yeah, but why?

1307
01:23:18,582 --> 01:23:21,210
And don't say because you're
scared of me, because you're not.

1308
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:26,381
Come on, you don't want to spend
eternity alone just to avoid the truth.

1309
01:23:27,257 --> 01:23:30,260
If not for me,
be honest for your own sake.

1310
01:23:30,552 --> 01:23:32,513
Don't lose yourself because of me.

1311
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:34,890
What do you want me to say?

1312
01:23:35,516 --> 01:23:37,601
You don't have to say anything.

1313
01:23:37,768 --> 01:23:41,355
All you have to do to free yourself
is admit how you truly feel about me.

1314
01:23:42,147 --> 01:23:43,899
In your heart.

1315
01:24:11,343 --> 01:24:13,762
How could you be so sure?

1316
01:24:15,139 --> 01:24:17,182
I had a feeling.

1317
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:22,563
I do love you.

1318
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:25,399
And I always will.

1319
01:24:26,275 --> 01:24:28,944
But it doesn't change anything.

1320
01:24:29,486 --> 01:24:30,779
It doesn't matter.

1321
01:24:33,574 --> 01:24:35,576
It's over between us.

1322
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:22,748
Paige.

1323
01:25:27,085 --> 01:25:30,756
I know I've been tough on you,
but I don't want you to quit.

1324
01:25:30,923 --> 01:25:32,800
You've got a real gift
for helping people.

1325
01:25:33,967 --> 01:25:35,385
Don't worry.

1326
01:25:35,552 --> 01:25:37,930
I'm gonna keep helping people.

1327
01:25:38,096 --> 01:25:41,475
I just don't wanna
split my focus anymore.

1328
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:45,729
But thanks for everything.
