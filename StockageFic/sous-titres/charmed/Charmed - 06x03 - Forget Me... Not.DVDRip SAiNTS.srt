1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,673
We don't have much time,
they're gonna follow us.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,301
- How do we stop them?
- We have to think of something.

3
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,053
We can't just let them take Wyatt.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,306
Incoming!

5
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,558
It's pointless to run.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,560
You can't have him.

7
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,440
You're only delaying
the inevitable, I'm afraid.

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:27,903
Now, if you don't mind,
we have a lot of cleaning to do.

9
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,700
No!

10
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,539
Leo!

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,748
Wyatt!

12
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,877
An Elder, good.
Perhaps you can explain it to her.

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,004
Explain? Explain what?

14
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,091
Well, do something.
Don't just stand there.

15
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,803
I can't.

16
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,014
- Nobody can.
- What the hell are you talking about?

17
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,518
Please, he's just a baby.

18
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,937
It won't happen again.
I won't let it happen again.

19
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,773
Sorry, we can't take that risk.

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,983
Don't worry.

21
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,485
You won't remember
any of this anyway.

22
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,007
What are you doing here?

23
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,551
I don't know.

24
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,345
Better go.

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,016
What were we talking about?

26
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,227
- I don't know.
- I'm beat. I'm gonna go up to bed.

27
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,480
Yeah, I'm tired too.

28
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,233
You all right?

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,653
Yeah, I just feel like
I'm forgetting something.

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,030
Like what?

31
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,615
I don't know.

32
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,367
Must not be very important.

33
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,651
Say goodbye to yesterday's rain and
"Good morning, sunshine."

34
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,028
It is a beautiful Wednesday
in San Francisco,

35
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,156
and if you're like me, you want
to forget all about yesterday.

36
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,200
I know I do. Thank you very much.

37
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,953
Any infomercials
for stain remover on there?

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,122
You have a stain
that needs removal?

39
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, I spilled coffee
on my blouse yesterday,

40
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:31,837
so that dork walking around the office
with a big old stain on her shirt,

41
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,590
- that'd be me.
- Have you tried baking soda?

42
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,510
No, it's dry-clean only,
so it's gonna eat up a half a day's pay.

43
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:43,640
The pay is lousy, your boss is
a sexist pig, why don't you just quit?

44
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,519
The job sucks
and it's just a temp job anyway.

45
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,106
Because, if I want a life
outside of magic,

46
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,275
I can't just quit
every time a job starts sucking.

47
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,527
Besides, I stuck around
with the dog-walking job,

48
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,237
and hey, I wound up
helping somebody.

49
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,655
Yeah, okay, but that was once.

50
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,158
What are the odds of something
like that happening again?

51
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,578
I don't know. But sometimes they say
you gotta ride a lot of different horses

52
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,247
on the merry-go-round
before you find what you're looking for.

53
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,916
Carousel.

54
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,125
Sorry?

55
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,336
Well, a merry-go-round
has lots of animals,

56
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,421
a carousel only has horses.

57
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,673
Okay, why do you
even know that, weirdo?

58
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,010
I have no idea.

59
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,846
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

60
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,599
- Now it's gone.
- Now what's gone?

61
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,687
I know this may sound crazy,
but I think I just heard a baby.

62
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,356
Yeah, you're crazy.

63
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,941
Piper!

64
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,943
Oh, my God, I heard something.

65
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,237
Oh, be quiet. Coming.

66
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,615
How long do you think she's gonna
spend down there, the rest of her life?

67
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,283
Yeah, long enough to be sure

68
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,495
she doesn't shove her tongue down
the throat of the next delivery guy.

69
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,330
I heard that.

70
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,749
For your information, we're lucky
that guy didn't sue me

71
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,959
for sexual harassment.

72
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,419
Well, you were
channelling his emotions.

73
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,129
That's not the point.

74
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,715
The point is, I have to figure out
how to work my new power,

75
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,469
or I'm gonna have to lock myself down
in this basement for the rest of my life.

76
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,639
Stay behind the yellow line.

77
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,519
I might channel
what you both are feeling.

78
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,021
Sure, would you like me
to toss you your breakfast?

79
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,191
What happened to your head?

80
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,026
This? I don't know.

81
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,196
I've been so scattered lately,
I must have bumped it or something.

82
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:25,325
Now, are either one of you
feeling any strong emotions?

83
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,536
Anger? Sadness?

84
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,079
Annoyance?

85
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,124
- You may proceed.
- Thanks.

86
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,169
Wait a minute.

87
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,753
One of you is feeling insecure.

88
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,219
What? I'm just feeling
a little off today, that's all.

89
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,138
Stop looking at me like that.

90
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,391
And you cut the crust off my toast,

91
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,144
and cut my eggs into little bits,

92
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:55,522
and look,
there's applesauce and milk.

93
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,692
Piper, I'm not in second grade.

94
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,987
I just thought maybe you'd like
some milk, for some strong bones.

95
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,323
Okay, what is going on
with you, lady?

96
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,993
Carousels, hearing babies
and now milk for strong bones.

97
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,037
Wait, you were hearing babies?

98
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:13,707
Forget it, I'm sure it's nothing.
Forget it.

99
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,546
- Hey, Elise, how'd you like the...?
- You're not getting off that easy.

100
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,964
- What?
- Just get in here!

101
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:25,427
No, I can't come in today
because I am very sick.

102
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,599
Yesterday you completely
turned the office upside down!

103
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,267
Wait, but I didn't come in yesterday.

104
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,769
- Yes, you did!
- Oh, I did?

105
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,313
I don't care if that was
a Phoebe Halliwell look-alike,

106
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,440
you get your butt in here now
or it's your job!

107
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,443
- Do you understand? I mean it!
- Oh, okay.

108
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,238
What was that about?

109
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,614
That was Elise.

110
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,617
She wants me to come
into work ASAP, or it's my job.

111
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,118
Your job? Why would she say that?

112
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:53,664
I have no idea.
Something about yesterday.

113
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,375
Must have bumped my head
pretty hard, huh?

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,628
Well, looks like you're gonna
have to brave the big, bad world.

115
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,923
- Want me to give you a ride?
- No, I'll drive.

116
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,634
This way I can get in and out fast.

117
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,888
Hey, don't forget your coats.
It might rain.

118
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,349
Would you stop
mothering us, please?

119
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,775
Ritz, Teukolsky and Ruben.
Please hold.

120
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,320
Ritz, Teukolsky and Ruben.
Please hold.

121
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,322
Who are you holding for?

122
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,701
You wouldn't happen to need
any help with anything, would you?

123
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,786
Flo, what happened?

124
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,664
I just got fired,
that's what happened.

125
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:40,085
What? Oh, not you.
You call back, or something.

126
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,090
I don't understand. Why?

127
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,800
You ought to know.

128
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,012
No, I don't, and I want to help,
believe me,

129
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:53,265
but I can't help unless you tell me,
you know, why you were fired.

130
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,976
So Mr. Stewick
gets me in his office and says,

131
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,395
either I go out with him again,
or he fires me.

132
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,814
I didn't take his offer.

133
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,359
So he told me to pack up.
My word against his, you know?

134
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,445
I would have gone in
with you if you asked.

135
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,906
I did, I asked you yesterday.

136
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,284
Obviously, I don't rank high enough
in importance for you to remember.

137
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,995
No, no, seriously,
I would remember that.

138
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,664
Excuse me, do you mind?

139
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,419
Back to the phones, Francine.

140
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,297
Paige. My name is Paige.

141
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:29,009
Whatever. You're a temp.
Do you wanna help people?

142
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:33,514
Sit your pretty ass back down,
answer the damn phone.

143
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,320
- Hey.
- Hey.

144
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,699
Leo, hey!

145
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,536
I didn't know you were coming here.

146
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,288
I can see that.
Are you drinking beer?

147
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:00,874
I was gonna pay for that.

148
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,876
Chris, what are you doing
sitting around here?

149
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,046
Aren't you supposed to be
getting to know your new charge?

150
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,634
Oh, hi, Leo.

151
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,094
Okay, look, before you get mad,

152
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:15,097
you're the one who wanted me
to have a charge in the first place.

153
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:18,267
- Yeah, to protect her.
- Oh, he was using protection.

154
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,102
Yeah, I don't think
that's what he meant.

155
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,353
Are you out of your mind?

156
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,481
Aside from this being out of line,
it's completely against the rules.

157
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,859
Yeah, you're one to talk.

158
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,069
Oh, I don't think that's his point.

159
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,574
Why don't I just...

160
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,201
...leave you two alone?

161
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,997
Look, I was just having a little fun,
what's the big deal?

162
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,249
It's not like I have anything
pressing to do anyway.

163
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,834
You don't have anything pressing?

164
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,713
Then why exactly did you come back
from the future in the first place?

165
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,384
I don't know.

166
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,887
- I forgot.
- You forgot.

167
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,351
- Do you hear that?
- What?

168
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,397
Never mind.
We'll talk about this later.

169
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,361
Is he gone?

170
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,838
I don't care what she says, Phoebe,
I always wanted to do what you did,

171
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,548
and man, was it good
to see you do it!

172
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:35,135
Oh, thanks for your support, Frank.

173
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:47,439
- Hey, Elise, what is going on out...?
- Sit.

174
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,615
I wanted to talk to you alone
before I involved any lawyers.

175
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,242
Lawyers? What...?

176
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,163
I'm not going to pretend that the only
reason you're still working here

177
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,998
is that you're an asset
to the paper.

178
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,543
But what the hell
came over you yesterday?

179
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:08,877
Yesterday?

180
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:12,297
Because there are three workers
out with injuries.

181
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:17,010
Jackie's got a broken nose!
Not to mention...

182
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,513
Yeah, that does look
like it hurts a lot.

183
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,433
It's all I can do
to keep lawsuits from pouring in.

184
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,894
If there were, perhaps,
a reasonable explanation

185
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,437
for your behaviour yesterday...

186
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,524
Elise, I'm sorry. But I honestly
have no idea what you're talking about.

187
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,276
Phoebe!

188
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:45,330
I'm feeling a lot worse. I gotta go.

189
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,044
Okay, here we go.
All right, come on, sweetheart.

190
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,255
Now, don't be fussy.

191
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,008
You hungry?

192
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,552
Don't be fussy.
Do you want a bottle?

193
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,724
You know, if you bounce a little,
and make a shushing sound,

194
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,602
it usually helps. Hi.

195
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,107
Wow, that was amazing.
How did you calm him down so fast?

196
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,819
Well, the shushing sound supposedly
reminds them of the womb.

197
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:19,239
Amazing. You must be a terrific mom
to know all this stuff.

198
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,367
No, actually, I don't have kids.

199
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,786
Really? Guess I just assumed.

200
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,830
Oh, well, I always wanted them.

201
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,333
I babysat a lot, but...

202
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,251
I should go.

203
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:36,924
- My diapers?
- Oh, sorry.

204
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,800
- Thank you.
- Got it?

205
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,387
Yep. You okay, sweetheart?
Want some chips?

206
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,030
Leo.

207
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:03,200
Piper, what are you doing here?

208
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:04,618
What am I doing here?

209
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,411
No, that's not what I meant.

210
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,163
It's just...

211
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,375
- I shouldn't be here.
- No, you shouldn't.

212
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,919
I mean, I asked you to stay away
for a good reason.

213
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,921
So that I could learn
to live without you.

214
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:17,130
I know.

215
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,633
And if you just keep orbing in
whenever you feel like it,

216
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,426
that's not really gonna help me.

217
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,596
You're right. I'm sorry. It's just...

218
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,017
Never mind, I should be going.

219
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,311
What were you gonna say?

220
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,064
Nothing.

221
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,818
You haven't by any chance...

222
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,571
I know this is gonna sound
a little weird.

223
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,615
- Been hearing things lately,
have you?

224
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,951
- Hearing things?
- Yeah, you know, like,

225
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,579
I could swear a couple times today,
I heard a...

226
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,664
- A baby?
- You too?

227
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,292
Pretty strange, huh?

228
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,879
- Do you think it means anything?
- I don't know.

229
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,299
I mean, maybe it's just that
we both regret not having children.

230
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,011
Which... Why didn't we?

231
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,806
I don't know. We both wanted to.

232
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,643
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

233
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,604
Piper, we need you upstairs!

234
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,647
Be right there.

235
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:18,734
You should probably go.

236
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:22,446
But what if you need help?
What if it's a demon?

237
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,574
Leo, you're not our whitelighter
anymore. Chris is.

238
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,451
Except he's busy.

239
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:30,579
I gave him another witch
to look after yesterday.

240
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:34,541
Well, then I guess we're just gonna
have to handle it alone, won't we?

241
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:40,881
So you're saying you started a riot
but you don't remember it?

242
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,716
Yeah, it must have been
how this happened,

243
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,468
and why Elise was so mad at me.

244
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,386
I thought Elise was just like that.

245
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,138
Well, yeah, she kind of is.

246
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,640
Hey, you okay?

247
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,975
I'm feeling a very emotional vibe
from you right now.

248
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,977
I'm fine. Stop that.

249
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,855
What I don't understand is,
if you don't remember the riot,

250
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,357
how do you know you started it?

251
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:02,194
I had a vision. And by the way,
the vision occurred yesterday.

252
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,446
Maybe you were channelling
somebody else's anger.

253
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,698
Probably, I just don't remember.

254
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:10,452
So you both have events that
you can't remember from yesterday.

255
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,746
Yeah, there was the riot,
and Paige's blouse.

256
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:16,208
And this thing with this girl Flo
from work. Did you forget anything?

257
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,670
You're asking me to remember
what I've apparently forgotten?

258
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:25,634
I don't know. I remember getting up,
I remember going downstairs,

259
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,678
but the rest is kind of a blur.

260
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,638
I think somebody's messing with us.

261
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:30,848
Making us forget.

262
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,767
But these all seem
like such random moments to forget.

263
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:34,977
Where's the connection?

264
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:39,439
Well, that's why we wrote a spell:
To fill in the blanks.

265
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,317
We know you might be reluctant
because of what happened

266
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,319
the last time we cast a spell
on your memory...

267
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,530
No, you're right. Let's do it.

268
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,782
- Really?
- Something's going on.

269
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,826
The only thing
we don't know is what.

270
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,536
All right, here we go.

271
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,413
"Moments lost make witches wonder

272
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,915
Warlocks plot or demons plunder

273
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,375
If this is not a prank

274
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,210
Help us to fill in the blanks"

275
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:07,759
It's raining.

276
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:08,969
Hey, your Band-Aid's gone.

277
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,929
And you're wearing that blouse.

278
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,640
Except for I've got no coffee stain.

279
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,935
Oh, my God.

280
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,282
I remember now. I'm a mom.

281
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:39,124
Today is yesterday.

282
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,044
Well, the spell didn't return our
memories, it just rewound the day.

283
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,253
Yeah, but why?

284
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,174
Why else? To help us remember what
somebody obviously wants us to forget.

285
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,968
Okay, but how could I have possibly
forgotten about Wyatt?

286
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,970
What could have happened
to make that happen?

287
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,848
Piper, it's not just you.
We were all made to forget about him.

288
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,517
And a whole bunch of other things.

289
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,103
But I'm his mother,
it's my job to protect him and I failed.

290
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,813
Don't be ridiculous, you did not fail.

291
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:06,777
Okay, now he's fussing.
Come on, sweetie, it's okay.

292
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,071
And now I can't get him
to stop fussing.

293
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,781
Well, you're just feeling insecure.

294
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,784
And Wyatt is feeling...

295
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,954
...very, very sad right now.

296
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,874
Poor little guy. See, this is why
I lock myself in the basement.

297
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,209
I am a wreck.

298
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,711
Okay, we're kind of against
the clock right now.

299
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,880
Maybe we should just
take it into the other room.

300
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:30,634
- I think that's a good idea.
- Okay, bud, here we go.

301
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:32,845
Here we go, okay.

302
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,763
Hey, lookie, how about this?

303
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,016
You like this guy? Hello. No?

304
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,476
Pheebs, a little help here.

305
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,563
We hate that toy.
It's yucky and crusty and gross.

306
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,940
Okay, then what does he want?

307
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,610
That.

308
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:50,946
Yeah, see, I am a failure.

309
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,991
No, you're not. We just happen to have
more pressing concerns right now

310
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,534
than the media's influence.

311
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,202
Okay?

312
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,874
Okay.

313
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,417
R-E-D.

314
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:08,213
Okay, sweetie, Mommy will just
be in the next room okay? Okay.

315
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,010
O-R-A-N-G-E. Orange.

316
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,971
G-R-E-E-N. Green.

317
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,852
- On the uneven parallel bars...

318
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,860
Okay, we remember everything
that happened before today, right?

319
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,069
Yeah, but...

320
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:34,031
And we're not gonna remember
everything unless we do something.

321
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,782
Paige, don't be impatient with me.

322
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,660
I'm feeling so much today,
I don't need this too.

323
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,454
Okay, all I'm saying is,

324
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,623
whatever caused us to forget
is gonna happen next.

325
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,000
We just have to relive this day
and see where it leads.

326
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,002
Yeah, but if we're not careful,
where it leads

327
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,254
will be right back where
we started, without Wyatt.

328
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,590
Except we know something
is gonna happen to him,

329
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,300
so all we have to do
is look for clues,

330
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,260
keep our eyes open and stop it.

331
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,304
How are we supposed to know
what's important?

332
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,681
It's all important
because it's all connected to Wyatt,

333
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,475
so we just have to see
the connection.

334
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,352
So you're supposed
to go to your temp job

335
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,270
and wait for coffee
to be spilled on you?

336
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,523
Yeah, exactly. So much
for my life outside of magic.

337
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,274
Now, you,
you have got to go to work...

338
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:13,445
Start a riot and get a cut on my head
and lose my job? No, thank you.

339
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,365
You have to.
It's the only way to save Wyatt.

340
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,984
So I guess I'm supposed
to stay home...

341
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,653
Wyatt?

342
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,328
How did those open?

343
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:05,414
Must have been the wind.

344
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,874
But they were locked.

345
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,667
Could be a clue, let's remember it.

346
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,378
- You gonna be okay here by yourself?
- Do I have a choice?

347
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,714
Wanna switch with me?

348
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,883
Okay, just call us
if anything weird happens.

349
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,144
You're kidding, right?

350
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,605
I don't have time for another charge.

351
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,524
- Why not?
- Because I just don't.

352
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,860
Why do you want me to oversee
another witch, anyway?

353
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:38,197
Because I want to see
what you can do, what you can handle.

354
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:41,116
Oh, please, you just don't want me
around the sisters all the time

355
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,202
because you don't trust me.

356
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:46,246
Chris, protecting charges
is what we do.

357
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:50,042
And besides, when I was
a whitelighter, I had other charges.

358
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,753
Leo, I didn't come all the way
from the future

359
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,631
to protect and oversee
other charges.

360
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,008
I came for one reason,
and one reason only.

361
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:01,053
- To protect Wyatt.
- Yeah.

362
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,764
From some demon
who will attack in the future

363
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,140
but you're not sure which one.

364
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,643
Hey, man, fine, whatever.
Don't believe me.

365
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,939
All I'm saying is, there is no way I'm
taking on another charge and that's...

366
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,650
...that.

367
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,195
- Hi, Leo, sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

368
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,533
You must be Chris.

369
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,411
I'm Natalie.

370
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:29,081
Maybe just one more.

371
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,838
Phoebe, thank God you came in.

372
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,756
The server crashed
and we lost your column.

373
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:40,509
- Do you have a hard copy?
- I'll check in my office.

374
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,053
It's not what you did, Elise,
it's how you did it.

375
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,389
Well, lucky I'm editor.
I don't care what you think.

376
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:47,891
- Don't think we're done here, mister!
- Screw you, Elise!

377
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:00,821
You think that's funny, huh?

378
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:06,368
Hold it! Wait! Don't!

379
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:17,421
Stay calm, just stay calm. Just,
you know, tell me what happened.

380
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:20,465
Mr. Stewick has been asking me out
ever since I got here.

381
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,343
- Okay, so you went on a date.
- Well, if you could call it a date.

382
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,679
He tried to grab my ass,
I threw a drink in his face.

383
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,764
I have avoided him ever since.
I'm so stupid!

384
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,267
I shouldn't have gone out with him
in the first place.

385
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:32,436
Okay, so tell me
what happened next.

386
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:35,522
Next. Next, he wants me
to meet him in his office

387
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,482
tomorrow morning, bright and early.

388
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,068
He says it's official.

389
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:44,239
I need this job, but I'm afraid
to face him alone.

390
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,908
Do you think
you could come with me?

391
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:49,119
Of course, absolutely.

392
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,330
I don't know how I could forget this.

393
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:52,915
Forget what?

394
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,167
Oh, nothing.

395
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,669
Well, this is just so typical
of my luck with men.

396
00:22:57,836 --> 00:23:00,506
I mean, not that you need
to hear me complain but...

397
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,591
Oh, hey, watch out.

398
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,844
- Coffee.
- I am so sorry. L...

399
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,222
- It's okay.
- It's just, something...

400
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,098
...weird just flew by the window.
It's...

401
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,600
Something, something what?

402
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:14,728
Spit it out, spit it out.

403
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:18,232
Well, to be honest with you,
it looked a little like a...

404
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,609
...a dragon.

405
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:21,985
A dragon.

406
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:30,160
Oh, that is so not good.

407
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:33,330
All right, sweetie, come on.

408
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:37,209
Mommy's gotta find something
to make sure nothing happens to you.

409
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:38,961
Here. Look, look, look.

410
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,381
Right, you hate this. You hate this.

411
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:45,843
Okay, I'm sorry.

412
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:49,304
Did I forget
how to be a mommy too?

413
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,809
Wyatt, what are you doing? Wyatt.

414
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,151
Oh, my God!

415
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:17,749
You son of a bitch!

416
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,252
Phoebe! No! Phoebe! No!

417
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:21,461
Snap out of it!

418
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,173
Oh, no, did I do all this?

419
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:27,342
Forget all that,
we gotta get out of here.

420
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,970
Phoebe, I figured out what
we're supposed to be remembering.

421
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,431
I'd be happier just forgetting,
I think, at this point.

422
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:35,976
No, no, you wouldn't. Phoebe,
there's a dragon loose in the city!

423
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:38,061
Did you say dragon?

424
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,190
Come on.

425
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,074
Wyatt, you're making Mommy
very nervous.

426
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,534
What are we doing here?

427
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:54,411
What is it?

428
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:57,831
- What's up?
- Where are you?

429
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,041
Where am I?

430
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,918
I'm standing outside
of the Presidio tunnel

431
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,419
where your nephew just orbed me.

432
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,546
What did you just say?

433
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,132
He did what?

434
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:09,843
Are you out of your mind?
Aren't you afraid of exposure?

435
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,637
Yeah, that's why we called.

436
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:14,264
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

437
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:18,936
I think she's talking about that.

438
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:34,243
Police here at the tunnel are saying
it's a miracle no one was hurt

439
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,370
although three cars were destroyed.

440
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:39,706
They haven't ruled out terrorism,
of course, but at the moment,

441
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,459
they are focusing
on some rather bizarre reports

442
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:47,506
of a giant bird, which one witness
went on record as saying:

443
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:51,677
"Shot fire out of its mouth at cars,
like a dragon."

444
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:58,225
Well, as far as clues go, I'd say that's
a pretty huge one, wouldn't you?

445
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,352
- Sorry.
- No,

446
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,355
it's not my pain I'm reacting to,
it's your pain.

447
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:07,234
Oh, well, then you should be feeling
a little irritated then too.

448
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:10,112
Piper, why are you blaming yourself?
It's not your fault.

449
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:13,365
Okay, number one, I haven't
actually verbalized guilt yet.

450
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:16,326
So in the future, let me confess
before you analyse.

451
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:17,828
Right.

452
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,539
Secondly, it is my fault because
I'm the one that plopped Wyatt

453
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,666
in front of the electronic babysitter.

454
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,587
- Any idea what she's talking about?
- No, not a clue.

455
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:29,923
You want some clues,
try this one on for size.

456
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,887
Before you left, Wyatt was watching a
TV show about... Wait for it... . Dragons.

457
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,471
Oh, he was watching a kid show.

458
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,974
Well, apparently
he magically changed the channel.

459
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:41,935
Of course, that was before
he magically orbed me to the tunnel

460
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,354
- to find his new friend.
- He did all of that?

461
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:49,860
Wait a second. So you're saying
Wyatt conjured a dragon.

462
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:52,112
Yep, right out of the TV.

463
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,906
Oh, you must be so proud!

464
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,533
- Yeah, or a little irritated.
- Right.

465
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,204
Okay, if this is true, your little boy
is developing some serious powers.

466
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,291
Yeah, the kind that unleashes
Godzilla on an unsuspecting city.

467
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,210
How am I supposed to handle this?

468
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,213
Well, at least now we know
how we lost our memories.

469
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,465
I mean, obviously, anything
connected to the dragon,

470
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:14,092
no matter how remote, was erased.

471
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:16,637
You know, what, coffee stains, riots.

472
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,263
The question is by whom?

473
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,684
Come on, you guys. So Wyatt
made a little magical mess.

474
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,729
- We've dealt with worse, we'll fix it.
- Perhaps we can help.

475
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:34,279
- Who are you?
- We're known as the Cleaners.

476
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,949
- And we're here to help.
- The Cleaners?

477
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:38,826
When magic is exposed,

478
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,494
we're the ones who cover it up,

479
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:42,162
remove all evidence.

480
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,082
Erase any memories,
whatever is necessary.

481
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,501
You're the ones
who are going to take Wyatt.

482
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:51,296
Well, we won't have to
if you can eliminate the exposure risk.

483
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:56,009
Exposure? You're here to take
my son away, you son of a bitch!

484
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:01,598
I understand your anger.

485
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:04,476
Now you need
to understand our position.

486
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:06,061
We're a neutral party.

487
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:08,897
We exist only to protect magic.

488
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:12,943
To that end,
your son has become... a problem.

489
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,404
- Easy.
- However,

490
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:18,949
based upon your past success
in covering up your own magic,

491
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:21,243
we've decided to give you a chance...

492
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,703
One chance only.

493
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,832
...to take care of the problem
yourselves before it gets out of hand.

494
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:28,083
And if we can't?

495
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:31,587
Then we'll have to
take care of it for you.

496
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:35,507
You can't make us forget everything.

497
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,759
There may be some
distant echoes that remain,

498
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:40,888
maybe a sense of déjá vu
here and there,

499
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,306
but like most people,

500
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,017
you'll just pass it off
as absent-mindedness and move on.

501
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,728
- Well, we're not like most people.
- It won't matter.

502
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,813
Clean it up.

503
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,732
Or we will.

504
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,530
At least now
we know what happened.

505
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,949
Too bad we just
won't remember any of it.

506
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:04,036
All right, I think we have
the upper hand on this one, don't we?

507
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:08,957
I mean, we know that we're recalling
the same day, they obviously don't.

508
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:12,461
None of this is gonna help unless
we can eliminate Wyatt's dragon.

509
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:14,463
- Piper.
- Go to the Book, work on the dragon.

510
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,006
Do not take your eyes off Wyatt.

511
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:17,216
Where are you going?

512
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,343
To call a higher power.

513
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:25,307
Leo! Leo, I know you can hear me.

514
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:28,352
I know I told you to go away,
but I really need you.

515
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,771
Wyatt's in trouble!

516
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:33,482
What do you mean?
What happened?

517
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:35,901
There's no time, just tell me
how to stop the Cleaners.

518
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,112
The Cleaners? Are they after him?

519
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,322
Yeah.

520
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:41,615
What the hell happened?

521
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:44,618
Well, he conjured a little dragon.

522
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:46,328
Piper, how could you
let that happen?

523
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:48,455
How could I let that happen?

524
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:52,084
You take off and suddenly
I'm responsible for every little thing?

525
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:53,585
This is not a little thing.

526
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:55,504
Yeah, well,
where the hell were you?

527
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:57,464
Why weren't you watching over
his every move

528
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:59,091
up there on your lofty perch?

529
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:00,509
Okay, that's not what I meant.

530
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:03,345
Then don't say it, because I'm beating
myself up enough about this

531
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:06,306
and I don't need you
beating me up too.

532
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,184
Sorry.

533
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,979
I'm just scared.

534
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:15,190
Yeah, so am I.
That's why I called you.

535
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:18,026
Because I'm about to lose our son
and I don't know what to do.

536
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:19,987
So please help me!

537
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,613
- Piper, if I could...
- No.

538
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,575
Don't say it, don't say anything
about Elders or rules,

539
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,660
because you know what?
He is your son, Leo.

540
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:27,911
There are no rules.

541
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:30,998
I'm telling you, the Cleaners
are empowered by both good and evil.

542
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:33,375
- You can't stop them.
- There has to be a way.

543
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,669
You don't understand, there isn't.

544
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:39,006
Cleaners have the power
to rewrite history, you can't fight that.

545
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:43,343
No, you don't understand!
I can't do this! I cannot lose Wyatt too!

546
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:46,263
Piper, you weren't
put in this position to lose Wyatt,

547
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,141
which means there is a way,
you just have to find it.

548
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:51,310
- But how?
- I don't know.

549
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:54,146
But if anybody can find it, you can.

550
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:58,066
You know, maybe
it's not a magical solution.

551
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,860
Maybe it's...

552
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:02,321
...maternal.

553
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:05,908
Deep down inside, you can find it.

554
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:07,993
I know you can.

555
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,547
Hey, you all right?

556
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:23,300
I don't know. Ask me again
when this is all over.

557
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:26,053
- Was Leo any help?
- I'm not sure yet.

558
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,262
Anything on the dragon?

559
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:30,390
No, dragons predate the Book.

560
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:33,268
One thing I do know is that
we're gonna have to get a tooth, scale,

561
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:36,480
some piece of him in order to make
the vanquishing potion even work.

562
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:38,148
Yeah, we're just kind of winging it,

563
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:41,068
making the most powerful potion
that we can.

564
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,278
- Phoebe?
- What happened? Are you all right?

565
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,864
I am, but someone's not.

566
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,700
Actually a bunch of people aren't.

567
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,828
People?
Like people out there, people?

568
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:55,707
I don't know. All I know is I've never
felt such pain and fear before in my life.

569
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:58,627
- Is it the dragon?
- Grab the potion.

570
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:01,046
Wyatt, sweetie, come on.

571
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:04,007
Remember your friend, Mr. Dragon?

572
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:06,510
What do you say
we find the dragon?

573
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,639
Look out! Look out!

574
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:15,894
Get out of here!

575
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:19,815
Get... Get back in here!

576
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:21,650
Get down!

577
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:23,026
Run!

578
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:25,195
Hurry, come on!

579
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,323
Help! Help!

580
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,118
God, it looks like a war zone.

581
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:41,795
Oh, God, looks like it made a nest.

582
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:43,589
Let's hope it's not laying any eggs.

583
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:48,135
Think you can steal
a scale for the potion?

584
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:51,430
I'll try. Scale!

585
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:58,812
- I think I woke it up.
- No, I think you pissed it off.

586
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:11,783
Okay, if you're sensing any fear,
it would be mine.

587
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:14,161
- I think we should go.
- Wait.

588
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:16,830
- Wait for what?
- Wyatt.

589
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:18,874
Piper, what are you doing?

590
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,876
No time to explain,
just make sure he sees me.

591
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:22,336
Piper, come back!

592
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:31,845
Come on, you fire-breathing lizard,
come and get me!

593
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:37,643
- Piper, are you nuts?
- Stay there.

594
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:38,852
We have to stop her.

595
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,774
I think I know what she's doing.

596
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:45,567
Come on, Wyatt,
don't let Mommy down.

597
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:01,625
Piper!

598
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:05,254
I'm okay. I'm okay.

599
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,340
Hi, little man, you did it!

600
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:11,176
I knew you could do it. Good job.

601
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:13,345
Okay, I'm confused.
What just happened?

602
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:15,556
That was the greatest
power there is.

603
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,724
A mother-and-child bond.

604
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,393
Especially when that child is Wyatt.

605
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,353
So you're saying
he vanquished the dragon,

606
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,021
and you knew he was gonna do it.

607
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:26,525
Well, I was hoping he wouldn't want
anything bad to happen to me.

608
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:31,530
Okay, well that solved that problem.
Now what do we do with this mess?

609
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:35,701
- We'll figure it out.
- No, actually, you won't.

610
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:39,329
Wait, we did what you asked,
we got rid of the dragon.

611
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,081
But not the exposure risk.

612
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:45,252
- The boy.
- No, you can't.

613
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:52,384
We don't have much time,
they're gonna follow us.

614
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:54,761
- How do we stop them?
- We have to think of something.

615
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,430
We can't just let them take Wyatt.

616
00:34:57,848 --> 00:34:58,974
Incoming!

617
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:02,311
I will not lose him.

618
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,276
No!

619
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:12,905
Don't worry.

620
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:15,866
You won't remember
any of this anyway.

621
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:29,713
Do you remember?

622
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,340
Absolutely everything.

623
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:33,175
The spell must have worked.

624
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:37,137
But not for Wyatt. He's gone.

625
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:59,701
Nothing. I can't find
the Cleaners anywhere.

626
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:01,787
Well, they have to exist
somewhere, don't they?

627
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:05,833
Not necessarily. Not even
on our plane, not even in our time.

628
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,459
Maybe we should
just summon them.

629
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,628
- And then what?
- I don't know.

630
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:11,129
Maybe we should call Leo again.

631
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:13,465
I don't think he can help
more than he already has.

632
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:17,094
- How did he help last time?
- By reminding me that I can do this.

633
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:22,099
You know, maybe we are
going about this all wrong.

634
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:23,851
Maybe instead of trying to stop them,

635
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:26,228
we should be trying to get them
to stop us.

636
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:27,479
You lost me.

637
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,106
Well, when magic is exposed,

638
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:32,109
- it's their job to clean it up, right?
- Yeah, so?

639
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:35,154
So why can't we expose our magic
and force them to deal with us?

640
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,324
Yeah, but if we do that,
what's to stop them from erasing us?

641
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:41,201
They wouldn't dare.

642
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:44,288
So let's give them
something to clean up.

643
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,499
The Doppler radar for the Bay Area
shows us that storm

644
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:48,917
is already on its way out.

645
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:52,754
So looks like San Francisco
is finally gonna get some good news.

646
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:56,258
Those scattered showers overnight
turning partly sunny by morn...

647
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:59,094
- Whoa! What the...?
- Hi. How you doing?

648
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:01,513
Why don't we get a skycam view
of that, shall we?

649
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,809
Help! Get me down from here!

650
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:07,936
Don't... Don't let go! Don't let go!

651
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:10,105
I don't know
what's happening here, l...

652
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,815
Well, it's called magic, Kaneisha.

653
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,026
Witchcraft, specifically.

654
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:16,737
I really love your jacket!

655
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:24,328
Want to see more magic?

656
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:26,788
Let's check in with Piper
at the Golden Gate Bridge.

657
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:28,999
Take it away, Piper!

658
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:34,546
Let the object of objection
Become but a dream

659
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:38,050
As I cause the scene
To become unseen

660
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:45,015
You might want to take an alternate
route to work in the morning.

661
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,979
Not so bad. You should
get out more often.

662
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:53,023
Yeah, Pheebs,
time to come out of the basement.

663
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,650
Maybe you're right.

664
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,110
What do you think you're doing?

665
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:59,279
Are you out of your minds?

666
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:00,906
Oh, hey, hi.

667
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:02,991
Did you see our little magic act?

668
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:04,701
How is it you still
have your memory?

669
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:08,247
Oh, I think we still have a few
surprises that you don't know about.

670
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:10,082
Yeah, and if you don't
return our nephew,

671
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,084
you might found out about
just a few more.

672
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:13,669
This is pointless.

673
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:16,547
Whatever you do, we'll simply erase.

674
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:19,258
- Or we'll erase you.
- You can't.

675
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,510
Not if you're truly neutral, that is.

676
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:23,262
Because, you see,
if you get rid of us,

677
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:25,973
you tip the balance of power
from good to evil.

678
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,684
And now, that's hardly
being neutral, now is it?

679
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,436
You will give me my son back.

680
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:34,773
Or I swear to you, the only thing
you will be doing for the next 50 years,

681
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,067
is cleaning up after us.

682
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:44,491
If we do return him, how do you know
you'll be able to control him?

683
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:47,578
I'm his mother.
If anybody can, I can.

684
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,218
Everything is as it was.

685
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:05,345
We've erased all evidence
of your son's magic.

686
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:09,892
- We'll leave him in your care.
- For now.

687
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:13,478
Oh, one more thing.

688
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:16,481
Please, if you could just do me
a little, teensy-weensy little favour

689
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:18,984
and erase that whole riot
I caused at the office.

690
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:22,529
Because I don't want to lose my job.
That would really suck.

691
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:26,617
Might throw off that balance thing
because I'd be distracted, you know.

692
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:29,912
It's done.

693
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:32,331
Good luck.

694
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:36,126
Because, believe me,
you're going to need it.

695
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:40,422
You're okay.
I'm so happy to see you.

696
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:42,966
- Don't smash him.
- I'm so happy to see you.

697
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:48,013
I can't help it, this is just very exciting.
He's back. We're back.

698
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,223
Coffee stain and all.

699
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:52,059
Yeah, what are you gonna do
about your job, are you gonna keep it?

700
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:55,145
Yeah, I think I will,
just so I can see what happens next.

701
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:10,410
Exactly what are you saying?

702
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:14,581
Unless you make it worth my while...

703
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:17,543
...I may find
your performance here...

704
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:19,044
...lacking.

705
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:22,840
Mr. Stewick, please, I need this job.

706
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:25,425
And that is why I'm giving
you an opportunity to keep it.

707
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:28,303
If you catch my meaning.

708
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:34,768
Absolutely.

709
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:37,020
You know, I like a man
who knows what he wants

710
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:39,857
and isn't afraid to ask for it.

711
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:43,360
Now are you afraid to come get it?

712
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:49,199
You mean, right here and now?

713
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:51,827
Yeah?

714
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:58,542
- Yeah, hold my calls, please.
- Yes, Mr. Stewick.

715
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,170
Flower pot!

716
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:16,476
Oh, Paige, I thought you were...

717
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:21,398
What happened?

718
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:24,610
Well, you see, I overheard
Mr. Stewick threatening you.

719
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:27,571
He'll be real lucky if you don't sue.

720
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:29,406
Just go with it.

721
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:36,079
Thanks, Paige, for whatever
you just did for me in here.

722
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:39,833
I was wondering why I took this job,
and now I know.

723
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,961
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

724
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,468
- Hey.
- Hey.

725
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:51,136
I didn't know you were coming here.

726
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:52,804
What are you still doing here, Chris?

727
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,973
Shouldn't you be getting
to know your new charge?

728
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,850
Yeah, about that.

729
00:41:57,017 --> 00:42:01,104
I'm... I'm going back
to what I originally said.

730
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,106
I don't have time for her.

731
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:05,192
- Chris.
- Leo, I mean it.

732
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,237
Because whether you believe me
or not, I'm here to protect Wyatt.

733
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:09,863
Not other charges.

734
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:12,658
Other than the sisters, of course.

735
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:15,077
If that's how you feel,
I guess I'll reassign her.

736
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:17,329
Thank you.
