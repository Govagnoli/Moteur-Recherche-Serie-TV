1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:03,698
All we need to do is think of one look,

2
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:07,200
one disguise that we wanna project
to the rest of the world.

3
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:08,978
Previously on Charmed.

4
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:12,889
I should have gone taller.
I always wanted to be taller.

5
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:13,796
Why did you go blond?

6
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:16,224
I don't know.
I didn't have time to think about it.

7
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:17,570
They think I'm somebody else.

8
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:18,759
You are somebody else.

9
00:00:18,996 --> 00:00:21,364
But I'm not a fugitive.
That's not the alias that I picked,

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,048
at least not intentionnally.

11
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:25,776
So, missy, where do you gonna
take your next alias from?

12
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,787
- Time magazine?
- I think I can come up with this one on my own, thank you.

13
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:31,634
- Just make sure it's not one of the most wanted at least, ok?
- Trust me.

14
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,269
- Dex Lawson, nice to meet you Dex.
- You too.

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,545
So what happened to the demon?

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,511
I don't know.

17
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:46,330
This chick came along
and just scared him off.

18
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:47,303
What chick?

19
00:00:47,582 --> 00:00:48,464
I'm here because you need me, right?

20
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:52,534
So the more you teach me, the more I can get out there
and go kick some demon ass.

21
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:55,794
We wanna keep to use magic to a minimum
so the demons don't find out that we're still alive.

22
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:05,191
Knowing how untrained and untrailed magic
could lead to disaster, the one in Atlantis

23
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:06,968
being the prime example,

24
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:10,653
the Elders knew that
they needed a nature young magic.

25
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:16,030
The Elders knew that
they needed a nature young magic.

26
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:17,528
Billie.

27
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,328
Billie, are you listenning to me?

28
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:24,093
Yeah yeah. Entering magic.
Elders, yeah.

29
00:01:24,353 --> 00:01:26,772
Ok, listen. If you're gonna take over
the fight for the greater good,

30
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:28,426
I really don't think it's a bad idea

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,421
if... you... know the history of good magic.

32
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:34,156
Listen, Paige wanted me
to teach you something good.

33
00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:36,754
And I think you're kind of
making me look bad.

34
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:39,841
Oh come on. You could be teaching me
"tic tac toe", she wouldn't care.

35
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:41,971
She's just happy of getting
me out of her back for the day.

36
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:43,356
Ok, so.

37
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:47,938
The magical community knew it needed
a place to a nature young magic. So

38
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,999
the Elders created magic school.

39
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:53,055
Yeah you know, I just imagine
a bunch of old fats in robes,

40
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:56,020
lecturing on the moral applications
of magic.

41
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,249
There's that. There's also advanced courses on telekinesis,
spell casting, potion making,

42
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:02,019
Wait, what?

43
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:05,582
astral projection, and medieval... weaponry.

44
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:06,789
They really teach that stuff?

45
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:12,756
This is so cool!

46
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:19,356
Oh sorry.

47
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,301

Particular thanks to Any1

53
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,728
Ok, either there's a gremlin
infesting in this house

54
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:30,076
otherwise our orby fingers got
the whole of my jewelry.

55
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,291
Jewels?

56
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:34,020
This so early in the morning,
what's the occasion?

57
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:36,619
I have a coffee date.

58
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:39,938
I'm trying to get out of here before
Leo changes his mind about training Billie.

59
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:40,740
Oh yeah!

60
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,768
Oh nice try little pirate.
I see what you've got here.

61
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:47,827
Thanks a lot, matey.

62
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:50,579
Oh Wyatt, honey, mummy said no magic.

63
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:54,178
Oh it's good to know you're more
worried about him using magic

64
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:56,563
than you are about him... stealing.

65
00:03:56,824 --> 00:04:01,897
Actually I'm more concerned with him blowing our cover
with this school play coming up.

66
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:05,784
- Not your cup of tea, uh?
- No, I'm just a little out of practice.

67
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,267
Thank you.

68
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,118
Well, me too. And the

69
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,310
morning date.
Ok, here is my problem.

70
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:14,179
Do I pick a lipstick color

71
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:17,231
to go with my face or my alias' face.

72
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,111
Well.

73
00:04:19,847 --> 00:04:22,877
Seeing as we're the only ones
who can see the real you,

74
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:25,439
I'd go with... pink.

75
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:33,760
oh... I take it you're not liking this whole

76
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:35,249
new you thing.

77
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,286
No.

78
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,114
I guess I just miss the old me a little.

79
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:43,503
Uh, why are you doing
this online dating thing anyway?

80
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:45,572
You could ask out all the time.

81
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,668
Not anymore. Not with me
having a deal Billie all the time.

82
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:49,941
Besides,

83
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,090
there aren't any risks here
and now what Phoebe's doing, right?

84
00:04:53,495 --> 00:04:54,472
What do you mean?

85
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,179
I don't care how many charts she looks at
to see if Dex is the father of her future child,

86
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:01,034
he's still a player.

87
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:02,517
Oh Paige!

88
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:04,190
What? It's true.

89
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,391
Even her own newspaper writes about it
in the gossip column.

90
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:11,835
Yeah, I realize that. But in the interest
iof sisterly harmony, I would really...

91
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,441
Hey guys, did you heard the good news?

92
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:15,693
Let me guess, Dex is the one?

93
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:18,985
Yep, according to every magical calculation,
there is.

94
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,143
Uh uh.

95
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:21,751
Not only that,
but it all times out perfectly.

96
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:24,882
You know, my vision of us getting married,
when I'm supposed to get pregnant,

97
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:26,744
all of it. He's the one.

98
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,271
Yeah, maybe you should
just check that one more time.

99
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:31,226
I'm sorry?

100
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,362
What do you think of this nazy costum?

101
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:39,860
Come on sweetie.

102
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,489
Don't you wanna be
one of Cinderella's footmen?

103
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:43,634
Ok hang on a second.

104
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:46,005
Come on, what's wrong?

105
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:48,098
It's a good costum. Look at it.

106
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:50,412
Shiny.

107
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:52,583
What's the matter?

108
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:56,013
Don't be sad buddy.

109
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,195
Hey cutty boy, what's going on?

110
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,558
I don't know.

111
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,904
He's never usually like this. He just hates it.
Maybe he's allergic to the fabric.

112
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,464
Or something could be sticking him.

113
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:08,883
A pen, a needle maybe?

114
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:10,682
Oh no, no I checked it.

115
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:14,971
Oh that could not have been
in there, really.

116
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:16,935
He tried it on before, it was fine.

117
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:18,452
It's ok.

118
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:19,893
You're doing the best you can.

119
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:22,355
Not been as his real mum in all.

120
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,777
You're a distant cousin right?

121
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:28,620
Oh we're a little bit closer that you think.

122
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:30,203
Well, it's that good to know.

123
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:32,889
Here.

124
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:34,708
How is the other costum coming?

125
00:06:35,191 --> 00:06:37,176
- Oh, the other?
- The pumpkin.

126
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:40,394
It was on the info sheet I sent out.

127
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,201
The other costum, right!

128
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:45,373
It's also in up!

129
00:06:45,713 --> 00:06:47,146
Great!

130
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:48,972
As long as he looks like the other boys,

131
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:50,686
you know how kids can tease.

132
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:52,897
Ok Wyatt,

133
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:54,917
let's go working on that foreseen, ok?

134
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,169
Let's go!

135
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:12,151
Our little secret.
Shhh.

136
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:28,331
Looks can be deceiving but

137
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:31,043
your picture on the dating site
didn't you injustice.

138
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:33,394
Thank you.
It's very nice.

139
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:40,220
So, tell what you do
that keeps you so crazy busy.

140
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:43,288
- Did I say that I was?
- No.

141
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,085
But I sense you're like me.

142
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,144
Old fashioned and heart,
not one to be online dating things

143
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:50,360
but too swirl to meet people any other way.

144
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,205
Yeah.

145
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,759
We could say I

146
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:55,611
haven't had a normal life and well but

147
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,374
I think that could be changing.

148
00:07:59,374 --> 00:08:00,937
Good.

149
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:02,714
So, what do you do?

150
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:05,134
Well, I teach or

151
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:06,256
I taught,

152
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:10,399
kind of at a special needs
school, if you will.

153
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:14,040
I tutor on one-on-one now,
girls are all pain in the butt...

154
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:16,876
Ok, resharing.

155
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:19,445
What do you do?

156
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:21,398
Ok, well... uh...

157
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:22,832
Where to start?

158
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:26,567
I find the most exciting thing
about market research is the variety.

159
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:30,809
I mean, the awareness we interface with,
whether it'd be the jobs from a pseudo-called validation,

160
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:35,146
a qualification, FDA compliance, infotech.
You name it.

161
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:38,101
The first thing we do is
we've gotta a data base and a quarter.

162
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,578
Bla bla bla...

163
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:50,069
Dex?

164
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:53,886
Hey baby.

165
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:02,889
Waouh!

166
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,385
So I'm fine with color but if you can see if

167
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,752
Jess can fit me for a quick cut
after my legwax, that would be great.

168
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:15,226
Sure.

169
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:17,488
Do you want me to pick up some candles?
You know, set the mood.

170
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:18,965
Great idea, yeah.

171
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,172
Make it a couple of dozen.

172
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:21,484
Thanks.

173
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:27,166
Hey there.
Bad time?

174
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:30,944
Hi, no. I'm just getting ready
for my big date with Dex tomorrow.

175
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:33,204
Hey, weren't you on a date?

176
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:35,280
Yeah, that didn't go so well.

177
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,573
I know it's hard.

178
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:41,138
I just got really lucky
that Dex showed up at my funeral.

179
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,665
Yeah. Right.

180
00:09:42,787 --> 00:09:45,172
You've know him for what,
all of a few weeks now?

181
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:46,834
Yeah, it's hard to believe, isn't it?

182
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:49,510
Yeah, I mean, how well do you
really know him considering the

183
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:51,928
"amount of time"
you've actually spent together?

184
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:54,721
Paige, where are you going with this?

185
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:56,577
Nowhere!

186
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:57,714
That's where!

187
00:09:57,824 --> 00:09:58,565
Ok.

188
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,070
Well, we've been through this before.

189
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:03,453
I didn't like Richard, you didn't like Cole.

190
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:04,839
But we promised each other

191
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:07,806
that we'd stay out of each other love life,
it's right?

192
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:08,964
Ok, just answer me this.

193
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,496
How well do you really know him?

194
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:13,094
Paige, please don't start.

195
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:16,557
Will it kill you just to slow things down,
you know, a smidgen.

196
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:18,522
You know, I can't slow things down,

197
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:20,079
because of my premonitions.

198
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:21,189
They're not always literal.

199
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:23,385
But I still have to honor them, don't I?

200
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:24,759
- But look...
- Honey,

201
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:26,121
I really like him

202
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:29,422
and I really care about him,
and he really cares about me.

203
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:31,560
Ok, so don't worry. Ok?

204
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:35,509
No, it's not ok.

205
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,364
Piper!

206
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,648
Look, I'm a little behind
in the crafty department, ok?

207
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:56,439
I didn't have time to owe my skills
with the demon attacking every five minutes!

208
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,058
It's still not a good idea.

209
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:00,460
You know what?
It's a great idea.

210
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:04,650
While all the other mothers were out there making cutsy costums,
I had my nose in this book.

211
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:07,982
So this book is gonna help me
make a damn cute pumpkin outfit.

212
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:10,192
What's up?

213
00:11:10,645 --> 00:11:13,616
Oh yeah, just I'm soaking up knowledge.
I'm a virtual sponge.

214
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:14,409
Good.

215
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:15,416
Keep it up.

216
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,322
So you know, on besides personnal gain...

217
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:20,914
Why are you so sweaty?

218
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,700
Oh you know, there was
this sale on witch hunts and

219
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:27,875
the lying, and the burning,
it's just outta control.

220
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,979
Well that was another called up, how about what happened over
to magic school. It's some real education.

221
00:11:32,014 --> 00:11:34,992
Ok, we can't because you know magic school
being the heart of good magic,

222
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:37,430
you know, we don't wanna expose ourselves.

223
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:39,745
And what is your wife doing?

224
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,545
Making up for lost time!
Now, zip it!

225
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,024
Actually, she is not gonna use
magic to make Wyatt a costum.

226
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:50,058
Oh no? Watch me!

227
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:51,470
You wanted a normal life, remember?

228
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:57,407
Ok, look, that was before I realized our son
was gonna be humiliated in front of his entire class!

229
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,090
You know, that happened to me all the time,

230
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,363
just made me stronger.

231
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:01,617
And shut it!

232
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,276
Ok, is this about Wyatt's humiliation
or yours?

233
00:12:05,787 --> 00:12:10,492
- No! It's about Wyatt and the pagent and...
- and you are doing Mandy?

234
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:15,510
Fine.

235
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,324
No magic.

236
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:22,566
But I will still make
the best damn pumpkin outfit ever

237
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:25,046
and that woman will be sorry
she tangled with me.

238
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:29,798
That is one desperate housewife.

239
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:38,414
Well?

240
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:43,239
I'm beginning to gain the boy's trust.

241
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:47,084
Once he knows it's safe
to use his powers around me...

242
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:51,363
What's taking you so long? You were supposed
to have this cleaned days ago.

243
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:52,848
Yeah, well.

244
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,332
It wasn't as easy as we thought.

245
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:56,989
- It's a lot more...
- I don't wanna hear any more excuses.

246
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,529
Do you understand me?

247
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:06,684
We need to create
a comfortable place for the boy.

248
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:08,670
A familiar place.

249
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:12,081
Or else he'll never do
what I want him to do.

250
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:29,079
Don't let that thing die.

251
00:13:30,662 --> 00:13:33,772
Not until after I've done using it
to get Wyatt.

252
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:45,273
Ok, honey, I know it's not the morning for this to happen,
but the coffee maker's on the fritz.

253
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:48,640
Oh, that's ok.
Do you want me to make you some tea instead?

254
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:49,682
- Tea?
- Yeah.

255
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,504
It's no problem.
I was just cleaning up.

256
00:13:52,273 --> 00:13:55,747
Well, you are in a surprisingly cheaper mood
for someone who hasn't slept all night.

257
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:59,631
- Well, I had to finish Wyatt's pumpkin costum, did'nt I?
- And did you finish?

258
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,672
Absolutely! You know, actually, being
a super mum can be surprisingly satisfying.

259
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:04,434
Don't forget.

260
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:06,370
You're really his super legal guardian.

261
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:07,371
Yes.

262
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:10,378
And are there any other soft spots
you'd like to poke at while you're here?

263
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:12,776
Honey, I'm sorry.

264
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:14,589
It's no big deal.

265
00:14:15,703 --> 00:14:18,676
I think at least Wyatt knows
who his mother really is.

266
00:14:19,022 --> 00:14:21,659
Of course he does.
He sees you as Piper, we all do.

267
00:14:21,914 --> 00:14:23,536
Yeah but it's gotta be confusing for him,

268
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:26,773
especially cause of his classmate
that thinks I'm his cousin.

269
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:29,178
His distant cousin.

270
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:31,848
Look, he's just gonna have
to get used to the way things are.

271
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:33,905
Hey.

272
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,952
Do you wanna hear my plan
how to save Phoebe from Dex?

273
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,071
Oh come on Paige.
Do we really need this inner life right now?

274
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,455
Do we really need our sister
marrying a cheater?

275
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,486
It was just a kiss, right?

276
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,310
So maybe it was his sister?

277
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:49,713
That's disgusting.

278
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,830
Sisters don't kiss brothers like that.

279
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:54,071
- Paige!
- Look,

280
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:55,867
all I'm gonna do is find out
who she really is,

281
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:57,660
Phoebe is never gonna know.

282
00:14:58,005 --> 00:14:59,868
She is gonna kill you.

283
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:01,437
She is gonna thank me.

284
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:04,993
- Right my dear, have a great time to play.
- Thanks.

285
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:11,836
How you like me now!

286
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:28,432
We're close.

287
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:35,248
Pretty elaborate ritual
you got us doing here.

288
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:38,248
When do I get to know who
you're planning to conjure?

289
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:39,249
You don't get to know.

290
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,998
Actually I think I do.

291
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:45,446
Especially if I'm the only one who knows
celebrating a demon from the waste land.

292
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:49,207
If you were the only one,
I wouldn't need the boy, no, would I?

293
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:53,633
Why do you need him?

294
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,306
What does he offer?

295
00:15:57,463 --> 00:15:59,299
He offers power.

296
00:15:59,903 --> 00:16:02,430
A power neither you or I possess.

297
00:16:02,747 --> 00:16:07,727
A power I'm going to need if I'm going
to bring back the demon I have in mind.

298
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,167
Tempus?

299
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,320
Barbas?

300
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,177
- Zankou?
- When it's time...

301
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:19,418
Now, or I stop what I am doing.

302
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:21,472
- You dare challenge me?
- No.

303
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:25,586
I was just thinking I had the right to know
what we're dealing with. That's all.

304
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,625
Especially considering the inner risks
involved with kidnapping the son

305
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:31,155
of a Charmed One.

306
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,639
I'm not kidnapping him.

307
00:16:32,985 --> 00:16:34,498
I'm offering him a new home.

308
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,184
A family,

309
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:39,772
a place to express his full potential.

310
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,003
Even if you lure him in here,

311
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,746
what makes you think he'll stay?

312
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:48,376
Because I'm going to replace
the mummy he lost.

313
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:51,326
And the Source will replace his daddy.

314
00:16:51,452 --> 00:16:52,197
The Source?

315
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:54,983
We can't bring him back.

316
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:56,429
You're right, we can't.

317
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,566
Not without Wyatt anyway.

318
00:17:13,171 --> 00:17:14,711
Any other questions?

319
00:17:17,158 --> 00:17:19,042
I'm sorry, is that yours?

320
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:21,058
Is your name Sylvia too?

321
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:24,357
Sylvia, that's so funny.
I thought I recognized you.

322
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:25,295
How are you?

323
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:27,923
Fine. Great.

324
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:29,600
Thanks.

325
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:33,388
You don't remember me, do you?
That's ok. It was

326
00:17:33,674 --> 00:17:36,439
a long time ago,
when we met in a kind crowded party.

327
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:37,806
Dex introduced us actually.

328
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:39,143
Oh Dex, right.

329
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:42,823
- You know, I'm sorry, I don't remember meeting...
- Jo.

330
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:44,423
Jo Bennett.

331
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,616
I'm an art dealer.

332
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:46,723
Really?

333
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:48,084
So am I! What firm?

334
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,902
Uh... I deal mostly with private collectors,
you know, kind of uh...

335
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:55,288
transactions, stuff like that.

336
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:56,576
How is Dex?

337
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,679
Dex is good, I guess.

338
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:01,449
Yeah, yeah, he just had a show last week,
running really well.

339
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:02,680
He's got some good stuff.

340
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:04,746
Great, great.
Are you two still going out?

341
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,481
Dex and I?
No, not anymore.

342
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,854
Really? Are you sure about that?

343
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,627
Yeah, I think I'd remember that.

344
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:15,613
Why are you asking?

345
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:18,061
Probably just a strange thing.
I was actually here

346
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:19,847
you know, yesterday, and I

347
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,070
I thought I saw you two kissing.

348
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:24,798
Oh yeah, that.
You know, that was nothing.

349
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,129
We were just saying hello.

350
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:29,756
We broke up months ago.

351
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:31,465
That's great.

352
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:33,052
No, that's awful.

353
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:34,320
Sorry about that.

354
00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:36,486
It was fun while it lasted.

355
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:39,293
No, still it's fun.
Once in a while, actually.

356
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:41,689
If you know,
cool the break up sex.

357
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,178
Break up sex?

358
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:46,044
Yeah, is there anything better?

359
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:49,001
Listen, I got to run.
It was nice seeing you again.

360
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:51,527
Yeah it was

361
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:53,189
really nice seeing you.

362
00:18:59,543 --> 00:19:01,091
What do you mean he's not a pumpkin?

363
00:19:01,702 --> 00:19:03,884
Oh, I can't imagine how it slipped my mind.

364
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:07,330
We decided mice costums
would be more comfortable.

365
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:09,838
Oh but

366
00:19:09,873 --> 00:19:11,884
Wyatt is really excited
about being a pumpkin.

367
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,721
Poor thing.

368
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:17,822
Maybe the problem is
the green thing on his head.

369
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:19,010
The

370
00:19:19,637 --> 00:19:21,494
green thing is the stem,

371
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:23,854
the stem of the pumpkin
I was up all night making.

372
00:19:24,357 --> 00:19:25,696
And it's a cute pumpkin.

373
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:27,256
Really.

374
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,561
Well I think he should wear it.

375
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,007
But this isn't about you now.

376
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:32,869
- Is it?
- Excuse me?

377
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:36,203
Ladies, we all want the children
to be happy, don't we?

378
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,830
Especially Wyatt.

379
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:41,076
- He's been through so much lately.
- And losing his mother and all.

380
00:19:41,117 --> 00:19:43,012
We don't wanna traumatize him any further.

381
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:45,458
Oh no, he's not

382
00:19:45,971 --> 00:19:47,926
traumatized. I mean, he has

383
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:49,376
me.

384
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,583
And you're doing the very best job you can.

385
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:55,059
Considering,

386
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:56,288
Considering what?

387
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:57,863
How new you are at this.

388
00:19:57,898 --> 00:19:59,729
- How overworked you must be.
- She's right.

389
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:01,543
You do look exhausted.

390
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:03,158
I'm fine.

391
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:05,703
And Wyatt's fine.
We're all fine. Now,

392
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,099
if you'll just excuse me.

393
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:10,654
Sweetie, if you're worried
about the mouse costum,

394
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,087
I can whip one up for Wyatt in a jiffy.

395
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,433
I can jiffy whip one up myself actually.

396
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:19,471
Really, it's no problem.

397
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:21,897
You've done quite enough already.

398
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,826
Leo?

399
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,555
Please tell me there's a demon somewhere
because I really need to blow something up.

400
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,599
Sorry, everything's fine except Billie
wants to go to magic school.

401
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:37,175
What? No.

402
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:38,606
That's what I told her too.

403
00:20:39,053 --> 00:20:41,046
That woman is out to get me.

404
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:44,595
Look, Piper, I think she's defiant,
but I think her intentions are good.

405
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:49,214
Well she may seem nice and sweet but
there is something deeply twit beneath the surface.

406
00:20:49,454 --> 00:20:52,690
- Come on Piper, I don't think Billie...
- No, not Billy. Mandy.

407
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:55,256
Miss too good to be true
has been quizzing about.

408
00:20:55,291 --> 00:21:00,640
Not only is she getting more clownly perfect with every moment
but now she's actually out to get me!

409
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:02,077
Don't be ridiculous.

410
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:04,740
I wish I could just blow her up.

411
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,116
Piper you can't blow her up,
she's not a demon.

412
00:21:07,496 --> 00:21:10,065
No, she's worse than a demon.
She's a room mum.

413
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:12,074
It's time to come home now honey, ok?

414
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:19,990
Hey, alright, what did she say?
We're going to magic school or what?

415
00:21:20,284 --> 00:21:22,524
Well she said what I thought,
she said no.

416
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,690
It's too dangerous.

417
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:26,964
Come on! You always listen to what she says.
You guys used to live in great danger.

418
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,238
And now we retired.

419
00:21:28,505 --> 00:21:31,519
Exactly, you've all been housing here.
It's my job to pick up the sack around here.

420
00:21:31,786 --> 00:21:34,427
I need to learn quick
and magic school has books,

421
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:36,853
and an apothecary and really bitchy weapons.

422
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,997
Which you can read about in the text book.

423
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,774
I'm done reading.

424
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:42,965
I'm going to magic school.

425
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,502
- How?
- I'm a quick study.

426
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:45,928
Ok wait what we're gonna get

427
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,181
exposed.

428
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,496
You did it?

429
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,383
I did? Oh cool.

430
00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:53,426
Something's not right.

431
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,617
- Who are they? Are they students?
- No, they're demons.

432
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,922
Demons? What are demons doing here?

433
00:22:02,143 --> 00:22:03,335
Taking over.

434
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:12,050
Ok this is bad.
This is really bad.

435
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:13,755
They're kind of cute though.

436
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,708
No, they're not cute! Ok?
They're demons.

437
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:18,183
Do you understand what that means?
Hurt, mime, kill?

438
00:22:18,218 --> 00:22:19,709
A lot of minor syllables
I got it.

439
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:22,902
You don't have it, if they take it over,
it means they've access to everything.

440
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,723
spells, maps, weapons.

441
00:22:24,758 --> 00:22:26,103
You know, these make coming an idea.

442
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:30,926
With everything here, they could wipe us all out,
Ok? Whitelighters, Elders, Gnomes,...

443
00:22:31,293 --> 00:22:32,708
- Witches?
- Everything.

444
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:34,731
Ok, fine. What do we do?

445
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:36,373
We've got to get out of here fast.

446
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:37,276
Fine, let's go!

447
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,715
So you brought the extra potion, right?

448
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:41,916
No.

449
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:43,308
You're kidding!

450
00:22:44,124 --> 00:22:45,780
Do I look like I think I had it.

451
00:22:46,338 --> 00:22:48,570
Come on, you used to run the place.
How did you go back and forth?

452
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:49,594
Paige orbed me.

453
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:54,194
Ok, there is a spell in one of these books,
if we can find it.

454
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:56,130
Ok I'm listenning.

455
00:22:56,318 --> 00:22:58,455
Ok, here is what we're gonna do.

456
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,592
Ok, don't move, don't say a word.

457
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:04,518
Nice.

458
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:07,696
- Could you give me a hand?
- What are you doing?

459
00:23:07,731 --> 00:23:09,136
If you can't beat them,
join them.

460
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:17,124
Leo?

461
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:20,939
Leo!

462
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:25,373
Let's see.

463
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:28,114
What do we have in here?

464
00:23:29,431 --> 00:23:31,857
Oh boy.

465
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:38,909
You don't wanna eat this dry
yecchy sandwich your guardian made, do you?

466
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:43,696
Damn all cousin, damn all guardian.

467
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:49,661
Here we go.

468
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:52,596
You can have this.

469
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,255
Right?

470
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,818
- Mummy.
- Mummy!

471
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:04,073
Sweet heart,

472
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,068
listen.

473
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:08,506
I know you miss your mummy.

474
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:10,754
But I am here.

475
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,008
And I love when you do your magic.

476
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:15,976
I do.

477
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:18,987
In fact,

478
00:24:19,732 --> 00:24:21,437
why don't we just

479
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:26,030
orb this pooh pooh sandwich,

480
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:29,054
right into that trash can, can you do that?

481
00:24:30,055 --> 00:24:31,173
No one's watching.

482
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:40,541
Look at that! Good boy, good boy!

483
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:43,139
Good job!

484
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:46,866
Let's do that again.

485
00:24:55,182 --> 00:24:56,745
Ok, ok.

486
00:24:56,758 --> 00:24:57,961
For Phoebe.

487
00:25:04,487 --> 00:25:07,976
I created this one as a complain
to the other you saw...

488
00:25:08,114 --> 00:25:09,175
Hi Sylvia.

489
00:25:09,296 --> 00:25:10,695
I hope I'm not interrupting.

490
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,434
- Actually, if you could just give...
- It's alright. We'll come back.

491
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:14,933
Are you sure? I'm sure...

492
00:25:14,968 --> 00:25:16,999
We need to think about it anyway.
We'll call you.

493
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:20,554
Thanks for coming by.

494
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:22,101
Let me know what you think.

495
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:24,974
I hope I didn't stopped the sale.

496
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:27,101
What are you doing here Sylvia?

497
00:25:27,807 --> 00:25:30,452
Well, I'm fine in the sack,
but it don't rate a work visit, huh?

498
00:25:30,806 --> 00:25:31,756
What?

499
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:34,154
Please, don't pretend you don't know
what I'm talking about.

500
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:35,755
But I don't know what you're talking about.

501
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:37,699
How quickly they forget!

502
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,347
Ok, look, here is the deal, buster.

503
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:42,185
It's over, alright?

504
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:44,633
Finito, no muss at today's news.
You got it?

505
00:25:45,206 --> 00:25:46,138
No, not really.

506
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:48,248
I'll try to spell this out for you.

507
00:25:48,456 --> 00:25:50,703
I am done with the break up sex.

508
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:53,872
It's not fair to me or
anyone else you might be

509
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:55,768
seeing at the moment.

510
00:25:56,295 --> 00:25:57,508
Understand?

511
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:59,175
Yeah, but...

512
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:01,342
Forget it.
No more freebees.

513
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,245
It's time to make an other man of yourself.

514
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:07,589
- Be true to the one you love.
- What the hell are you talking about?

515
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:10,340
You know damn well what I'm talking about.

516
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,349
We haven't slept together
in over two months.

517
00:26:13,804 --> 00:26:15,651
- We haven't?
- No.

518
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:21,122
Do I

519
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:22,516
lie a lot?

520
00:26:23,434 --> 00:26:24,459
It's why we broke up.

521
00:26:25,524 --> 00:26:26,914
Dex. Hey!

522
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,338
Phoebe!

523
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:31,088
Excuse me?

524
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:33,090
Freebees.
We were just talking about freebees.

525
00:26:36,848 --> 00:26:38,129
Julie, Sylvia.

526
00:26:38,736 --> 00:26:39,905
Hi. Nice to meet you.

527
00:26:40,328 --> 00:26:41,224
Yeah, you too.

528
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,679
Oh God, look at the time, I've got to go.

529
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:44,560
Nice meeting you.
Take care. Goodbye.

530
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:50,535
Ex girl friend.

531
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:06,917
Will you just leave it alone?
You looks hot.

532
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:08,487
Really? Thanks.
I think.

533
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,938
Hey you're watching buddy!

534
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:18,144
You're trying to get us killed?

535
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,329
We're supposed to be evil, not wimps.

536
00:27:20,574 --> 00:27:22,115
- Let's just find the spell, ok?
- Fine.

537
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:34,167
Everything's out of order.

538
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,640
What is?

539
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:37,314
The books.

540
00:27:37,713 --> 00:27:39,988
I don't think it's where
it's supposed to be.

541
00:27:40,023 --> 00:27:41,741
What do you think they're doing?

542
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:45,168
I don't know but
I don't wanna hang around...

543
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:48,284
Wyatt!

544
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:51,604
Welcome home sweetie boy!

545
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,469
- You wanna play with the toys?
- Yeah.

546
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,649
Come over here.

547
00:28:04,246 --> 00:28:05,650
Why did she get Wyatt?

548
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:09,191
I should let Piper blow her up.

549
00:28:09,446 --> 00:28:10,767
Why, you know her?

550
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:13,293
Yeah, she's Wyatt room mum or...

551
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,826
So she said she was.

552
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:17,673
What does she want with him?

553
00:28:20,703 --> 00:28:21,682
Wait.
Where are you going?

554
00:28:21,946 --> 00:28:22,999
Go to see my son!

555
00:28:23,272 --> 00:28:25,684
Are you insane? Look around you,
you're getting us killed, you're gonna get me killed!

556
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:29,252
We need to get out of here,
we're gotta get help.

557
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:31,952
It feels good to be back
in magic school, doesn't it?

558
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:34,406
It's where you belong.

559
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:43,525
Is everything ready?

560
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:44,655
Yes.

561
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:47,510
Although, are you sure of what you're doing?

562
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:50,066
The boy trusts me.

563
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:53,442
- Otherwise he would have orbed me...
- I wasn't talking about the boy.

564
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,751
I was talking about the Source.

565
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:57,977
I found it.

566
00:28:58,012 --> 00:29:01,620
- Who's the Source?
- The Source?

567
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:05,742
I'm just saying he could be pretty pissed.

568
00:29:06,507 --> 00:29:09,174
After all he never thought
the Charmed Ones could vanquish him.

569
00:29:09,521 --> 00:29:10,713
I'll handle him.

570
00:29:16,136 --> 00:29:17,122
How?

571
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:19,805
I'm bringing him back from the dead,
aren't I?

572
00:29:20,141 --> 00:29:20,861
He'll own me.

573
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:25,054
Plus he'll have the son of a Charmed One
to raise as his very own.

574
00:29:26,095 --> 00:29:28,337
What better revenge is there than that?

575
00:29:28,372 --> 00:29:31,829
- Okay, the spell is on page 86. You go get out of here.
- Wait, you wanna me go by myself, why?

576
00:29:31,864 --> 00:29:33,074
I'm not leaving my son!

577
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:34,982
You don't have any powers. I have powers.
I should stay.

578
00:29:35,196 --> 00:29:37,226
There's nothing worse than the Source,
do you understand me?

579
00:29:38,391 --> 00:29:39,552
I can't leave my son alone.

580
00:29:41,732 --> 00:29:43,257
Okay, just be careful.

581
00:29:49,124 --> 00:29:51,146
Are you sure an other member of the family
didn't take him up?

582
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:54,017
Of course I'm sure. Otherwise,
I wouldn't be freaking out right now.

583
00:29:54,465 --> 00:29:56,435
Oh okay, okay, here, see?

584
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,843
Nothing to worry about. Wyatt is with Mandy.

585
00:29:58,878 --> 00:29:59,988
Mandy?

586
00:30:00,572 --> 00:30:02,915
- You let him go with Mandy?
- Well,

587
00:30:04,007 --> 00:30:05,698
she has already been
looking out for him lately.

588
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:09,966
I'm sure he's having a time of his life
with her son as we speak.

589
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:13,452
Really?

590
00:30:13,652 --> 00:30:15,313
Then why is her son still here?

591
00:30:16,262 --> 00:30:17,141
She would never...

592
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:19,624
Well it's not like Mandy.

593
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:25,310
She's a demon!

594
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:30,067
Jealousy is an ugly,

595
00:30:30,507 --> 00:30:31,427
ugly thing.

596
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:41,870
You, crazy witch!

597
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,072
- That was you, I know it!
- I was just trying to protect you!

598
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:49,761
How? By posing as his ex?

599
00:30:49,796 --> 00:30:51,612
I thought he was cheating on you!

600
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:53,428
What? I told you to stay out of it!

601
00:30:53,463 --> 00:30:54,846
I saw him kiss her!

602
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:55,789
What?

603
00:30:58,213 --> 00:30:59,566
Wyatt's been kidnapped.

604
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:01,120
And Leo is missing.

605
00:31:04,118 --> 00:31:07,873
Seven years of doing this. I should've known
something was unright with Mandy.

606
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,318
Nobody's that perfect, not even her.

607
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:11,625
But she has a child and a husband.

608
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,391
That's why I think a demon possessed her
to get to Wyatt.

609
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,057
Somebody starts scrying for him!

610
00:31:19,092 --> 00:31:20,573
Fine, I'm going, I'm going.

611
00:31:20,608 --> 00:31:22,323
Okay I'm gonna work on vanquishing potion,

612
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:23,793
you work on the depossession spell.

613
00:31:25,075 --> 00:31:28,931
I can't believe I let her take him
right here, under my nose. What was I doing?

614
00:31:28,966 --> 00:31:30,419
It's okay, we're gonna get him back.

615
00:31:30,454 --> 00:31:31,233
How?

616
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:32,456
He could be anywhere.

617
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:34,018
He's at magic school.

618
00:31:34,298 --> 00:31:35,295
Hey.

619
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,046
Where did you come from?

620
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,609
And how do you know that?

621
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:40,783
Well I just came from here,
Leo stayed behind to keep on eye on Wyatt.

622
00:31:40,818 --> 00:31:42,063
Why are you wearing that?

623
00:31:42,474 --> 00:31:45,769
Well if I wasn't, I would be dead. There are demons
everywhere, they're taking over the place.

624
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,215
- What?
- How?

625
00:31:47,218 --> 00:31:48,173
Who cares?

626
00:31:48,857 --> 00:31:49,879
What do they want with Wyatt?

627
00:31:50,297 --> 00:31:52,758
They need him te help bring back the Source.

628
00:31:57,091 --> 00:31:59,581
Okay, Leo looked just like that
when he heard that name.

629
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:01,690
Who is this guy, I mean,
how do we annihilate him?

630
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,644
You don't.

631
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:03,569
We do.

632
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,534
You're not ready, trust me.

633
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,019
Well, ladies, how are we enjoying
our demon free existence now?

634
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,175
You can use all the magic you want here.

635
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:22,693
Whatever you want, whenever you want.
It's not fun?

636
00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:28,069
But first, I want your power to bring back
a special friend of ours.

637
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:32,365
Somebody who's gonna to be very
very happy to see you, okay?

638
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:34,162
Yeah.

639
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:36,389
Alright.

640
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:40,094
Good. It will be easy,
I'll show you.

641
00:32:42,592 --> 00:32:44,911
Don't you want the Source
to know the real you?

642
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,711
So he knows you're a demon.

643
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:49,794
I don't want to risk

644
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:51,451
scaring the child.

645
00:32:52,165 --> 00:32:53,496
Stand back.

646
00:32:59,272 --> 00:33:00,426
Ready?

647
00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:02,332
Okay.

648
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:07,206
We call to you, that away was torn,

649
00:33:07,646 --> 00:33:12,322
return master of all evil born.

650
00:33:14,337 --> 00:33:16,900
Put your finger in it,
it will make some really need magic!

651
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:41,908
My lord,

652
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:44,564
Where am I?

653
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,464
Who brought me back?

654
00:33:49,054 --> 00:33:50,386
We did.

655
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:08,889
It was me, actually,

656
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:10,329
who brought you back.

657
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:11,857
Why?

658
00:34:11,892 --> 00:34:13,582
Why else?

659
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,685
Power.

660
00:34:15,747 --> 00:34:18,345
Yours, mine, his.

661
00:34:19,245 --> 00:34:21,743
One big unstoppable happy family!

662
00:34:23,003 --> 00:34:28,147
What possible power could he have
that I might covert?

663
00:34:28,182 --> 00:34:29,738
Charmed power.

664
00:34:29,912 --> 00:34:31,256
That's right.

665
00:34:31,968 --> 00:34:34,387
He's the first born,
the prophecy.

666
00:34:37,395 --> 00:34:39,676
- How did you get him away...
- The Charmed Ones are dead.

667
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:44,232
I'm sorry just boiling your fun,
I'm sure you would've wanted revenge.

668
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:48,760
Although, our raising him as evil

669
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,500
might be even better, don't you think?

670
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:54,206
You got it all worked out, don't you?

671
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,733
Except for one thing.

672
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:00,014
Why do I need you?

673
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:03,303
Because every mortal boy needs his mummy.

674
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:09,068
And I'm sure you would enjoy being the head
of the demonic dinasty.

675
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:21,194
What's your name, little boy?

676
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:23,104
Let him be.

677
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:25,412
What did you say?

678
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,780
You don't wanna scare him and
he's not use to your kind.

679
00:35:28,815 --> 00:35:30,443
Who are you? I've never seen you before.

680
00:35:30,478 --> 00:35:31,220
I've been here.

681
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:33,536
I've also been in the boy's house.

682
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:35,459
With Zankou.

683
00:35:36,445 --> 00:35:37,820
Is that a fact?

684
00:35:45,592 --> 00:35:47,117
See, he knows me obviously.

685
00:35:53,587 --> 00:35:56,285
He seems to more than just know you.

686
00:35:58,207 --> 00:35:59,014
Leave us.

687
00:36:09,464 --> 00:36:11,565
Who are you?

688
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:21,046
Billy was right.
It's demons' central.

689
00:36:22,364 --> 00:36:24,119
Just trying to help you
with the kid, that's all.

690
00:36:26,986 --> 00:36:30,384
Then why don't I believe that?

691
00:36:30,419 --> 00:36:32,160
We've got to hurry.
Leo's in trouble.

692
00:36:32,195 --> 00:36:35,175
Yeah, how are we gonna stop the Source,
we have no potions.

693
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:36,988
That's gonna take a lot more than potions.

694
00:36:37,023 --> 00:36:38,525
How did you do the last time?

695
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,805
- Not the same way we're going to do it this time.
- You have a plan?

696
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,815
Yeah. And it starts with Mandy.

697
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:51,504
If you don't trust him,
just kill him.

698
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:54,162
Then we'll go on a family outing,

699
00:36:54,257 --> 00:36:56,541
savour a few innocents, have a pic nic.

700
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:05,762
There's not a trap of evil in him.

701
00:37:06,907 --> 00:37:08,972
He's not a demon at all!

702
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,566
This is too good to be true,

703
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,482
- daddy.
- What?

704
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:29,613
What happened?

705
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:31,191
Who did this?

706
00:37:31,296 --> 00:37:32,366
We did.

707
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:41,861
I should have known
the Charmed Ones weren't really dead.

708
00:37:43,223 --> 00:37:46,541
Only you've gone soft in my absence.

709
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:50,648
Without the hollow, you can't take me.

710
00:37:50,683 --> 00:37:51,564
Oh really?

711
00:37:52,118 --> 00:37:53,885
Take up kick!

712
00:38:03,978 --> 00:38:05,474
Nooooooooooo!

713
00:38:09,283 --> 00:38:11,151
Talking about your ball and chain.

714
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:13,226
I don't really understand.
How did you...

715
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:15,357
She conjured him, so they're connected.

716
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:16,687
She goes, he goes.

717
00:38:16,722 --> 00:38:17,941
For eternity now.

718
00:38:18,153 --> 00:38:22,525
Ok, well, we probably should get out of here
before any other demon recognises us.

719
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,878
What are we gonna do with her?

720
00:38:24,397 --> 00:38:26,015
Oh come on, we don't need to save her.

721
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,613
What? She's still too perky.

722
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:44,712
Hey there.

723
00:38:44,747 --> 00:38:45,775
Hi.

724
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:46,728
What do you still doing up?

725
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,619
I'm just studying.

726
00:38:48,938 --> 00:38:51,903
Maybe you should give you
a little bit of rest for tonight.

727
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:53,982
No thanks, I just wanna look up
a few more things.

728
00:38:54,243 --> 00:38:58,466
You know I didn't realise I had to learn
how to vanquish vanquished demons.

729
00:38:58,501 --> 00:39:01,086
Yeah well, that's the funny thing
about here,

730
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:03,187
nodody really stays dead a long.

731
00:39:03,222 --> 00:39:04,525
Yeah I'm noticing that.

732
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:08,167
- Wait, Paige,
- Yeah?

733
00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:12,125
Are you guys worried at all about demons
being at the magic school?

734
00:39:12,314 --> 00:39:13,795
Look, what can they do there?

735
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,295
Yeah, we are

736
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,761
pretty worried.

737
00:39:17,238 --> 00:39:19,905
So, in that case maybe you should stay up,

738
00:39:19,906 --> 00:39:21,229
and study a little longer.

739
00:39:29,856 --> 00:39:31,443
Dex? Hey!

740
00:39:31,478 --> 00:39:32,802
What are you doing here?

741
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,734
I only thought we could talk.

742
00:39:35,092 --> 00:39:36,733
Yeah, of course, come on in.

743
00:39:43,495 --> 00:39:47,623
Look I want to apologize
for what happened earlier.

744
00:39:47,658 --> 00:39:48,527
Apologize?

745
00:39:48,562 --> 00:39:50,378
About Sylvia and I, I mean,

746
00:39:50,413 --> 00:39:52,195
Oh! You know, I don't think

747
00:39:52,365 --> 00:39:55,114
you need to explain yourself
about any of that.

748
00:39:55,474 --> 00:39:56,760
No I do.

749
00:39:56,783 --> 00:40:00,276
No I think I have a pretty good idea
of what was going on.

750
00:40:00,304 --> 00:40:02,098
Actually you don't.

751
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,398
Not completely.

752
00:40:03,557 --> 00:40:06,212
I mean, there's nothing going on
between Sylvia and I anymore.

753
00:40:06,861 --> 00:40:08,940
- Really.
- Ok and why?

754
00:40:08,975 --> 00:40:11,020
We broke up a while ago.

755
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:15,063
But I've sort have been staying
in contact with her.

756
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,504
Staying in contact?

757
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,649
Look I should have probably made
a cleaner break than I did,

758
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:24,322
but I guess I didn't realise it until today.

759
00:40:25,576 --> 00:40:28,104
I'm not looking for anybody else
in my life right now, Julie.

760
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:30,213
I just want you.

761
00:40:31,174 --> 00:40:32,214
Forgive me?

762
00:40:35,854 --> 00:40:37,389
Hold that thought.

763
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:46,278
Hi.

764
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:47,900
Don't mind me. I was just...

765
00:40:48,101 --> 00:40:50,171
I was just coming to say good night.

766
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:51,379
No, you weren't.

767
00:40:53,143 --> 00:40:55,535
- But thank you.
- For what?

768
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,921
For butting in.

769
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:59,231
Well, you're welcome.

770
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,199
Just don't do it again.

771
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,902
Pinch me.

772
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:18,326
Why?

773
00:41:19,063 --> 00:41:22,762
Cause I can't believe we're actually going
to see a real life normal school play.

774
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:24,159
Hard to believe.

775
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:30,037
Yeah. Still you know, we should let Wyatt
blow off some magical steam now and then.

776
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:32,355
Good idea.

777
00:41:34,882 --> 00:41:36,285
See Mandy over there?

778
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:40,186
Yeah, if she all I knew.

779
00:41:41,171 --> 00:41:41,977
She might.

780
00:41:43,697 --> 00:41:45,446
Maybe on some serial level.

781
00:41:45,696 --> 00:41:47,750
It might make her more likable.

782
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:48,965
I doubt it.

783
00:42:00,615 --> 00:42:03,591
Is there any moment more perfect than this?
