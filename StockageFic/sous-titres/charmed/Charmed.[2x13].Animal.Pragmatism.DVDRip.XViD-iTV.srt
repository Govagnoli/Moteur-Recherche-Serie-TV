1
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:08,803
The lions observed in the Ngorongoro
Crater of Tanzania mated,

2
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:12,518
on average, once an hour
for a week straight.

3
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,477
Now, before I lose half the room
to that thought, answer me this:

4
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:17,917
Where does it begin?

5
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:20,967
And the purpose of all animals is
the proliferation of the species, right?

6
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,518
But it isn't as easy as,
"Your nest or mine?"

7
00:00:23,729 --> 00:00:26,289
It starts with a series
of mating rituals.

8
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:31,285
First, an animal must get the attention
of the object it desires.

9
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:34,486
Next, there must be a sign
that the interest is mutual.

10
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,403
But as we've all learned from
painful experience, an animal...

11
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:40,799
What's up with my study group
having fun without me?

12
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,960
Sorry, Phoebe. You looked busy.

13
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:46,002
Use your time in section tomorrow
to outline your group's thesis.

14
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:48,637
Be specific. Better yet,
just spell-check.

15
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,648
I'll see you next week.

16
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,168
Is that a book of love spells?

17
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:01,287
Yeah, found it in the Valentine's Day
display over at the campus bookstore.

18
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,845
- It's stupid.
- Is not.

19
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,564
We figured since we're dateless this
year, maybe it'll give us some laughs.

20
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:10,438
What?

21
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,807
Oh, nothing. It's just,
they've got it backwards.

22
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,160
You would never say it in that order.
First you say what's lacking,

23
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:19,889
then what's needed. Here, try this:

24
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,837
From strike of 12, count 24
That's how long the spell is for

25
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:28,241
If to abate my lonely heart
Enchant these gifts I thee impart

26
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,001
See?

27
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:36,486
I'm doing a paper on the
growing popularity of witchcraft.

28
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:40,009
Hey, if you guys want something fun
to do tomorrow night,

29
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,921
you should check out
my sister's club.

30
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:44,719
- Oh, cool.
- No dates required.

31
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:46,408
- Okay.
- Okay, we'll be there.

32
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:48,366
- See you at section tomorrow.
- Okay.

33
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:59,045
Hey, there's a party tomorrow night.

34
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:01,006
You should come.

35
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:03,364
- Why?
- Because I'll be there.

36
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,040
Okay, I'm freaked.
Can we turn some lights on?

37
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,769
- No, we can't. Can we?
- It will spoil the mood.

38
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,284
Come on, it says to join hands.

39
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:22,761
We're not gonna hurt them, are we? I
promised Spencer I'd get his pig back.

40
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:25,443
It's a joke spell, Tessa.
This is just supposed to be fun.

41
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,762
You could choose any animal to turn
into a man, and you chose a pig?

42
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:32,847
It's widely known that pigs are the
most intelligent species, that's why.

43
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:35,364
Well, then we all know
why Andrea chose a rabbit.

44
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:37,804
Just keep your fingers clear.
He scratches.

45
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:39,925
Kinky. Exactly why I brought a snake.

46
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:42,762
Okay, let's do this. Say it with me.

47
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:47,719
From strike of 12, count 24
That's how long the spell is for

48
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:51,962
Turn these gifts into a mate
And then my lonely heart abate

49
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:56,641
Okay, that was fun. Can I go now?

50
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,198
Wait. Now, didn't Phoebe say
some of the words were wrong?

51
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:00,842
Why don't you call her.

52
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:04,285
Don't have to. Power of technology.

53
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:08,121
No dates required.

54
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:14,041
From strike of 12, count 24
That's how long the spell is for

55
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:17,679
If to abate my lonely heart
Enchant these gifts I thee impart

56
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:25,160
- What's wrong with this picture?
- Okay, is that rhetorical,

57
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:28,287
or do I actually have to open
my eyes to look at something?

58
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:29,768
Well, it is a weekday,

59
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,885
and Phoebe Halliwell
is already at campus,

60
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:34,517
while Prue Halliwell,
master of the morning meeting,

61
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:39,126
- sultan of scheduling and queen of...
- Got it.

62
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:42,004
How's it feel to be footloose
and office-free?

63
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:44,524
Amazing. You know
what I'm gonna do today?

64
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:46,759
- What?
- Absolutely nothing.

65
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:49,244
Nothing? Really, Prue?

66
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:52,765
Nothing entails physically doing
nothing, thinking about nothing

67
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:55,284
and worrying about nothing,
as opposed to your sister here,

68
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,041
who is so in the middle
of something.

69
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,368
Okay, sweetie. What is wrong?

70
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:04,282
Well, for starters, there's tomorrow.

71
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:07,880
Valentine's Day?

72
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,046
Wow, I completely forgot.

73
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:13,325
See? I'm doing nothing already.

74
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:16,687
And Dan wants me to have
V-Day dinner with him.

75
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:19,002
Oh, that's good.

76
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:21,724
Yeah. Except for the fact
that there's...

77
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:25,404
Leo? I mean, he is mortal now.
Doesn't that change things?

78
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:30,168
Piper, you're my sister,
and I'm with you,

79
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:34,527
whatever and whoever you choose.

80
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:43,446
I need to eat.

81
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:47,765
Another satisfied customer.

82
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,840
You've already eaten
everything in our fridge.

83
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,603
Brooke will be back with food
any minute. Just wait, okay?

84
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:54,839
Whoa, what are we
supposed to do until then?

85
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:58,321
Fine question. What should we do?

86
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,006
You two are acting
like nothing's changed,

87
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:04,559
like you're still trapped
in the confines of your cages.

88
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:06,959
- Behaving like animals.
- That's what you are.

89
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:09,359
Not anymore, thanks to you.

90
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:13,318
We've been given a gift.
It's time to take it out for a test drive,

91
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:16,688
see what the world looks like
from up here.

92
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:19,767
You can't.
I mean, you have to stay here.

93
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:25,164
Wait!

94
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,838
Yeah, you got my CD, man?

95
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:48,760
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah. Try covering up, dude.

96
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:53,479
Remedy the situation.

97
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,204
- Hey! What the...?
- Hey, man.

98
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:58,998
Hey, man.

99
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:02,443
Hey. What are you doing?

100
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,367
Who are those guys?

101
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:23,800
Who are these for?

102
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,761
They're for you.

103
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:28,927
- I know they're not much.
- They're beautiful.

104
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,048
- But, Leo...
- But it's the best I could do.

105
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:36,204
You know, no ID, no mode
of transportation, no money.

106
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:38,678
I just wanted you to have
something, mark the day.

107
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:42,646
Thank you.
I have something for you too.

108
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:45,926
Although not nearly as romantic,
but still a good thing.

109
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:49,365
Your first paycheque. Or cash, rather.
I thought it'd be easier.

110
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:52,241
So did I.

111
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:54,607
Anyway, thanks.

112
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:58,965
Looks like after everything, I'm still
working for the Charmed Ones.

113
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,925
Is all this...?
Are you doing okay with it?

114
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:04,205
Yeah. Kind of making it up as I go.

115
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:06,599
But, Piper, if me being here
is awkward for you...

116
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:08,561
No.

117
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:11,323
What's there to be awkward about?

118
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:17,200
These go in the back, right?

119
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,804
What are those?

120
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:28,802
I thought we were gonna wait
until tonight.

121
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,561
You're right.
I should take them back.

122
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:33,004
Don't you dare.

123
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:34,927
Give them to me.

124
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:40,245
They're beautiful. Thank you.

125
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:49,369
Piper? Is there something
you wanted to tell me?

126
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:51,480
Not that I know of.

127
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:55,647
You sure?

128
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,402
Dan. Hey.

129
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:01,367
Leo.

130
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,567
You never mentioned he was here.

131
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:13,363
- Leo's here.
- Yeah.

132
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:17,357
You're right. I meant to,
and then things got busy,

133
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:21,888
so I didn't, and I'm sorry.

134
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,478
- He's just helping out.
- With what, exactly?

135
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:29,439
You know, handyman, busboy,
bar back, security-type stuff.

136
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:33,678
He needed a place to stay,
and it's really not a big deal, Dan.

137
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:35,845
That's just the point. It is.

138
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:39,048
When you were sick,
you called out his name, not mine.

139
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:41,081
And I was right there with you.

140
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,763
When he's around, you're,

141
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:46,807
I don't know, different.
We're different.

142
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:49,398
- How do you want me to handle that?
- I don't know.

143
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:52,527
And to tell you the truth,
if the situation were reversed,

144
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:54,680
I don't know how I would feel.

145
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:56,999
But I do know how I feel right now.

146
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,437
How do you feel?

147
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:00,759
Like for the first time
in a very long time,

148
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:03,762
I'm actually looking forward
to a Valentine's Day dinner.

149
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,920
And you're the reason.

150
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:16,439
Hi, is Briana there?

151
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,000
Of course she's at work.

152
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:21,763
Yeah, hi, this is Prue calling.

153
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:25,319
No, you can actually
just erase that number.

154
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:28,561
She can reach me at home.

155
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:31,809
Home. I'll be home.

156
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:33,925
Okay, bye.

157
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:51,161
Prue Hall...

158
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:53,524
- Hello?
- Hello, yourself.

159
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:56,157
- How is the life of leisure going?
- It's great.

160
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:57,887
I don't know why you ever gave it up.

161
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:01,837
Yeah. Because that house is only big
enough for one homebound Halliwell.

162
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:04,284
Hey, I'm just on my way to class,
but I wanted to know

163
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:06,963
if Brooke or Andrea or Tessa called.

164
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:09,404
No, no one called. Nobody.

165
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,003
No one. Zip.

166
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:13,000
- Nada. Zilch.
- That is so weird.

167
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:14,847
They never showed up
for our section today.

168
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:16,761
Hey, watch it!

169
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:21,885
Hey, buddy, get in line.

170
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:24,279
- What's happening over there?
- Come on.

171
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:26,486
How could you do this to them?

172
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:30,845
- Run! Run, my brothers.
- Who is that guy?

173
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:34,559
- Run free!
- What is he doing?

174
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:39,801
So hey, Phoebe, I was wondering
if maybe we could meet for lunch.

175
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:43,166
And if you're crunched on time,
then I can just come to the campus.

176
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,285
I was gonna pick up a sandwich
on the way to class.

177
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:47,724
Okay, so, what about after class?
We could go to the gym.

178
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:51,440
- You're hurting me!
- Pheebs?

179
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:54,527
- Stop! I told you to get off!
- I gotta go, Prue.

180
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:58,200
Hey, is there a problem?

181
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:11,926
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

182
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,847
Hey, man.

183
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:35,521
Oh, we so have to cancel
your Martha Stewart subscription.

184
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,283
When I start making flower boxes
out of milk cartons,

185
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:40,599
- then you can shoot me.
- No problem.

186
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:43,886
So do you need help with anything?

187
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:47,446
- What happened to doing nothing?
- I'm finished.

188
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:48,928
You can't finish doing nothing.

189
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:51,398
So then how do you know
when you're done?

190
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:53,366
Put your finger on this.

191
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:56,606
- It's for Dan.
- What did you get him?

192
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:59,159
This book on San Francisco
architecture.

193
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:03,486
I know, I know. It's a little too
impersonal for Valentine's Day, but...

194
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:05,686
No. No.

195
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:09,762
Shows that you know him.
It's perfect for him.

196
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:13,399
- What did you get Leo?
- Leo? But... Should I?

197
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:15,958
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

198
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,602
- Hi.
- Hey.

199
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:19,600
Okay, guess what I saw
on Pheeb TV.

200
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:21,805
No, not a premonition.
It's Valentine's Day.

201
00:14:21,969 --> 00:14:24,039
Can't there be some kind
of supernatural day off?

202
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:26,763
- What did you see?
- There was a guy harassing this girl,

203
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:29,045
so I tried to stop him, and wham.

204
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:33,407
It was really weird.
Like, a guy biting a girl.

205
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:36,606
Biting or kissing?
It is that time of the year.

206
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:39,727
- It could've been kissing.
- Maybe. It could have been, I guess.

207
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:42,881
Most people kiss on Valentine's Day.
Except, of course, for witches.

208
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,519
Witches don't kiss on Valentine's Day,
because something always comes up.

209
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:50,159
Okay, maybe it was just some drunk
frat guy and his chick of the moment.

210
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:53,082
Yeah, maybe. It just...
It wasn't very clear.

211
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:57,800
And then I followed him,
and I think he jumped over this wall.

212
00:14:58,369 --> 00:14:59,882
He jumped over a wall?

213
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:02,762
Yeah, well, there was a ladder
pretty close.

214
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,402
Phoebe, come on.
Doesn't anybody care

215
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:07,402
that I have dinner plans tonight
with Dan?

216
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:11,404
Oh, honey, is that what he got you?

217
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:14,800
I mean, it's nice and all,
just a little impersonal.

218
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:18,645
What'd she get for Leo?

219
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:20,847
What'd you get Leo?

220
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:24,688
But we missed section.

221
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:26,999
It's Valentine's Day.
I wanna find my date.

222
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:29,319
Are you sure?
I mean, this isn't natural.

223
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:32,322
You said it was just a joke,
and now they are human beings.

224
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:33,638
- Pretty cool, huh?
- No.

225
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,288
No, it's not.
We should turn them back.

226
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:38,088
Just chill. Wait until midnight,
and they'll turn back on their own.

227
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:39,238
Yeah.

228
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:43,918
What does this mean?

229
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,884
It's a spell.
That's what made you human.

230
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:50,483
Yes, but for how long?

231
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:56,798
He asked you a question.

232
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:02,407
Twenty-four hours.
But actually, now it's more like 12.

233
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:04,721
Well, fix it.

234
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:06,607
We've decided
we'd like to stay this way.

235
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:09,483
Yeah, we're having fun.

236
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:12,722
Yeah, it sure looks like it.
Now, am I wrong here,

237
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:17,047
- but aren't you supposed to be mine?
- Aren't you having fun, Andrea?

238
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:20,798
You know, you can have
much more fun if we had more time.

239
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,401
- I might know how.
- No.

240
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:26,283
Okay, maybe I don't,
but I know someone who might.

241
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:28,565
Phoebe, yeah.
She'll be at the party tonight.

242
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,920
Wait, I have the class roster.
I know where she lives.

243
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:34,208
Show us the way.

244
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,837
We're gonna eat, though, right?

245
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:40,001
- I don't think we should be messing...
- Why don't you go on ahead.

246
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:42,766
We'll catch up.

247
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:56,119
Now, why do you have to be
such a little troublemaker?

248
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,077
Thanks for keeping me company.

249
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:08,205
Better here than at the club
with Prue.

250
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:12,601
This boredom has turned her
into the demon of decoration.

251
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,000
Why don't they make a card that says,
"You used to be my whitelighter,

252
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:21,081
and now your wings are clipped,
and you're sleeping in my club"?

253
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,319
Or how about,
"You snooze, you lose,

254
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:26,242
and now I'm getting naked
with the neighbour."

255
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:27,683
Hey.

256
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:29,607
What about this one?

257
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:32,040
Oh, yeah. Yeah, very sweet.

258
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:36,488
And what is that supposed to say?

259
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:39,721
That says something in Portuguese,
but at least you won't have to worry

260
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:41,527
about him taking it the wrong way.

261
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,839
Thank you. Oh, no.

262
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:46,842
"To the special person who lights up
my day, I'll treasure you always."

263
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:50,558
- Oh, of course.
- And then I'll spit up on myself.

264
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,805
The girls in school are reading this.

265
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:55,483
The ones in my class.
We are so in right now.

266
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:59,843
We are not in, love is, and this stuff
gives people hope that they can find it.

267
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:02,239
Yeah, the problem is,
people think they can get into magic

268
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:03,842
without dealing
with the consequences.

269
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:05,806
None of this is like
in the Book of Shadows.

270
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:07,721
I mean, for one thing,
it doesn't really work.

271
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,562
I mean, normal people
can't make this work.

272
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:12,327
Right?

273
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:14,918
- Pheebs?
- Not without a little help.

274
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:20,721
I have to go call Prue.
I think I need her help with something.

275
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:24,325
Something to do? She'll be thrilled.

276
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,880
Okey-dokey.

277
00:18:31,969 --> 00:18:33,402
Now, that's a card.

278
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:44,207
This will do.

279
00:18:57,489 --> 00:19:01,767
Hello? Worker bees? Anyone?

280
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:26,799
This will ruin the dinner
that I'm gonna buy you tonight.

281
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:29,244
You are so sweet.

282
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,960
Piper red label?

283
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:36,647
Well, with a name like that,
I figured it would be the best.

284
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,128
I mean, this is our first holiday.

285
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:42,084
Granted, a holiday invented
by Hallmark,

286
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,205
but first, it's just the same.

287
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:50,887
Is that for me?

288
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:05,561
"To a dear friend
on Valentine's Day."

289
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:11,566
Piper, it's good to know
that you're deeply in like with me.

290
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,687
It isn't for me. It's for Leo, isn't it?

291
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,646
- What do you want me to say?
- How about "no."

292
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,846
Dan, you read it. Read it again.
It says "to a friend."

293
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:24,285
And I'm sorry, but I'm not interested
in ending that particular friendship.

294
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,400
I'm not sure that's all he sees it as.

295
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:28,446
I come with a past. We all do.

296
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,805
It's a package,
one I would like to share with you,

297
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:32,322
but you can't pick and choose.

298
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:34,400
- You get all of me.
- Do I?

299
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:37,559
Okay. I've gotta work.

300
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:39,526
So why don't I just see you tonight.

301
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:42,688
Fine.

302
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:45,847
Fine.

303
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:49,446
I just love Valentine's Day.

304
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:55,600
- You can't do this.
- This is going too far.

305
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:57,839
Rules, like cages,
were meant to be broken.

306
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:01,126
Okay, since leaving campus, you guys
have beaten a pedestrian to a pulp

307
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:03,120
and played chicken
with a car-pool mom.

308
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:05,962
- Are you on something?
- Or just your average crazy?

309
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:07,683
Look, Tessa seemed fine.

310
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:11,165
But if she's really not feeling well
like you said, we should go home.

311
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:13,166
- Or at least call her.
- Not yet.

312
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,280
We need Phoebe.

313
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:18,326
What...?

314
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,280
Oh, my God.

315
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:30,124
- What's happening?
- We're changing back.

316
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:31,682
The spell said this would happen.

317
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:35,359
Look, Phoebe's not here, and there's
nothing we can do to change things.

318
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:38,083
- It's not like we made up the rules.
- God, Tessa was right.

319
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:40,042
We shouldn't have done this.

320
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,645
She talked too much.

321
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:56,638
What are you doing?
Don't touch me.

322
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,885
- Guys, stop. This isn't fun anymore.
- Yes, it is.

323
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,562
Next time you want
a dangerous man,

324
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:03,004
might wanna make sure
he's not poisonous.

325
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:12,678
- Why'd you do that?
- Paper. Give me the paper.

326
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:16,283
Are they...

327
00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:17,438
...dead?

328
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:19,088
They will be.

329
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:22,207
Wait a minute. Don't we need
both them and Phoebe for the spell?

330
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:25,003
- That's how it worked before.
- Four hours until we turn back.

331
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:27,520
Four hours until they die
from the poison.

332
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:31,687
I think that information might motivate
this Phoebe to help us.

333
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:40,839
Her scent, it's everywhere.

334
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:45,241
- But she's not here right now.
- Let's go home, okay, guys?

335
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:49,925
I've had enough.
We're not meant to be like this.

336
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:55,567
What?

337
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:59,727
Come on, guys, what? No.

338
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:03,126
Not me. Guys, stop. No! No! No!

339
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:10,199
I didn't think he'd ever shut up.

340
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:15,162
So since when can mortals
cast spells that actually work?

341
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:19,004
Look, I know that that book is probably
a total cheese-fest, but what if?

342
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:21,603
I mean, the spell called for
living objects, my premonition

343
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:24,158
and that guy who could leap
tall buildings in a single bound?

344
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:26,718
Something is wrong, I know it.

345
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:29,717
Higher education.

346
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:32,084
Maybe I need to come back
to college to study something.

347
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:33,238
- Oh, Ethan.
- Hey.

348
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:37,038
- What happened, honey?
- Oh, it's nothing. Some drunk frat guy.

349
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:38,801
Seems to be a lot of that
going around.

350
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:40,641
This is my sister Prue.

351
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,318
- Hi.
- Hey.

352
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,207
Well, I just knocked,
but nobody was in.

353
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,360
Thought I'd give them hell
for missing section.

354
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:48,201
Andrea and Brooke
would totally bail,

355
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:50,764
but it doesn't really seem
like Tessa, you know?

356
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:53,325
It is Valentine's Day.
Maybe they had something to do.

357
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:55,161
Do you?

358
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,277
Okay, gotta go. Busy, busy.
Nice meeting you, Ethan.

359
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:00,320
Nice to meet you,
and I'll see you tonight.

360
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:01,763
Okay.

361
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:03,123
All right.

362
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:04,768
- Back!
- Okay.

363
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:06,567
- I'm sorry, okay?
- Well, you're right.

364
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:08,845
Love takes a back seat to duty.

365
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:11,443
What's that about love
in the back seat? Because...

366
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:14,719
...Mom, Dad, your birth.

367
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:17,084
- That's disgusting.
- Sort of how you were...

368
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:20,286
My God, this place is a mess.

369
00:24:20,449 --> 00:24:24,601
I mean, I know that boys are bad,
but this is a pigsty.

370
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:26,646
I don't think they did this.

371
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:29,482
- Hey, is this the spell book?
- Yeah.

372
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:34,566
- What was that?
- It's in the closet.

373
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:55,605
Look, Tessa, I know what you've
been through has been really hard,

374
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:58,647
but the only way that we can help you
is if you tell us what happened.

375
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:01,204
There's no way
that you'd understand.

376
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:04,999
You won't find two more understanding
people in this particular instance.

377
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:07,599
It just sounds so crazy,
and you're gonna think that I'm...

378
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:10,158
Very brave for facing whatever it is.

379
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:16,399
You remember that spell
that we showed you in class?

380
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:18,247
Well, it worked.

381
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:20,286
Not like it helped us meet guys,

382
00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:22,201
it helped us make guys
out of animals.

383
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:24,680
And you did this
from the spell in that book?

384
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:27,728
Yeah, and we even played back the
tape that we were recording in class

385
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:29,686
so we could hear your corrections
to the spell.

386
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:31,840
But before we had a chance
to chant the new version,

387
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:33,806
I mean, there they were.

388
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:36,437
All right, so what is it that you think
these men want with you?

389
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:38,207
I don't know.

390
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:41,520
Maybe it's our fault because we tried to
make them into something they're not.

391
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:44,328
No, you can't blame yourself
for the actions of other people.

392
00:25:44,729 --> 00:25:47,721
We're gonna fix this.
First, we have to fix you.

393
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:49,527
I'll be right back.

394
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:57,598
If I were hydrogen peroxide,
where would I be?

395
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:10,208
- Phoebe?
- Prue, where do we keep

396
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:12,564
the hydrogen peroxide?

397
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:24,448
Oh, my God.

398
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:26,884
He was one of them,
except he didn't look like that.

399
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:29,683
- The spell must be wearing off.
- They're starting to look and act

400
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:32,568
- more like animals.
- Look, they've killed one of their own.

401
00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:36,005
There's no telling what they'll do
or what they've done to your friends.

402
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:37,927
- Do you know what they want?
- You.

403
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:39,717
- What?
- They're having fun,

404
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,040
and they wanna stay this way. Andrea
told them you'd be able to help them.

405
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:45,165
Okay, where are they now?

406
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:49,247
There.

407
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:52,168
That's where they think you'll be.

408
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:00,887
Hey. Hey.

409
00:27:07,729 --> 00:27:10,038
- You guys need some help?
- You could say that.

410
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:13,087
- I think we're out of gas.
- What can I do for you?

411
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:17,079
Well, you could not scream.

412
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:33,808
Okay, ladies, Papa's got
a brand-new set of wheels.

413
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:36,721
Prue, the place is full of snakes.

414
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:39,847
How am I supposed to pick out
the right one?

415
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:43,524
Did I mention I have
dinner plans with Dan?

416
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:47,723
Okay, you're five minutes away? Okay,
as fast as you can would be good.

417
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:49,447
- Everything okay?
- Of course not.

418
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:51,998
Prue and Phoebe have found
a problem. Two of them, actually.

419
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:53,921
And they're bringing their dates here.

420
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,603
On a night when you have
a date of your own, huh?

421
00:27:57,329 --> 00:27:58,967
Just earmark anyone
looking for Phoebe.

422
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:00,881
They're coming here
to try and find her.

423
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:04,682
Excuse me,
you wouldn't happen to know

424
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,079
if Phoebe Halliwell is anywhere
around here, would you?

425
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:10,328
She should be here any minute,
and if you sit down and don't move,

426
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:11,757
you'll have a perfect view.

427
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:22,246
You think he's...?

428
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,240
- Could be.
- Let me help.

429
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:26,681
No, Leo. Thank you,

430
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:30,285
but now that you've lost your wings,

431
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:32,246
I don't want you to get hurt.

432
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:45,201
Hey.

433
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:48,287
- You my Valentine?
- I hope so.

434
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:50,519
- Especially after...
- Today.

435
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:52,242
Well, tonight's tonight.

436
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:54,757
So let's get started.

437
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:57,601
About that.

438
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,327
You're kidding.

439
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,207
Just tell me you're kidding.

440
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:03,445
- What?
- Wait, let me guess.

441
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,839
It's something with your sisters.
Or maybe you'll be vague

442
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:07,920
and just say,
"Something important's come up."

443
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:10,444
Or my favourite of all time,

444
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:12,520
"It's a matter of life and death."

445
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:16,400
Actually, what I was going to say,
if you would let me,

446
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:17,968
is that I'm running a little late,

447
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:19,801
and could you please
wait for me at the bar?

448
00:29:34,449 --> 00:29:35,962
Phoebe?

449
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,486
Are you okay?

450
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:44,837
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

451
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:46,681
Piper's destressing in the alcove.

452
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:50,959
Tessa, Leo. Leo, Tessa. Can you
watch her for us for a little while?

453
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:52,887
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

454
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:55,244
- How's the spell coming?
- It'd be coming a lot better

455
00:29:55,449 --> 00:29:57,041
if I had a pinch of the salt of life.

456
00:29:57,489 --> 00:29:59,639
- We got the salt of margarita.
- I will take it.

457
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:04,286
On this day of love,
let's show a little for Janice Robinson.

458
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,287
So who are you?

459
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:08,241
I'm...

460
00:30:09,449 --> 00:30:11,201
...just a friend.

461
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:37,443
Hey, how's my stressed-out sister
and her something?

462
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:40,442
Well, we've moved past "something"
and straight into "everything."

463
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:43,919
The view sucks. I don't recommend it.
How goes the battle plan?

464
00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:45,767
We didn't find anything
in the Book of Shadows.

465
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:48,603
Which makes sense,
because the ani-men or whatever

466
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:51,602
were created by careless magic,
not supernatural evil.

467
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:53,761
- So where does that leave us?
- In the hands

468
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:56,363
of our spellbinding sister,
who's writing a little hocus-pocus

469
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:57,882
to turn these men back into animals

470
00:30:58,049 --> 00:30:59,687
before they get
completely out of control.

471
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:02,483
Easier said than done.
I do not work well under pressure.

472
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:05,288
- Any sign of them?
- Well, I've been watching that one,

473
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:09,044
who came in looking for Phoebe,
but he doesn't seem so creepy.

474
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,929
Yeah, the only magic Phoebe
wants to work on him is personal.

475
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:14,000
That's her date.

476
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:16,803
Why do we seem to have a habit
of gathering our men

477
00:31:16,969 --> 00:31:18,846
at the scene
of a supernatural smackdown?

478
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:21,524
- It's part of our charm.
- Hey, ladies.

479
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:24,365
Hey, Darryl, please tell me
you're here

480
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:26,565
for a nice romantic evening
with your wife.

481
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:28,566
No, that would be what I'm late for.

482
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:30,960
- Join the club.
- I'm here as a friend.

483
00:31:31,129 --> 00:31:34,280
It's not my case, but I've heard a buzz.
String of violent crimes from campus,

484
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:36,957
through your neighbourhood,
all the way here to the parking lot.

485
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:39,399
Stolen blue Grand Marq
the assailants were driving?

486
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:42,367
Parked outside.
Couple of units are on the way, so...

487
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:45,244
- Thanks for the heads-up.
- I'll warn security.

488
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,167
- Here.
- Oh, thanks, Leo.

489
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:53,685
Tessa says Andrea
and Brooke aren't here.

490
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:55,163
But they are.

491
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:03,087
Phoebe. So nice to smell you.

492
00:32:03,249 --> 00:32:04,887
He just spotted me.

493
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,239
- How are we doing on that spell?
- You keep throwing

494
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:14,481
this "we" word around,
and I don't see you doing anything.

495
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:18,201
- Wait.
- Darryl, no.

496
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:24,121
Darryl, wait.

497
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:26,081
Okay, I got it.

498
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:33,405
Make us human, or by the time
you find your friends, they'll be dead.

499
00:32:34,689 --> 00:32:37,328
Something wicked in our midst

500
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,844
In human form, these spirits dwell

501
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:41,243
Phoebe, no.

502
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:45,367
Make them animals sayeth the spell

503
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:48,967
Phoebe, they hid the girls.

504
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:52,479
Okay, we need to keep them human
until we find out where they are.

505
00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:01,047
- Okay, what's going on?
- The good news...

506
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:02,483
...is the spell worked.

507
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:03,684
And the bad news?

508
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:05,800
The spell worked on everyone.

509
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:19,603
I don't have a permit
for this kind of party.

510
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:34,246
Old MacPiper had a farm

511
00:33:34,449 --> 00:33:35,882
E-l-E-I...

512
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:37,687
Was that a moo?

513
00:33:38,969 --> 00:33:42,359
- Phoebe, fix this.
- Rome was not built in a day, Piper.

514
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah, but my club was ruined
in the blink of an eye.

515
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:49,201
At least we don't have to try and figure
out what species our innocents are.

516
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:52,128
Yeah, but if Tessa's right,
and they're not here, then what?

517
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:53,927
Well, right before you cast the spell,

518
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:57,206
the snake said something about,
if we don't make them human,

519
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,042
- then the girls will die.
- So how much time do we have?

520
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:03,798
Tessa said the spell lasts for 24 hours,
and they cast it at midnight, so...

521
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:05,402
That's in 35 minutes.

522
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:08,561
Didn't Morris say something about
the men's stolen car parked outside?

523
00:34:08,729 --> 00:34:11,038
Yeah, followed by...

524
00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:13,685
...the police, who are
on their way here right now.

525
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,959
Okay, you know, I made this mess,
let me clean it up.

526
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:18,962
You have to find Brooke and Andrea,
because if my premonition was right,

527
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:22,122
- As they always are.
- They were both bitten by that snake,

528
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:24,843
which means if they don't get
medical attention, they could die.

529
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:27,921
We'll go try and find something
in the car that will lead us to them.

530
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:29,960
Okay, Phoebe,
you try and turn this room back,

531
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:31,801
and we will try to find the girls, and...

532
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:35,200
Go kiss someone else.

533
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:38,921
Let's take these guys with us,
make sure they don't turn human.

534
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:40,841
Are you sure we got the right ones?

535
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:43,284
Yeah, it was the only
rabbit and snake next to each other.

536
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:46,078
And the only two that put up a fight.

537
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:48,962
Whoa, they're fleeing.

538
00:34:50,729 --> 00:34:52,879
Piper, how about
a little supernatural corral.

539
00:34:56,049 --> 00:34:57,562
Thank you.

540
00:34:58,009 --> 00:35:01,718
Okay. I would like you all to know
that I am vegetarian, okay?

541
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:04,164
I have never eaten any of you.

542
00:35:05,009 --> 00:35:06,806
Why do I have to carry
the poisonous snake?

543
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:08,561
- Because you're the oldest.
- So?

544
00:35:08,729 --> 00:35:11,004
So you've lived a full life.

545
00:35:11,169 --> 00:35:12,761
Wait, you think that's the car
over there?

546
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:14,647
What, do you want me to ask them?

547
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:17,960
You know what? You're a smartass.
Come on, we don't have much time.

548
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:27,280
No. Bad dog!

549
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:29,565
Lxnay on the icking-lay.

550
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,600
You know what?
Nobody bothers the witch, okay?

551
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:35,237
If we all remain calm,
I will have everything under control

552
00:35:35,409 --> 00:35:36,967
and back to normal, all right?

553
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:40,642
- Nothing. Now what?
- Trunk.

554
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:46,077
Oh, my God.

555
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:48,924
They have a pulse.
It's still there, but it's faint.

556
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:51,603
- We need to get them to the hospital.
- All right.

557
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:56,281
Undo the magic acted here
Reverse the spell so all is clear

558
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:11,084
Back off, Thumper.

559
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:14,365
- What's happening?
- Phoebe reversed the spell.

560
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:16,087
- Piper, hold on.
- What do you mean?

561
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:32,882
How's it feel to be a man now?

562
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:46,526
What do you say we wake up
Dr Poison here and move him...?

563
00:36:46,689 --> 00:36:48,805
Move Thumper there
right into his fangs?

564
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:50,482
I've got a better idea.

565
00:36:50,649 --> 00:36:52,207
Come on.

566
00:36:58,729 --> 00:37:00,924
Well, at least we're human
for good now.

567
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:02,727
Shut up.

568
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:07,324
So it looks like they got
what they wanted.

569
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:09,002
They get to be treated like humans.

570
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:10,682
And caged like them too.

571
00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:13,283
You three sure are rewriting
my book on public service.

572
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:15,281
- So the girls are gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

573
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:19,278
They're on the way to the hospital.
I think you found them just in time.

574
00:37:19,729 --> 00:37:21,401
How did...?

575
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:25,208
I'm not gonna even ask.

576
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,360
Remember when our biggest
concern on Valentine's Day

577
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:29,121
was who to spend it with?

578
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:30,603
Still is.

579
00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:32,521
Yeah, maybe for you.

580
00:37:32,689 --> 00:37:34,805
I was dateless tonight.

581
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:38,279
Oh, speaking of dates,
don't I have one in there?

582
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:05,364
You know, I never knew how
exhausting not having a job could be.

583
00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:09,488
- Table four needs to be bussed.
- Okay, I'm serious.

584
00:38:09,649 --> 00:38:13,244
It's like having a job sort of made this
whole charmed thing less stressful.

585
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:15,320
It gave me something else
to worry about.

586
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:18,287
So the Prue of old wins out after all.

587
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:20,041
I like being busy.

588
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:21,801
Then why mess with a good thing?

589
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:25,325
Yeah, I just need to find something
that I love getting busy at.

590
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:28,765
Speaking of getting busy,
check out our little sister.

591
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,442
Oh, my.

592
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,925
Let's just hope
she doesn't do '80s dancing.

593
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:38,001
Time to go home. Bye.

594
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:40,327
Stick around.
Janice Robinson will be back

595
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:42,445
with her second set
after a short break.

596
00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:45,282
- Phoebe, there's something...
- Oh, no. In my teeth?

597
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,002
Oh, no.

598
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:53,006
That's... That's...
That's really strange.

599
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:01,080
You're not a beck-and-call
kind of girl. I get that.

600
00:39:01,249 --> 00:39:04,047
I have a job that takes time,
a family that takes time,

601
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:07,087
and making you and me work
is gonna take time.

602
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:09,041
I need to know
you're willing to deal with it.

603
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:12,440
You know I am,
as long as you realize who I am.

604
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:15,720
Sometimes I...

605
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:20,559
I get jealous. I wonder where you are
and who you're with, and that's me.

606
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:23,203
But you can't make me
something I'm not.

607
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:24,848
Work with me, yes, but change me...

608
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:28,247
Relationships are hard work.

609
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:30,647
Especially on an empty stomach.

610
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:33,603
You think we can talk about this
over dinner?

611
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:35,037
Magic words.

612
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:41,120
Oh, I forgot my purse.
I'll meet you outside.

613
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:42,927
Okay.

614
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:05,005
Piper, when we first met,
you thought I was just a handyman.

615
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:08,963
Well, I'm a handyman again.
Same guy you fell in love with.

616
00:40:09,129 --> 00:40:12,678
The same guy who fell in love
with you for who you are.

617
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:15,488
Remember that,
and know that I'm not giving up.
