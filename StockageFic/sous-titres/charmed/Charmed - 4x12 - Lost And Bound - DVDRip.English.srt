1
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,192
Hey.

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,915
Guess what.

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,832
You've come to help me
fold the laundry.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,399
No.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,357
What good is being a witch
if I can't just

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,478
twitch my nose
and make the laundry fold itself?

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,234
Which witch can do that?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,069
Samantha Stephens.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,275
From Bewitched?

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,308
Oh, it's only, like, one
of my favourite old television shows.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,957
Sometimes I forget that you've only
been fully human for, like, a month.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,798
And becoming
more human by the day.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,431
What would you say
if I became really human...

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,232
...and got a job?

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,550
If that's the criteria
for being really human,

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,790
then I am in big trouble.

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,995
I'm serious.

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,550
Paige said that a lawyer
at Legal Aid quit, so she kind of...

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,435
...recommended me.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,115
She did?

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,557
Of course, if you
don't think I should, then--

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,709
No, no.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,795
Actually, I think that's a great idea.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,150
It'll keep you busy

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,955
and help you find your identity

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,235
while I lose mine.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,392
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,834
Tell me.

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,837
It's just...

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,913
...becoming a wife.

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,596
I mean, I like Samantha, but I never
actually wanted to become her.

32
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,276
See, Samantha,

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,190
she was married
to a human, Darrin.

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,593
Darrin completely repressed
Samantha's magic.

35
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,035
Completely denied who she was.

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,317
And it wasn't because
he didn't love her. It was just...

37
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,993
That's the way it had to be.

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,988
And this was one
of your favourite shows?

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,079
Well, not that part.

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,314
It's just, growing up,
that was my only role model

41
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,436
for a typical marriage.

42
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,669
So that's all I knew.

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,276
And he was able to meet people
and leave the house

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,919
and go to work
and build his career.

45
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,957
And she had to stay home.

46
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,873
You know, and cook dinner

47
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,712
and do the laundry.

48
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,393
She went from being Samantha

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,518
to being Mrs. Darrin Stephens
overnight.

50
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,108
Well, that won't happen to you.

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,953
- Won't it?
- No.

52
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,434
You'll become Mrs. Cole Turner.

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,309
Phoebe, come on.

54
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,472
Number one, this is a different time,
different world, obviously.

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,915
Number two, we're hardly typical.

56
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,071
I proposed to you
under a hail of demon goo,

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,674
and you accepted
while I was bleeding to death.

58
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,193
Remember?

59
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,790
Look, why don't we just...

60
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,631
...do it again, start over.

61
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,959
Grams' ring.

62
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,711
- Where did you get that?
- From Piper.

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,075
She gave it to me.

64
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,914
So I could give it to you.

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,753
Well, that's not exactly
a good omen.

66
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,672
She was married
with that thing six times.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,752
Well, she must have liked
something about it,

68
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,638
or she would have
stopped at, like, three.

69
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,915
Right?

70
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,429
Miss Phoebe Halliwell,
I come to you,

71
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,628
a man, nothing more,
nothing less, to ask,

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,872
will you be my wife?

73
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,114
Yeah.

74
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,233
I will.

75
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,833
Again.

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,754
Good.

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,156
Tyler, we just wanna talk.

78
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,912
It was an accident. I'm sorry.

79
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,518
- It's all right. Just let us in.
- No, you'll yell at me.

80
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,711
I'll deal with Tyler.
You contact Ludlow.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,592
Who's Ludlow?

82
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,671
He runs the academy
we told you about.

83
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,432
I'm not going to boarding school.

84
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,669
You can't send me away.

85
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,592
Oh, honey, it's for your own good.

86
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,557
I told you, I didn't mean to do it.

87
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,678
I swear I'm not bad. I swear.

88
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,352
Tyler? What's going on?

89
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,472
Is that smoke I smell?

90
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,512
Sun came up again.

91
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,955
Good morning, sunshine.
Let me pour you a cup of coffee.

92
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,429
Notice anything different about me?

93
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,990
Engagement ring.
Notice it, or wear coffee.

94
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,754
- Nice ice.
- Thank you very much.

95
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,911
I can't stop looking at it.

96
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,071
I was like that
when I got my belly ring.

97
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,996
Oh, you're right, a wedding ring
is totally different.

98
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,675
- Phoebe?
- Yeah.

99
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,717
Will you pass me the milk?

100
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,869
It's right next to Leo.

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,474
We're not talking to each other.

102
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,712
What? Still?

103
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,869
Wait, I don't understand.

104
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,917
Shouldn't you wait
till after you have kids

105
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,354
to start fighting about them?

106
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,590
Well, what's the matter?
Maybe we can help.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,357
It's about having a magical child
in a non-magical world.

108
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,954
Someone, I won't say who,

109
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,711
has the insane notion of binding
our child's powers.

110
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,712
Why is it insane?

111
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,314
Grams bound your powers
when you were a child.

112
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,708
Yes.

113
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,715
And we spent 20-odd years
ignorant about our destiny.

114
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,068
I look back on those normal days,

115
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,471
and I feel like I was
a complete and total fraud.

116
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,031
I'm not saying hide the truth.

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,952
It's just growing up
is hard enough

118
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,997
without the extra burden
of having powers.

119
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,914
Magic is not a burden. It is a gift.

120
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,436
It's a lot for any child to deal with.
Plus ours will be

121
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,955
doubly magical.
Half whitelighter, half witch.

122
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,109
Hey, that's like me.

123
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,668
You might have some trouble.

124
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,237
- Where's Cole? We gotta go to work.
- I'll get him.

125
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,312
And, Paige, thank you so much
for getting him this job.

126
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,550
Especially now, you know,
that we're gonna be married,

127
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,349
and he's gonna have to get used
to bringing home the bacon.

128
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,589
Since when does Phoebe
care about bacon?

129
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,069
I'm sure she meant
all breakfast meats.

130
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,073
Piper, would you please
pass me the milk?

131
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,679
Nope.

132
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,874
Oh, honey, you look gorgeous.

133
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,393
Should I make you some breakfast?

134
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,118
It's the most important
meal of the day.

135
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,157
- I'll grab a coffee on the way.
- Are you sure?

136
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,038
I could whip something up in a jiff.

137
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,519
- In a jiff, really?
- Yeah.

138
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,110
Come on, dude, let's get paid.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,228
Have a great day.

140
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,038
I am so proud of you.

141
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,994
Look at us. We are so Bewitched.

142
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,953
No, no, no. No, we're not.

143
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,554
You feel free to use all the magic
you want while I'm gone.

144
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,916
Okay. Whatever makes you happy.

145
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,074
I wonder what I should
make him for dinner?

146
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,074
So this is your office.

147
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,754
It's got a desk, a chair, a lamp.
What more do you need?

148
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,069
Oxygen.

149
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,840
You know, when I was a DA,
I had an office eight times this size.

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,355
Windows, an assistant.

151
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,158
Plus, I could throw energy balls.

152
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,550
Yeah, well, you're human now,
so get used to being humble,

153
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,597
just like all the rest of us.

154
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,315
Cole Turner? Hi, I'm Cynthia Corn,

155
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,755
- director of the Legal Aid office.
- Hi.

156
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,150
Paige has told me such
wonderful things about you.

157
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,231
I wish I had time to get
to know you, but I don't.

158
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,198
- So jumping right in, if we could.
- I have to jump right out.

159
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,157
If anyone needs me,
I'll be down the hall.

160
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,833
Okay, your first case.

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,878
Slumlord Alan Yates cut off heat
to his tenants last week.

162
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,190
He's due in at 1 2
for a fact-finding session.

163
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,794
You have two hours to learn
everything you can about this case.

164
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,633
So you better be fast,
and you better be good. Thanks.

165
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,511
Thank you.

166
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,671
I'm only human, you know.

167
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,634
Hi.

168
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,958
Hey.

169
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,473
What's with the kid?

170
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,029
The police brought him in.
Found him sleeping in an alley.

171
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,350
- Is he a runaway?
- Looks like it. His name is Tyler.

172
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,351
I'm having trouble getting
information from him.

173
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,558
Sometimes those little video-game
things help loosen them up.

174
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,438
Billy's got one in the back.
I'll go get it.

175
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,989
Good.

176
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,515
Here you go, Tyler,
thought you might be thirsty.

177
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,636
So have you thought about
giving us a phone number

178
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,189
so we can call your parents,
letting them know you're okay?

179
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,950
Do you want them to know
you're okay?

180
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,754
- Did they hurt you?
- No. They didn't hurt me.

181
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,394
Good, all right.

182
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,880
- But something happened?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

183
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,268
I know it's hard, Tyler,

184
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,796
- but talking is how we fix things.
- I said, I don't want to talk about it!

185
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,399
Fire.

186
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,999
Get the fire extinguisher.

187
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,715
Hey.

188
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,871
Hey, hey, don't go.
You don't have to be afraid.

189
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,396
It's okay. I won't tell anyone
I saw you start the fire.

190
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,878
You saw?

191
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,190
Yeah, but nobody else did.

192
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,398
And I promise I won't tell.

193
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,516
I swear I won't.

194
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,193
I didn't mean to do it.

195
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,237
I know, Tyler, I know.

196
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,834
Please don't make me
go back to the clinic.

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,151
I don't ever wanna go back
to my foster parents.

198
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,356
They don't understand me.

199
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,349
I know a place where I can take you
where you'll be safe.

200
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,956
But you gotta trust me, okay?

201
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,913
Come on.

202
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,508
- Sorry, I didn't see you there.
- We're looking for our son.

203
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,956
His name is Tyler,
1 1 years old, blond hair.

204
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,599
- And you are...?
- His foster parents.

205
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,478
Is he here? Is he all right?

206
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,471
- He was.
- Thank God.

207
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,119
We've been checking
everywhere for him.

208
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,157
- We've been worried sick.
- What do you mean?

209
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,072
- Where is he?
- There was a fire,

210
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,514
and in the chaos, he ran off.

211
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,035
Ran off? What do you mean,
you lost him?

212
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,031
Where could he have gone?
We've got to find him.

213
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,760
- I mean, right now.
- I understand this must be difficult.

214
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,593
You don't understand anything. We
need our son, and we need him now.

215
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,556
Would you give me
a moment with my wife?

216
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,039
She's obviously very distraught.

217
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,953
Of course.

218
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,555
You're making a scene.

219
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,631
Can't a mother be upset
about the loss of her son?

220
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,552
You're not reacting
like an overreacting parent.

221
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,073
- You're reacting like a--
- A what?

222
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,593
- A demon.
- We don't have time

223
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,718
to play the concerned parents.
Ludlow wants the boy before nightfall.

224
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,110
- No boy, no bounty.
- These humans can't help.

225
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,508
So, what are we supposed to do?

226
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,114
Wait until Tyler uses his power again?

227
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,032
It's the only way we have
of tracking him.

228
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,589
- What if he doesn't get angry?
- He will.

229
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,716
Just be patient.

230
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,112
How's it going?

231
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,551
Not so good.
He's barely making eye contact.

232
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,438
Not really speaking.

233
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,478
- He's just really afraid.
- Of what?

234
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,234
Himself, his powers.

235
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,638
He's showing the signs of a kid who's
never received sustained affection.

236
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,028
Well, plus being shuffled

237
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,031
in and out of foster homes
doesn't help either.

238
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,031
No, and I get the sense
that he's always

239
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,270
felt like an outsider
and a bit of a freak.

240
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,228
And now he's found out
that, in some ways, he kind of is.

241
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,274
Which is why it could make sense
for us to bind his powers.

242
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,034
Yeah, maybe we could just take off
one of his legs at the same time

243
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,872
because, you know,
they're both part of him.

244
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,314
It is not the same thing, Piper.

245
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,710
Tyler's powers could be a danger
to himself and to others.

246
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,232
You know what?
Don't make our issues his issues.

247
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,437
I think you need to give him
a chance to learn how to control it.

248
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,874
Maybe that's why we met him.

249
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,474
- To teach him, guide him.
- Feed him.

250
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,198
Wow, Phoebe, you went all out.

251
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,679
Oh, well, you know me.

252
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,149
Any excuse to spend
a little extra time in the kitchen.

253
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,993
I do know you,
and that's just not true.

254
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,833
But it is now that I'm gonna be
Sadie, Sadie, married lady.

255
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,277
All right, Sadie, how about
I take the cookies to the kid?

256
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,993
Do you mind if I try talking to him?

257
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,674
No, actually, the sooner
we get through to him, the better

258
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,149
because last time I checked,
kidnapping is still illegal.

259
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,154
I'm gonna go back to work.
You guys call me later.

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,433
Eat them while they're hot.

261
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,828
Pheebs, friendly little tip.

262
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,560
Lay off the hair spray.
There's a firestarter in the house.

263
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,434
Hi.

264
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,430
My sister made some cookies.
Do you want some?

265
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,951
I don't blame you.
It could be kind of dicey.

266
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,156
She's not really a great cook.

267
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,599
Why don't you try one so, you know,
her feelings don't get hurt.

268
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,549
Can I have another?

269
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,077
Help yourself.

270
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,313
You know, it's probably
hard to believe,

271
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,072
but something amazing
has happened to you.

272
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,278
You've been given a gift.

273
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,759
A magical gift.

274
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,957
And as strange as it sounds,
you're not alone.

275
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,838
I know exactly
what you're going through.

276
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,988
Yeah, right. You start fires too?

277
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,993
Not exactly.

278
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,471
But I do know what it's like
to possess a power

279
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,755
that you can't control

280
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,589
and to want so desperately to be
normal, but it's just not an option.

281
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,838
And because there aren't
any options, you just

282
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,833
sometimes get so angry
that you wanna--

283
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,359
What was that?

284
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,873
What did you just do?

285
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,837
I proved that I know
what you're going through.

286
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,036
But how did you do that?

287
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,675
Pretty much the same way you do.

288
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,638
I've just learned how to focus
my emotions and control it.

289
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,198
I wish I could control mine.

290
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,471
Then I could be around people.

291
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,556
Is that why you ran away?

292
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,711
Because you were afraid
you were gonna hurt someone?

293
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,199
I was scared.

294
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,715
I set fire to
the living-room couch.

295
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,229
I didn't mean to.

296
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,437
But my foster mom was yelling
at me, that I was "good-for-nothing."

297
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,512
And it made me so mad, I just...

298
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,235
I'm sorry.

299
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,351
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

300
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,714
In this house, it's okay.

301
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,509
I can also freeze things.

302
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,829
Now, that's cool.

303
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,237
Leo? Could you get some water?

304
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,436
Oh, Leo, I'm so glad you came in.

305
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,955
I have a very important question
to ask you.

306
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,678
What is it?

307
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,638
Do you think that little boy
will be staying for lunch?

308
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,313
I would imagine so.

309
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,072
What's the important question?

310
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,672
That was it.

311
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,909
Really?

312
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,748
Phoebe?

313
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,195
- Are you feeling all right?
- Peachy keen.

314
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,754
I'll get it.

315
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,919
- Hello.
- You gotta keep me

316
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,115
from killing this slumlord.

317
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,840
I got a meeting in, like, ten minutes
with a guy who's the biggest ass.

318
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,230
Hold it. Do not make me
march down there

319
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,992
and wash your mouth out
with soap, mister.

320
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,474
Do you want me to twitch my nose
and turn him into Mr. Nice?

321
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,234
No, I want to use an energy ball
and send him where he belongs.

322
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,119
The jerk cut off the heat, causing
an elderly tenant to get pneumonia.

323
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,157
- Then he tried to evict her.
- Okay, just relax

324
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,197
and try to get through it,
and I will have a martini

325
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,157
- waiting for you when you get home.
- Martini?

326
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,198
Yeah, and a steak. You really need
some more red meat in your diet.

327
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,952
What the hell are you talking about?

328
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,110
Company. I have to go.

329
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,512
I'll get it!

330
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,198
- Hello.
- Hi.

331
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,113
Hi. We're looking for our son, Tyler.
Is he here, by any chance?

332
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,872
You betcha. Come on in.

333
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,075
Can I make you anything?
A sandwich,

334
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,435
- a Spanish omelette, perhaps?
- Wait.

335
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,834
How did you know he was here?

336
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,352
Maternal instinct.

337
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,753
Piper.

338
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,274
I got him.

339
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,436
- Leave them alone.
- Nobody is keeping us

340
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,192
- from collecting our bounty.
- No. Stop.

341
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,793
Shut up, Tyler.

342
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,355
I didn't mean to.

343
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,875
Tyler, you don't have
to explain anything.

344
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,395
We were there,
we saw what happened.

345
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,953
I thought I was gonna
hurt someone,

346
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,348
and then I did.

347
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,636
You did what you had to do.

348
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,869
I did a bad thing.

349
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,676
Tyler, listen to me.

350
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,390
Look at me.
You didn't do a bad thing.

351
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,869
Those were very bad people,
and they were gonna hurt us.

352
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,076
You protected us.

353
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,916
Come on,
I want to show you something.

354
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,391
Come on, it's okay.

355
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,594
A book?

356
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,672
Not just any book.
It's a magical one.

357
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,034
Can I trust you?

358
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,077
Sure. Yeah.

359
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,915
Okay, let's find out
who those people really were.

360
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,712
My foster parents?

361
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,711
They weren't really
your foster parents, Tyler.

362
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,189
- They were...
- Demonic bounty hunters.

363
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,872
"Driven by greed, these heartless
low-level demons will stop

364
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,156
at nothing to collect their bounty."

365
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,069
So if they're bad, does that mean

366
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,549
- I didn't do anything bad?
- That's right.

367
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,958
Is there anything about me in there?

368
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,918
Actually, I think there is.

369
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,354
Here it is. You read.

370
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,831
"The firestarter. An extremely rare

371
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,151
and coveted magical creature."

372
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,073
What does "coveted" mean?

373
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,669
It means "highly desirable, wanted."

374
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,552
I'm wanted?

375
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,194
Very much so.

376
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,356
"Their power is linked
to their emotions.

377
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,478
First manifests itself in adolescence.

378
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,392
They're often trained to be

379
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,755
the bodyguards of The Source."

380
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,548
What's The Source?

381
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,392
A really, really bad guy.

382
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,233
Which means
he's probably resurfacing

383
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,516
if the bounty hunters
are after Tyler.

384
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,709
So Ludlow must be
a bounty hunter too, then.

385
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,309
- Who is Ludlow?
- Some guy who runs

386
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,357
some sort of an academy.

387
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,636
My demon parents
were gonna send me there.

388
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,870
To train, to serve The Source.

389
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,670
So then I am bad.

390
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,356
- Why do you say that?
- Well, if I'm supposed to use

391
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,397
my powers to protect
somebody bad...

392
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,596
No, but that's not how powers work.

393
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,877
They're not good or bad
by themselves.

394
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,799
It's how we use them.

395
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,238
Tyler, why don't you read
a little more while I talk to Piper.

396
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,674
Okay.

397
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,429
See? With a little guidance,
he's already on the road

398
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,670
to acceptance and control.

399
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,354
That's great, but I think
we have another problem.

400
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,909
I figured out how the bounty hunters
found out where Tyler is.

401
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,189
They tracked his powers.

402
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,076
- When he blew up the chair?
- Yeah.

403
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,958
So when he vanquished them...

404
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,918
So there may be
other bounty hunters on the way.

405
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,838
I'm making soup for Cole

406
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,036
He'll eat it in a bowl

407
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,952
I guess that's my new role

408
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,634
Just making soup for Cole

409
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,352
Where's the firestarter?

410
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,031
You nearly scared me half to death.

411
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,156
The boy, now.

412
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,875
I don't like
your tone of voice, mister.

413
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,590
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

414
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,988
No messy cleanup.

415
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,312
Since when do you scream
instead of fight?

416
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,392
Actually, I did consider
scratching him.

417
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,230
Okay, that was another
bounty hunter, which means more

418
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,551
are just gonna keep coming
until Ludlow gets Tyler.

419
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,273
Unless we get Ludlow first.

420
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,672
Dishpan hands.

421
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,718
Leo and I can pose as bounty hunters
and say that we have Tyler.

422
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,599
We can gain access to Ludlow
and vanquish him.

423
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,354
Sure. Just as long
as you're home for dinner.

424
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,069
But he's gotta be pretty powerful,
which means we might need

425
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,232
the power of three for us to bring
Ludlow back here, just in case.

426
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,119
And call Paige and tell her
to get her butt back here

427
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,840
- as soon as possible.
- Okey-dokey.

428
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,151
Oh, God, I'll have everything done
for you in one second, okay?

429
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,392
Two secs.

430
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,028
- Paige Matthews.
- Serena? Sam.

431
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,757
Phoebe? Look, I'm in the middle
of about a zillion things.

432
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,673
- Can I just call you back?
- Piper wants you to come home.

433
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,353
And I want you
to bring your appetite.

434
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,512
Yeah, Phoebe, like I said,
I'm in the middle of a zillion things.

435
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,112
Back off. This is assault.

436
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,396
It's better than what you do,
which is close to murder.

437
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,152
- Stay away from me.
- You would not believe

438
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,437
- what Cole is doing.
- Cole? How is my little sweetie?

439
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,034
- Get up, you scum!
- I'll see you in court.

440
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,839
You'll see me every time
you turn around, buddy.

441
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,071
I don't believe this. Let go of him.

442
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,196
- What are you doing?
- I want that heat turned back on

443
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,112
for those tenants today,
do you hear me?

444
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,838
Hands off me.

445
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,471
This is not the way
we do things around here.

446
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,755
Yeah, well, maybe you should.

447
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,718
- Or maybe I should quit!
- You're fired!

448
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,316
He looks so normal.

449
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,877
You sure we should let him
play those games?

450
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,758
Aren't they kind of violent?

451
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,069
Darn it!

452
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,633
Looks like he's learning
to handle his power.

453
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,712
He wouldn't have been
given them if he couldn't.

454
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,549
Is that what you think
about you and your sisters?

455
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,319
I don't know. Maybe.

456
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,518
All I do know is that,

457
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,910
when we finally got
our powers back,

458
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,594
it felt like we were scrambling
to catch up.

459
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,069
And I can't help but think
if we'd had our powers

460
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,834
from day one,
we would have been more prepared.

461
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,037
Things would have
turned out different.

462
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,516
Prue would still be alive?

463
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,272
And The Source would be dead.

464
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,271
And we would be on our way
to having a family,

465
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,271
as opposed to just talking about it.

466
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,317
And life

467
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,995
- would be perfect.
- Not perfect. Just easier.

468
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,194
Obviously, when I recommended you
for the job, I thought

469
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,588
you were a former demon.

470
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,320
You know, do me a favour, Paige,
and don't do me any more favours.

471
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,550
- Good, Paige, you're home.
- Yeah, but not for long.

472
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,711
I have to get back to work
unlike Cole here.

473
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,518
The Legal Aid thing
didn't work out for me.

474
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,910
See, I thought lawyers
were supposed to seek out justice.

475
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,197
Okay, we've got bigger problems.
The Source wants Tyler.

476
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,920
So let's focus
on the most pressing matter at hand.

477
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,274
- Lunch.
- Phoebe.

478
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,795
Darling, what a pleasant surprise.

479
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,469
You feeling okay?

480
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,632
Oh, yeah. Happy as a clam. Why?

481
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,759
What was that?

482
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,114
What was what?

483
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,510
You just flashed. Black and white.

484
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,669
Oh, don't be silly.

485
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,558
Oh, he's not being silly.
We all saw it.

486
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,599
Okay, we don't have time for this.

487
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,399
We gotta get to Ludlow before The
Source does. So, Cole, fix Phoebe.

488
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,835
I don't care how but just do it.
She needs to write a spell.

489
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,869
- Which spell?
- A power-of-three spell, in case

490
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,190
Leo and I have no choice
but to lure Ludlow back here.

491
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,232
Biscuits are ready.

492
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,069
We'll need some proof for Ludlow
that we actually have Tyler.

493
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,515
- We're gonna take his jacket.
- Why can't I come with you?

494
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,079
Because it's too dangerous.

495
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,878
But I can protect myself.

496
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,315
Besides, I helped you out before.

497
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,391
- Didn't l?
- This is different.

498
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,476
Okay, everyone, be ready,
be prepared. No surprises.

499
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,712
Hey!

500
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,313
- What happened?
- He jumped the orb!

501
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,869
Dude, you are so
going back right now.

502
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,279
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

503
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,873
We got lost.

504
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,838
The academy is protected by charms,
which means you can't find the place

505
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,991
unless you're looking for it.

506
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,914
Kill them.

507
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,149
- Let's get out of here.
- I'm not going.

508
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,669
You wanna bet?

509
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,474
Hey. I said, no.

510
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,756
Look, just listen to me.

511
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,831
They don't know I'm a firestarter yet.

512
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,434
Once they do,
they'll take us right to Ludlow.

513
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,954
Isn't that what we want?

514
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,680
No. Not at your expense,
and I'm not gonna let you go in there.

515
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,673
And I don't wanna spend the rest
of my life with bad guys chasing me.

516
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,759
He's right. Wherever we take him,
they will eventually find him.

517
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,512
Yeah, but if something
happens to him--

518
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,069
They won't hurt me. Remember?

519
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,719
I'm coveted.

520
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,076
Well, if he tags along,
it might double your chances

521
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,992
of getting Ludlow
and not having to go home.

522
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,276
I'd like to do
something good for once.

523
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,592
All right, but you stay next to me.

524
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,115
And if anything goes wrong,
we're out of there.

525
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,274
Okay.

526
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,509
This better work.

527
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,634
- Hi.
- How'd you--?

528
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,711
We're bounty hunters.
We need to see Ludlow.

529
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,515
- Who's the kid?
- I'm not a kid.

530
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,954
I'm a firestarter.

531
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,117
So are you gonna let us in or not?

532
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,795
- What's the password?
- The password?

533
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,039
It's...

534
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,397
That was it. You're in.

535
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,509
Oh, hi, honey.

536
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,835
What are you doing?
This is no time to be taking a bath.

537
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,752
Piper might be home,
and she's counting on you

538
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,797
- to write a spell.
- Oh, I tried.

539
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,269
And I only got as far
as "hey, demon,"

540
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,795
and then my mind went blank.

541
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,231
Look, I don't know
what's happening to you.

542
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,437
It might be some backfired spell
or curse or something.

543
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,319
But you gotta snap out of it.
There's work to be done.

544
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,835
Yeah. Hey, why aren't you
at the office?

545
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,395
Because I quit my job.

546
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,357
- You what?
- I don't think I'm cut out

547
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,120
- for that whole 9-to-5 life.
- Oh, honey, what will you do?

548
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,555
I don't know.
I'm still searching for who I am.

549
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,558
But we know who you are, which is
a demon-fighting, ass-kicking witch

550
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,995
who never lets her sisters down.
So get out of that bathtub

551
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,673
and show me what you're made of!

552
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,869
Better?

553
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,070
Cole, how's your progress going--?
Oh, God!

554
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,719
Full-frontal Phoebe. Sorry.

555
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,917
- She just-- She just flashed.
- Yeah, I got that.

556
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,877
No, I mean she just flashed
black and white.

557
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,993
Again? She's like an old TV

558
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,673
that's on the blink or something.

559
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,752
Hey, maybe that's the connection.
The TV show Bewitched,

560
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,512
is that in black and white or colour?

561
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,318
Originally black and white.

562
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,833
I'm very chilly.

563
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,750
- Phoebe, sit down.
- Okay.

564
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,876
Why are you asking me
about Bewitched?

565
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,190
Phoebe was worried about
becoming an old-fashioned housewife

566
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,430
Iike Samantha. And that might be
fine for some people,

567
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,192
but for Phoebe,
that could be dangerous.

568
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,517
So I'll take care of her, and you need
to write the power-of-three spell.

569
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,352
No, I've never done that before.

570
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,476
Well, you're gonna have
to learn fast, so go. Hurry.

571
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,359
- And you.
- Yeah.

572
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,397
You're coming with me.

573
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,951
Okay.

574
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,358
So we're gonna try
to take him out, right?

575
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,989
Yes, I will go in first.

576
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,113
What if I can't--?
I mean, I have to get angry

577
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,554
for my power to work, don't l?

578
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,395
- So?
- So, what if I'm just scared instead?

579
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,551
What if it doesn't work?

580
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,509
Just walk through that door.

581
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,356
- Through the door?
- Yes. Through the door.

582
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,591
Relax.

583
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,953
Where is he?

584
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,711
Ludlow.

585
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,194
So...

586
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,237
...you brought
the alleged firestarter.

587
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,593
You've given us quite
the run-around, haven't you, boy?

588
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,839
I said, haven't you, boy?

589
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,758
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

590
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,958
Yes, sir.

591
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,032
No one teaches manners anymore.

592
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,954
About our payment,
see, we don't want any surprises.

593
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,749
Yeah, because we hate surprises.

594
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,233
What are you doing?

595
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,076
Oh, you're afraid
that I'll grab the boy

596
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,390
and stiff you?

597
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,393
If the child is a firestarter,
you'll get your reward.

598
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,516
If he's not...

599
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,715
...you'll all die.

600
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,158
Well, Tyler is a firestarter,
so that won't be an issue.

601
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,518
Prove it.

602
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,673
Go ahead.
Give him everything you got.

603
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,635
What? Not even a flicker?

604
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,677
Okay, he's just a little scared.

605
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,274
Oh, that's ridiculous.

606
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,192
Don't be scared, boy.

607
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,320
You're closing in on the most
important moment of your life.

608
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,073
Prove what you are,

609
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,673
and you'll meet The Source,

610
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,513
the most powerful evil
that exists in the universe.

611
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,597
Yeah, okay, see, that's not helping.

612
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,432
- Do it.
- He's just a kid.

613
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,397
- Do it, boy!
- I mean it, lay off of him!

614
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,120
- lnsolent! How dare you!
- No!

615
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,993
Excellent. Well done.

616
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,351
- What did you do to him?
- Just a precaution

617
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,273
until The Source arrives
to kill him and steal his power.

618
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,590
- But--
- Your bounty's outside.

619
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,156
Leo, hurry. Go get him.

620
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,591
It's a force field.
I can't blast through it.

621
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,478
- I'll go get your sisters.
- Leo.

622
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,870
I know. Hurry.

623
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,038
It's a disaster there.
Ludlow has Tyler.

624
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,351
- It's a disaster down here too.
- Piper needs her sisters immediately.

625
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,239
Oh, I'll be right with you,
as soon as I finish this sleeve.

626
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,154
A child is in danger, Phoebe.
We need you now.

627
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,669
Phoebe? Who's Phoebe?

628
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,198
She can't go with you. She doesn't
even know who she is anymore.

629
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,554
I beg your pardon.

630
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,473
I know exactly who I am.

631
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,229
I am Mrs. Cole Turner.

632
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,518
This is all wrong. Ever since I put
that ring on your finger,

633
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,240
- you've been acting strange.
- You mean I've been acting normal?

634
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,198
Which is strange for you, you know.
I gotta be honest.

635
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,874
If this is what being married to you
is gonna be like,

636
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,554
- you can take that ring off now.
- I will not.

637
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,234
This ring is a symbol of our love.

638
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,799
That's it.

639
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,633
- It's the ring. We gotta get it off.
- Over my dead body.

640
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,756
That won't be necessary.
Grams' ring, please.

641
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,877
- No.
- Listen to this inscription.

642
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,716
"To gain another
is to lose yourself."

643
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,792
- Grams cursed the ring. Why?
- I don't know. Good question.

644
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,075
Look.

645
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,872
Are you feeling better?

646
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,553
I feel a little faint.

647
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,438
Can you hold it together?
We gotta go.

648
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,828
I don't know.

649
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,274
I'm still a little confused.

650
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,112
Well, nothing will remind you
of who you are

651
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,714
better than saving an innocent.
Now go to work.

652
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,438
I can't get in.
You gotta write a spell.

653
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,318
- Are you up to it?
- I think so.

654
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,391
Door unlock
No magic block

655
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,869
- That's it?
- Come here.

656
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,632
Door unlock
No magic block

657
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,114
Honey,

658
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,589
maybe we should go back and check
the Book of Shadows again.

659
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,159
I can't leave Tyler here.

660
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,311
It doesn't look like you
have much of a choice.

661
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,675
No!

662
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,355
Please. Please don't hurt me.

663
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,558
Stand back.

664
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,072
No.

665
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,197
Please.

666
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,594
What was that?

667
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,115
I think you just saw a mother
lift a car off her child.

668
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,677
All the pain...

669
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,910
...is over.

670
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,239
Soon...

671
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,836
...you will serve...

672
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,631
...The Source.

673
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,950
- I'm back.
- I paid you your bounty.

674
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,519
Yeah, that's not what I'm after.

675
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,316
- Power-of-three spell?
- I don't have one.

676
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,629
- What?
- I don't have one.

677
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,631
I did one.

678
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,033
The brittle winter
Gives way to flowers of spring

679
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,668
Ludlow is vanquished

680
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,154
What the hell was that?

681
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,276
It's a haiku. I couldn't do
the rhyming thing.

682
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,749
- Leo, he's frozen.
- I got him.

683
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,555
His hand is starting to warm up.

684
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,559
He's gonna make it.

685
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,029
Let's get back
to the gate and orb home.

686
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,357
Are you sure you wanna do this?
It's completely up to you.

687
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,556
Yeah, I'm sure.

688
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,199
It's an awful lot to give up.

689
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,157
No, it's not. Not for me.

690
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,309
All right, here you go.

691
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,394
It will bind your powers.
It won't strip them, but it'll bind them.

692
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,517
- Say, "Excuse me."
- Excuse me.

693
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,990
Ludlow's right, nobody
teaches manners anymore.

694
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,833
- Do you think it worked?
- Try it.

695
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,434
Look at something and get mad.
Just think of Ludlow.

696
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,235
I didn't hurt it.

697
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,359
I'm normal.

698
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,351
Whatever that means.

699
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,751
- Where are you going?
- To play video games.

700
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,271
Still wanna have a baby?

701
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,348
I'm just not ready
for an adolescent yet.

702
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,191
Well, Paige said
she found a pretty good family,

703
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,709
not too far from here.

704
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,269
I'm glad because
I want visitation rights.

705
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,353
Plus, you know,
I have to be in touch,

706
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,192
in case he ever wants
his powers back.

707
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,358
You think he will?

708
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,839
I don't know.

709
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,558
He's a surprising kid.

710
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,073
Yeah, like the piggyback orb.

711
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,795
I was so focused on how
I was gonna guide him.

712
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,032
Then he ended up guiding me.

713
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,395
- How?
- Well, you know how I was

714
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,835
upset with Grams
for binding our powers,

715
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,749
Ieaving us unprepared
for our magical future?

716
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,716
- You mentioned it once or twice.
- Well, now, I see

717
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,916
the wisdom in her decision.

718
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,231
She realised, someday, we were
gonna have to battle demons.

719
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,914
But she also realised that

720
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,832
children shouldn't live in fear.

721
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,878
They need to feel safe,

722
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,350
to explore and learn and grow.

723
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,831
I still think magic is a gift.

724
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,232
But Grams gave us
the greatest gift of all.

725
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,350
A normal childhood.

726
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,477
The gift of innocence.

727
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,550
Okay, okay, stop splashing. I'll say it.

728
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,551
Cole Turner

729
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,315
is the greatest lawyer
in all of the world.

730
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,155
The greatest unemployed lawyer
in all of the world.

731
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,276
Although Mr. Yates
did respond

732
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,079
to my persuasive argument
and got the tenants' heat back on.

733
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,719
And he's not gonna press charges?

734
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,395
Nope. His lawyer thought the case
would raise more issues than it closed.

735
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,232
I am so proud of you.

736
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,639
Now, that was colourful.

737
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,635
Okay, now, I think I figured out
what Grams did to this ring here.

738
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,916
- Did you, now?
- I think to keep her from

739
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,516
making a seventh mistake,
she put a hex on the ring.

740
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,671
So that if she ever
got engaged again,

741
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,559
the ring would remind her
of what she hated about marriage.

742
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,918
The loss of identity, the subjugation
by a man, the focus on housework.

743
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,672
All those things that I was afraid of.

744
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,593
But Grams was from a different era.
That's not gonna happen to us.

745
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,512
Sitting and knitting
is not the woman you are,

746
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,591
just like sitting and typing
is not the man I am.

747
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,873
No, I can't picture you doing that.

748
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,439
But can you picture us together,
or are you so freaked out by marriage

749
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,715
- that you don't--?
- No.

750
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,878
I wanna marry you.

751
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,512
We just have to work extra hard

752
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,638
to make sure neither one of us
loses our identity.

753
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,396
And as for Grams
and her notion of marriage...

754
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,559
...we can watch that
go down the drain.
