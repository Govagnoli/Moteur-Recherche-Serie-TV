1
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,650
Are you closing?

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,860
Not anymore.

3
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,988
Please, come in.

4
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,158
- I am Madame Theresa.
- I'm Phoebe.

5
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,826
Yes, I know.

6
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,912
Really? Did you read my mind?

7
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,332
No, I read your column.

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,381
You are not sure if you're a believer,
are you?

9
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,759
Oh, no. I'm a believer. Believe me.

10
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,427
That's why I'm here.

11
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,556
I didn't know where else to turn.

12
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,141
Sit.

13
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,480
Let's see what your hands tell us.

14
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,943
They're probably gonna tell you
that I need a manicure.

15
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,287
You have the gift of foresight.

16
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,248
- What?
- But don't worry.

17
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,209
Your secrets are safe here.

18
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,301
You are creative,

19
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,219
sensitive,

20
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,597
street-smart.

21
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,976
You have a strong family, close ties.

22
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,770
I am wondering why
you do not turn to them now.

23
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,523
I don't wanna worry them.

24
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,234
You see, I'm

25
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,237
having trouble with my gift.

26
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,824
And that's why I'm here.
I wanna try to figure out what's wrong.

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,577
These lines on your index finger,

28
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,163
they are saying
that you are overworked.

29
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,375
Yeah. Well, besides my column,
and my personal appearances,

30
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,378
my boss has me
giving advice on a radio show.

31
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,840
- And I love it, I do. It's just...
- Keeping that pace

32
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:16,011
has blocked out
other parts of yourself.

33
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,263
Including your gift.

34
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,475
Your gift must be honoured.

35
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,855
But so must your work.

36
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,984
So how do I find the balance?

37
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:37,950
Let's start by unblocking that energy.
Breathe with me.

38
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,093
I know that reaction.

39
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,595
You just had a premonition,
didn't you?

40
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,682
But I don't have premonitions.

41
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,060
Yeah, but I do.

42
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,604
Maybe you intercepted it for me?

43
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,940
The reading is over. You must go.

44
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,110
- No, but...
- I'm sorry.

45
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,913
Theresa. Theresa, wait.
I'm losing you. Say that again?

46
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:29,334
Orin, the gypsy hunter.
He's coming for me.

47
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,880
Theresa, that's impossible.
We blinded him decades ago.

48
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,257
Only gypsy magic can lift his curse.

49
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,010
I'm telling you,
it had to be him, Lydia.

50
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:42,181
The girl I was dukkering for,
she has a powerful gift for seeing.

51
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,058
And somehow I received her vision.

52
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,227
All right, where are you? I'll come.

53
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,105
No. You must leave town.

54
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:53,817
If he's hunting Shuvanis,
he could be after you next.

55
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,236
Expecting me, were you?

56
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,824
Theresa?

57
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,743
Theresa!

58
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,286
Orin?

59
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,413
You've heard of my father.

60
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,290
He'll be very pleased.

61
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,292
What do you want?

62
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,835
His revenge.

63
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,129
And of course,

64
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,089
your eyes.

65
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:24,241
- Maybe try a different yoga instructor.
- It wasn't the instructor.

66
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:27,160
It was all those women showing off
their sonogram pictures.

67
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,371
That was just working
on my last nerve.

68
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,417
Like, "Look, it's Jasper's first
photo and it's gonna go on the fridge

69
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,752
in a magnetic frame that says
'Jasper's first photo."'

70
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,715
Okay. I thought prenatal yoga
was supposed to help you relax.

71
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,634
How am I supposed to relax

72
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,180
when I can't even go to a doctor
like a normal person?

73
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,224
Honey, I thought we agreed that
a magical pregnancy was too risky.

74
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,143
Especially with a baby
that heals itself.

75
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,313
Okay, but she's not healing my
nauseousness. Every woman

76
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,649
in that class says it's supposed
to go away after the first trimester.

77
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,986
Well, according to this book,
every pregnancy is different.

78
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,113
- What book?
- This one.

79
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,073
The Joys of Home Birthing.

80
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,534
It also comes with this video.
I thought maybe we could

81
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,288
watch it together. It might make
you feel better about what's in store.

82
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,208
That sounds good.
I'll make some popcorn.

83
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,460
Since when are prenatal yoga

84
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,379
and home birthing videos
your idea of a good time?

85
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:23,050
Since I became a friendless loser
with no life.

86
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,761
- Paige, you have tons of friends.
- They're all employed.

87
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,472
And I'm a demon fighter
and I can't tell anyone about it.

88
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,976
So I basically just come off as
this big, dumb, fat, unemployed loser.

89
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,480
No, Paige. You're a big, fat, dumb,
unemployed loser who saves the world.

90
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,025
Oh, I hope that's leaded.

91
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,319
I didn't sleep very well last night.

92
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,321
- Cole problems?
- What?

93
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,407
No, he's soul-searching somewhere.

94
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,952
Or off searching for a soul.

95
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,746
I'm just a little overwhelmed
with work.

96
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,456
What's up with your hand?

97
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,588
I actually went to see
a gypsy fortune-teller.

98
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,092
Oh, look.

99
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,802
Work. Gotta go.

100
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,184
Hey. Hey there, Speedy.

101
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,938
Will you slow down and tell us
why you went to see a fortune-teller?

102
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,857
To get my fortune told.

103
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,404
Just don't freak out, all right? Because
I don't have time for a freak-out.

104
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,073
I went to find out

105
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,327
why I haven't gotten a premonition
in the last few months.

106
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,415
You've had premonitions.
Haven't you?

107
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:37,875
No, I haven't.

108
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,418
And check this out.

109
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,670
Hold this.

110
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,760
I can barely levitate.

111
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,556
- Do you think a demon...?
- No. I mean, I can still cast spells

112
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,725
and I still have
the power of three thing.

113
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:57,603
Whatever the problem is, it seems
more natural than supernatural.

114
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,106
Phoebe, why didn't you come to me?
I'm your whitelighter.

115
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,150
Well, because
you've been very busy.

116
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,736
- I've been busy?
- Okay. Well, I've been busy.

117
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,739
My work schedule's been really hectic.
But I'm coming to you guys now.

118
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,282
Okay, you guys yell at her.

119
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,202
I'm gonna check with the Elders
and see what they know.

120
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:19,458
I can't believe you went to a
fortune-teller instead of coming to us.

121
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,419
I'm really sorry, but I just
didn't want to worry you guys.

122
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,547
But now that we're on the subject...

123
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,299
What?

124
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,676
Something really weird happened
during my reading.

125
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,012
I felt like I was
getting a premonition

126
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,182
and then I think
Madame Theresa intercepted it.

127
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,768
Intercepted it? How?

128
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,146
She's a gypsy.
She probably channelled it.

129
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,689
Being that I have nothing to do,

130
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,609
I've actually been reading up
on a lot of gypsy magic lately.

131
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,361
Whatever she saw,
it must have been bad

132
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,613
because she closed up
shop very quickly.

133
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,157
Well, maybe you should swing by
and check up on her.

134
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,409
Yeah, I was going to, but...

135
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,663
Oh, that's work. I really have to go.

136
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,750
I'll go for you.
You know, I have no life and all.

137
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:05,462
Really? Oh, that would be great.
Let me just find the...

138
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,631
Here. Here's her card.

139
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:11,009
Thank you so much.
Find out what she saw.

140
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,604
I have a good feeling
about these eyes, Father.

141
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:26,233
I was glad to see the Shuvani
didn't put up much of a fight.

142
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:28,944
You saw that far?

143
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,240
Your mind's eye grows stronger.

144
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,784
I've had a long time to develop it.

145
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,751
But it's no replacement for
what those gypsies stole from me.

146
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,258
If these eyes work,

147
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,761
you'll have your revenge
and much more.

148
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,459
- Maybe we should stop trying.
- No!

149
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,545
The eyes I seek

150
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,714
are worth this pain.

151
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,886
Her Shuvani friend is near.

152
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,140
I can see her.

153
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,942
Yeah, we're almost done.

154
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,530
Yeah. I gave them
the heads up in there.

155
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,283
Phoebe Halliwell.

156
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,371
Hey, Phoebe, it's me.
I'm at the fortune-teller's.

157
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,248
Oh, really? What did you find out?

158
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,292
Nothing good.
Unfortunately, sweetie, she's dead.

159
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:12,756
What?

160
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,050
Yeah, she was murdered last night.

161
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,302
And from what I can gather,
it seems demonic.

162
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,555
She had her eyes gouged out.

163
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,474
I should have been able
to prevent this.

164
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:23,851
How do you figure?

165
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,020
Well, if my stupid powers
had been working, Paige...

166
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,147
They loved you over at Hot Line.

167
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,525
They want you to guest host
for the rest of the week.

168
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:36,154
This is not your fault, Phoebe. If you
were meant to stop Theresa's murder

169
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,198
you would have had
a premonition about this.

170
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,242
I know, I know. I can't.

171
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,952
Sorry, but I've already booked you.

172
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,954
- Can't what?
- I'm swamped.

173
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,541
Swamped? But, Phoebe, we have to
find this demon and stop him.

174
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,627
- Price of success, kiddo.
- Phoebe, hello?

175
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,422
I will meet you at home
and we'll get right on it. Okay?

176
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,803
Elise. Elise. Wait.

177
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,139
Is it possible that we could
postpone the radio show?

178
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,141
Because I barely have
time to write my column

179
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,602
let alone all the other stuff
that I have to do.

180
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,023
Dear Phoebe,
my career is on the fast track.

181
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:16,069
I'm wildly popular and the money is
pretty damn good. What should I do?

182
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,782
- Stop whining.
- Damn, you are good.

183
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:31,627
It's a very standard surgery.
You're gonna be just fine, I promise.

184
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,758
Excuse me.

185
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,135
Aunt Lydia,
what are you doing here?

186
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,389
No, in English.
I don't speak the language anymore.

187
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,434
I am in danger, Ava.
I am afraid you are too.

188
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,437
Orin is back and he is
seeking revenge on Shuvanis.

189
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,689
- Orin?
- The gypsy hunter.

190
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,274
You've heard the stories.

191
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,193
Aunt Lydia,
we've had this conversation.

192
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,111
I'm not interested in the stories.

193
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,865
- Ava, Madame Theresa was murdered.
- What?

194
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,576
I was talking to her on the phone
when it happened.

195
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,371
She had a vision of Orin
coming for her,

196
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:11,333
which means he'll be seeking
revenge on all Shuvanis, including you.

197
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,877
- I'm not a Shuvani, I am a doctor.
- Ava.

198
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,839
You cannot change
what you were born to be.

199
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,968
And Orin won't care that you rejected
your heritage. He'll sense you anyway.

200
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,803
Aunt Lydia,

201
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,097
I'm sorry about Theresa.

202
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:26,849
I know she meant a lot
to you and Mom.

203
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,101
I'll come to the funeral.
I'll pay my respects.

204
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,603
I'm not gonna run
from a fictional demon.

205
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,191
I gotta get back to work.

206
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,360
Ava, we have to trust
the gypsy magic.

207
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,614
Why? Because it did
such a great job saving Mom?

208
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,617
Your mother couldn't be helped,
chawi.

209
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,287
By the time she was sick,
it was too late.

210
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,746
You don't know that.

211
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,833
If she'd gotten chemo instead of
relying on herbs and spells...

212
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,961
Your mother believed in
herbs and spells, and so should you.

213
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,588
Yeah?

214
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,633
Well, if gypsy magic really worked,
then I'd be able to see her, right?

215
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,386
In the afterlife? Talk to her?

216
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,680
Like she promised me.

217
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:11,935
- Ava...
- I'm sorry, I don't have time for this.

218
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,730
Your friend was murdered.
Turn to the police, not superstition.

219
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:27,576
At full term, the baby's head
measures up to 38 centimetres.

220
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:34,583
Okay, see, I need an epidural
just to watch this.

221
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,418
Okay, let's

222
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,839
fast-forward to the part where
the parents get to meet the baby.

223
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:46,887
At this point, the birthing partner
will coach the mother's breathing.

224
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,847
Okay, give that to me.

225
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,934
Look, just tell me when the baby is out
and all wiped off.

226
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,313
But seriously though, I need a
sterile hospital, magical baby or not.

227
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:59,107
And medical people.
Lots of professional, medical people.

228
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,362
Gross. What are you guys watching?
Is that some horror movie?

229
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,324
No, it's the Joys of Home Birthing.
Strangely, I'm not feeling the joy.

230
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,660
Well, I'm sorry to cut
your entertainment short,

231
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,997
but we're on demon duty now. Turns
out Madame Theresa was murdered.

232
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,875
- The fortune-teller?
- Yeah, I checked with Darryl.

233
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:21,046
The third in a string of gypsy killings.
All had their eyes gouged out.

234
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,508
Now that video
doesn't seem so gruesome.

235
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:25,717
Speak for yourself.

236
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,428
Okay, let's go, people.
I've gotta fit this vanquish in between

237
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,930
two deadlines and three meetings.

238
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,599
Leo, what did you find out about my
powers? What's wrong with them?

239
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,226
Well, technically nothing.

240
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:38,146
Which means the disconnect
is tied to your emotions.

241
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,233
I think it's a case of
use them or lose them.

242
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,070
Hey, you know, if he's after gypsies,
we should stop by Theresa's funeral.

243
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,322
I know where it is.
Maybe you can get a premonition

244
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,199
that'll help us find the demon.

245
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:53,287
Prenatal yoga this morning, and now
you want to crash a stranger's funeral?

246
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,746
You really do need friends.

247
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,125
You're mean.

248
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:27,779
Well, I don't know what she's saying,
but the symbolism's beautiful.

249
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,823
It is. It's really beautiful.

250
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,576
Don't you guys think
Theresa looks a little crowded?

251
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,119
I think that's the gypsy custom,

252
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:37,498
to send their people off into the
next life with things they might need.

253
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,959
Okay, well, I need a cracker
in this lifetime.

254
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,463
Would it be bad if I grabbed
that box of saltines?

255
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,089
Probably.

256
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:50,052
May I join the choir invisible
of those immortal dead,

257
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,972
who live again in minds
made better by their presence.

258
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,518
Phoebe, enough with the work.

259
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,812
Sorry.

260
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:12,574
Well, go on. You're not gonna get
a premonition standing here.

261
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:15,285
Put a little shoulder into it.

262
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,498
Hi. Excuse me.

263
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,793
Pardon me. Hi.

264
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,046
Are you staying for the pomana?
I made stew.

265
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,340
Aren't you worried
about the gypsy hunter?

266
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,551
He won't attack in a crowd.

267
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,428
- Which means you'd be safer here...
- Please stop.

268
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:36,974
I have no interest in staying,
Aunt Lydia. This isn't my life.

269
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,811
Please accept that.
I have to get back to work.

270
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,271
Ava.

271
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,649
Ava, wait.

272
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,828
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

273
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,247
Yeah, I'm fine.

274
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:08,922
- Did you get anything?
- Kind of. Just bits and pieces.

275
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,508
Well, that's better than nothing.
What did you see?

276
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:16,096
I saw candles and lanterns
and Theresa in her coffin.

277
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:20,350
Okay, well, you don't need
a premonition for that. Anything else?

278
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,605
That woman. Her eyes.

279
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,149
Right.

280
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,360
Ava?

281
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,196
Ava!

282
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,699
Nice funeral.

283
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,955
Very touching.

284
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:50,130
But will there be any Shuvanis left
to throw you yours?

285
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,690
You're the one.

286
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,528
Hey!

287
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,828
He was supposed to blow up?
Why did he not blow up?

288
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:31,213
Oh, not good.
We gotta get out of here.

289
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,409
Thank you.

290
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,618
I have to go.

291
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,495
Wait, you don't have to be afraid.

292
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:07,457
I'm not afraid of you. We come from
sister traditions, witches and gypsies.

293
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,043
I appreciate everything you've done,
but I have to go.

294
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,712
But there's a demon after you.

295
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,631
I'm not the only one he's after.

296
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,469
Wait. Clearly you have powers,
but we face demons all the time.

297
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,513
Will you please at least
tell us what you know?

298
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,015
Maybe we're supposed to help.

299
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,059
Perhaps.

300
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,230
Years ago, my tribe threw a curse
on a gypsy hunter named Orin,

301
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:33,400
blinding him so he no longer
had the power to spot our people.

302
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:35,611
The demon we saw wasn't blind.

303
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,362
I think that was Orin's son, Cree.

304
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:40,240
I think he's killing Shuvanis
in the name of his father.

305
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,869
- Shuvanis?
- That's their form of a high priestess.

306
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:49,041
My niece Ava. She's a Shuvani too.

307
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,002
Only she's rejected her magic,
which is leaving her defenceless.

308
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:54,338
Well, can't you curse Cree
like you did his father?

309
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,798
There aren't enough Shuvanis left
to pool our power.

310
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,718
Because Ava chooses not to believe
anymore, she won't listen to me.

311
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,178
Maybe we can help.

312
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,058
Okay, I'll take care of that.

313
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:09,603
You know, sometimes it's easier
to hear the truth from a stranger

314
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,396
than it is to hear from family.

315
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,149
Her name is Ava Nicolae.

316
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,235
She's a doctor at
San Francisco Memorial.

317
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,195
Ob-gyn by any chance?

318
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,821
No, she's a surgeon.

319
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,032
- Close enough. I'll go.
- Why you?

320
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,368
Because I am done
with this nauseousness

321
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:29,581
and I can fight off Cree if he attacks.
So either you're orbing or I'm driving.

322
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:39,800
I'm sorry, Elise, I just can't make it.
Is it possible that we can move it?

323
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,970
Hey, we still have a book to check
and a vanquishing potion to make.

324
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,765
All right, all right.
I'll be there. I promise.

325
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:49,810
I'm sorry.
This is interrupting your lives.

326
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:55,357
No, no, no. This is our lives.
My sister just needed a little reminder.

327
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,489
Are you injured?

328
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,700
No.

329
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:09,329
- Did you see everything?
- I saw enough.

330
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,125
If only I would have been prepared
for her, I wouldn't have...

331
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:15,252
The search is over!

332
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,087
She has the power,
that's what matters.

333
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:20,757
Next time you'll be more prepared,
the way I taught you.

334
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:23,385
But how will I get to her?

335
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,889
She's protected by witches now.

336
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,516
They can't protect her heart.

337
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:35,105
I can see it yearns for
a wayward child, her niece.

338
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:36,607
Find her.

339
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,984
Shuvani will follow.

340
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:55,000
They even teach them to swaddle.

341
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:59,463
Come on, we have to find Ava.

342
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,511
I need to find some help.

343
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:09,556
Leo, I do not feel well.
And I don't think this is normal.

344
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:12,351
I need a doctor, a real doctor.

345
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,063
What happens when they check
the security camera footage

346
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,981
to find out why
the sonogram machine blew up

347
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,483
like it did with Phoebe's baby?

348
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:23,487
Phoebe's baby was a demon.
Ours is an angel, for crying out loud.

349
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,282
Thanks, Bill.

350
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,118
Ava?

351
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,996
Wait.

352
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:36,416
Do I know you?

353
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,961
No, you don't.
But we kind of know you.

354
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,587
We're friends of your Aunt Lydia.

355
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,381
Is something wrong?

356
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:46,510
Yeah, there kind of is.
See, there's this gypsy hunter...

357
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,136
Oh, please.

358
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:51,598
I don't mean to be rude.
You guys look like normal people.

359
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:54,017
My Aunt Lydia,
she's just very superstitious.

360
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,520
- She shouldn't be sending you...
- She's afraid for you.

361
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,857
People are dying.

362
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:02,317
Look around you.
That's why I'm here.

363
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:05,112
I save lives using medicine,
not magic.

364
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,865
But magic is part of who you are.

365
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:10,951
No, relying on magic
is what killed my mom.

366
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:19,209
Ava, I know what it's like
to lose your mom. Believe me, I do.

367
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,253
But still, you can't deny who you are.

368
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:25,090
Dr. Nicolae. Dr. Nicolae
to the emergency room, stat.

369
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,176
I've gotta go.

370
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,139
- Great. Now what do we do?
- Wait and try again.

371
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:35,684
- You okay?
- No, I am not.

372
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:39,021
Doctor. Any doctor, now.

373
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:44,735
All right, add ice to thicken.
I'd say we're done.

374
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:48,822
I wouldn't have thought to add
turmeric to anything but Indian food.

375
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:52,117
It's nice to finally have someone
to share my magic with.

376
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:53,494
Ava will come around.

377
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:57,289
Sometimes it takes longer for people
to embrace their magic. Right, Paige?

378
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,418
I hope you're right.
She's the last of our line.

379
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:04,379
If she doesn't carry on the tradition,
it dies with me.

380
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,507
Yeah. Well, that's
not gonna happen.

381
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,387
Being so hard on yourself won't
bring your powers back, you know.

382
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:16,600
- Okay, what can't you see?
- Maybe I can help.

383
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:19,811
Well, I think my stress level
is beyond chamomile tea at this point.

384
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:23,232
You're not gonna drink it.
You're gonna swirl it. Come.

385
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:27,694
Wait, you read tea leaves?
That's so amazing.

386
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,988
Now pour it out.

387
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,115
All right.

388
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,577
I see an X.

389
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:38,539
A thorn.

390
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,250
A broken spiral.

391
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:44,294
You're way out of balance,
just like your powers.

392
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,130
That's pretty much
what Madame Theresa said.

393
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,842
Well, that's what happens
when your brain overrides your heart.

394
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:53,679
If you want to regain your balance, to
reconnect, you'll have to find out why.

395
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:57,224
It's so crazy. I never would have seen
those shapes in there.

396
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:59,768
Just takes practice.
Here, read mine.

397
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,103
Okay.

398
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:04,690
What do you see?

399
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:07,442
I see an X.

400
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:12,447
And that looks kind of like
a lightning bolt.

401
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,746
Ava.

402
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:23,292
I can't put you in any more danger.

403
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:27,713
Lydia!

404
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,136
Well, that's an interesting
disappearing act.

405
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,889
I'll have to ask her
how she does that.

406
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:40,184
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to see what Lydia saw.

407
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:42,519
Yeah. You can't read tea leaves.

408
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,522
No, but I get premonitions.
At least I'm supposed to.

409
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,860
Okay, come on.
Please let me see something.

410
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,997
- I saw Cree. He's after Ava.
- Where? When?

411
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:04,333
I don't know. It's still all in pieces.

412
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,962
But I saw cars, and a parking lot.
Maybe it's the hospital?

413
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:11,298
The hospital?
Why can't Piper and Leo stop him?

414
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,010
I wouldn't worry too much.

415
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:18,347
Some women are nauseous their
whole pregnancy. It's perfectly normal.

416
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,432
Yeah, I just...

417
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,684
First-time mom.
I wanted to make sure.

418
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,312
I'm getting paged.

419
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:31,610
- It's on vibrate.
- Don't you want to see who it is?

420
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:34,780
Oh, it's her sisters. They're the
only ones with the number, so...

421
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:36,448
Honey, I think we should hurry up.

422
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,033
Almost done.

423
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:50,504
Fast healer. Thanks.

424
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,214
Yeah.

425
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:01,598
Where's Ava?

426
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,642
She's in surgery.
What are you guys doing here?

427
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,394
Trying to find Lydia.
She ran out on us.

428
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:07,396
She's after Cree.

429
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,069
Surprised to see me again?

430
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:16,280
Hardly.

431
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,036
This time I was ready for you.

432
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:32,671
Lydia!

433
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,367
- I don't get a response.
- Clear.

434
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:03,577
Clear.

435
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:11,043
- Give me 200 joules.
- Two hundred charged.

436
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,461
Clear.

437
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:15,464
- Ava.
- Pressure's dropping.

438
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:17,132
Waffediyok, Ava.

439
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:19,760
Aunt Lydia?

440
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:27,601
Dr. Nicolae?

441
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,605
Are you all right?

442
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,275
No ventricular rhythm.

443
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:38,904
She's flat.

444
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,031
Let's call the code.

445
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:07,391
No.

446
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,978
Aunt Lydia.

447
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:14,439
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, sit down.

448
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:24,700
I saw her.

449
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:29,496
She came to me, a Mulo.

450
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,917
- Mulo?
- The living dead.

451
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:37,045
I never believed in it before.

452
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:39,590
It's okay. Just tell us
what happened.

453
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,219
It was a code blue.

454
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,930
My patient, she died.

455
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:50,559
And then it was Aunt Lydia.

456
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:54,897
Nobody else saw.
I thought I was going crazy.

457
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:58,859
I am so sorry.

458
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:01,904
No, it's my fault.

459
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:06,116
She tried to warn me this morning.
I didn't believe her.

460
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:10,412
No, it's not your fault.
You had your reasons to be sceptical.

461
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:14,082
Was she trying
to tell you something?

462
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:16,293
I don't know.
I don't remember much.

463
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:20,589
I do know a Mulo is a bad omen.

464
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:24,051
It means that something horrible
is about to happen.

465
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:26,887
Well, it shouldn't.
We vanquished Cree.

466
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:29,431
What about Orin?

467
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:32,267
It has to be him.

468
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:36,146
That's what she was trying
to tell me.

469
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,690
She was trying to warn me again.

470
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,401
My Romanian's weak,

471
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:46,198
but I think she was saying something
about him trying to take her power.

472
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:49,284
Well, how can he take her power
now that she's...?

473
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:50,828
I don't know.

474
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:55,374
I wish I knew what
waffediyok meant.

475
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:57,501
She kept saying that.

476
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:59,127
We should go to Lydia's apartment.

477
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:01,171
- Maybe you could get a prem...
- No.

478
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,509
We need more vanquishing potion.

479
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:08,637
I'm gonna go back to the house
and try to remember what she used.

480
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:11,682
But, Phoebe, we could
really use your powers.

481
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:15,602
Yeah. I know, Paige. I know.

482
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,147
Can you take me home?

483
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:20,858
Sure.

484
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:26,280
What should we do now?

485
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,827
Theresa would know.

486
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,171
Gypsy custom.

487
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,340
Covering the photos of the dead.

488
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:49,261
Looks like you're remembering
more and more of those customs.

489
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:51,889
Nobody knew more about them
than Theresa.

490
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:54,725
She was like the holy woman
of the tribe.

491
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:56,685
She always made sure

492
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:59,771
that traditions were passed down
from mother to daughter.

493
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:04,484
My mom tried to pass them
down to me, but I wouldn't listen.

494
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,988
Look at this. It's so beautiful.

495
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:09,990
Let me see that.

496
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,579
This is my mother's.

497
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,711
I can't believe Theresa kept it.

498
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:26,256
Yeah. Well, maybe she was
just saving it for a special kind of day.

499
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:32,888
My mother called it
her treasure chest.

500
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:35,974
It's where she kept precious things.

501
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,691
Is that you and your mom?

502
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:50,239
She made us matching dresses
for Christmas.

503
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:56,119
She worked so hard
to finish them in time.

504
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:01,124
I know it's hard.

505
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:07,965
My mom died 10 years ago and
there's still a lot of boxes I can't open.

506
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,686
These are recipes
and herbal remedies.

507
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:22,688
Would these be spells?

508
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:27,651
Maybe it's not too late to learn
after all.

509
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:37,578
Look at this.
It looks like Lydia's locket.

510
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:41,165
That's our family talisman.
The Evil Eye.

511
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,041
Your family symbol is evil?

512
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,335
Only to those
who would wish us harm.

513
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:50,716
Many feared the Evil Eye, but our
family was said to be protected by it.

514
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,011
The folklore said that
the keeper of the Eye

515
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:56,513
could use it to magnify
or channel her powers.

516
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,559
I don't think this is folklore.
Look at this inscription.

517
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:02,644
"Waffediyok."

518
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,271
That's the Evil Eye.

519
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,066
I think Lydia was the keeper.
I think she conjured up that dust storm

520
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,277
and I think this
is what Cree was after.

521
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:13,572
So he wasn't taking
Shuvanis' eyes just out of revenge.

522
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:17,784
He wanted the Evil Eye.

523
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,956
And Orin still wants it.

524
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:04,581
I'll have my revenge, son.

525
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:08,335
But not before I give you yours.

526
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:11,505
Who are you?
What are you doing in here?

527
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,468
Testing my new powers.

528
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:26,687
Okay, Piper. Just be careful.

529
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:29,940
They're going to the morgue.

530
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:37,281
- Done. Can you pass me the ice?
- Sure.

531
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:40,826
You know, maybe we should follow
and see if you can get a premonition.

532
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:42,870
It was my sorry excuse
for a premonition

533
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:45,330
that put Lydia in the
morgue in the first place.

534
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:48,375
Well, Phoebe, we lose innocents.
It's not your fault.

535
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,087
I think if anyone's to blame, it's Cole.

536
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:55,716
What? He's out of town.

537
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:58,927
For the first time,
he's actually not plaguing my life.

538
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:00,804
Which is what gave you
the time to find out

539
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:03,682
something was wrong with
your powers to begin with.

540
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:07,269
You dove into your work originally
to escape the pain

541
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:09,313
and you dealt with it fine.

542
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:12,107
But you haven't slowed down.

543
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:14,985
You went from one obsession
to another.

544
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:21,366
If you want to reach us,
you know the drill.

545
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:23,660
Phoebe, it's Elise.
Where are you?

546
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:26,288
Phoebe?

547
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:27,915
Elise?

548
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,667
Hey, just listen to me
for a second, okay?

549
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:34,379
Look, I'm sorry, but I have
a major family emergency.

550
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:35,881
More important than your career?

551
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:39,760
Of course my career is important to
me, but my family is more important.

552
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:42,387
Get your butt in here now!

553
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:48,060
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

554
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:53,232
We were too late.
Orin got the Evil Eye.

555
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:56,443
- The Evil Eye?
- Yeah, Lydia's eyes have the power.

556
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,612
That's what she was
trying to tell me.

557
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,493
Wait, I hope you have the potion ready,
because we're gonna need it big-time.

558
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:09,706
Phoebe, are you okay?

559
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,960
Premonition.

560
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:16,296
Major premonition.

561
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,048
I'm in the future.

562
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:19,758
Let her go.

563
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,922
It's okay, it's okay.

564
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:00,841
What happened?

565
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:12,561
It's been so long since my powers
advanced. And boy, did they advance.

566
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:14,605
To the point it almost got you killed.

567
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,940
I don't get it.
How can you be at risk in the present

568
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,775
when you're witnessing
a future event?

569
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:21,320
All I know is it felt like
I was in two places at once.

570
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:24,948
Almost as if I astral-projected
into my future self.

571
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:27,326
Okay, it's really great
that your powers have advanced,

572
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:30,412
and we'll talk about that later. Right
after we make sure there is a later.

573
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:33,040
Now that Orin has the Evil Eye,

574
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:35,834
I'd say our best chance at survival
is to run and hide.

575
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:38,170
You said the vanquishing potion
had no effect?

576
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:39,588
He didn't even flinch.

577
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:41,590
So your new-and-improved
premonitions

578
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:44,301
are just a more vivid way
of telling us we're screwed?

579
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:46,261
Well, the premonitions
may have changed,

580
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:48,555
but the reason behind
getting them hasn't.

581
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:52,351
I mean, they show us the future,
so that we could change the outcome.

582
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:54,937
But how?

583
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,987
Isn't it a bit suicidal to be walking
into the room Phoebe saw us die in?

584
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:06,824
Yes, except for we have something
Phoebe's premonition didn't.

585
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,075
We have Ava.

586
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:10,327
How am I supposed
to make a difference?

587
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:14,122
Well, in the premonition, witchcraft
alone wasn't enough to vanquish Orin.

588
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:17,167
But we think witchcraft
plus gypsy magic will be.

589
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:20,212
But I don't know any gypsy magic.

590
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:23,257
Well, you have it inside you.
You were born with it.

591
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:25,384
Why else would you have received
your aunt's warning?

592
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:28,554
Even if you're right,
I can't defeat Orin on my own.

593
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:31,765
You won't need to.
You can just call upon your ancestors.

594
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:35,477
Here's a spell we've used before.
Just substitute these names

595
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:37,729
for those of
your gypsy family members.

596
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,986
Okay.

597
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:47,614
Here goes.

598
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,659
Nicolae gypsies

599
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:54,663
stand strong beside me

600
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:05,048
- Keep saying the spell.
- Marina, Theresa, Lydia.

601
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:10,721
Nicolae gypsies
Stand strong beside us

602
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:13,182
Vanquish this evil
From time and space

603
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:15,142
Nicolae gypsies
Stand strong beside us

604
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:16,894
Vanquish this evil
From time and space

605
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,062
Nicolae gypsies
Stand strong beside us

606
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:21,565
Vanquish this evil
From time and space

607
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:23,066
Nicolae gypsies
Stand strong beside us

608
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:25,360
Vanquish this evil
From time and space

609
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:39,750
Piper.

610
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:51,178
You did it.

611
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:53,430
My mother.

612
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:58,852
She was here. I felt her.

613
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,175
- Who's next?
- We are!

614
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,179
Well, not really.
But we'll make it super quick.

615
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:36,139
Hey, how you doing?

616
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:38,141
Fine. Hectic.

617
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,477
I can only make it here
after my hospital shift.

618
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:43,355
Hectic is good,
just as long as it's not too hectic.

619
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:45,274
Well, I think I have
my priorities in order.

620
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,027
Helping out gypsies who don't have
health care is definitely one of them.

621
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:51,113
Good for you.

622
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,657
Ava, did Mrs. Vasila
get her tetanus shot?

623
00:42:53,824 --> 00:42:56,702
- Paige?
- Hey, guys.

624
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:58,370
- What are you doing?
- Oh, you know.

625
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:01,707
Just pitching in, helping out.
Did I ever mention that l...?

626
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:03,959
- Have no life. Yeah.
- Have no life. Yeah.

627
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:06,003
Paige has been great.
Quick study too.

628
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,338
You should see all the folk remedies
the gypsies have.

629
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:10,549
Some of them are even better
than Western medicine.

630
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:13,177
Really? Any of them help
with my nauseousness?

631
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:17,306
- Well, it's funny you should ask.
- Where are you going?

632
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:19,516
You don't want to be late
for your appointment, do you?

633
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:21,894
- What appointment?
- Your appointment with Ava.

634
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,604
Meet your new doctor.

635
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:29,276
She's also gonna teach us
how to be your midwives.

636
00:43:29,735 --> 00:43:31,987
Midwives? No.

637
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:34,448
See, because I'm not
having this thing naturally.

638
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:37,034
No, I need lots and lots
of Western medicine.

639
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:38,785
- Piper...
- No offence.

640
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:42,873
Piper. You know, I trusted you
to carry on my heritage,

641
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,417
now you trust me to carry on yours.

642
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:47,836
Yeah, right. You're good.
