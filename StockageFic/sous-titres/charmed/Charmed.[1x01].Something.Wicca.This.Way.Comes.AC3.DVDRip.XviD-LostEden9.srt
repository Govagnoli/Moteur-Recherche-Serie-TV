1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,439
Here, baby. Come on, baby.

2
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,609
Good girl.

3
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,541
<i>Ancient one of the earth so deep</i>

4
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,210
<i>Master of moon and sun</i>

5
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,630
<i>I shield you in my Wiccan way</i>

6
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:32,425
<i>Here in my circle round</i>

7
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,595
<i>Asking you protect this space</i>

8
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,765
<i>And offer your sun- force down</i>

9
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,025
What are you doing here?

10
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:19,513
- Prue?
- In here, working on the chandelier.

11
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:26,645
- Sorry I'm late.
- What else is new?

12
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:29,440
Piper, I would have been here
to meet the electrician myself,

13
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:32,443
but I can't leave the museum until 6.
I haven't even had time to change.

14
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:36,238
I just, I didn't realise how long I was
in Chinatown. Did Jeremy call?

15
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:39,074
No, but he had some roses
and a package delivered.

16
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:41,952
What were you doing in Chinatown?
I thought you had an interview?

17
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,621
I did, but I went to Young Lee Market
after my interview

18
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:47,583
to get the ingredients for my
audition recipe tomorrow.

19
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,044
So that Wolfgang Puck knockoff
didn't hire you today?

20
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,797
No, but this just may get me the job.

21
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:55,591
Jeremy sent you port?

22
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,676
It's the ultimate ingredient
for my recipe.

23
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:59,761
Nice boyfriend.

24
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:02,681
Oh, my God. I don't believe it.

25
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:05,642
Tell me that's not
our old spirit board.

26
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:08,687
I found it in the basement when I
was looking for the circuit tester.

27
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,606
"To my three beautiful girls.

28
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:12,983
May this give you the light
to find the shadows.

29
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:15,902
The power of three will set you free.
Love, Mom."

30
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:18,613
We never did figure out
what this inscription meant.

31
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:22,576
Send it to Phoebe. That girl is so in the
dark, maybe a little bit of light will help.

32
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:24,453
You're always so hard on her.

33
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:27,456
Piper, the girl has no vision.
No sense of the future.

34
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:30,292
I really think
Phoebe's coming around.

35
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,044
As long as she doesn't come
around here, I guess it's good news.

36
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:18,941
Okay.

37
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:24,488
Okay, okay.
We have three units on it now.

38
00:05:24,655 --> 00:05:27,074
- Well, it's about time.
- I got here as soon as I heard.

39
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:29,910
Another dead female, right?
Mid- To late 20s?

40
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:33,247
I've been paging you for over an hour,
Trudeau. Where have you been?

41
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:34,832
Oakland, checking out a lead.

42
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:36,333
What lead?

43
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,003
- One that didn't go anywhere.
- You're avoiding my question.

44
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:42,715
Because you don't want to know
I went to an occult shop.

45
00:05:43,674 --> 00:05:46,677
You hate me, don't you?
You wanna see me suffer.

46
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:48,595
I want to solve these murders.

47
00:05:48,804 --> 00:05:51,724
- Someone's after witches.
- Women.

48
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,935
That woman up there, I'll bet
she was killed with an athame.

49
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:57,229
Wrong. Double-edged steel knife.

50
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:59,606
Right. That's an athame.

51
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:02,609
It's a ceremonial tool.
Witches use them to direct energy.

52
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:04,862
That woman didn't direct jack.

53
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:08,240
She was stabbed. Plain and simple.

54
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:11,535
Was she found near an altar?

55
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:13,036
Yes.

56
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:15,747
Were there carvings on that altar?

57
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,252
Just do me a favour.

58
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:24,715
Don't ever follow a lead
without checking with me first.

59
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,633
You want to go to occult shops?

60
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,471
Just get to work, okay?

61
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,891
Inspector Trudeau.

62
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:37,477
<i>Jeremy Burns,
San Francisco Chronicle.</i>

63
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:40,063
- You care to comment?
- A woman was stabbed.

64
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,065
Plain and simple.

65
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:45,110
That's the third one in three weeks.

66
00:07:01,835 --> 00:07:03,878
I don't get it.
I have checked everything.

67
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:06,673
There's no reason why the chandelier
should not be working.

68
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,175
We've been talking about what
to do with that spare room.

69
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:11,636
I think you're right.
We do need a roommate.

70
00:07:11,803 --> 00:07:14,139
Well, we could rent out
the room at a reduced rate

71
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:15,974
in exchange for help
around the house.

72
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:17,767
Phoebe's good with a wrench.

73
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,769
Phoebe lives in New York.

74
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,771
Not anymore.

75
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:24,858
What?

76
00:07:25,358 --> 00:07:27,735
She left New York.
She's moving back in with us.

77
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:32,657
You've got to be kidding.

78
00:07:32,824 --> 00:07:35,243
Well, I could hardly say no.

79
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:37,578
It's her house too.
It was willed to all of us.

80
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:40,373
Yeah, months ago and we haven't
seen or spoken to her since!

81
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,209
- Well, you haven't spoken to her.
- No, I haven't.

82
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:45,086
Maybe you've forgotten
why I'm so mad.

83
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,380
No, of course not,
but she had nowhere else to go.

84
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,298
She lost her job. She's in debt.

85
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:51,092
And this is news?

86
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:52,760
How long have you known
about this?

87
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:54,637
A couple of days.

88
00:07:54,804 --> 00:07:57,140
Maybe a week. Or two.

89
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,643
Thanks for sharing.
When does she arrive?

90
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:03,145
Surprise!

91
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:08,985
I found the hide-a-key.

92
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:11,404
Phoebe, welcome home.

93
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:14,573
- Hello, Piper.
- It's so good to see you.

94
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,535
- Isn't it, Prue?
- I'm speechless.

95
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:21,831
- Oops. I forgot about the cab.
- I'll get it.

96
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:24,917
Piper, that's my purse!

97
00:08:28,003 --> 00:08:30,548
Thanks. I'll pay it back.

98
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:33,259
Is that all that you brought?

99
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,594
That's all that I own.
That and a bike.

100
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:40,099
Look, I know that you don't
want me here.

101
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:41,725
We're not selling Gram's house.

102
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:43,394
Is that why you think I came back?

103
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:46,146
The only reason Piper and I gave up
our apartment and moved back

104
00:08:46,313 --> 00:08:49,149
was because this house has been
in our family for generations.

105
00:08:49,358 --> 00:08:51,527
No history lesson needed,
I grew up here too.

106
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:54,029
So can we talk about what's
really bothering you?

107
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:56,156
No, I'm still furious with you.

108
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:58,033
So you'd rather have a tense reunion

109
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,744
filled with boring chitchat
and unimportant small talk?

110
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:03,288
No, but otherwise we won't
have anything to talk about.

111
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:06,458
- I never touched Roger.
- Whoa.

112
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09,586
I know you think otherwise because
that's what that Armani-wearing,

113
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:12,297
chardonnay-slugging
trust-funder told you, but...

114
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:13,799
Hey!

115
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:18,762
I have a great idea! Why don't I
make a fabulous reunion dinner?

116
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,973
I'm not hungry.

117
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:22,975
I ate on the bus.

118
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:26,645
Okay, we'll try the group hug later.

119
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:30,107
<i>I'm at an apartment building
on the corner of 8th and Franklin</i>

120
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:32,567
<i>where a murder occurred
earlier this evening.</i>

121
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:34,986
<i>The victim, believed to be a nurse
at County General,</i>

122
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:38,115
<i>was reportedly stabbed to death
in her apartment.</i>

123
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:41,243
- It's me.
- Come on in.

124
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,915
- Oh, thank God. I am starving!
- I figured.

125
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:49,918
Hey, that's my boyfriend, Jeremy!

126
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:52,712
- What happened?
- Oh, some woman got whacked.

127
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,423
"Whacked"? Phoebe, you've been
in New York way too long.

128
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:58,009
Yeah. I should have stayed.

129
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:01,763
Why didn't you tell Prue
I was coming back?

130
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:03,598
And risk her changing the locks?

131
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:06,351
Besides, you should have been
the one to tell her, not me.

132
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:08,478
Good point, Chicken Little.

133
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:12,482
It's just so hard for me to talk to her.
She's always been more like a mother.

134
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:14,984
That's not her fault.
She practically had to sacrifice

135
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:18,113
- her own childhood to raise us.
- Her own childhood to raise us.

136
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:19,739
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

137
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:23,785
Hey, we're lucky she
was so responsible.

138
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,871
You and I had it easy.
All we had to do was be there.

139
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,874
Yeah, well, I don't need a mom
anymore, you know, I need a sister.

140
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:33,586
Hey.

141
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:35,713
This was always the coldest room
in the house.

142
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:37,840
Thanks.

143
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,227
The same tattoo was on
the other two victims.

144
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:51,979
So the murderer is killing cultists.

145
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:53,731
No, the murderer is on a witch-hunt.

146
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:56,943
Oh, yeah, and he's 500 years old
and he lives in Salem.

147
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,697
Look around, Trudeau.
Pentagrams, altars, offerings.

148
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:03,658
All tools for a freak fest.

149
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:07,078
They call them sabbats,
and this was hardly a freak fest.

150
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:11,415
She was a solitary practitioner.
She practised her craft alone.

151
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,669
Let me ask you something.
Do you believe in UFOs?

152
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:17,213
- Hell, no.
- Neither do I.

153
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,299
But do you believe there are people
out there who do believe in UFOs?

154
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:23,010
Yes, but I think they're crazy.

155
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:27,431
Then why can't you believe there are
people who believe they are witches?

156
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:31,852
Look, all I know is that if you don't
stop talking about witches,

157
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:34,063
I'm gonna start questioning you.

158
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:42,905
I'd stay away from that cat, Trudeau.

159
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:46,116
It's been clawing the crap
out of everybody.

160
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:48,327
See you at the car.

161
00:11:59,505 --> 00:12:01,965
I'm glad to hear you and Jeremy
are still together.

162
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:03,884
Where did you meet him anyway?

163
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:08,138
We met at the hospital cafeteria
the day Grams was admitted.

164
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:11,642
He was covering a story
and I was bawling over a bagel.

165
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:14,061
So he handed me a napkin.

166
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:16,897
- How romantic.
- As a matter of fact, it was.

167
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:20,275
The napkin had his
phone number on it.

168
00:12:21,193 --> 00:12:23,278
- Stop pushing the pointer.
- I'm not touching it.

169
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:25,781
You used to always
push the pointer.

170
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:27,824
More popcorn?

171
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:29,826
Hey, I forgot your question.

172
00:12:29,993 --> 00:12:33,747
I asked if Prue would have sex with
someone other than herself this year.

173
00:12:33,914 --> 00:12:35,624
That's disgusting!

174
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,585
Please say yes.

175
00:12:42,547 --> 00:12:44,049
Piper.

176
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:48,053
- Piper, get in here!
- What?

177
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:51,348
- What did you guys do now?
- Me? I didn't do anything.

178
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:53,892
The pointer on the spirit board.
It moved on its own.

179
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:57,938
I'm serious. It spelled A-T.

180
00:12:58,396 --> 00:12:59,856
- Well, did you push it?
- No!

181
00:13:00,023 --> 00:13:01,733
You always used to push the pointer.

182
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,945
My fingers were
barely touching it. Look.

183
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:13,620
It did it again! It moved!

184
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:19,042
- It's still on the letter T.
- I swear, it moved.

185
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:24,798
There! Look!

186
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:28,468
- You saw that, right?
- I think so, yeah.

187
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:30,553
I told you I wasn't touching it.

188
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:34,599
Prue, can you come in here a sec?

189
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:38,645
- Now what?
- I think it's trying to tell us something.

190
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,357
Attic.

191
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:50,365
Don't you think you're overreacting?
We are perfectly safe here.

192
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:53,868
Don't say that. In horror movies, the
person who says that is the next to die.

193
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:57,246
It's pouring rain. There's a psycho's on
the loose. Jeremy's not even home.

194
00:13:57,413 --> 00:14:00,833
So, I'll... I'll wait in the cab till
he gets home from work.

195
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,503
- That'll be cheap.
- Prue, I saw that pointer move.

196
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:07,423
No, look, what you saw was
Phoebe's fingers pushing the pointer.

197
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,926
There's nothing in that attic.
She's playing a joke on us.

198
00:14:10,092 --> 00:14:12,136
We don't know that.
We've lived here for months now

199
00:14:12,303 --> 00:14:15,556
and we've never been able
to get that attic door open.

200
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:18,267
- Great, now the phone doesn't work.
- Yeah, the power's out.

201
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:20,311
- Just go with me to the basement.
- What?

202
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,521
I need you to hold the flashlight.

203
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:24,732
Phoebe will go with you
to the basement.

204
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,277
- No, I'm going to the attic.
- No, you're not. We already agreed.

205
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:30,946
I am not waiting for some handyman
to check out the attic

206
00:14:31,155 --> 00:14:34,325
and I'm certainly not waiting until
tomorrow. I'm going now.

207
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:39,789
Prue, wait!

208
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,511
<i>"Book of Shadows.</i>

209
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:25,602
<i>Hear now the words of the witches</i>

210
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,438
<i>The secrets we hid in the night</i>

211
00:16:28,605 --> 00:16:31,274
<i>The oldest of gods are invoked here</i>

212
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:34,694
<i>The great work of magic is sought</i>

213
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,780
<i>In this night and in this hour,</i>

214
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:40,241
<i>I call upon the ancient power</i>

215
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:44,579
<i>Bring your powers to we sisters three</i>

216
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:47,040
<i>We want the power</i>

217
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,251
<i>Give us the power"</i>

218
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:12,774
What are you doing?

219
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:16,152
Reading an incantation.

220
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,904
<i>It was in this Book of Shadows.</i>

221
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,239
- I found it in that trunk.
- Let me see that.

222
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,409
- How did you get in here?
- The door opened.

223
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:24,911
Wait a minute.

224
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,538
An incantation?
What kind of incantation?

225
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:30,791
It said something about there
being three essentials of magic:

226
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,878
Timing, feeling
and the phases of the moon.

227
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:36,172
If we were ever gonna do this,

228
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:40,718
now, midnight on a full moon,
is the most powerful time.

229
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:43,345
"This"? Do what, "this"?

230
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:44,972
Receive our powers.

231
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:48,768
What powers? Wait, our powers?
You included me in this?

232
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,519
No, she included all of us.

233
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,438
<i>"Bring your powers to we sisters three"</i>

234
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,649
- It's a book of witchcraft.
- Let me see that.

235
00:18:02,823 --> 00:18:04,742
Spirit boards. Books of witchcraft.

236
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:07,328
It figures all this freaky stuff
started when you arrived.

237
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:09,330
I wasn't the one that
found the spirit board.

238
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:11,665
It wasn't my fingers sliding
around on the pointer.

239
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:14,209
It doesn't matter, because
nothing happened, right, Phoebe?

240
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:16,295
When you did the incantation?

241
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,757
Well, my head spun around
and I vomited split pea soup.

242
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:21,550
How should I know?

243
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:23,427
Well, everything looks the same.

244
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:25,804
- You're right.
- Yep, the house still needs work.

245
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:30,767
And everything feels the same,
so nothing's changed, right?

246
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:01,882
You're up early.

247
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:03,925
I never went to sleep.

248
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:05,969
Don't tell me you put on
a black conical hat

249
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:09,222
and spent the night flying around
the neighbourhood on a broomstick?

250
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,560
The only broom I've ever had was
kept in a closet beside a mop.

251
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:16,021
So what were you doing?

252
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:17,731
Reading. Is Prue around?

253
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:20,650
She went to work early.
Reading aloud?

254
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,069
No.

255
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:25,030
<i>But according to
the Book of Shadows,</i>

256
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:30,035
one of our ancestors was a witch
named Melinda Warren.

257
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:33,121
And we have a cousin who's a drunk,
and aunt who's manic,

258
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:35,582
and a father who's invisible.

259
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:38,501
I'm serious. She practised powers.
Three powers.

260
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:42,630
She could move objects with her mind,
see the future, and stop time.

261
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:45,008
Before Melinda was burned
at the stake,

262
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:47,760
she vowed that each generation
of Warren witches

263
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:50,346
would become
stronger and stronger,

264
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:53,933
culminating in the arrival
of three sisters.

265
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:58,021
These sisters would be the most
powerful witches the world has known.

266
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:01,566
They're good witches
and I think we're those sisters.

267
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:05,778
Look, I know what happened last
night was weird and unexplainable,

268
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:08,948
but we are not witches,
and we do not have special powers.

269
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:12,618
Besides, Grams wasn't a witch and
as far as we know, neither was Mom.

270
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:16,497
So take that, Nancy Drew.

271
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:19,333
We're the protectors of the innocent.

272
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:21,586
We're known as the Charmed Ones!

273
00:20:26,674 --> 00:20:28,801
There's been a change of plans.

274
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,512
A change of plans?
Regarding the Beals exhibition?

275
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,223
The extra money that you helped raise
through private donations

276
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,059
has sparked significant
corporate interest.

277
00:20:37,226 --> 00:20:41,355
The Beals artefacts will now become
part of our permanent collection.

278
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:44,066
Well, that's terrific.

279
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:47,069
Which is why the board wants
someone a little more qualified

280
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:49,697
to handle the collection
from now on.

281
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:51,532
You look surprised.

282
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:53,701
I don't know why, I'm furious.

283
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:56,245
Not only have I been on this project
since its inception,

284
00:20:56,412 --> 00:21:00,374
but I'm the curator who secured
the entire exhibition.

285
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:04,128
You're the person more qualified,
aren't you?

286
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:06,922
I could hardly say no to the entire
board of directors, could I?

287
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:08,924
But I know you'll be happy for me.

288
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:12,511
After all, what's good for me
is definitely good for you.

289
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:16,390
- Right, Miss Halliwell?
- "Miss Halliwell"?

290
00:21:16,557 --> 00:21:19,059
Since when did we stop being
on a first-name basis?

291
00:21:19,268 --> 00:21:21,145
When we stopped sleeping together?

292
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:23,605
Or when I returned your
engagement ring, Roger?

293
00:21:23,772 --> 00:21:26,650
I didn't realise the two
were mutually exclusive.

294
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:29,486
Although I certainly enjoyed
one more than the other.

295
00:21:30,237 --> 00:21:31,655
Bastard.

296
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:35,367
Prue, wait.

297
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:40,080
I feel like I should say something,
if only to avoid a lawsuit.

298
00:22:10,902 --> 00:22:15,073
Your time is up.

299
00:22:16,158 --> 00:22:17,534
Let's see.

300
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:20,078
Roast pork with gratin,
Florence fennel

301
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:23,373
and penne with a port giblet sauce.

302
00:22:23,582 --> 00:22:25,000
- Chef Moore?
- What?

303
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,501
The port.

304
00:22:26,668 --> 00:22:29,921
Yes. Without it, the sauce is nothing
more than a salty marinara.

305
00:22:30,088 --> 00:22:32,674
A recipe from a woman's magazine.

306
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,093
I didn't have time for...

307
00:22:38,263 --> 00:22:39,764
But...

308
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:46,062
Chef Moore?

309
00:22:46,604 --> 00:22:48,523
Chef Moore?

310
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:51,943
Hello?

311
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,071
Hello?

312
00:23:15,466 --> 00:23:17,885
That is very good.

313
00:23:18,052 --> 00:23:19,387
<i>C'est magnifique.</i>

314
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:25,935
It was my idea to spark corporate
interest from private donations.

315
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:31,524
Besides, not only have I been
with this project since its inception,

316
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:36,445
but we both know who really
secured the entire exhibit.

317
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:38,864
- Prue.
- I quit.

318
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:42,827
I'm going to have to call you back.

319
00:23:43,995 --> 00:23:45,538
Think about this, Prue.

320
00:23:45,705 --> 00:23:48,833
Lousy job, lousy pay, lousy boss.
What's to think about?

321
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,711
Your future. Because, believe me,
if you walk out with no notice,

322
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:54,296
- you can kiss any references...
- Don't threaten me, Roger.

323
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:00,970
You know me. Had to try.

324
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,305
You're hurt. You're angry.

325
00:24:03,472 --> 00:24:05,558
Your pride is wounded.
I understand all that.

326
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,644
That's why you can't see
that I'm doing you a favour.

327
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:12,106
- Excuse me?
- I had to take the exhibit away.

328
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:16,068
If I hadn't, the board would've come in
and put a total stranger in my place.

329
00:24:16,694 --> 00:24:18,070
Think about it, Prue.

330
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:20,739
I'm here for you, not some stranger.

331
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:23,242
You should be thanking me,
not leaving me.

332
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,868
Well, I'm not worried.

333
00:24:25,035 --> 00:24:28,664
I'm certain your intellect will make
quick work of the 75 computer discs

334
00:24:28,872 --> 00:24:31,500
and the thousands of pages of
research I've left in my office.

335
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,669
- You're gonna regret this.
- I don't think so.

336
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:36,713
I thought breaking up with you
was the best thing I had ever done,

337
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,590
but this definitely tops that.

338
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:42,136
Goodbye, Roger.

339
00:24:43,303 --> 00:24:46,807
I hope there are no office supplies
in your purse!

340
00:25:01,738 --> 00:25:03,323
What the hell was that?

341
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:07,828
Phoebe, answer the phone.

342
00:25:07,994 --> 00:25:10,247
Answer the phone.

343
00:25:17,754 --> 00:25:19,464
Oh, God, Jeremy, you scared me.

344
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:21,007
I can see. I'm sorry.

345
00:25:21,174 --> 00:25:22,551
- You okay?
- Yeah.

346
00:25:22,717 --> 00:25:26,763
Now I am. I really am.
What are you doing here?

347
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,683
I wanted to be the first one to
congratulate you on your new job.

348
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:32,185
You're always surprising me.
How did you know?

349
00:25:32,352 --> 00:25:33,687
You prepared your specialty.

350
00:25:33,895 --> 00:25:38,525
And anyone who's ever sampled your
work can see how talented you are.

351
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:41,152
I get so turned on when
you talk about food.

352
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:43,029
Hot dogs.

353
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:46,282
Hamburgers. Pizza.

354
00:26:18,481 --> 00:26:20,066
No, wait!

355
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:48,970
Hi, I'm looking for my sister,
Phoebe Halliwell.

356
00:26:49,136 --> 00:26:50,846
One second, please.
What's the name again?

357
00:26:51,263 --> 00:26:53,808
Inspector Andrew Trudeau, Homicide.

358
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:56,060
Dr Gordon's expecting me.

359
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,105
Andy?

360
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,316
Prue? I don't believe it.

361
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:05,486
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

362
00:27:05,694 --> 00:27:10,032
I'm fine. I just can't believe
I'm running into you.

363
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:12,868
Yeah. I'm picking up Phoebe.
She had some sort of an accident.

364
00:27:13,077 --> 00:27:15,579
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Oh, yeah. She'll be fine.

365
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:17,790
What are you doing here?

366
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,252
Murder investigation.

367
00:27:22,002 --> 00:27:24,880
Your sister's still in X-ray,
so it'll be another 15 minutes.

368
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:27,216
Dr Gordon's office is to the left
and down the hall.

369
00:27:27,383 --> 00:27:29,718
He's with a patient right now,
but you're free to wait.

370
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

371
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,224
Well...

372
00:27:36,892 --> 00:27:39,103
It's good seeing you, Prue.

373
00:27:39,478 --> 00:27:42,314
Yeah, you, too, Andy.
Take care.

374
00:27:45,192 --> 00:27:48,904
You know, Phoebe's busy
and Dr Gordon's busy.

375
00:27:50,113 --> 00:27:53,075
Can I buy you a bad cup of coffee
while we wait?

376
00:27:53,408 --> 00:27:54,993
Sure.

377
00:27:56,703 --> 00:27:58,956
So you're an inspector now?

378
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:02,584
What can I say? In any other city,
I'd be called a "detective."

379
00:28:02,751 --> 00:28:04,461
"Inspector" is classier.

380
00:28:05,212 --> 00:28:06,797
I'm liking it better already.

381
00:28:07,547 --> 00:28:09,299
Your dad must be so proud.

382
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:11,968
Third generation,
you bet he's happy.

383
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:14,388
How about you?
You taking the world by storm?

384
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:16,973
Well, I'm living
back at Gram's house

385
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,935
and as of an hour ago,
I'm looking for work.

386
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,271
- I heard you moved to Portland.
- I'm back.

387
00:28:23,897 --> 00:28:26,066
You still seeing Roger?

388
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:28,985
- How did you know about him?
- I know people.

389
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:32,280
You checked up on me?

390
00:28:33,073 --> 00:28:36,076
I wouldn't call it that.

391
00:28:37,202 --> 00:28:38,453
What would you call it?

392
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,748
Inquiring minds want to know.

393
00:28:41,957 --> 00:28:45,293
- You checked up on me.
- What can I say? I'm a detective.

394
00:28:45,502 --> 00:28:48,338
<i>Miss Halliwell, please meet
your sister at the nurse's station.</i>

395
00:28:51,132 --> 00:28:53,802
The Chosen Ones? Charmed Ones?
Phoebe, this is insane.

396
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:56,679
Are you telling me that nothing
strange happened to you today?

397
00:28:56,846 --> 00:28:59,849
You didn't freeze time
or move anything?

398
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:03,144
Roger took an exhibit away from me.

399
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,564
All right, look, Phoebe, I know that you
think that you can see the future,

400
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:09,442
- which is pretty ironic...
- Since you don't think I have one?

401
00:29:09,651 --> 00:29:15,448
That my vision of life is cloudy
compared to your perfect hell?

402
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:20,036
Even if you don't want to believe me,
just once, can't you trust me?

403
00:29:20,244 --> 00:29:22,997
Phoebe, I do not have
special powers.

404
00:29:23,206 --> 00:29:25,541
Now, where is the cream?

405
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:32,632
Really? That looks
pretty special to me.

406
00:29:40,014 --> 00:29:44,685
Oh, my God.
So I can move things with my mind?

407
00:29:44,894 --> 00:29:48,564
With how much you hold inside,
you should be a lethal weapon by now.

408
00:29:49,565 --> 00:29:53,152
- I don't believe it.
- This means Piper can freeze time.

409
00:29:56,072 --> 00:29:58,658
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

410
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:03,245
- You've turned me into a witch.
- You were born one, we all were.

411
00:30:03,412 --> 00:30:05,790
And I think we better start
learning to deal with that.

412
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,295
<i>When I was looking through
the Book of Shadows</i>

413
00:30:11,462 --> 00:30:14,632
I saw these carvings. They looked like
something out of a Bosch painting.

414
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,635
All these terrifying images
of three women

415
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:20,429
battling different incarnations of evil.

416
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:22,181
Evil fighting evil, that's a twist.

417
00:30:22,348 --> 00:30:25,059
Actually, a witch can be
either good or evil.

418
00:30:25,226 --> 00:30:29,396
A good witch follows a Wiccan Rede:
"An it harm none, do what ye will."

419
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:32,858
A bad witch, or a warlock,
has but one goal,

420
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:36,070
to kill good witches
and obtain their powers.

421
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:38,405
Unfortunately, they look
like regular people.

422
00:30:38,572 --> 00:30:41,367
They could be anyone, anywhere.

423
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:43,202
And this has what
to do with us?

424
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:46,246
Well, in the first woodcarving
they were in a slumber,

425
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:49,792
but in the second one, they were
battling some kind of warlock.

426
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:54,171
I think as long as we were in the dark
about our powers, we were safe.

427
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:56,340
Not anymore.

428
00:31:01,553 --> 00:31:05,599
Has anything weird or unexplainable
ever happened to you?

429
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:09,144
Sure. It's called luck or fate.

430
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:11,396
Some call it miracles.

431
00:31:11,563 --> 00:31:13,565
Why? What happened?

432
00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:18,070
Forget it. Even if I could tell you,
you'd swear I was crazy.

433
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:20,781
Open your fortune cookie.

434
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:24,659
Okay.

435
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:30,415
"Soon you will be on top."

436
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,834
It doesn't say that.

437
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:35,086
- Yes, it does.
- Let me see.

438
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:36,588
Is that a bad thing?

439
00:31:36,755 --> 00:31:40,800
"Of the world.
Soon you will be on top of the world."

440
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:43,345
- Can you make a left on 7th?
- You got it.

441
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:45,805
Seventh? I thought we were
going to your place.

442
00:31:46,014 --> 00:31:47,682
We are, but you reminded me
of something.

443
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:49,768
I want to show you
the old Bowing Building.

444
00:31:49,934 --> 00:31:51,561
The view of the Bay Bridge?

445
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:53,521
It's amazing.

446
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:57,400
- I'll be right back with your prescription.
- Take your time.

447
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:59,652
Excuse me, where do you
keep the aspirin?

448
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:01,780
- Aisle three.
- Thank you.

449
00:32:01,946 --> 00:32:04,199
Chamomile tea works great
for headaches.

450
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:05,825
Not for this one, it won't.

451
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:07,952
You know, I'm not afraid
of our powers.

452
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:10,955
I mean, everyone inherits something
from their family, right?

453
00:32:11,122 --> 00:32:13,625
Yeah, money, antiques,
a strong disposition.

454
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:15,460
That's what normal people inherit.

455
00:32:15,627 --> 00:32:17,462
Who wants to be normal
when we can be special?

456
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:19,505
I want to be normal.
I want my life to be...

457
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:21,424
You know, isn't this aisle three?

458
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:24,761
Well, we can't change what happened.
We can't undo our destiny.

459
00:32:24,927 --> 00:32:27,221
- Do you see any aspirin?
- I see chamomile tea.

460
00:32:27,388 --> 00:32:30,016
Look, I have just found out
that I'm a witch,

461
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:31,517
that my sisters are witches,

462
00:32:31,726 --> 00:32:35,646
and that we have powers that will
apparently unleash all forms of evil.

463
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:37,690
Evil that is going to
come looking for us.

464
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:39,233
So, excuse me, Phoebe,

465
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,028
but I am not exactly in a
homeopathic mood right now.

466
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:45,406
Then move your headache
out of your mind.

467
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:55,124
You move things when you're upset.

468
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:59,003
This is ridiculous. I thought that you
landed on your arm, not your head.

469
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,798
- You don't believe me?
- Of course I don't believe you!

470
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:04,675
Roger.

471
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:09,430
Now, let's talk about Dad
and see what happens.

472
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:11,766
- He's dead, Phoebe.
- No, he's moved from New York,

473
00:33:11,932 --> 00:33:13,434
but he's very much alive.

474
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:14,977
He isn't to me.

475
00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:16,771
He died the day he left Mom.

476
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:20,357
What are you talking about? He's
always been a button-pusher for you!

477
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:23,402
You're mad he's alive,
you're mad I tried to find him,

478
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:25,779
and you're mad I came back.

479
00:33:25,946 --> 00:33:28,699
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

480
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:39,418
- Feel better?
- Lots.

481
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:41,879
<i>The Book of Shadows said that
our powers would grow.</i>

482
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,590
Grow to what?

483
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:53,724
Well, here we are.

484
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:56,226
I don't care how amazing
the view is, I'm not going in.

485
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:59,563
Come on, I have a surprise inside.

486
00:34:11,575 --> 00:34:13,035
You are gonna love this.

487
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:16,580
I bet you tell Phoebe and Prue
the moment you see them.

488
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,833
I never mentioned
Phoebe came home.

489
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,461
- Oops.
- What is that?

490
00:34:22,836 --> 00:34:24,171
It's your surprise.

491
00:34:24,588 --> 00:34:26,256
Jeremy, stop it.
You're scaring me.

492
00:34:27,257 --> 00:34:29,468
- Damn it, I'm serious!
- So am I!

493
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:32,012
See, I've waited six months for this.

494
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:35,599
Ever since Grams
went into the hospital.

495
00:34:35,765 --> 00:34:38,852
See, I've known for quite some time
that the moment the old witch croaked

496
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:41,146
that all your powers,
they'd be released.

497
00:34:41,354 --> 00:34:42,772
Powers that would
reveal themselves

498
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:45,275
as soon as the three of you
got together again.

499
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:48,153
All that was needed was
for Phoebe to return.

500
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,655
It's you, isn't it?
You killed all those women.

501
00:34:50,864 --> 00:34:52,824
Not women, witches.

502
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,951
Why?

503
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,662
It was the only way
to get their powers.

504
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,332
And now I want yours.

505
00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:17,056
Okay, think, stay calm.

506
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,976
Think, think, think.
Gotta get out of here.

507
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:23,187
Okay, okay.

508
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,335
<i>Prue, it's Roger.</i>

509
00:35:46,502 --> 00:35:48,546
<i>I've decided to let you
come back to work.</i>

510
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,339
<i>Seriously, let's talk.</i>

511
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:54,010
Well, Piper's definitely not home,
unless she's turned into a cat.

512
00:35:54,177 --> 00:35:55,720
- How'd the cat get in?
- I don't know.

513
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,263
Someone left a window open.

514
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,558
- Did Piper leave a message?
- She's probably out with Jeremy.

515
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,519
- Roger called.
- Yeah, I heard.

516
00:36:03,853 --> 00:36:06,022
- Prue!
- In here.

517
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:10,067
- Piper?
- My God. What is it? What's wrong?

518
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,528
Lock the doors! Check the windows!
We don't have time!

519
00:36:12,695 --> 00:36:14,864
<i>Phoebe, in the Book, did it say
how to get rid of a...</i>

520
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,783
- Warlock?
- Oh, my God.

521
00:36:31,297 --> 00:36:33,883
I'll get you, you bitch.

522
00:36:41,307 --> 00:36:43,809
- I'm calling the cops.
- And tell them that we're witches?

523
00:36:43,976 --> 00:36:46,937
That some freak with powers beyond
comprehension is trying to kill us?

524
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:50,566
Even if the cops did come, they'd be
no match for Jeremy and we'd be next.

525
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:54,111
I've found the answer.
It's our only hope. Come on!

526
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,156
Okay, we've placed the nine candles

527
00:36:57,322 --> 00:36:59,575
anointed with the oils
and spices in a circle.

528
00:36:59,741 --> 00:37:01,493
Wait, I only count eight.

529
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:03,829
- You forgot this one.
- A birthday candle?

530
00:37:04,037 --> 00:37:06,456
I guess Grams was a little low
on witch supplies.

531
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:08,250
All right, next, we need the poppet.

532
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,127
- Got it.
- I think we're set.

533
00:37:10,502 --> 00:37:12,045
We're ready to cast the spell.

534
00:37:12,254 --> 00:37:15,173
Okay, first, I'll make it stronger.

535
00:37:16,091 --> 00:37:19,803
<i>Your love will wither and depart
From my life and my heart</i>

536
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,181
<i>Let me be, Jeremy
And go away forever</i>

537
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:31,106
- Okay, the spell is complete.
- Let's hope it works.

538
00:38:03,638 --> 00:38:05,640
Wait, it didn't work.

539
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:07,934
- What?
- The spell. It didn't work.

540
00:38:08,601 --> 00:38:11,020
- How do you know?
- When I touched the pot, I had a flash.

541
00:38:11,187 --> 00:38:14,315
- I saw Jeremy.
- You touched the pot and saw him?

542
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:16,276
He's on his way here.

543
00:38:28,288 --> 00:38:29,914
Hello, ladies.

544
00:38:30,123 --> 00:38:31,833
Piper, Phoebe...

545
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,128
...get out of here. Now!

546
00:38:36,004 --> 00:38:37,630
Cool parlour trick, bitch.

547
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,842
Yeah, you were always the tough one,
weren't you, Prue?

548
00:38:47,014 --> 00:38:49,016
Phoebe, you're right.
Our powers, they're growing.

549
00:38:49,183 --> 00:38:51,060
Put as many things against
the door as you can!

550
00:38:51,227 --> 00:38:54,856
You can't keep me out, Prue.
My powers are stronger than yours.

551
00:38:55,022 --> 00:38:57,400
- Okay.
- Yeah, look out.

552
00:39:01,988 --> 00:39:04,782
You don't think a chair will stop me.

553
00:39:05,491 --> 00:39:08,286
You don't think a dresser
can stop me.

554
00:39:09,328 --> 00:39:11,706
Have you witches figured it out?

555
00:39:12,707 --> 00:39:16,752
Nothing, nothing can keep me away.

556
00:39:18,963 --> 00:39:21,090
What do we do?
We're trapped!

557
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:27,471
Come on, we'll face him together!
Remember the spirit board?

558
00:39:27,638 --> 00:39:29,390
The inscription on the back!

559
00:39:29,598 --> 00:39:31,433
<i>The power of three will set us free</i>

560
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:40,734
Come on, we've got to stay together.

561
00:39:41,151 --> 00:39:43,529
<i>The power of three will set us free</i>

562
00:39:43,737 --> 00:39:45,531
<i>The power of three will set us free</i>

563
00:39:45,698 --> 00:39:47,491
<i>The power of three will set us free</i>

564
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,202
<i>The power of three will set us free</i>

565
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:52,287
<i>The power of three will set us free</i>

566
00:39:52,454 --> 00:39:54,206
I'm not the only one!

567
00:39:54,748 --> 00:39:56,500
I'm one of millions.

568
00:39:56,709 --> 00:40:01,130
In places you can't even imagine,
in forms you would never believe.

569
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:02,881
We are hell on this earth!

570
00:40:03,173 --> 00:40:09,680
You'll never be safe
and you'll never be free!

571
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:20,190
The power of three.

572
00:40:32,452 --> 00:40:33,954
Good morning.

573
00:40:36,164 --> 00:40:37,582
Hey.

574
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:39,960
This is a surprise.

575
00:40:40,419 --> 00:40:43,713
I've been feeling really guilty
about that bad cup of coffee.

576
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,632
I just wanna make it up to you.

577
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:47,384
So you brought me
a good cup of coffee?

578
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:49,386
Oh, this? No, this is mine.

579
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:53,682
I just wanted to ask you
out to dinner.

580
00:40:55,517 --> 00:40:56,977
Unless, of course, you're afraid.

581
00:40:57,602 --> 00:40:59,229
Afraid of what?

582
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:01,022
Oh, you know.
Having too good a time,

583
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:05,110
stirring up old memories,
rekindling the old flame.

584
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:06,778
Good point. Better not.

585
00:41:07,362 --> 00:41:09,030
Okay.

586
00:41:09,823 --> 00:41:11,700
Friday night, 8:00?

587
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:15,078
You hesitated.

588
00:41:15,245 --> 00:41:17,622
Yeah, but it's not what you think.

589
00:41:18,915 --> 00:41:21,543
It's just that my life has gotten
a bit complicated.

590
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,840
- Can I call you?
- Sure.

591
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:33,596
Take care, Prue.

592
00:41:34,097 --> 00:41:35,848
Bye, Andy.

593
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:39,644
- That was Andy.
- I told you I heard a man's voice.

594
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:41,938
What did he want?

595
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:43,940
He asked me out.

596
00:41:44,107 --> 00:41:45,525
And you said?

597
00:41:45,692 --> 00:41:49,654
Well, I started to say yes
and then I stopped.

598
00:41:50,196 --> 00:41:53,408
I wondered if I could date.
I mean, do witches date?

599
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:57,286
Not only do they date,
but they usually get the best guys.

600
00:42:06,462 --> 00:42:08,714
You two will not be laughing
when this happens to you.

601
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:10,800
Believe me, everything
will be different now.

602
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:12,843
Well, at least our lives
won't be boring.

603
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,428
But they'll never be the same.

604
00:42:14,595 --> 00:42:16,180
And this is a bad thing?

605
00:42:16,347 --> 00:42:18,641
No, but it could be a big problem.

606
00:42:18,808 --> 00:42:20,518
Prue's right.
What are we gonna do?

607
00:42:20,685 --> 00:42:22,061
What can't we do?

608
00:42:22,228 --> 00:42:24,355
We're going to be careful.
We're going to be wise.

609
00:42:24,522 --> 00:42:25,981
And we're gonna stick together.

610
00:42:26,148 --> 00:42:28,609
This should be interesting.
