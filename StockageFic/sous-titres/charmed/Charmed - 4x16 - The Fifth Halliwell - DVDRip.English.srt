1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,518
To marriage!

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,309
Hey, this is supposed to be
our anniversary.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,552
Oh, to Piper and Leo's marriage.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,676
May ours be as successful as theirs.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,115
Yeah, see, that still didn't sound
like it was about us.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,394
All right, everybody, l...

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,358
- I'm gonna go, I'm tired.
- Wait, you can't go yet, Paige.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,919
We haven't gotten to the good part.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,469
Oh, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,392
I thought watching you guys
make out all night

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,516
was supposed to be
the highlight of my evening.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,831
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
Are we boring you?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,989
No, no, it's just...

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,869
It is weird seeing a girl
that wasn't the marrying type

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,429
be so married.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,236
Piper tried to tell me that it was
gonna be great and different.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,274
Well, you just have to experience it,
and you'll understand.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,078
- All right, so the good part?
- Oh, yes, the good part.

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,593
Excuse me.

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,195
There you go.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,352
- Oh, my God.
- Cole.

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,557
- It's no big deal.
- Just the finest hotel in Hawaii.

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,514
I just didn't think it was right
you guys never got a honeymoon.

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,234
Oh, my God, could you be
any sweeter right now?

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,628
Hang on, you got them
tickets to Hawaii?

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,030
Well, not plane tickets.
They'll have to orb there.

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,397
But, you know, hotel
and a couple of nice dinners...

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,797
Cole, I can't believe you did this.

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,559
Am I missing something?

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,280
Aren't you unemployed?
How did you afford this?

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,717
That's tomorrow's surprise.
For tonight, another toast.

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,754
To Leo and to Piper,
a lifetime of happiness.

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,829
You okay?

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,879
- Baby, you okay?
- Excuse me.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,278
I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just...

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,317
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

37
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,309
So you think Cole won
the lottery or something?

38
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,674
I know I did.

39
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,109
Sorry.

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,040
I was with the entire family.
Have you lost your mind?

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,189
Forgive me.

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,433
But it was imperative that I have you
here now if my ritual is to take effect.

43
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,997
I am trying to be the perfect husband,
the perfect brother-in-law.

44
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,677
It would help if I didn't have demons
waving at me from the dance floor.

45
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,150
If my fertility ritual fails,
the show's over anyway.

46
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,589
Tomorrow's harvest moon
will be your one chance

47
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,637
to impregnate your wife.

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,439
The power of the moon
combined with this tonic

49
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,795
will make her fertile to demon seed

50
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,839
and override any preventative
measures she's taken.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
- Her favourite sweet?
- Chocolate.

52
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,197
Then I'll mix it with the chocolate.

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,710
You must feed it
to her in the morning,

54
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,919
and then finish the job when
the moon is high in the night sky.

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,718
And if you succeed,

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,237
the evil spawn growing inside her
will influence her own evil leanings.

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,630
So that when she does
discover the truth,

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,836
she will bend to your will.

59
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,476
She will bend to her love for me.

60
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,352
For the tonic.

61
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,197
- Can I try this?
- Yeah, sure.

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,757
- My hair clip broke.
- Try one of mine.

63
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,239
- Glowy.
- Yeah, like you need more glow.

64
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,198
Yeah, isn't it weird
how sex can replace sleep?

65
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,839
Wonder if they've done
studies on that.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,709
- I remember Dave, my ex-boyfriend...
- Oh, no. It's different with boyfriends.

67
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,230
I don't know why, but once
you're married, it's just...

68
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,709
It's just better.
You know what I mean?

69
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,632
Commitment, it's incredibly sexy.

70
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,358
Yeah. It's more intimate
or something.

71
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,715
Well, I wouldn't know.

72
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,672
Speaking of looking forward,

73
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,229
Piper, you're going
on your honeymoon tonight.

74
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,879
I think new lingerie is in order.

75
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,031
You always think
new lingerie is in order.

76
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,316
Not for me, silly.

77
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,993
- You wanna come, Paige?
- I can't.

78
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,469
I have to go to that evil place
where they keep my paycheck.

79
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,073
Oh, right. Sorry.

80
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,317
- Surprise.
- A new car?

81
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,869
Where did you get that?

82
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,435
- It came with the job.
- Oh, are you a valet parker?

83
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,915
Attorney, thank you very much.

84
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,991
It's a company car.

85
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,357
Are you serious?

86
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,478
That's strange. You didn't last
two hours at Legal Aid.

87
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,552
Yeah, you hated it.
You said you hated being a lawyer.

88
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,474
Yeah, but that job was high-stress
and paid nothing.

89
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,392
- This one--
- Comes with a Porsche.

90
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,193
Right.

91
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,276
- How come she's not smiling?
- You got me.

92
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,796
- Is this the Tiptronic?
- No.

93
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,715
I thought you'd be happy?

94
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,597
Cole, if you're happy, I'm happy.

95
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,352
All right.

96
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,358
I got your favourite chocolates.

97
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,839
And I reserved
the honeymoon suite at the Mark.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,195
- A honeymoon?
- Just for tonight. What do you say?

99
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,796
Oh, I say I need to do
a little bit of shopping first, I think.

100
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,473
What do you say, Piper?

101
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,552
Rebekah Ryan's playing
at the club tonight, so I gotta go set up.

102
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,154
I'll cover for you.

103
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,396
Gotta do something.
Cole's making me look bad.

104
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,233
So chocolates?

105
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,913
Are you sure you don't want one?
They smell pretty good.

106
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,039
Maybe you are evil.

107
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,193
I love you.

108
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,998
So, what law firm
are you working for?

109
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,874
Are you familiar
with San Francisco law firms?

110
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,116
Yeah, I deal with them
from time to time.

111
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,674
Jackman, Carter and Kline?

112
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,032
Haven't heard of them.

113
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,438
Well, I better get to work.

114
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,592
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

115
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,115
Okay, what do you think?

116
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,229
Hey!

117
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,671
I think he liked it,
and I think she didn't.

118
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,159
Okay, but what is it saying?

119
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,836
Because I'm going for that kind of
we're-married-but-we're-not-dead look.

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,989
I think it's more of

121
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,118
a I'm-gonna-wear-this-one-night-and-
spend-the-next-six-months-paying-it-off

122
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,032
kind of look.

123
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,359
I hate it when you're right.

124
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,959
But although come to think of it,

125
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,874
you could probably afford anything you
want now that Cole's gone corporate.

126
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,554
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
rely on that.

127
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,153
And I'm not gonna just sit at home

128
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,709
while my husband works either,
you know.

129
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,998
Maybe in ten years from now,
like when I have kids, but not now.

130
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,276
Oh, hit a nerve?

131
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,598
I just think it's time
I got a job too, you know.

132
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,398
What do you think?

133
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,592
I think being so charming, as we are,
is kind of a full-time job.

134
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,390
Yeah, it just happens to come with
a death threat in lieu of a paycheck.

135
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,832
Right. So if Cole is bringing, you know,
an extra few bucks into the household,

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,149
why not enjoy it?

137
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,955
Because, Piper, it's not about that.

138
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,829
I have a degree in psychology
that I worked really hard for,

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,551
and I would like to be able to use it
to help people in a non-magical way.

140
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,474
Speaking of helping people...

141
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,878
Good thing that car had brakes.

142
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,116
- You would have been roadkill.
- Totally.

143
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,316
- This woman saved her.
- Are you okay?

144
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,718
Can you help me get to work?

145
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,075
I won't make my deadline.
I've gotta get to work.

146
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,753
All right.

147
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,074
- lnnocent.
- Of course.

148
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,958
I still don't trust him.

149
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,237
I called the firm, and apparently he's
telling the truth about getting that job.

150
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,550
Wait, he told the truth? The rat.

151
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,950
I'm telling you, Lila,
there's something weird going on.

152
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,111
He couldn't function
in the job that I got him here.

153
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,349
I mean, he hit a client.

154
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,829
And now all of a sudden
he's Mr. Suave Lawyer Man.

155
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,314
People change.

156
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,637
Not that quickly, not that much.

157
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,119
There's something off about him,

158
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,669
and I'm gonna keep
an eye on him. Period.

159
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,354
Spying on the husband,

160
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,795
now, that's a sure-fire way
to reconnect with your sister.

161
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,829
Paige Matthews.

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,197
Hey, we got a witchy-type situation

163
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,272
that could really benefit
from your area of expertise.

164
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,396
Any chance you could
meet us back at the manor?

165
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,199
- Yeah, I'll be right over.
- Great, see you there.

166
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,110
What do you mean
she wouldn't eat it?

167
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,950
I mean I thought shoving it down
her throat might be a little suspicious.

168
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,629
So is it too late?

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,312
No. The tonic is stronger
the longer it has to gestate.

170
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,397
It might still work.

171
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,635
Then keep an eye out

172
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,030
and warn me of any demons
who might be planning to attack.

173
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,838
I can't afford any distractions
for Phoebe.

174
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,430
Cole, we have to...

175
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,799
This is-- This is Mike, my law clerk,
and he was just leaving.

176
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,509
Thanks. You can catch me up
on those cases tomorrow.

177
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,631
Right. Sure.

178
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,912
Excuse me.

179
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,079
- Cole, this is Karen Young.
- Pleased to meet you.

180
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,800
She needs our help.

181
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,072
I was going in early.
It was still dark.

182
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,635
I said goodbye to my husband...

183
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,279
...and then I don't remember.

184
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,034
I don't understand
what's happening to me.

185
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,636
Karen, I know you're scared,
but we're gonna help you, I promise.

186
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,398
What's wrong with her?

187
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,635
I don't know.

188
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,189
I had a premonition that she was
being attacked by demons.

189
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,478
Only I don't think it was a premonition.
I think it already happened.

190
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,279
But she was hit
by some kind of light ball.

191
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,398
So we might have to postpone
this evening, baby.

192
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,709
No, we can't.

193
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,037
Well, Cole, innocents come first.

194
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,319
Of course they do.

195
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,037
I just...

196
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,552
I just can't wait to be
alone with you.

197
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,278
I'll do whatever I can to help.

198
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,669
Forgive me?

199
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,551
Hi, hi, hi.
Innocent afoot, remember?

200
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,989
Right.

201
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,519
So she's calmer now,

202
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,990
but why don't you hang out with her
while we go check the Book?

203
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,350
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

204
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,556
- Piper?
- What?

205
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,000
Nothing. It's okay.

206
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,710
Suddenly I can't wait
to go on my honeymoon.

207
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,190
Me either. Must be the full moon.

208
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,392
You wanna tell me what happened?

209
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,596
I don't know.

210
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,274
I don't have time for this.

211
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,994
Who attacked you?

212
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,869
Don't touch me!

213
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,359
Don't touch me! Leave me alone!

214
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,831
He was touching me!

215
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,949
I didn't hear you come in.

216
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,268
What's the matter?
You look like you saw a ghost.

217
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,792
I'm not sure what I saw.

218
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,034
What do you mean?

219
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,959
What were you doing to her?

220
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,355
Well, I was comforting her.

221
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,909
If you haven't noticed,
she's hysterical.

222
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,394
Got it!

223
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,675
- That was quick.
- Yeah.

224
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,717
Well, we're that good.
Thanks for coming.

225
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,754
- We have a problem.
- Yeah?

226
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,673
I mean, what's the problem
with her?

227
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,751
- Power brokers?
- Of course.

228
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,950
Apparently the light ball
that was thrown at Karen

229
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,473
was a demonic power.

230
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,268
Yeah, brokers will sometimes
use people to store powers

231
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,032
until they find a buyer.

232
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,111
That way, thieves can't get to them.

233
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,757
"A human being possessed
of a demonic power

234
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,114
will become confused,

235
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,157
then frightened, paranoid,
violent and demonic,

236
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,359
and will ultimately die
if the power isn't withdrawn."

237
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,273
The good news is there is a potion
to pull the power out of her.

238
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,433
It's work.

239
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,397
They probably want me
to fill out more forms.

240
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,438
Okay, baby, well, you go,
and we'll call you if we need you.

241
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,235
Good.

242
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,113
I gotta get out of here.

243
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,919
- I have a family to take care of.
- Karen, your family is okay.

244
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,074
But I have a job, I have a deadline.
Elise, she'll fire me.

245
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,958
It's okay. We'll talk to Elise for you,

246
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,680
we'll tell her you're with us,
we'll make it all okay.

247
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,198
- I'll go.
- No.

248
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,511
Phoebe should go,
you're the best with potions.

249
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,477
Here, honey, take my car.

250
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,677
Okay. Call me if things get worse.

251
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,271
- Piper--
- This potion takes a while to brew,

252
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,475
and we're out of hyssop,

253
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,631
so why don't you stay
with Karen and start cooking,

254
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,199
and I'll go to the herb store.

255
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,191
No, I have to talk to you
about something.

256
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,113
You're gonna hate me for saying this,
but I think I saw Cole use--

257
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,999
No. Paige, we've been through this
a million times.

258
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,593
No, this is different.

259
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,069
- I think I saw Cole use demonic pow--
- No, no, no.

260
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,078
There is nothing demonic
about Cole.

261
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,470
And whether you like it or not,
he's your brother-in-law.

262
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,312
So whatever issues
you have with him,

263
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,914
you're gonna have
to take care of yourself.

264
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,359
Karen, can I ask you
a couple questions?

265
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,869
I don't know, I just felt him
do something behind me.

266
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,669
Something like what?
Did you see him do anything?

267
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,632
Who are you?
Why did you bring me here?

268
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,519
Paige, have you seen Piper around?

269
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,148
Yeah, she's already left.

270
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,799
Aren't you supposed to be
on club duty?

271
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,916
Well, I'd much rather be
on my honeymoon.

272
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,719
Who is she?
Is there something wrong?

273
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,519
No, she's an innocent.
We're on top of it.

274
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,992
More importantly,

275
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,072
I think I saw Cole
using magical powers.

276
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,196
- What?
- Yes.

277
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,191
Now, I know it sounds crazy,

278
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,955
but I think I saw his hand glow.

279
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,476
- Paige--
- No, look.

280
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,039
There's something strange going on.

281
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,553
There's all the elaborate gifts,

282
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,395
and then he's got the $50,000 car,
what job comes with perks like that?

283
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,548
So Cole gets a company car,

284
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,870
and that automatically makes him
a demon in your eyes?

285
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,599
No!

286
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,912
No, it's just that something is
different with him lately

287
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,832
and it's not good.

288
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,433
Am I the only one seeing this?

289
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,991
Maybe you're the only one
who wants to see it.

290
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,749
Meaning?

291
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,639
Meaning that no one
wants to be the fifth wheel.

292
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,119
That's not fair.

293
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,111
You know what's not fair?

294
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,874
Is you judging Cole for his past.

295
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,152
He's not a demon anymore.

296
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,790
And he's part of this family.

297
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,196
Well, it's about time.

298
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,873
Thank you.

299
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,638
Paige saw me using my powers.

300
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,950
What? You've been exposed?

301
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,156
Not necessarily.
She's not certain what she saw.

302
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,072
Nevertheless, she must die.

303
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,559
A little subtlety.

304
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,671
That would hardly put Phoebe
in an amorous mood,

305
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,637
and I'm too close now
to abandon my plan.

306
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,156
If one of the witches is on to you,
more than your plan is at risk.

307
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,197
But still, she's not sure
she can trust her own eyes.

308
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,879
And I think I know a way
to make sure

309
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,235
no one trusts what Paige
says she saw.

310
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,072
How?

311
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,435
The innocent the girls brought home
was infected by a power broker.

312
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,113
What does that have to do with it?

313
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,430
If I could get a power broker
to do the same to Paige,

314
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,953
she'd become unstable as well.

315
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,395
But by the time she reached
breaking point,

316
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,710
her sisters will be
on their honeymoons.

317
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,355
She could alert them.

318
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,388
Not if I accelerate her slide,

319
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,518
push her past fear
and into paranoia.

320
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,792
Then she won't trust them enough
to alert them.

321
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,677
Who did this? Who pulled me here?

322
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,636
- I did.
- The Source.

323
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,358
You live.

324
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,676
Let's just keep that
between us for now.

325
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,872
I have an assignment for you.

326
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,595
If you succeed,

327
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,558
you'll be rewarded with more power
than you can possibly imagine.

328
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,231
- Hold that for the Sunday special.
- Okay.

329
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,072
Yes, yes, that's no problem.

330
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,672
Hi.

331
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,993
-You are?
- Married.

332
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,071
Honeymooning tonight, yeah.

333
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,834
Cannot wait.

334
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,838
Excuse me.

335
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,754
I'm actually looking for someone,
a boss-type someone.

336
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,876
Her name is Elise?

337
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,037
Okay.

338
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,393
What?

339
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,757
Hi, I'm here on behalf
of Karen Young.

340
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,876
- She has fallen ill and--
- Tell her she's fired.

341
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,873
- What? No.
- When she's late, I'm late.

342
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,759
I'm an editor with better things to do
than to wait around for her.

343
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,990
No, but she's not gonna be late.

344
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,275
Is she late already?

345
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,592
Deadline's 8:00 tonight.
And I thought you said she was sick.

346
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,228
Well, that's why I'm here.

347
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,960
To pick up her assignment
and bring it to her.

348
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,318
Believe me, nothing is more important
to Karen than reporting the news.

349
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,237
I would hardly call
the advice column news.

350
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,755
This week's letters are probably
on this train wreck of a desk.

351
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,839
Wow, that's a lot of mail.

352
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,151
Yeah, she's got a following,
so she must be doing something right.

353
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,233
Since there's so much traffic right now
and I have to get this mail to her,

354
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,913
would you consider extending--?

355
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,117
I appreciate the fact that it takes
a special type of person

356
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,794
to rifle through the miseries
of absolute strangers

357
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,109
and actually manage to help.

358
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,592
The fact is I couldn't even
manage to care.

359
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,876
This is a newspaper,
and we work on a deadline.

360
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,075
End of conversation.

361
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,953
Okay.

362
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,630
- Hello.
- Hey, did you make the potion?

363
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,755
Potion?

364
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,798
Paige is making the potion,

365
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,511
and I have ten glorious minutes
until I have to add my herbs.

366
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,989
Great, because I need
your help fast.

367
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,073
Karen's gonna get fired unless we get
her advice column in by 8:00 tonight.

368
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,831
So, what would you tell
a 28-year-old woman

369
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,834
who's still living in her parents' house
because she's afraid of living alone?

370
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,397
I'd tell her to get a life!

371
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,913
How can I write that?

372
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,513
We fight demons every day.

373
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,468
How can I tell her that there's
nothing to be afraid of, you know?

374
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,599
What are you doing, Piper?

375
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,872
I am taking my own advice!

376
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,236
--to get out of here.
I just have to get out of here.

377
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,550
I gotta get out of here.
I gotta get out of here.

378
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,835
I gotta get out.
I gotta get out of here now!

379
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,871
Wait, Karen, the medicine
is almost finished.

380
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,190
After you take it,
you can go anywhere you want.

381
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,994
You're trying to poison me.
You're working for that bitch, Elise.

382
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,957
- I'm gonna kill her before she kills me.
- No.

383
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,680
We are only trying to help you.
No one is trying to hurt you.

384
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,273
I don't want your help.

385
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,159
I'm sorry, I just can't let you go.

386
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,994
Oh, my God, what are you?

387
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,713
What's going on in here?

388
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,599
- Get off me! Leave me alone!
- Where's Phoebe?

389
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,792
Good question.

390
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,679
Paige, behind you!

391
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,158
Paige, get her out of here!

392
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,548
Stay away from me!

393
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,039
Leo!

394
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,997
- Power broker, blow him up!
- What?

395
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,989
Where's Karen?

396
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,835
You should be feeling better.
I healed your wounds.

397
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,594
Oh, yeah, I am.
I'm just a little woozy.

398
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,514
It was like acid spray.
It hurt Paige pretty bad.

399
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,717
So we need to find Karen fast.

400
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,440
- So our innocent is now our demon?
- Right.

401
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,114
But she is still our innocent.

402
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,989
And listen, Paige said she was ranting
about hating her boss,

403
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,355
so she could be on her way there.

404
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,750
Oh, well, great. Then you should be
on your way here too.

405
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,718
Because there's not a lot I could do
against an acid-breathing innocent,

406
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,518
you know?

407
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,511
The acid is coming out of her hands.

408
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,192
Whatever. I'm on a deadline, okay.

409
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,392
Okay, I'm gonna go to Phoebe
in case Karen goes there.

410
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,036
- I'll orb you.
- No.

411
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,674
Your orbing's still a little clumsy.

412
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,070
And besides, they might need
Leo's healing powers.

413
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,074
Yeah, he's right. You should stay here
in case Karen comes back.

414
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,237
And if there's any problems,

415
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,597
any real problems,
you can call for us.

416
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,078
Keep an eye on her, will you?

417
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,038
Yeah, don't worry.

418
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,470
Paige, you don't still
have a problem with me, do you?

419
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,830
I don't believe it.
I saved your life out there.

420
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,638
I just...

421
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,835
I don't understand.

422
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,396
What if she doesn't come here?

423
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,039
It's our best bet.

424
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,514
How do you spell "oblique"?

425
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,954
With spell check.

426
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,234
There she is.

427
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,239
Out of my way!

428
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,473
Phoebe. Phoebe!
Acid-spraying innocent in the house.

429
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,789
Yeah, just give me a second.

430
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,634
Karen, she's in here.
She's waiting for your assignment.

431
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,039
Yes! Printing.

432
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,675
Hi, saving.

433
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,632
Karen, we have your medicine.

434
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,951
Well, it's a good thing I was done.

435
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,472
Someone's coming,
and the door doesn't lock.

436
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,756
Oh, that's Elise.
She's coming for Karen's assignment.

437
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,114
God, I hope she likes it.

438
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,429
- Phoebe!
- What? Okay.

439
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,999
Okay, what do I do? What do I do?

440
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,913
- Shove it down her throat.
- Shove it down her throat.

441
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,835
Hi. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

442
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,799
Karen?

443
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,558
Karen, open the door.

444
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,748
Karen? Open the door!

445
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,353
Sorry, it was jammed.

446
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,995
What the hell is going on in here?
Who are you?

447
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,751
This is Karen's doctor and nurse.

448
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,310
I told you, she's very sick.

449
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,718
She gonna live?

450
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,116
Yeah, yeah, she's gonna be fine.

451
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,078
Good. Where's my copy?

452
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,670
- I don't...
- I have that.

453
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,796
I have the copy.

454
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,399
That's funny.

455
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,836
It's funny? Like, bad funny?
What's funny?

456
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,036
You should be sick more often.
This is good stuff.

457
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,111
Really? It is?

458
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,475
Yay, Karen.

459
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,032
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

460
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,555
I did it.

461
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,599
I mean we-- We did it. Yay, we.

462
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,789
Paige?

463
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,838
What's the matter?

464
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,669
Are you okay?

465
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,229
How did you do that?

466
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,349
Do what?

467
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,512
Just admit it. You're a demon.
Just tell the truth.

468
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,513
I can't believe you'd even think that.
You're the one acting strange.

469
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,511
If you keep this up,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

470
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,594
Stay away from me.
I'm gonna tell Phoebe.

471
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,159
Oh, come on.

472
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,880
You don't really think your sisters
would leave you alone with me

473
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,951
- if I was evil?
- Stay away from me.

474
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,108
Do you really think Phoebe would have
married me if I was a demon?

475
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,396
- Hello?
- Hey.

476
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,916
Did you say something
about a honeymoon suite for tonight?

477
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,471
- Does that mean you found Karen?
- Yes, we found her, we saved her.

478
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,835
We even saved her job. She's fine.

479
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,989
The only thing is,

480
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,151
she doesn't remember
anything that happened today.

481
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,436
- Perfect.
- What?

482
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,398
Well, that means she can't
expose you guys as witches.

483
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,277
You know what, if we hurry,
we can still make late check-in.

484
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,872
But I don't have anything to wear.

485
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,951
I can pack for you.
I know what I like.

486
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,599
I bet you do.

487
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,028
Okay, I'll meet you there.

488
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,953
Hey, wait, why don't you tell
Leo and Piper to orb straight to Hawaii,

489
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,758
don't even bother packing?

490
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,956
You never know when
the next demon's gonna attack.

491
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,556
I'll tell them. You just hurry. Bye.

492
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,075
Stop it. Why are you doing this?

493
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,917
What's the matter? Seeing things?

494
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,512
I know you're here.

495
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,591
I'll find you.

496
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,712
I love you.

497
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,274
I had a feeling.

498
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,113
Oh, and here I thought all this time
I was being so subtle.

499
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,430
Oh, my God, Paige!

500
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,679
The power brokers got to her.
There's a potion in my purse.

501
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,035
- He's evil.
- Paige, don't do this. Fight it.

502
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,719
He's evil. I have to stop him.

503
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,228
Leo! Leo!

504
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,834
This better be good!

505
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,315
Look at her eyes.

506
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,112
Okay, Piper. What--?

507
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,310
What? This is what
whitelighters are for.

508
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,914
- Where's the potion?
- It's broken.

509
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,231
Oh, okay.
Well, there's more at the manor.

510
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,909
No, there's not, actually.
Paige broke that one too.

511
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,355
What? What do you mean?
That took forever to make.

512
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,590
She could die
if we have to make more.

513
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,988
How did we not notice?

514
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,070
She was talking
about not trusting Cole.

515
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,196
It didn't occur to me
that she might be infected.

516
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,716
- This is all my fault.
- It's not your fault, it's no one's fault.

517
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,550
Leo, she's burning up!

518
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,835
I tried to heal her, I can't.

519
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,798
Well, what are we supposed to do?
Just stand here and watch her die?

520
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,589
No, no, no. This can't be happening!
Not again.

521
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,759
There is a way.

522
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,113
We need to find a power broker
to pull it out of her.

523
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,349
I blew him up.

524
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,433
There's others.

525
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,432
You'll have to orb me underground.

526
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,719
- We'll all go.
- No, it's too dangerous.

527
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,711
You never know what
powers they might have.

528
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,189
Besides, your powers might not
work too well down there.

529
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,634
Cole, you don't have any powers!

530
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,789
Cole, there's no time to argue,
we're going.

531
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,598
Let me get dressed.

532
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,914
So I'll give you an energy ball
for a lightning bolt.

533
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,229
For the fire bolts.

534
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,471
- What are they doing?
- Trading powers.

535
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,995
- So, what do we do?
- Well...

536
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,670
- We barge in. Get Paige.
- Wait, wait, wait!

537
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:39,595
Sorry to interrupt, but I think one
of you may have misplaced a power.

538
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,149
I'll get her, you get ready
to orb them out of here.

539
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,595
- Who are you?
- We're the Charmed Ones.

540
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,638
And one of you jackasses
infected our sister.

541
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,833
It's gonna be pretty hard to tell
which jackass though, huh?

542
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,679
So here's the deal:

543
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,197
We'll spare your lives, if you pull
your skanky little power out of her.

544
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,958
The power of the Charmed Ones
lies in the power of three.

545
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,679
You're one witch down.

546
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,434
You sure you wanna
test that theory?

547
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,798
Too bad. You lose.

548
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,993
Told you about
your powers down here.

549
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,872
Let's get out of here.

550
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,034
Keep in mind that
that was just a warning.

551
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,997
Next time, I'll use full force.

552
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,956
Forgive us.
We'll do whatever you ask.

553
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,270
See, now, that's more like it
right there.

554
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,914
- Well?
- What the hell are you doing?

555
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,993
What are you waiting for?

556
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,239
Where am l?

557
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,753
You're gonna be okay, sweetie.

558
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,195
- Now can we get out of here?
- Wait.

559
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,154
Had enough power to do that.

560
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,599
Why would you save Paige

561
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,354
after everything you did
to destroy her?

562
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,714
They would have found a way
to save her anyway.

563
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,233
This way, I get the credit.

564
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,631
Did you do it for credit? Or love?

565
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,592
I suppose there's some things
even The Source can't defeat.

566
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,679
Careful.

567
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,796
I am, but are you?

568
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,279
We have worked too hard

569
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,194
to let a nugget of humanity
destroy a legacy of evil.

570
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,872
Paige has no memory.

571
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,439
She's not a threat to us anymore.

572
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,990
I'm not talking about her,
I'm talking about Cole.

573
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,958
He's the one threat
neither one of us can control.

574
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,716
He saved Paige, not you.

575
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,711
I'm not concerned.

576
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,872
There will be nothing he can do
once Phoebe's pregnant.

577
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,309
Is she?

578
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,353
Well?

579
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,910
I see conflicting futures.

580
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,548
Only time will tell.

581
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,800
I can't believe I destroyed the house.

582
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,793
What I can't believe is what
you almost saw in that hotel room.

583
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,270
If you had gotten there
five minutes earlier...

584
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,194
Oversharing.

585
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,714
Hey, Karen.

586
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,030
Oh, I hoped I'd find you here.

587
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,272
- Do we know her?
- Wow, your memory really is shot.

588
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,476
You told Fearful in Marin
to get a dog.

589
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,198
Yeah. Oh, I know.

590
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,510
I know, it just-- It seemed right
at the time, you know.

591
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,669
So she didn't have to--

592
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,559
I would have told her
to get a therapist and get a life.

593
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,999
See, this is what I said.

594
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,676
Hers was better.

595
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,039
- Wow, really?
- Yeah.

596
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,111
It was proactive,
it was non-judgmental.

597
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,397
The whole column had
a freshness and a passion

598
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,790
that it hasn't had
for a really long time.

599
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,754
Thank you.

600
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,751
And I'm gonna tell Elise
that you wrote it.

601
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,996
Oh, no, Karen, don't do that.

602
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,118
I mean, she'll fire you then.

603
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,236
And my guess is she'll hire you.

604
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,870
If you think you can handle
working for that witch.

605
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,279
I thought of her more as a demon.

606
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,394
Well, either way, I hate her.

607
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,790
And even though I'm not sure
what happened today,

608
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,033
I just feel like I wanna spend
more time at home with my kid.

609
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,159
So I wanna say thanks.

610
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,391
For everything.

611
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,510
That is very sweet.

612
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,998
What just happened there?

613
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,438
I think Phoebe just got a job.

614
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,279
No, I can't.

615
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,389
Can l?

616
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,950
Phoebe, somebody's going to pay you
to tell other people what to do.

617
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,269
Shut up and be happy.

618
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,234
To Phoebe: May you never give
any lethal advice.

619
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,478
And to Piper: May you actually get
to go on your honeymoon tomorrow.

620
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,316
- And to Paige--
- May I never try to kill you again.

621
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,913
Oh, you're not really a Halliwell

622
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,674
until you've gone demonic
on your sisters at least twice.

623
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,708
Actually, she didn't go
demonic on us.

624
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,677
She went demonic on Cole.

625
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,189
- You say tomato and I say--
- Karen already hated Elise.

626
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:46,195
That's why Elise became the object
of Karen's demonic rage.

627
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,273
Which also means
that you already hated Cole.

628
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,080
No, I don't hate Cole, Phoebe.

629
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,399
I just don't trust him.

630
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,480
I don't know why
I feel that way, I just...

631
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,278
I don't.

632
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,835
I'm sorry.

633
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,233
Yeah.

634
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,551
So am l.
