0
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,959
- She's gonna choose you.
- Is not.

1
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,792
You get to hang out with her
a lot more.

2
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,029
You've known her longer.

3
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,078
I mean, there was that whole
bonding time before I was even born.

4
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,231
Okay, she was 1 and I was 3.

5
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,119
What did we bond over,
diapers and drooling?

6
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,349
- What are those?
- Glasses,

7
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,794
so we can watch the eclipse.

8
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,393
They're very cool.

9
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,516
- I made you a pair too.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,678
- Oh, good, you're home.
- Hey.

11
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,152
So we were sort of hoping that
you could settle something for us.

12
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,393
Sure, anything to get my mind
off weddings.

13
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,232
- What?
- Nothing.

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,072
No, come on, what?

15
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,629
Okay, well, we were
kind of wondering

16
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,633
who you were gonna have
as your maid of honour.

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,870
Oh, well, let me think about it.

18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,235
I'm not allowed to invite anybody,

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,676
or have a cake
or a band or flowers,

20
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,798
so, what makes you think
I'll be able to have a maid of honour?

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,996
Honey, it's not that bad.

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,635
It's not like I'm some girly girl
who wants, like, a fairy-tale wedding,

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,713
but I just thought there would be
some things that would be givens.

24
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,995
Like fighting with the caterer

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,311
and agonising over who makes
the final cut on the guest list?

26
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,833
Even those, I just...

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,197
I just want to be able
to celebrate a little.

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,351
All right, maybe you're not getting
your dream wedding,

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,033
but you are getting
your dream guy.

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,231
Leo!

31
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,799
Leo.

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,634
I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,109
Can't you possibly be
the bearer of a big hug?

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
Not after what I just found out.

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,270
They want an answer,
Piper, about us.

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,433
Either there isn't any us,
or you guys get a new 'lighter.

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,158
We have till tomorrow night to decide.

38
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,356
Tomorrow night? That's insane.

39
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,670
But there is door number three.

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,876
We can try and pull this off
by tomorrow night.

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,156
If we do, it's binding.
They can't even break that apart.

42
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,594
Yeah, but if they find out,

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,479
they can break us apart
into a thousand little pieces.

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,392
Excuse me?

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,790
I believe the term he used was:

46
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,633
"Unspeakable wrath, the likes of which
you can't even imagine."

47
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,190
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.
We would be taking a huge risk.

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,999
And until they get an answer,
they're gonna be listening very closely.

49
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,835
So any talk of it,
any use of the W word...

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,831
I hate to be the detail police,

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,718
but, I mean, how are we
gonna hide it from them

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,155
when we're on their, like,
supernatural redial?

53
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,992
They're always gonna be tuning in.

54
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,754
Phoebe, did you find anything
in the Book of Shadows

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,831
- about how to hide this?
- No, nothing.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,116
I'm sorry, I'm still on
the "unspeakable wrath" part.

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,636
Is that just the bride and groom
or does it also include bridesmaids?

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,915
- Phoebe.
- What?

59
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,957
I mean, there must be
some real reason

60
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,838
that this merging is so forbidden.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,672
They're hardcore against it.

62
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,512
Yeah, well, rules are meant
to be broken.

63
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,238
Yeah, but bodies weren't.

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,038
And neither were hearts.

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,718
Leo, are you sure there's a way
we can do this without getting caught?

66
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,155
If there is, we'll find it.

67
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,113
Just be extra careful.

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,193
Speak in code, and especially avoid
using words like, you know...

69
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,755
All right. You should go.

70
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,515
The less time you spend here
is probably better.

71
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,195
And we probably
shouldn't do that either.

72
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,838
Soon.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,149
Yeah.

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,110
Why are they so hell-bent on seeing
each one of us so very, very alone?

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,513
Kit?

76
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,668
Kit! Leave that alone!

77
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,717
Bad kitty!

78
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,790
Good kitty!

79
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,598
- Are you afraid of me?
- No.

80
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,228
Are you planning on sprouting horns,
growing fangs and eating us?

81
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,072
If you work for him,
I'll do worse than that.

82
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,639
Which him are you referring to?

83
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,949
Okay, hi.

84
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,156
Not that I don't enjoy
the verbal Ping-Pong here,

85
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,880
but we do have that other thing
we need to figure out kind of quickly.

86
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,112
So let's cut to the chase.
Are we helping or fighting?

87
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,429
What you saw didn't scare you?

88
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,151
If I had a dollar for every time an owl
turned into a hot guy, I'd be r...

89
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,639
We've seen worse.

90
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,758
If you're not here to kill us,
apparently we're supposed to help you.

91
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,831
The only help you can give
is allow me to leave.

92
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,829
I think it's pretty obvious, don't you,

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,389
that we're pretty familiar
with the world of magic.

94
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,913
We're sort of
on the same team here.

95
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,674
Look, the last thing I need in my life
right now is more magic.

96
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,274
- I don't think you understand.
- You're right, I don't understand.

97
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,919
I stopped understanding when
he cursed me

98
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,229
and took my life away from me.

99
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,391
The only thing I do understand is loss.

100
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,391
And the only thing I want is revenge.

101
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,233
Who did this to you?
Was it a magician, a sorcerer?

102
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,753
He was my boss.

103
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,195
If you could give us some time,
we could figure out...

104
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,920
I lost enough time already
when your cat dragged me here.

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,069
Look, I only have 12 hours.

106
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,037
And tomorrow at sunrise
I am airborne again.

107
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,194
I won't... No, I can't last another day
repeating the same cycle.

108
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,634
Tonight, this thing ends.

109
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,997
His life, and, I hope, the curse
that goes along with it.

110
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,674
Just give us 30 seconds, please.

111
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,159
It starts now.

112
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,551
Okay, there are some of
my boyfriend's clothes over there.

113
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,315
Why don't you dress
while we huddle?

114
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,677
Well, he definitely has that whole
tortured innocent thing going on.

115
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,116
Yeah, but we're kind of busy,
and he doesn't seem to want our help.

116
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,191
Been there, saved that.
It wouldn't be the first time.

117
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,669
All right, you get ready
just in case he decides to bolt.

118
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,592
All right, here's what we're gonna...

119
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,433
Oh, well, he's gone. That's too bad.

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,636
Piper, we can't just ignore this.

121
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,313
He was brought to us for a reason.

122
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,439
Yes, but we have to find a way
to hide the w...

123
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,877
"Rutabaga" before they catch on.

124
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,309
The rutabaga?

125
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,711
It's a code word for the thing
we're not supposed to talk about.

126
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,879
- Oh, the rutabaga.
- Yes.

127
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,270
So let's do the divide
and conquer thing, okay?

128
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,035
Right. I'll look in the Book of Shadows
and try and scry with this owl feather...

129
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,670
...you guys see what you can
come up with for Piper's rutabaga.

130
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,115
Maybe I should stay here
and help you.

131
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,589
Phoebe, Piper needs your help
just as much as the innocent does,

132
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,749
maybe more.

133
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,388
I'm fully aware that we're
supposed to protect the innocent.

134
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,959
These are the rules
that we live by now.

135
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,793
I'm just not so sure we should be
helping Piper break them.

136
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,188
If our ancient compilation of spells,
witchcraft and rituals can't help us,

137
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,952
what makes you think
Martha Stewart can?

138
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,553
You know what I don't get?

139
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,472
Why you're giving me
such a hard time about this.

140
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,870
Weren't you the same girl
that was pushing me to say yes?

141
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,996
If you didn't think
I should have a rutabaga,

142
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,118
then you should have said so,
maybe like a long time ago.

143
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,032
Back to your corners.

144
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,679
Hi.

145
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,353
Phoebe and...

146
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,749
- Piper.
- Piper.

147
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,512
Right.

148
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,513
Assistant district attorney,
we have to stop meeting like this.

149
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,319
You better be careful,
a guy might think he's being followed.

150
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,232
You better be careful,

151
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,518
or a girl might think her sister's
getting a really cheesy pickup line.

152
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,914
So, what brings you
all the way across town?

153
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,311
I needed some source material
on a forensic-psychology case.

154
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,596
Well, I can see you're making
a lot of progress.

155
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,751
Yeah.

156
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,480
Here's the info on forensic psychology
you requested.

157
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,198
Thanks.

158
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,033
- Next customer, please.
- Embarrassed, party of one.

159
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,710
So who's the lucky guy?

160
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,711
Or more importantly,
who's the lucky sister?

161
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,678
Me. Me. Mimi.

162
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,717
Our cousin.

163
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,075
Our cousin Mimi.

164
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,993
Good old cousin Mimi.

165
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,752
Love her.

166
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,514
Well, I should probably get going.

167
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,797
I sort of got plans to accidentally bump
into another eye witness

168
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,791
over at the Gas 'N Sip's.

169
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,669
- Cute.
- I get cuter.

170
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,318
We go now.

171
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,831
Gotta go.

172
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,989
We made another killing today.

173
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,879
When you told the traders
to buy at 54 and a quarter,

174
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,837
they were a little sketchy.

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,228
Thirty minutes later,

176
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,358
everybody's rich and they're
worshipping you like a god.

177
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,397
Magic does take a bit of the risk
out of playing the market.

178
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,276
Unfortunately, not all my risks have
paid out like they were supposed to.

179
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,555
You've heard it too?

180
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,678
That screech.

181
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,479
It reeks of despair.
He's near, circling.

182
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,790
He longs for her like I do.

183
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,189
Well, give it time.

184
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,873
I sought the magic
so I wouldn't have to.

185
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,998
It has been two months, the curse
should have broken them by now!

186
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,070
All this means nothing
if I can't have what I want.

187
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,196
And I want her.

188
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,954
Dismissed.

189
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,275
I'm going to cut out your heart
like you cut out mine!

190
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,193
Christopher, I'm impressed.

191
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,828
In our time apart, you've gone
and discovered courage.

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,515
- Would you like to borrow some?
- No, thanks, I'm trying to cut down.

193
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,798
I have to say, I'm a bit surprised to see
you've managed to come so close.

194
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,599
Note to self, chat with security.

195
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,950
Well, a bird's-eye view gives a man
a different perspective,

196
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,473
different strategies.

197
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,551
Yes, the curse.

198
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,554
So tell me, does absence
make the heart grow fonder?

199
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,551
Do you think that killing me
will ease your pain?

200
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,996
All that will do is ensure
that the curse lasts forever.

201
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,479
You rang?

202
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,550
What's it gonna be, Chris?
You've got the wrong plan.

203
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,235
The only way your curse ends
is if she gives herself to me.

204
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,630
But is he telling the truth?

205
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,233
I'll let you in on a little secret.

206
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,799
I never bluff.

207
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,076
And he rarely misses.

208
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,519
Find him and kill him.

209
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,037
And if you haven't by sunrise,
kill every owl you see!

210
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,389
Hey, I hope you guys
had better luck than I did.

211
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,074
Not really.
I ended up with the wrong books.

212
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,710
And, well, Phoebe almost got lucky
right there in the store.

213
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,199
So you didn't find anything?

214
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,590
It's just that the pieces
don't really seem to fit.

215
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,797
I mean, I can understand
cursing someone to be an animal,

216
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,757
but why for only half of the day?

217
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,434
And we don't know
where he went, right?

218
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,511
No, I tried scrying
with the owl feather

219
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,274
but it must not work
while he's human.

220
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,352
- I found something.
- On the curse?

221
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,990
No, about the rutabaga.

222
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,269
It's a ritual that's like a rutabaga
but it's called...

223
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,718
Oh, yeah, that handf...

224
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,517
The reason we write the bad words
is so that we don't say the bad words.

225
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,069
Wait a minute. I thought you said
you looked in the Book

226
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,595
and couldn't find anything
to help me.

227
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,150
Yeah, well, it said that we needed
a high priestess.

228
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,108
And since we don't have one of those,
I just figured, why even mention it.

229
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,478
Besides, I couldn't find anything in
there about how to hide it from them,

230
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,029
and since that's really
the most important part,

231
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,476
so that we don't have to feel the...

232
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,153
I think you can say those words.

233
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,118
I was hoping writing them down
would help us remember them.

234
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,159
I'm just worried
that if you go through with it,

235
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,629
it's going to be too dangerous.

236
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,153
And that maybe...

237
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,835
This is really hard for me to say...

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,434
...but maybe you're being
a little selfish?

239
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,828
Selfish?

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,275
Yeah, because what if your rutabaga
keeps us from doing our job?

241
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,749
Keeps us from saving
innocent people?

242
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,876
I mean, what happens then?

243
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,429
Yeah, but what about me?

244
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,709
I mean, maybe you're right,
maybe I am being selfish,

245
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,711
but what's wrong with that?

246
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,314
I mean, when do we get to do
something for ourselves?

247
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,392
Haven't you ever wondered that,
or wanted that?

248
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,232
Yeah, absolutely.

249
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,915
But not at the expense of hurting
other people or each other.

250
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,758
Is that what you're afraid of,
getting hurt?

251
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,993
No, Piper, I'm afraid that you're
not afraid of getting hurt.

252
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,719
I've been through more pain in the
past two years than you can imagine.

253
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,394
And this is the only way to stop that.

254
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,279
Now, I'd like to do the right thing...

255
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,872
...but I also want to be with him.

256
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,072
- What is it?
- Our innocent.

257
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,030
And I think he was being attacked
by a coyote or a wolf.

258
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,873
All right, wait a minute.

259
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,431
I think that this looks like the place.
Sort of.

260
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,798
That's funny, I remember it looking like
the right place sort of three hours ago.

261
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,315
Okay, look, if you wanted
a supernatural LoJack,

262
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,630
you came to the wrong witch.

263
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,556
Wait, look.

264
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,156
That is where Christopher
was standing in my premonition.

265
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,993
What was that?

266
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,912
There he is.

267
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,149
Hey!

268
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,519
No!

269
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,399
- Okay, Piper, hurry up, freeze him.
- Wait.

270
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,231
We don't have much time, my love.
Someone's coming.

271
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,469
He's not attacking him.

272
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,636
Wait.

273
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,870
Christopher wanted us to talk to you.

274
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,268
He does?

275
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,908
I'm vamping. It's the only way
to get her to stop.

276
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,911
Look, we met him last night.

277
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,593
Right before he went
after the sorcerer.

278
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,958
We tried to stop him.
But without your help, he'll do it again.

279
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,634
And we both know
what will happen if he does.

280
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,789
He'll die.

281
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,478
How do I know that you
aren't working for him?

282
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,438
You don't.

283
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,429
You guys can't do it alone.
So you're just gonna have to trust us.

284
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,079
Trust is earned.

285
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,355
Okay, I hate to break up

286
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,476
the whole getting-to-know-you
portion of the program,

287
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,076
but what did Christopher mean
when he said someone was coming?

288
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,833
If Christopher went after him,

289
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,956
then he must have
sent someone after us.

290
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,633
Why?

291
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,075
Because he fell in love with me.

292
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,117
This...

293
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,078
This curse is my punishment
for not returning that love.

294
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,879
So woman by day
and wolf by night?

295
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,035
He's warning me.

296
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,316
We have to go.

297
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,708
All right.

298
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,469
- Where is he?
- That's the least of your problems.

299
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,518
Have we earned your trust yet?
Come on.

300
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,549
I swear to God I've seen this
in a movie somewhere.

301
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,119
Pheebs.

302
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,953
Upstairs, Book of Shadows,
curse search, way ahead of you.

303
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,758
Okay, you and I
are gonna go to the kitchen.

304
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,319
I'm fine, really. Let me help.

305
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,917
Look, you are tired and hungry.
Please, just let me help.

306
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,992
Want to take a Wiccan time-out
and do the crossword puzzle?

307
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,439
Piper, about what I said before.

308
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,795
- I didn't mean for...
- Yes, you did.

309
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,315
You never say anything
you don't mean.

310
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,753
You keep saying that it isn't
like what you'd imagined.

311
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,399
And I do understand your side of it.

312
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,758
I mean, I have never seen anyone
look at you the way Leo does.

313
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,354
And that is beautiful, and
you deserve that.

314
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,479
But I still... I...

315
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,676
I can't say that it's right.

316
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,757
And I wish that I were wrong.

317
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,036
And it's important
that you know that.

318
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,431
The problem is you're not.

319
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,319
There's truth to it, to what you said.

320
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,391
I can't deny that.

321
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,078
So unless both
Prue and you approve it...

322
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,117
...I won't go through with it.

323
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,718
We used to leave each other notes.

324
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,155
When this...

325
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,470
When this first happened,

326
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,870
I'd find them at sunrise
and I'd know.

327
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,157
I'd remember all the reasons
I loved him.

328
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,038
And then...

329
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,872
The letters stopped.

330
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,119
There's a limit, you know,
to how much any person can take.

331
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,589
I keep wondering...

332
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,958
You keep asking yourself...

333
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,917
Shouldn't love conquer all?

334
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,753
You know, this isn't fair.

335
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,151
It's hard enough to find somebody you
can spend the rest of your life with,

336
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,392
but when you constantly
have magic meddling...

337
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,834
I am so sick of it.

338
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,471
I mean, I've been through it,
you're going through it,

339
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,312
and now Brooke.

340
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,592
What love can't conquer, we will.

341
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,996
For everybody but ourselves.

342
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,279
Honey, the day is not over yet.

343
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,431
We're gonna need your help if
you want this to end happily ever after.

344
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,556
I know I could use a happy ending.

345
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,868
Do you come bearing gifts?

346
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,353
I come bearing victory.

347
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,353
That's an awfully small bag
for awfully large prey.

348
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,948
If you killed the right bird,

349
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,793
we'd be looking at a dead human
bleeding on my floor right now.

350
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,874
You're foolish or deceitful.
Either way, you failed.

351
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,548
- He had help.
- From whom?

352
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,472
A pigeon, perhaps?

353
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,915
Maybe a penguin to the rescue?

354
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,957
Witches! And now they're with her.

355
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,997
Their choice in company
is not relevant.

356
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,755
The fact that he still lives is.

357
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,990
I wanted blood in my hands.

358
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,833
I don't have his,
so guess I'll have to take yours.

359
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,631
Clean up, aisle two.

360
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,034
Congratulations.

361
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,428
You've just been promoted.

362
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,631
I took a job.

363
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,356
It was an established firm with a
reputation for promoting from within.

364
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,156
My boss was this odd man.

365
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,834
I'd worked for nightmares before,
but nothing like this.

366
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,156
He made moves...

367
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,595
...I made things clear...

368
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,199
...he made me this.

369
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,510
To keep you away from Christopher?

370
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,115
He said if he couldn't have me,
no one would.

371
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,078
Until there was a night within a day.

372
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,714
Or until I give in.

373
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,434
I never thought...

374
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,275
Magic was for kids' parties,
it wasn't real.

375
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,476
I didn't know.

376
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,234
We're still kind of
getting used to it ourselves.

377
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,432
But this...

378
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,079
This is my fault.

379
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,390
No, you said yes to a job,
not to a man.

380
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,869
But Christopher is being punished
because of me.

381
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,398
I did this to him.

382
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,118
That's not what he said.

383
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,077
He doesn't blame you for anything.

384
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,918
And he said...

385
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,910
How strong you are.

386
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,358
He said that?

387
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,348
He said that it's your strength
that he first fell in love with.

388
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,393
And he just needs to know
that you're not gonna give that up.

389
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,953
Anything, anything.

390
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,032
I curse you, you curse me.

391
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,795
Let's get together
and do a little cursing.

392
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,877
Okay, all right. You know,
I specifically asked for a...

393
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,519
You asked for an answer.

394
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,398
There it is.

395
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,879
I know that voice.

396
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,878
I should hope so.

397
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,555
Yours came through loud and clear,
so here I am.

398
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,392
Grams.

399
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,950
- Oh, I would hug you, but...
- I know.

400
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,712
It's just good to be here.

401
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,838
Yeah, and not that
I'm not thrilled by that fact.

402
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,911
But a little fuzzy on the why.

403
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,354
You need guidance.

404
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,636
Some advice on a certain
sister situation.

405
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,314
- Am I getting warm?
- Red hot.

406
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,517
But wait a minute, if you know,
that means that they know.

407
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,116
- And if they know, we are f...
- Fine.

408
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,510
Anyway, I'm beyond them now.

409
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,875
Secret's safe with me.

410
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,359
But what about you, Phoebe?

411
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,433
Do you want to tell me about that
nagging concern you have in your gut?

412
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,034
That's no fair,
you have afterlife advantage.

413
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,589
I also know you, Phoebe.
Talk to me.

414
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,308
Okay.

415
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,395
I want to be able
to support Piper in this.

416
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,155
I want to look at her
and I want to say, "Go for it."

417
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,030
But what if her and Leo
get "rutabagaed,"

418
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,713
and they find out,

419
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,438
and then something horrible
happens to them?

420
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,195
I mean, look what happened
to Mom and her special friend.

421
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,433
And I hate to go skipping
down selfish road...

422
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,238
...but what if, by association...

423
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,674
You or Prue get hurt?

424
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,829
Yeah.

425
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,468
I want to be supportive to her,
Grams, I really do,

426
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,518
but everything in my heart
is telling me that it's wrong.

427
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,033
All valid points.

428
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,112
But logic and reason go out
the window when love gets involved.

429
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,474
Yes, I know that, but...

430
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,438
The Charmed Ones
are destined for greatness.

431
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,751
But that fact doesn't keep a girl warm
on a cold winter's night.

432
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,559
So add a blanket. Grams,
I can't believe you're saying this.

433
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,358
I'm saying what I know.

434
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,795
I remember the Ioneliness
all too well.

435
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,393
You were married four times.

436
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,313
Well, that's because
I never found true love.

437
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,436
But maybe Piper has.

438
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,956
And when the time comes
for them to make it official,

439
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,633
they'll feel it.

440
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,028
They'll know.

441
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,316
- Phoebe?
- Coming.

442
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,758
Thank you.

443
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,556
- Pheebs, a little help here, please.
- Okay.

444
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,992
- Okay. He could have killed me.
- Us.

445
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,639
So the question is, why didn't he?

446
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,233
Because I don't want you.

447
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,628
I want the bird.

448
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,392
- Where is he hiding?
- No!

449
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,672
Oh, no.

450
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,231
Oh, baby.

451
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,351
He's gonna be all right.

452
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,239
I know that's the right thing for you
to say, but you don't know that.

453
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,073
Now all I can do is watch him die.

454
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,276
No, we can do a lot more than that.

455
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,749
You know I can't. Not now.
Not while they're watching.

456
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,672
Piper, this has absolutely nothing
to do with us,

457
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,512
and everything to do
with an innocent.

458
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,589
Leo, we...

459
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,228
I know. They told me
about the bad guys.

460
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,595
The vanquishing talk caught their ears,
not the other thing.

461
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,069
Leo's a healer.

462
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,553
I can't heal animals.

463
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,437
Well, we can't take him to the vet.

464
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,477
He's not exactly an animal.

465
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,037
He is until sunset.

466
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,758
So you're saying we have to wait.

467
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,189
I'm sorry.

468
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,636
He'll be okay.

469
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,396
1329 Prescott Street.

470
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,511
On the receipt.

471
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,272
In the bag.

472
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,589
It was there.

473
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,712
That sounded much better in my head.

474
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,032
They gave you our books,
and you thought you'd drop them by.

475
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,509
That wasn't so hard
when you said it.

476
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,148
I actually need the ones I bought,
so if you don't mind, I...

477
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,395
Of course you do. Okay.

478
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:49,630
Actually, you know,
my sisters sort of got into it today,

479
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,349
the place is a disaster,
looks like a bomb went off.

480
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,956
So if you don't mind just waiting here,
that would be great.

481
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,918
Hi.

482
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,672
So are you going back to the office?

483
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,752
Justice must be served, right?

484
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,713
Tell me about it.

485
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,199
Phoebe? Everything okay?

486
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,919
I was starting to get worried.

487
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,195
- Yeah.
- Hey.

488
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,313
- Cole, Leo. Leo, Cole.
- Nice to meet you.

489
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,908
Pleasure.

490
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,917
- Sorry to...
- No, no.

491
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,638
I was just leaving.

492
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,916
Really need to take care
of some business.

493
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,909
Whitelighters always were messy.

494
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,757
Report this.

495
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,197
Did you ever think?

496
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,750
Did you ever consider
that maybe it wasn't meant to be?

497
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,157
I mean, things happen
for a reason, right?

498
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,628
Maybe it's not worth the risk
to be together.

499
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,678
If you don't take the risk for love,
then what do you take it for?

500
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,911
Leo, wait.

501
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,113
Leo.

502
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,679
Wait.

503
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,829
You can't do that.

504
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,797
You cannot come in
to the end of a conversation

505
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,632
and assume that you know everything.

506
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,836
All right. Let's pretend
that I don't know anything, then.

507
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,149
Explain it to me.

508
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,719
I wasn't questioning you.

509
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,155
I was questioning our decision.

510
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,992
Then ask me your questions.

511
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,593
Don't you think I would like to?

512
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,513
Honestly, I don't know
what you're thinking.

513
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,758
Well, what I'm thinking is,
maybe Phoebe is right.

514
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,879
Maybe we're being selfish.
Our decision affects other people.

515
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,598
Other people that I happen to love.

516
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,716
- I love them too, Piper.
- I know.

517
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,154
I know that.

518
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,756
Look, you are the last person
I want to be fighting with right now.

519
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,276
- Then let's stop.
- Leo, if we get...

520
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,873
If you and...

521
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,996
Okay, let me try that again.

522
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,596
Brooke and Christopher
love each other very much.

523
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,478
But in the end, that didn't matter.

524
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,039
We haven't reached the end yet.

525
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,838
Have a little faith.

526
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,718
Don't you think this scares me too?

527
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,518
Don't you think
that I have my doubts?

528
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,636
- Do you?
- Of course I do.

529
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,076
What I'm trying to say is,
I know what Christopher must feel.

530
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,117
You know, always worried
about the timing,

531
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,032
about how he has to live his life.

532
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,474
Knowing what his true feelings are,

533
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,438
but unable to share those with
the one person that he has them for.

534
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,837
She knows.

535
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,195
But it doesn't fix everything.

536
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,828
You've gotta give it a chance.

537
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,560
Logic and reason go out the window
when love gets involved.

538
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,317
Wait a minute,
I thought you said that...

539
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,473
Yeah, well, I got a long-distance call
with some really good advice.

540
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,835
But we still haven't figured out
how to pull it off.

541
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,319
When the time's right, you'll know.

542
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,034
I'm sorry.

543
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,272
I'm sorry, I can't let you die.

544
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,715
Please forgive me.

545
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,870
Please forgive me.

546
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,399
That's quite a turnaround for you, sis.

547
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,551
- Who's your new confidante?
- Huh?

548
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,790
I think she means
your advice-giver?

549
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,157
It was just... Oh, my God.

550
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,514
Nice try, Pheebs,

551
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,875
but the distraction technique
stopped working in third grade.

552
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,838
No, it's not a technique.
It's an eclipse.

553
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,355
Look at it.
No, wait! Don't look at it.

554
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,748
Trust me.

555
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,708
I totally forgot that the eclipse
was today.

556
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,030
A night within a day.

557
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,351
- I'm sorry, please repeat.
- The curse. The eclipse.

558
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,798
"Until a night within a day,"
isn't that what Brooke said?

559
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,718
That's what's gonna
break the curse.

560
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,199
Prue, it's happening!

561
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,190
Leo, it just happened.
Please help him.

562
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,954
This proves the theory.
It's the eclipse.

563
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,275
You're not going anywhere.

564
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,829
- Brooke...
- Look, just rest, okay?

565
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,673
- We'll tell her while we...
- You can't, she's gone.

566
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,149
What do you mean gone?
She was in the kitchen when I left.

567
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,833
She's gone to him, hasn't she?

568
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,270
All right, we'll handle it
while Leo works on you.

569
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,189
Thank you.

570
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,713
I don't understand.

571
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,472
Why would Brooke go to him?

572
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,471
She didn't trust that you would
be able to save me,

573
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,675
but she knows that she can.

574
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,193
- How?
- The curse.

575
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,794
If at any time she agrees
to be with him,

576
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,473
and seals that pledge with a kiss...

577
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,039
She'll be forever bound.

578
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,796
- But the eclipse changes that.
- Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

579
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,595
If he's off the radar,
then he's more than failed.

580
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,990
Which leaves a space open
for one of you to fill.

581
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,597
And you do that by killing the owl!

582
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,756
I was hoping you would
take me instead.

583
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,276
Aren't you going to kiss me?

584
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,479
Brooke, I may be cheap
but I'm not easy.

585
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,950
No, wait. Yes, I am.

586
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,318
You're only doing this to save him,
aren't you?

587
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,959
That's okay.

588
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,712
It's quite obvious.

589
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,518
You know what?

590
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,557
I don't care.

591
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,790
You'll grow to love me.

592
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,355
I have your assurance that Christopher
will not be harmed again?

593
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,671
You have my love, isn't that enough?

594
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,232
T-minus and counting.

595
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,470
Then we get to break into Attica.

596
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,278
Well, we do have other choices.

597
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,759
We can climb the roof.

598
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,037
Or see if there's a convenient
and unguarded side entrance.

599
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,111
Or we could use
the Wonder Twin powers.

600
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,871
- I don't feel so...
- What is it?

601
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,996
I don't know. I don't have
a good feeling about this.

602
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,989
Wait a minute. I take that back.

603
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,789
I do have a good feeling about it,
about something.

604
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,110
I feel all warm and fuzzy.

605
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,316
- Is it your stomach?
- No.

606
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,199
It's here.

607
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,594
When the time is right,
you'll know.

608
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,228
Oh, my God. The time is right.

609
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,279
- The time for what?
- The wed... The rutabaga.

610
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,998
It's gotta be the eclipse.

611
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,993
If we can't look up, that must mean
that they can't look down.

612
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,431
This is it, this is it.

613
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,192
Okay, all we have to do
is get home and...

614
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,874
And do the ritual,
and let Leo know,

615
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,793
and call the florist,
and we gotta do...

616
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,428
- What's...? What?
- We've gotta get to Brooke.

617
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,592
Right, we've gotta get to Brooke
and then we gotta get home.

618
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,196
No, we only have time for one.

619
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,238
- So we either save Brooke...
- Piper, go home.

620
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,914
Of all people, I understand this,
all right, and so would Brooke.

621
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,116
I can handle this on my own.

622
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,717
No.

623
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,952
All right. We go in the front.

624
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,599
Oh, look, it's the Girl Scouts.

625
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,796
Set your Thin Mints down
on the table and leave

626
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,439
before you get yourselves hurt.

627
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,068
- Let her go.
- I have no fear of witches.

628
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,549
Maybe not, but how do you feel
about true love?

629
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,354
That's not possible.

630
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,993
If I can't have her, no one will!

631
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,678
Anyone got a vanquish in their pocket?

632
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,354
Oh, let's not get rid of him just yet.

633
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,158
I want him to watch this
for a little bit.

634
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,992
Okay, go ahead.

635
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,032
I don't know what to say.

636
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,474
How can we thank you?

637
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,959
You already have.

638
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,038
Oh, Piper, I think I have a solution
to the whole maid of honour thing.

639
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,679
Oh, me too.

640
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,796
What about our distinct lack
of a high priestess?

641
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,394
Would you please just let me
worry about that.

642
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,429
Girls, your high priestess is waiting.

643
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,910
Unfortunately, the eclipse is not.
Now, let's move it.

644
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,157
That would be your cue,
maids of honour.

645
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,149
You look beautiful.

646
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,153
I know it's not exactly
how you wanted it.

647
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,959
But it's exactly what I wanted.

648
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,872
Grams.

649
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,235
How could this happen?
What did we do?

650
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,389
Listen to me, darling.

651
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,675
It's going to be okay.

652
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,717
We will fix this.

653
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,952
We have to. This is all my fault.

654
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,076
He doesn't deserve to be...

655
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,471
Oh, I don't think I can do this.

656
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,959
You do good work.

657
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,272
To get close to the Halliwells
with no suspicion. Splendid.

658
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,399
And we were pleased that you
informed us of the witch's nuptials.

659
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,595
The pleasure was mine.

660
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,150
And the displeasure was theirs
when the information was shared.

661
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,436
You've gained useful knowledge
of the Charmed Ones.

662
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,352
Now you must gain their trust.

663
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,431
Others have failed.

664
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,352
Others weren't me.

665
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,080
So, what is next?

666
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,992
The wedding was child's play.

667
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,559
A perk, if you will.

668
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,792
I'm focusing my attentions
on Phoebe.

669
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,757
She's my way in.

670
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,797
You sent me up to find out
how to destroy them.

671
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,599
I'd say we're well on our way.
