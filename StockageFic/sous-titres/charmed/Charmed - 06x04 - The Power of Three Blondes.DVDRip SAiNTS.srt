1
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,340
It's okay, you're gonna be okay.

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:10,260
Okay? That demon wiped out
that whole family of innocents.

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,222
- How will I ever be okay?
- You learn.

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,682
If that demon
is anywhere in that Book,

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,727
I'm gonna nail his sorry ass.

6
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,147
Those poor children.

7
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,815
They were so scared.

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,776
I could feel their pain.

9
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,362
Okay, maybe you could
feel their pain a little less, Phoebe.

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,906
Remember, she's an empath now.

11
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:32,699
I know what her powers are.

12
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:37,287
Okay, I think a little sister bonding
is in order for all of us here.

13
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,622
- I'll get the tea.
- No.

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,499
Did you see that demon?

15
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:44,253
Did you see those teeth,
flying out like razor blades?

16
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,046
We need to kill that demon.

17
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,675
For the children.
All six of those children.

18
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,969
Fine, we'll hit the Book now, tea later.

19
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,906
- Told you it wouldn't work.
- Well, it's her fault.

20
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,617
Who's ever heard of a demon
with razor flying teeth before?

21
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,995
My fault? I'm not the one
who made the innocents

22
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,747
- into the von Trapp family.
- Did not.

23
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,459
- Did too.
- Knock it off.

24
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,796
It's my fault for going along
with you two.

25
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,133
We can look like the Charmed Ones,
but let's face it, our acting sucks.

26
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,970
If we want the Book of Shadows,
we need to become them.

27
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,222
It's time to try my identity-theft spell.

28
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,602
No way! They'll come after us.
It's a suicide mission.

29
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,812
And it's dangerous too.

30
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,356
So what? You wanna be
chiselers your whole life?

31
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,734
It's time to think big,
and thinking big means

32
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,445
making the whole world
believe that we are them.

33
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,990
I don't wanna be them.
I wanna be bad.

34
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,202
- Me too. Bad's better.
- Then stick with me.

35
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,246
Because once we get the Book,
we'll steal their powers

36
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,082
and then form our own power of three.

37
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:04,333
- And you know what that means.
- No.

38
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,627
- And you know what that means.
- No.

39
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,962
We'll be the untouchable sisters.

40
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,840
Phoebe, Paige, are you up there?

41
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,592
Perfume, girls.

42
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,228
What time did he go to sleep?

43
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,356
Okay, can you call me
as soon as he starts to stir?

44
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,400
Okay, thanks.

45
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,237
Jack, the band is coming in in an
hour to set up and do a sound check.

46
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,282
Can you take care of them? I wanna
be home when my baby wakes up.

47
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,327
- I'm on it.
- Hey. You ready for lunch?

48
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,997
I was thinking I can make you
something fabulous at home instead.

49
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,833
Piper, every new mommy
needs a little grown-up time.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,336
- That's why we got the nanny, right?
- Right.

51
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,713
So let's go...

52
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,758
Was that a moan?

53
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,887
- Piper!
- What?

54
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,184
That new bartender guy
is checking you out.

55
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,194
Are you telling me that you're feeling
what he's feeling for me?

56
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:42,324
Yes, I still can't control
my new power.

57
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,663
All right, that's it.
Take your shoes for a walk, buddy.

58
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,459
- That's creepy.
- I know, it's horrible.

59
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,254
You should have seen it
the last time Jason was in town.

60
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,256
I couldn't keep my hands off of him.

61
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,591
I don't know
what I'm gonna do this weekend.

62
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,636
Jason is flying in
from Hong Kong again?

63
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,222
Wow, I'd say that guy
is falling for you.

64
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,267
You think so? I think so. I hope so.

65
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,436
But all I can feel
is this strong sexual desire for me.

66
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,772
And that's a bad thing.

67
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,108
Yeah, it's a bad thing
if that's all he's feeling.

68
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:20,946
And if it is all he's feeling,
I want to know now so I don't get hurt.

69
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,990
Well, why don't you
take him to a restaurant,

70
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:27,160
where you can't get buck wild,
and ask Jason how he feels.

71
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,748
The direct approach.
Very sneaky of you.

72
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:35,878
And if that doesn't work, ask him
about the weather in Hong Kong.

73
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,882
- No.
- No. We're not demon hunting.

74
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,300
We're going to lunch.

75
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,344
Hey, I am not unreasonable.
We can hunt demons after lunch.

76
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,182
- By the way, anyone seen Leo?
- No, I have not.

77
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,184
- I haven't either.
- If you do, let me know.

78
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,020
There's a rumour that he has
a lead on who sent him to Valhalla.

79
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,856
I'm sure that's very important stuff,
but I have another question.

80
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,525
Did either one of you leave
the Book on the floor last night?

81
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,736
- On the floor?
- No, I didn't.

82
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,822
Chris?

83
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,284
I vaguely remember a story
that started like that in the future.

84
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,120
- Someone was after the Book.
- Demons are always after the Book.

85
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,122
- What's new?
- I think this time they get it.

86
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,875
You should take
this threat seriously. And tell Paige.

87
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,211
- Where is Paige?
- She's at her new temp job.

88
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,671
- She's still on that kick?
- It's not a kick, Chris.

89
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,633
It's her quest for happiness
outside of magic.

90
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:27,012
Yeah, but it's a temp job.
Who finds happiness on a temp job?

91
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,393
Straighten your back. You wanna
get out of bed in the morning?

92
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,312
Back straight. Check.

93
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:39,024
No, no, mira. Don't reach.
Let them come to you.

94
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,817
Okay.

95
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,070
Forget it. Keep the line moving.

96
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,031
Okay. How long have you been
working here, anyway?

97
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,784
Eight years and two herniated discs.

98
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,537
Didn't know what you were getting into
on this one, did you?

99
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,665
No, I can't say as I did. But it's fun.

100
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:57,543
You know, I get to work with my hands
and it's kind of like nature.

101
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,670
And best of all, there's no magic.

102
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,799
Markers, magic markers,
I'm crazy... Crazy allergic.

103
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,177
Oh, no.

104
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:08,804
Watch out!

105
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,520
Everybody okay over here?

106
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,481
She saved my life.

107
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,400
- It was nothing.
- All right, everybody,

108
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,569
take 20 till we can
perform a safety check here.

109
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,321
That is the third accident this month.

110
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:31,451
I think this place is maldito. Cursed.

111
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,746
I think I'm maldito.

112
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,296
I can't tell if anyone's home from here.

113
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,672
If I get Piper's powers,

114
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,383
first thing I'm gonna do
is freeze these unwanted facial lines.

115
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm the oldest, I get Piper's powers.
You'll get Paige's.

116
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:53,640
Well, in that case,
maybe I'll orb away this blemish.

117
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,518
Stakeout takeout, anyone?

118
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,188
All I asked for was a scrying bulb.

119
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,856
Just because
we killed the owners here

120
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,817
doesn't mean we
should let their food go to waste.

121
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:10,699
Give me sight though the blackest bile
Show me the faces I revile

122
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,996
Piper's the only one home right now.

123
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,082
We need all three sisters together
for my spell to work.

124
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:23,128
She's with the baby. I can't wait
to orb that thing into a volcano.

125
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,049
As the baby in the family,
I'm afraid I'll be doing the orbing.

126
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,511
- We get our powers by sorority.
- That's "seniority," Margo.

127
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,429
And that's not fair.
I wanted Paige's power.

128
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:36,183
Don't talk to me about fair.
I always got less growing up.

129
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,310
And usually two years out of style.

130
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,063
There's nothing wrong
with Phoebe's powers, Mitzy.

131
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,733
- You'll be able to levitate.
- Yeah, six feet in the air.

132
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,860
Margo will be orbing
around the world.

133
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,278
I'll send postcards.

134
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,657
Don't forget, you'll also have the
power of premonition and empathy.

135
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,993
Like I care what happens
to people or how they feel.

136
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,622
Maybe you should care, instead of this
"me, me, me" attitude all the time.

137
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,250
You're gonna get your teeth
knocked in if you don't back off!

138
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,460
Enough!
What is wrong with you two?

139
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:07,256
We have worked way too hard
to let it all fall apart now.

140
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,347
Hello, are you the lady of the house?

141
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,432
Go away.

142
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,310
This is the biggest con of our lives.

143
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,939
If we don't get this right, we're gonna
be two-bit magic hustlers forever.

144
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,108
Is that what you want?

145
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,864
But you haven't seen
the amazing new Kelby 3000.

146
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,950
- Just get inside.
- Okay, okay.

147
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:41,832
The secret of the Charmed Ones lies
in their sisterhood. The power of three.

148
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,084
Well, guess what.
We got our own sisterhood.

149
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,211
Our own power of three, right here.

150
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,673
If we can just stick together,
we can have it all.

151
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,759
You'll never have it all
until you own the Kelby 3000.

152
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,763
I'm telling you,
this baby is gonna change your...

153
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,976
So who's with me?

154
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,436
I'm sorry, sweetie.

155
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,230
Oh, me too.

156
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,608
I'll orb you anywhere you wanna go.

157
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,068
That's more like it.

158
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:15,240
Now, let's sit back,
relax until the other two get home.

159
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,871
All right, look, Mommy'll try it.

160
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,667
That's so horrible!
Wow, is that horrible.

161
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,297
Leo, what are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

162
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,468
I was looking for Chris.
I heard he was asking about me.

163
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:39,056
He was. He thinks you found
the person that sent you to Valhalla.

164
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,267
He does?

165
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,228
But he's not here.

166
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:49,149
But even if he was, I mean, why can't
you use your Elder powers to sense,

167
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,902
like you sensed me here with?

168
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:57,783
Sorry.

169
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,744
For missing your son? That's okay.

170
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,163
As an Elder,
I watch over him every minute,

171
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,040
but it's not the same, you know.

172
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:09,294
When he's sleeping, sometimes I orb
into the nursery just to hold him.

173
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,924
Yeah. Yeah.

174
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,593
- Piper, you home?
- I shouldn't have come.

175
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,350
- Sweetie.
- Dude, there are gremlins

176
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:24,685
at the fruit-packing plant.

177
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,771
And I am the only one who can
prevent serious workplace injury.

178
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,815
This is not what I planned.

179
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,942
You lost me at "fruit-packing plant."

180
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,861
It's my new temp job.

181
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,988
I keep trying to find
a life away from magic,

182
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,615
and all I get is magic,
magic, magic, everywhere.

183
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:43,412
Oh, don't worry, little dude,
I'm not gonna let the gremlins get you.

184
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,498
It's okay,
I think he just misses his dad.

185
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,002
I'm gonna go upstairs
and check in the Book of Shadows

186
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:53,005
and see what it says about
the capture and control of gremlins.

187
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:56,258
Did you leave the Book
on the floor last night?

188
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,509
No, why?

189
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,636
I don't know, it's probably nothing.

190
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,764
Just be on the lookout.
Chris said somebody may be after it.

191
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,850
People are after it every week.

192
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,768
You're okay, you're okay.

193
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,022
Fussy babies need fresh air.

194
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:12,524
Oh, that's a good idea.
I'll go get my sweater.

195
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,777
Nonsense. Let me take
the boy for a walk.

196
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,696
All right.

197
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,699
Just don't forget
a hat for those ears.

198
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,409
I always keep the baby warm.

199
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,119
I meant yours.

200
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,293
You are on a real hot streak, kiddo.

201
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,297
Your advice column has never been
more revealing.

202
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,466
Yeah, well, I just think
that I'm really in touch

203
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,635
with what other people
are feeling right now.

204
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,262
Whatever it is, keep it up.

205
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,938
Honey!

206
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:55,859
- You're back!
- God, I missed you, Phoebe.

207
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,241
Oh, no. No, no, not again.

208
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,952
- What's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong.

209
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,037
How was the weather in Hong Kong?

210
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,666
- Weather?
- Yeah, I hear it gets very balmy there.

211
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,627
- Balmy.
- I suppose.

212
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,255
You really wanna
talk about the weather?

213
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,382
No, I just don't wanna
be alone with you.

214
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:23,762
I mean, I do wanna be alone with you,
just not alone with you here, you know?

215
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:27,641
I just... I wanna be alone
with you in a public area.

216
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,980
You're still a little shaken up
over my last visit.

217
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,815
You know,
your behaviour wasn't all that...

218
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,776
Humiliating and embarrassing.
It was.

219
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:43,323
Yeah. I just would appreciate
if we could take things...

220
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,745
...slower, you know?
Maybe go out for dinner and talk.

221
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:50,789
I'll pick you up at 7.

222
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:52,624
Okay.

223
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,715
Can't wait to talk. Talk.

224
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,600
You know what this means.

225
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,394
It's spell time.

226
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,439
We got one shot, so pay attention.

227
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:19,985
After we read this spell, the world
will see us as the Halliwell sisters.

228
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:21,361
You mean I'm going brunette?

229
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,406
No, you'll look like you do now,
but the world will know you as Phoebe.

230
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,325
Let's go, let's go!

231
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:31,038
I'm dying to orb someplace far away
and exotic, like Fort Lauderdale.

232
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,458
Not so fast.
The spell only gives us their identities.

233
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,544
They keep their powers until
we can get to the Book of Shadows.

234
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,631
Which we should be able to do
once we lure them out of the house.

235
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,842
Okay, everyone ready?

236
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:52,100
"Blinking faces blank and ho-hum
We are they and they are no one

237
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:58,565
Grant to us the power of three
and turn them into nobody"

238
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,486
Did it work?

239
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:07,199
One way to find out.
Let's call our whitelighter.

240
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,535
Chris.

241
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:20,170
Why did you change clothes, Piper?
You can't hunt demons in heels.

242
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,172
Go switch your shoes
and we'll get started.

243
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,467
Hey, slow down there, angel.

244
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,595
It's all good in the charmed universe.
What's your hurry?

245
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,305
Paige, did you just call me "angel"?

246
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:36,311
She did. And I can clearly see why.

247
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:40,190
Okay. What are you doing
over here?

248
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:43,068
Oh, well, we were just...

249
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:50,868
Solving a murder. Evil has been here,
probably spying on us.

250
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,126
This could be connected to whoever
is after the Book of Shadows.

251
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,421
Could be. See that symbol
carved into the handle?

252
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,756
We think that
that represents the astral plane.

253
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,467
I don't know. The astral planes
are run with spirit and energy.

254
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,595
It's not like they manufacture
athames there.

255
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,306
All the more reason
you should orb over and investigate.

256
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,016
You want me to orb
to the astral plane?

257
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:17,519
Lmmediately. And don't come back till
you find out where that knife is from.

258
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:20,147
Can I have a kiss goodbye?

259
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,982
No.

260
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,028
Oh, well, girl's gotta try.

261
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:28,280
You know what this means.

262
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:32,743
We are charmed and dangerous.
Oh, yeah.

263
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,881
- Excuse me. Elise?
- Phoebe. I thought you left.

264
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,091
I did. Now I'm back.

265
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,761
That's not against the rules, is it?

266
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,095
What you got there?

267
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:55,724
It's a new article for tomorrow's paper.
I didn't like what I wrote before.

268
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,559
Is this crayon?

269
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,811
Eyeliner, actually. I didn't have a pen.

270
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,774
Well, it's a little late for new copy,
but I'll see what I can do.

271
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,734
Awesome.

272
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,695
I mean, thank you.

273
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,866
Phoebe. Thought you were
getting ready for dinner.

274
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,745
You are hot.

275
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,038
Are you okay?

276
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,166
Never better. Did you say
we were hooking up tonight?

277
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,835
I'll swing by at 7.

278
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,462
Great. I'll be ready for you, sugar.

279
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:47,693
I did not fire your band.
I need them to play tonight.

280
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:50,195
Today at rehearsal?
No, that's impossible.

281
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,197
I have been home all afternoon.

282
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,325
Okay, listen. I'll be right there.

283
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:56,994
I gotta go to P3,

284
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:59,830
so tell the nanny to give
Wyatt dinner if I'm not back in time.

285
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,540
Okay. Bye.

286
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:08,255
Okay, this vanquishing potion
is more like vanquishing goo.

287
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,299
Can you check
the last ingredient for me?

288
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:11,884
Sure.

289
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,805
- That was different.
- Try it again.

290
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,560
It's like it's not recognizing us.

291
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:25,689
Okay, that's weird, I was just holding
it in my hands ten minutes ago.

292
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,941
Wait, Chris said something
might happen to the Book,

293
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,985
remember, and we just
kind of blew him off?

294
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:32,571
Chris! Hello, are you there?

295
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:36,950
Is that you? Who is that?

296
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,827
Both of us.

297
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,871
- Hello?
- Hey, Elise.

298
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,040
There's a union rally
at the fruit-packing plant?

299
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,959
No, I did not advocate
multiple sex partners.

300
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,630
- I'm not leading the rally, I'm at home.
- I didn't say alcohol cures depression.

301
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,798
Of course I believe
in equal pay for workers.

302
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,009
- This is Phoebe. Hello?
- Hello?

303
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,471
- Emergency at work?
- Yeah.

304
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,765
- Unfortunate coincidence?
- Not likely.

305
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,934
I don't know about you,
but I wanna keep my job.

306
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,978
Yeah, me too. I'll leave a note
for the nanny, she's out walking Wyatt.

307
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,563
And I'll try to put the Book away.

308
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,692
I'm gonna change in case I don't make
it back in time for my date with Jason.

309
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,779
All right, meet back here
as soon as possible.

310
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:26,333
Hey, Ray, did the band leave yet?

311
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,001
I'm sorry, ma'am, we're not open yet.

312
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,129
- Very funny.
- You'll have to come back tonight.

313
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,842
Ray, I'm missing dinnertime with my
kid because the band cancelled, okay?

314
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,385
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

315
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,012
They didn't cancel,
the owner fired them.

316
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,431
Too bad, too, they were good.

317
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,016
You one of their groupies?

318
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:47,855
No, I'm your boss and
I'm gonna fire you if you don't move it.

319
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,817
Look, lady, there's a bar open up the
road if you really need another drink.

320
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:58,657
I have to admit, Piper, when you
said that there'd be fringe benefits,

321
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:02,494
- you weren't kidding.
- Oh, I'm all about job satisfaction.

322
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,873
- Yeah? What about after-hours?
- Yeah, so do I.

323
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,084
And you're gonna be
one sorry dude if you don't move!

324
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,631
You know what?
There's some work I have to deal with,

325
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,176
but I'll try to wrap it up early.

326
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,469
Why don't you come by the house
after your shift.

327
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,097
Like you could.

328
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,562
Why is Ray acting
like he doesn't know me?

329
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,772
Would you please tell him who I am?

330
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,609
Sure. Who are you?

331
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:40,657
Equal pay, shorter days.
Equal pay, shorter days.

332
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,334
What a circus.

333
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:53,253
Okay, get down! Quiet down!
Everybody quiet down!

334
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,381
I talked to my supervisor,
and he's replacing all of you

335
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,426
if you don't get your asses
back on that line!

336
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,678
You mean the line with
unsafe working conditions?

337
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,014
- Yeah!
- No medical benefits?

338
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,225
- Yeah!
- And third-world wages?

339
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,560
I don't think so.

340
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:13,690
Equal pay, shorter days.
Equal pay, shorter days.

341
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,067
May I help you, miss?

342
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:18,445
Oh, it's okay, I work here.
Who's that girl on the conveyor belt?

343
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,114
I'd like to see some ID, please.

344
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,787
- Who you steal this from?
- What are you talking about?

345
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,665
Come on, let's go.

346
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:38,632
Split up, fan out. Find the Book.
We don't have much...

347
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,342
I'm on to you three.

348
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,512
What do we do?

349
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,223
You thought you could fool me,
but you can't.

350
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,268
This athame
isn't from the astral plane.

351
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,894
You sent me on a wild-goose chase

352
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,981
so you wouldn't have
to hunt demons, didn't you, Piper?

353
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,775
- Busted.
- Guilty.

354
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,944
You figured us out, Chris.

355
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,115
We are so sorry.

356
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:05,993
Yeah, you should be.

357
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,078
Look, there's an evil
out there after Wyatt,

358
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:12,457
and we need to find him before he...
Phoebe, what are you doing?

359
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,501
Finding comfort in my whitelighter.

360
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,753
You're all over him.

361
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,464
You're just jealous
because I got to him first.

362
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:23,552
Look, Phoebe, I know Piper
hooked up with her last whitelighter,

363
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:28,182
but I'm really,
really not interested, okay?

364
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,058
Can we get back
to hunting demons, please?

365
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,686
Actually, Chris, we can't.

366
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:34,938
We didn't ditch you to play hooky.

367
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,358
We needed time to investigate
the death across the street.

368
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,444
Well, why didn't you
say so in the first place?

369
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:43,113
I would have given you time off
for legitimate charmed duties.

370
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,533
Well, we're asking now. We believe
that athame belongs to witches.

371
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,536
Really smart, pretty witches.

372
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,371
We just don't know who they are.

373
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,624
So why don't I check around
this realm for you.

374
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,709
It's like you read my mind.

375
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:59,796
See? I can be reasonable and helpful.
All you gotta do is be honest with me.

376
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:07,304
Okay, now we really are running
out of time. We need that Book.

377
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,890
You two search down here,
I'm gonna take upstairs.

378
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:14,686
And from now on,
keep your hands off the whitelighter.

379
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:16,980
That's an order.

380
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:41,171
Hurry. Hurry, before they get home!

381
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,884
This is it, this is what we want.

382
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:50,055
All right, who do you think you are?

383
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:53,308
Oh, you haven't heard?
We're the Charmed Ones.

384
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,519
Nice dress.

385
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,020
Thanks.

386
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,856
Nice Book.

387
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:04,027
- "Powers of the witches, rise"
- Hey, hey. I can't freeze them.

388
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:08,782
"Come to us, who call you near
Come to us and settle here"

389
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:14,788
Let's see, what was that
freaky little hand thing you did?

390
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,790
Like this?

391
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,085
Oh, I'm down!

392
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:30,971
Paige.

393
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:37,060
- I can still orb.
- That was supposed to be my power.

394
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:40,898
- Freeze them!
- I don't know how!

395
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:52,201
You guys gotta see this. There's spells,
potions, charms for everything.

396
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,913
Once we get rid of the Halliwells,
this Book is gonna change our lives.

397
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,666
You guys, my arm's getting sore here.
How about a little relief?

398
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,961
Never takes this long
to scry for a witch.

399
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:05,047
That's because
they're not witches anymore.

400
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:06,590
We got their powers.

401
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:12,554
Excuse me. You got their powers.
I got a big, fat nothing. As usual.

402
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:16,308
Margo, please.
Ease off the resentment pedal there.

403
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:17,726
You're dragging me down.

404
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:20,896
Oh, this is great: Vanquishing tips
on all of our competition.

405
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:23,815
Paige orbed.
How could she still do that?

406
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:25,651
We cast a spell
to call the witches' power.

407
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,903
Paige's orbing must come
from her whitelighter side.

408
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,530
Well, then, let's call for her
whitelighter's power.

409
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,948
Well, then, let's call for her
whitelighter's power.

410
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:36,036
- Because I wanna orb!
- Yo, Margo. Get over it already.

411
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,872
Your negativity
is giving me a migraine.

412
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,918
You think it's bad now? Just keep
flaunting that empath power at me.

413
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:44,586
I'll start hating on you for real.

414
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:48,882
- Hey, we're in here!
- We made the Book of Shadows?

415
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:52,761
What, no picture?

416
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:54,763
Just a paragraph.

417
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,517
A really, really tiny paragraph.

418
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:02,771
"The Stillman sisters:
Mabel, Mitzy, Margo.

419
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:06,233
Common witches known
for their small-time hustles and cons.

420
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,734
Not worth vanquishing.

421
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:12,489
If they become a nuisance,
try a simple spell to bind their magic."

422
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,201
Well, at least we got an entry.

423
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,370
Yeah, but look
at what they think of us.

424
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,622
Common witches,
not worth vanquishing?

425
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:24,459
Is that right? Well, check what
these common witches just did.

426
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:28,338
We're standing in the home of the
Charmed Ones. We got their powers.

427
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,466
We got their Book, and we got...

428
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:35,179
...blond, multi-tonal hair.
Who's the nuisance now?

429
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,848
- We are.
- Oh, yeah.

430
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:40,434
So let's use all these powers
and find the Halliwells.

431
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:43,562
We cannot rest until they're dead.

432
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,774
Phoebe's boyfriend.
She had dinner plans with him tonight.

433
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,402
Go. Margo and I will work on spells.

434
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:53,030
Wait, what?
Why does she get to go on a date?

435
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:55,073
We have to keep up pretences.

436
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,159
If Leo or Chris
find that we're impostors,

437
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:59,995
they're gonna send the entire
magical community after those girls.

438
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:03,248
And then we'll never find them. Go.

439
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:07,294
I felt that, Miss Blackheart.

440
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,840
Let's get to work.

441
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:20,307
Okay.

442
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,559
Okay.

443
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,147
Let's see what we got here.

444
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,358
This... You all right?

445
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,318
- Yeah.
- You sure?

446
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:34,029
Oh, it's really bad.
It's really, really bad.

447
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:35,280
Okay, just do what you can.

448
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:38,408
We have to get back
to the manor fast, for Wyatt.

449
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,495
They're not gonna hurt Wyatt.
They won't risk exposure.

450
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:42,830
Not while we're still alive.

451
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,414
How are we gonna stay alive?

452
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,250
How are we gonna fight
without our powers?

453
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,919
- At least you could still orb.
- I wish you could orb to Leo.

454
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:52,047
I'd give anything for one
of his unwanted visits right...

455
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:54,466
Piper, we should
get you to the doctor.

456
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,051
- No.
- Why?

457
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:59,847
The same reason we paid cash for this
room: Because without picture IDs,

458
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:03,016
we got no credit cards, we got
nothing. It's like we don't exist.

459
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,935
Everyone thinks we're
these trashy blonds.

460
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:06,603
I do have to hand it to them, though.

461
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,981
They've taken identity theft
to a whole new level.

462
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,482
What about Chris?

463
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:14,236
What if we get him in the same room
with the blond ones?

464
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:15,946
Then we can prove to him
they're fakes.

465
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:19,658
How? He can't hear our call. Going in
the manor right now would be suicide.

466
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:23,453
Wait a minute. I have an idea.

467
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,123
Maybe we can find some
magical creatures to help us,

468
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,417
like fairies or muses.
What do you think?

469
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:32,337
We won't be able to see them.
We're not witches anymore.

470
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:37,259
You're not, you can't see them,
but I'm still half whitelighter.

471
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:38,844
And I actually happen to know

472
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:41,805
where a couple of handy-dandy
gremlins like to hang out.

473
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:44,308
You mean
the fruit-packer-killing variety?

474
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:46,476
No, no, no.
This could actually work.

475
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:49,271
Gremlins are fast, right?
They can move between realms.

476
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:50,981
They could actually
help us find Chris.

477
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:53,025
- What if they say no?
- Well, if they say no,

478
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:56,403
then I'll just have to threaten their
little butts with my vanquishing gel.

479
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,615
Okay, Paige, you orb to
the plant and find those gremlins.

480
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,783
Chris has gotta be back
at the manor by midnight.

481
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,369
- Piper, stay here where you're safe.
- Where are you going?

482
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:08,373
I'm going to hand out
a personal invitation.

483
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:22,387
Hey, now!
Who did you knock off for this?

484
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:27,935
Oh, it's nothing. There's so much
that I want for us, Phoebe...

485
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:29,436
How many carats are these?

486
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:33,315
Miss, could we have
a wine menu here, please?

487
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,567
Sure.

488
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:38,320
Hey.

489
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:42,950
You just earned yourself
a big, fat thank-you.

490
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,411
Better get that.

491
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:49,748
Phoebe, what are you
doing under the...?

492
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:53,502
My wife was wondering
if you have any champagne.

493
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:54,962
How dare she.

494
00:29:55,128 --> 00:30:00,968
I only drink it on special occasions.
This is our 42nd wedding anniversary.

495
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:02,469
You slut!

496
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:08,433
Can l...? Can I talk to you, Phoebe?
Up here, where I can see your face?

497
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,856
Today you said you wanted to talk.

498
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:16,400
And now you're groping me
under the table. What's going on?

499
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:20,946
Well, if you didn't interrupt me,
you would have figured it out.

500
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:24,783
Look, Phoebe, maybe
you got the wrong guy here.

501
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:28,328
Because this isn't what I'm about.

502
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:31,039
Really?

503
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:32,791
Do you really mean that?

504
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:34,209
Who are you?

505
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:36,628
She's nobody, baby.
Let me take care of this.

506
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:38,755
Listen, sweetie, l...

507
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:44,094
Lady, what the hell's going on here?

508
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:49,308
I'm so sorry, I thought she was
someone else. I'm sorry. Sorry.

509
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:55,647
Hey, little blue fellas!
Come on out, I won't hurt you.

510
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,489
Hey, will you slow down for a second?

511
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:06,700
I have an offer
I'd like to discuss with you.

512
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,333
What's it gonna be?

513
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,099
Piper?

514
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,230
What are you doing?

515
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:37,523
Isn't it obvious?

516
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,192
Yeah.

517
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:42,361
But in front of our son?

518
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:44,321
The lights are off.

519
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:49,201
I think I'd better go, Piper.
I'll see you tomorrow at work.

520
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:51,912
No. Wait.

521
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,330
Oh, man.

522
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:56,875
Look what you did. Aren't we,
like, divorced or something?

523
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,460
What are you doing here?

524
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:02,214
I told you, sometimes I visit Wyatt
in the nursery to hold him.

525
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,675
It's the only chance
I get to spend any time with him.

526
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:08,053
You know what? You're right.
I'm a terrible mother.

527
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,055
I don't deserve our son,
you should take him.

528
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:12,724
Careful, I just might.

529
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:14,560
Great, it's settled. He's yours.

530
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:18,230
Piper, what's the matter with you?
You're not acting like yourself.

531
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,401
I'm sorry, Leo.

532
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:26,113
I just think I'm just postpartum.

533
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,615
I've just been
so tired and overworked.

534
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:33,537
It would really help out if you could
take Wyatt off my hands for a while.

535
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:35,205
Please?

536
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:46,091
Don't worry about the bartender.
We've got bigger fish to fry.

537
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:56,852
Okay, if the gremlins found Chris,
he should be here by now.

538
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,354
Well, he'd better hurry.

539
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:02,024
Okay, this is not good.

540
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:04,109
Okay.

541
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:10,532
You Charmed Ones
think you're so clever.

542
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:14,328
Surprised to see us?
I got my first premonition tonight.

543
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:18,123
I know you did, you genius.
I planted it to lead you here.

544
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:23,712
Well, from where I'm standing,
that seems like a stupid thing to do.

545
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:26,423
And I know a lot about stupid things.

546
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,383
Yeah, see, she's got us there.

547
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:30,886
You wouldn't happen to know
any gremlins, would you?

548
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:33,180
- It's about time.
- Chris, thank God. Look at them.

549
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:35,265
Look at them, they're impostors.
They stole...

550
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:37,976
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
Who are you?

551
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:42,231
They're witches. They're the ones
that killed that guy across the street.

552
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:44,149
No, Chris, she's lying.
Remember this morning,

553
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:46,235
you said something
was gonna happen to the Book?

554
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:47,778
This is it, it's happening now.

555
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:50,155
Enough of this. Piper, blast them!

556
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:52,241
How do you know what I said to Piper?

557
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:55,369
Because she is Piper.
And I'm Paige, and this is Phoebe,

558
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:58,872
and they cast an identity spell to make
the entire world think they're us.

559
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,836
That's ridiculous. Everyone knows
the Charmed Ones are blond.

560
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:08,632
If you're Piper, then show
me your powers. Blast me.

561
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:12,177
I can't. You stole them.

562
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:16,306
Okay, so we stole
your identities and your powers.

563
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:18,517
Wow, we must be good.

564
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:22,145
- Worth more than a paragraph.
- Oh, yeah.

565
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:25,941
It's time to take care of
you witches and your delusions.

566
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:28,694
Wait! Wait.

567
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:31,238
I can prove that we're telling the truth.

568
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,073
I can still orb, I'm half whitelighter.

569
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,659
Okay. Go for it.

570
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:41,665
Okay.

571
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:47,379
What do you think
of my anti-orb spell?

572
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:49,256
Oh, you...!

573
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:51,091
Go ahead, Piper, blast away.

574
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:56,263
She missed, Chris. When have
you ever known Piper to miss?

575
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,140
Even I'm entitled to a bad day.

576
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,350
Come on, try again.

577
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:03,270
Chris, a little help here?

578
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:05,272
Oh, you know what,
she's getting angry.

579
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:07,482
And our powers don't work so good
when we're angry.

580
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:09,693
- We got them now.
- Yeah, you got us now,

581
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,320
so why don't you blow us up.

582
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:12,905
Piper, death bad, life good.

583
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:16,158
Don't worry, this bimbo couldn't hit
the broad side of a beauty parlour.

584
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:18,577
Check out that dye job.

585
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:19,912
How dare you!

586
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:25,542
Run.

587
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:31,006
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
we need weapons.

588
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:33,091
- Demon leftovers!
- Okay.

589
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:36,386
- Oh, Piper, Piper, for you.
- I got it.

590
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:38,680
- Okay, ready?
- Yes.

591
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,014
- Okay, ready?
- Yes.

592
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:45,854
Now!

593
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:52,069
So that's how it works.

594
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:55,906
Could we, like,
not stand here right now?

595
00:35:58,325 --> 00:35:59,409
Now what?

596
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:01,203
Now we kill them.

597
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:06,875
You did it. Nice work, babe.

598
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:12,172
This is not fair!

599
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:14,508
First I get ripped off
in the power department.

600
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:19,680
Then you bag the bartender and the
boyfriend lays diamonds on you.

601
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:22,891
- That whitelighter belongs to me.
- Oh, my head!

602
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,978
You know, you really need
to learn how to control your emotions.

603
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:27,855
I can't help it that Chris chose me.

604
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:29,189
Did you sleep with him?

605
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:30,399
- No.
- Yes.

606
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:34,236
You did what? I gave you a direct
order. That whitelighter was off-limits!

607
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:39,741
You know what? I am sick and tired
of your orders. We both are.

608
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:41,410
Stay out of my feelings.

609
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:43,370
Oh, are those your feelings?

610
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:47,541
Hell, yes, those are my feelings.
You boss us around like we're idiots.

611
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:51,587
What? She thinks we are idiots.

612
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:53,422
- I didn't say that.
- I bet she felt it.

613
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:57,426
- My little empath feels everything.
- He's right. You despise us.

614
00:36:57,593 --> 00:37:01,763
In fact, until I became an empath,
I never realized how you truly hate us.

615
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,516
You know what? Come on, baby,
let's go. Who needs them?

616
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:05,893
You're not going anywhere.

617
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,061
We gotta stick together
or our plan falls apart.

618
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,105
See? There you go, bossing again.

619
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:14,610
Just let the little chippy run off,
if that's what she wants.

620
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:16,987
Don't call me a chippy!

621
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:18,655
Don't push me!

622
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:21,116
Just shut up!

623
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:32,753
You should be able
to handle these women now.

624
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:39,843
Not the nose, please.

625
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,137
I think you have
something that's mine.

626
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:45,098
Sure, it's yours.
Anything you want.

627
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:46,433
Thank you.

628
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:51,271
I take it this was all your doing.

629
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:52,814
You're the one who got me here.

630
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:54,316
How did you know they weren't us?

631
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:56,944
Well, in all my life, I've never
seen you take the bait

632
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,446
the way that witch took it from you.

633
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:03,659
In all your life? You've only been
our whitelighter for two months.

634
00:38:03,826 --> 00:38:05,452
Let's just reverse the magic.

635
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:11,041
"Powers of the witches, rise
Course unseen across the skies

636
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:15,128
Come to us, who call you near
Come to us and settle here"

637
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:34,606
So we binded their powers
and handed them over to Morris.

638
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:37,442
There's enough evidence across
the street to book them for murder.

639
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,612
And if that doesn't stick,
they're wanted in eight other states.

640
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,324
Looks like you two had a good time.

641
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:46,869
Yeah. He loved
all the clouds up there.

642
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,745
I bet.

643
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:55,419
Well, he just finished a bottle.
He's probably ready for a nap.

644
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:58,881
I should get going.

645
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:00,632
Leo, wait.

646
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:03,135
Don't go too far away
from Wyatt, okay?

647
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:07,848
I mean, feel free to sneak in
and hold him any time I'm not around.

648
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:10,392
Thanks.

649
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:15,314
Leo, can I talk to you for a second?

650
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,983
See you, buddy.

651
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,948
There's a rumour
floating around up there

652
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:27,743
that you got a lead on whoever
scattered your orbs.

653
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:31,622
Yeah, I know. I floated it.

654
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:33,540
You did?

655
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:35,834
Why?

656
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:38,337
To draw out the guilty party.

657
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:41,340
- Did it work?
- You tell me.

658
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:44,593
So far, you're the only one
to come forward with any questions.

659
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,222
It's an interesting experiment. When
you find out who did it, let me know.

660
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:52,267
Oh, I already know who did it, Chris.

661
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:55,562
And when I get enough proof
to expose him...

662
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:59,316
...you'll be the first one to know.

663
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,781
I don't know why I keep running
into magic, but thanks to you two,

664
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,409
I have my identity back
and the fruit packers are unionized.

665
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:12,412
So for now, I'm just gonna go with it.

666
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:14,748
However, you two
can't hurt people anymore.

667
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:16,250
That's why I brought you here,

668
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,877
so you can tinker away
to your heart's content.

669
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:23,423
Well, have at it, little blue dudes.

670
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:39,940
- Hi.
- Hi.

671
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,195
Can we talk?

672
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:47,614
- About?
- Us.

673
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:51,702
I thought we tried that earlier.

674
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:55,539
I was kind of hoping
we could forget about that.

675
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:58,041
Okay.

676
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:04,173
- You're still mad.
- No, no, actually, I'm confused.

677
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:07,885
I swear, every time I see you, I never
know which Phoebe I'm gonna get.

678
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:10,012
- You either wanna talk or you want...
- Yeah.

679
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:12,973
I know.

680
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,476
But I don't know
how to act around you either.

681
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:19,438
You know, you fly in for a few days,

682
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:21,982
and we're supposed to squeeze
everything that we're feeling

683
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:24,943
for each other
in those few days, and it's just...

684
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:28,238
It's just really hard.

685
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:31,158
I know.

686
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:34,953
And that's why I wanted
to go to dinner, you know.

687
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,165
Just so we could talk.

688
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:42,169
Figure out how we feel
about each other.

689
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:47,549
How's your nose?

690
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,635
My nose?

691
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,804
Oh, yeah, my nose.

692
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,765
It's pretty good.

693
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:56,683
I'm a fast healer.

694
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:02,314
Well, I should probably
let you get back to work, huh?

695
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:04,107
What are you doing right now?

696
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:05,734
Trying to make a classy exit.

697
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:08,654
You wanna go to a classy lunch?

698
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,323
We'll just...

699
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,158
We'll talk.

700
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,327
I'd love to.

701
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:26,964
- Jason.
- Yeah.

702
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,174
Thanks for my diamonds.
