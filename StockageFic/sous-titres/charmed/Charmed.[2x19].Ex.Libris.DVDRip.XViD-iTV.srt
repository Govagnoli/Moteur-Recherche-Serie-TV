1
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:25,645
Piper?

2
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:31,007
- Expecting company?
- You think? What are you doing here?

3
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:33,558
I was supposed to have
the house to myself tonight.

4
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,684
God, I thought that that
was tomorrow night.

5
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:39,409
No, I put it on the kitchen calendar
way in advance.

6
00:00:39,569 --> 00:00:41,002
That's why Phoebe's at the library,

7
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:42,966
and you're supposed to be
out on assignment.

8
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:44,807
Yeah, well, I was all day.

9
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,757
I was just downstairs in the basement
developing these shots that I took.

10
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:50,925
Actually, I was hoping
to get your opinion on them.

11
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:53,000
But I guess now wouldn't
be a good time, would it?

12
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:54,682
No.

13
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:58,729
- Although, Leo's not really here yet.
- All right, make it fast.

14
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,681
Okay.

15
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:05,602
All right, so the magazine asked me
to capture faces in the city.

16
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:08,237
So I went to the Haight
and I took these shots,

17
00:01:08,449 --> 00:01:11,009
- but look at this man.
- Yeah, so?

18
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:14,206
So he is in every single one
of my pictures.

19
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,320
I mean, I didn't really focus on him.

20
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:18,366
I didn't even notice him
until I got home.

21
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:22,442
But, I mean, there he is
in all of them, just hanging out.

22
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:26,124
- Well, maybe he's homeless.
- Handing out flyers? I don't think so.

23
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:27,318
And look at his face.

24
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:30,686
I mean, he looks so sad
and determined.

25
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:36,637
Okay, bye-bye.

26
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:45,166
All right, so I'm gonna go now,
and I'll be downstairs

27
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:46,597
and work all night long.

28
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:49,158
And I'll be really quiet.
You don't have to worry about me.

29
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:51,763
- Okay.
- So no sex without safe sex.

30
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:53,846
- Thanks.
- Okay.

31
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,560
By the way,
on the kitchen counter,

32
00:01:56,769 --> 00:01:59,283
there's a birthday card for Dad
if you wanna sign it.

33
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:01,599
I don't. Night, Leo.

34
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:03,083
Good night.

35
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:06,917
That's weird. I wonder why
she doesn't wanna sign...

36
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:08,488
Hi.

37
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:15,283
You wanna sit down?

38
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:19,245
Why don't we go upstairs,
since she's downstairs?

39
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:21,758
Okay. I know a faster way.

40
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,960
- You do?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:48,405
- I'm sorry.
- I won't tell if you won't.

42
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:53,117
- Hey. Hi, I'm Phoebe.
- I'm Charlene.

43
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,325
Actually, we've met,
we even carpooled.

44
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:57,440
Metaphysics 301, remember?

45
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:00,169
That's right. And your dad
is the professor of that class, right?

46
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:02,718
Yeah, he's a dirty rat.
He gave me a C.

47
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:06,040
We don't get along, in anything,
even metaphysics.

48
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:07,841
But I'm hoping that will change.

49
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:10,079
I'm gonna finish my thesis,
get published.

50
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:12,604
He'll finally have to
take me seriously.

51
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:15,488
Run quick, before I start
telling you about my mother.

52
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:17,645
No, it's okay. I've been
studying here for so long,

53
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:20,039
it's nice to have someone to talk to.

54
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:21,528
So, what's your thesis about?

55
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:23,566
It's about the existence
of demons in our world.

56
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:27,240
- Demons?
- Yeah, I've been researching

57
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:30,162
for five years to prove they're not
just myths, like my dad thinks.

58
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:32,325
That they actually really exist.

59
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:33,882
I've got proof right here.

60
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:38,401
- That's very interesting.
- But you believe in them, don't you?

61
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,208
I mean, you seemed to in class.
Certainly knew a lot about them.

62
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:47,369
It's really late, and I really
gotta go. Okay.

63
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,400
It was really nice
talking to you, Charlene.

64
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,480
- Take care, okay?
- Okay, see you around.

65
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:56,446
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

66
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,639
I'm sorry. You scared me.

67
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,077
Wait.

68
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:22,167
Hey, Piper.

69
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:24,923
Will you do me a favour
and feed the cat?

70
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:28,240
I wanna get down
to the Haight, you know.

71
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:30,400
I wanna see if that guy
is still on the bus bench.

72
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:34,727
You know, I just could not
stop thinking about him all night.

73
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:37,403
I mean, there's no guarantee
that he'll actually be there,

74
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:39,366
but if he is, I wanna
get a better shot.

75
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,243
Prue.

76
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:45,446
- What...? What are you doing in here?
- Piper, can you hand me a towel?

77
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:47,958
- Prue.
- Leo.

78
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:53,248
Nice orbs.

79
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,839
Okay, bye.

80
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:58,678
Bye. Out.

81
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,967
Let me help you,
let me help you. All right.

82
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,245
Go on, sicko.

83
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:17,042
Phoebe.

84
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:21,564
It's 8:00. It's 8:00.
I'm late for my finals.

85
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:23,646
Phoebe, relax.

86
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:25,765
It's Thursday.
Your finals are tomorrow.

87
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:27,760
- It's Thursday?
- Yes.

88
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,119
Today is Thursday. You sure?

89
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:32,206
Okay, that's really good news.

90
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,325
Please tell me you didn't do
another all-nighter.

91
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:36,248
- I can't.
- Phoebe.

92
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,599
What? Piper, what am I
supposed to do?

93
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:40,282
- Hi, Leo.
- Hey.

94
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,599
If I don't ace this final,
I'm gonna flunk out of school

95
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,839
because of all the
demon-hunting interruptions.

96
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:47,609
Still, Phoebe, you have to take care
of yourself. Get some rest.

97
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:51,678
After. Piper, I did not go back
to college to fail at it, okay?

98
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,604
So, what do I have to do?
Okay, I'm gonna go change,

99
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,521
and then I'm gonna go to the library.

100
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:03,286
Now, if any demon or warlock attacks,
please, just fend them off till Saturday.

101
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:05,438
I have a question for you.

102
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:10,082
Is it possible for someone to find proof
that demons really do exist?

103
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:12,080
I don't know, maybe.

104
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:14,479
But even if anybody did,
nobody would ever know about it.

105
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,799
- What do you mean?
- Evil doesn't want anybody to know.

106
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:20,325
It has a system for covering
its tracks, protecting its identity.

107
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:22,957
That's why demons disappear
when you guys vanquish them.

108
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:26,519
Why do you ask?

109
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:27,883
Just curious.

110
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,961
- Okay, adíos.
- Wait, Phoebe.

111
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:33,527
Don't you wanna sign
Dad's birthday card?

112
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,521
Why? He never sends me one.

113
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:40,048
She's right.
He doesn't to any of us.

114
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:41,528
So why do I keep trying?

115
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:44,999
- I'm just a sucker for punishment?
- No.

116
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:47,808
You keep trying
because you never give up hope.

117
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:50,085
That's one of the things
I love about you.

118
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:52,968
You never gave up on us.

119
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:55,165
Were you close to your dad?

120
00:08:56,929 --> 00:09:00,001
Well, that was a long time ago.

121
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:02,125
Different lifetime.

122
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:04,849
I prefer to focus on the present.

123
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:07,762
So do I, which means I have to go.
I have a dentist appointment.

124
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:10,124
- How long can you stay?
- Till they call.

125
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:12,962
If they don't call before lunch,
why don't you meet me at the club?

126
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:14,323
- I'll buy.
- You'll have to.

127
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:16,724
Whitelighter pay sucks.

128
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:31,642
Hi.

129
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,208
My name's Prue Halliwell.

130
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:35,007
Cleavant Wilson.

131
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:39,157
I'm a photographer
with 415 magazine.

132
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:41,599
I'd like to know if it's okay
if I take your picture.

133
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,282
- Why?
- We're doing a feature

134
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:46,401
called "Faces in the City,"
and I would love to include yours.

135
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,204
I'm not interested.

136
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:56,157
Although, I would appreciate it
if you would include this one.

137
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:58,888
"Tyra L. Wilson."

138
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:00,522
My daughter.

139
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:03,681
She was murdered six and a half
months ago here waiting for the bus.

140
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:06,443
I'm looking for a witness.

141
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:13,125
That's why you were sitting here
all day yesterday.

142
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:14,722
That's why I'm here every day.

143
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:17,887
I have been since
the police quit on us.

144
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:21,598
I'm not leaving until I find somebody
who saw what happened.

145
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,448
How can you be sure that you will?

146
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:26,920
I will.

147
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:29,284
I have to be sure.

148
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:32,482
So are you gonna print that or not?

149
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:36,720
Actually, it's not really up to me.

150
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:43,161
I'm just looking for a witness.

151
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:44,398
Just looking for a witness.

152
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,885
Sir, I'm looking for a witness.

153
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:49,125
You don't have to be afraid
to come forward.

154
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:59,648
- What?
- You two must've been very close.

155
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:03,044
She was my daughter.

156
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:04,881
It doesn't get any closer.

157
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:10,639
You know, I have a friend,

158
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:13,926
a really good friend,
who's an inspector.

159
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:17,081
You know, maybe I can call them,
see if they have any ideas who did it.

160
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:19,280
I know who did it.

161
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:22,566
The punk that owns that pawnshop
across the street, Gibbs.

162
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:28,962
He killed my little girl.

163
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:32,280
- Why?
- Wrong place, wrong time.

164
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:34,886
Everybody knows he did it.

165
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:37,523
Problem is, he's got everyone
too afraid to talk.

166
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:59,839
Hey! Hey!

167
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:02,318
Hey! Hey!

168
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,879
All right, you first.

169
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,608
What the hell is going on here?

170
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:11,327
Don't ask me,
he came in here punching.

171
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,406
Dan did?
Well, what did you do to him?

172
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,442
- What did I do? Nothing.
- Come on. He had to have a reason.

173
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,521
Like losing you isn't enough reason.

174
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:21,439
All right, back
to your position. Go on.

175
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,602
You kidding me?
He's about to clock me.

176
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,039
I'm sorry, I can't help you
with that. Let's go.

177
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:27,998
Let's go.

178
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:38,206
Piper, where did you come from?

179
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:40,798
I'll be asking the questions.
What the hell is going on?

180
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:43,728
- I don't know, why don't you ask him?
- I did... I mean, I will.

181
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,607
I'm asking you first.

182
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:50,322
- You know what? I just gotta go.
- Dan, wait.

183
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:54,159
Oh, no, you don't. They can wait.

184
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:56,325
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Leo.

185
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:09,964
Agent Cucushny, at this time, we need
you to return to homequarters.

186
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:18,600
Excuse me.

187
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,566
Excuse...

188
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:24,284
Darryl.

189
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:33,806
Don't tell me. Demons, right?

190
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:35,687
Or is it warlocks this time?

191
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:39,645
- What are you talking about, Darryl?
- You're not here because of this?

192
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:42,044
No, Darryl, contrary
to popular belief,

193
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:44,677
not every crime in the city
is demonically related.

194
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:47,158
Or Halliwell-related, for that matter.

195
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:48,603
I was on my way to the library.

196
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:50,288
- What happened?
- College student.

197
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:52,639
She was decapitated
and her body was dumped here.

198
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:55,165
College student. Any idea who?

199
00:13:57,849 --> 00:13:59,726
Charlene Hughes.

200
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:01,561
Charlene.

201
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:03,447
You know her?

202
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:07,800
I saw her last night in the library.

203
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:28,279
Hey, Phoebe.

204
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:32,439
Do you have an aspirin?
I have a splitting headache.

205
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:34,128
Charlene.

206
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:37,397
You're supposed to be...

207
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:39,648
I'm supposed to be what?

208
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:57,606
Okay, just tell Dan
that I called again, okay?

209
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:00,841
No, believe me, he knows
what it's about. Thank you.

210
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:04,044
- They're both ducking me.
- Who both?

211
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:06,126
- What happened in here?
- Dan and Leo.

212
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:08,928
I found them in here
beating the crap out of each other

213
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:11,045
and neither one of them
will tell me why.

214
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:14,324
Well, I hate to top that,

215
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:17,083
but I am dealing with a ghost
who doesn't know she's a ghost.

216
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:19,086
She thinks she's still alive.

217
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:22,440
Charlene, she's a student
that I know, or knew.

218
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,804
The police found her body
behind the library,

219
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:27,079
about 20 feet away from her head.

220
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:29,405
So I went back to the library,
and I saw her ghost.

221
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:32,681
You know? And I tried to tell her,
but I just couldn't.

222
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:35,477
You're right. Yours tops mine.

223
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,920
I just don't get it. How could someone
not know that they're dead?

224
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,002
Well, it takes them a while to accept it,
to get over the shock.

225
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:48,168
Why today of all days?
I have got to study.

226
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:51,119
Hey, I know. Maybe you could
help me out with this one,

227
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,166
and then I could take
the next two ghosts, okay?

228
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,200
Nice try, Pheebs,
but you know how this works.

229
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:57,286
That ghost came to you
for a reason,

230
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,561
and more than likely it's to get justice
for her murder so she can move on.

231
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:03,681
The other thing, I think
a demon actually killed her.

232
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:06,727
Oh, and you were gonna
pawn this off on me.

233
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:10,086
Well, no, I was gonna tell you
about the demon part sooner or later.

234
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:13,686
But remember what Leo said
about evil covering up its tracks?

235
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,965
I think that's what happened
to Charlene.

236
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:19,326
She was convinced that she found
proof that demons really do exist.

237
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:21,957
Well, then you have to get her
to tell you what that proof was.

238
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:24,444
But first you're gonna
have to tell her that she's dead.

239
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,759
I know. That's the problem.

240
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:29,604
How do you tell someone
that their life is over?

241
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:36,443
Darryl.

242
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:39,885
See, I knew I was right the first time.

243
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:41,721
You guys don't give me
nearly enough credit.

244
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:43,322
Credit?

245
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:45,127
First Phoebe, now you.

246
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:48,679
I've learned by now that if it walks
like a duck and it quacks like a duck...

247
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:51,317
Okay, Darryl,
what are you talking about?

248
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:56,242
Demons. You're here to tell me
one got Charlene, right?

249
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:59,685
Okay, number one,
I have no idea who Charlene is.

250
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:03,239
Number two, I'm here to talk about
Cleavant Wilson's daughter, Tyra.

251
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:06,602
Tyra? She wasn't killed by demons.

252
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:09,404
No, but you guys have an idea
of who killed her, right?

253
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,520
Yeah, we got a pretty good idea.

254
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:15,318
- Just a pretty good idea?
- All right, a very good idea.

255
00:17:15,489 --> 00:17:18,447
- Why are you so interested?
- Honestly, I'm not entirely sure.

256
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:21,362
I just... I'm drawn to him
for some reason

257
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:23,360
and usually that means to help.

258
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,480
Unless you can magically
turn up a witness,

259
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:27,322
I doubt there's anything you can do.

260
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:31,798
- You can't, right, magically?
- No, if I could do that, Darryl,

261
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,961
Cleavant wouldn't be out there
giving up his life trying to find one.

262
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:37,324
You really wanna help?
Convince him to give up trying.

263
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,925
Help him to move on. No one
is ever going to testify against Gibbs.

264
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:44,201
- We have been down that road.
- He is never gonna give up, Darryl.

265
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:46,121
His daughter was his entire life.

266
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:48,644
And why are you guys
so okay with giving up?

267
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:50,879
Look, Gibbs owns that street, okay?

268
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:53,398
Tyra was probably gunned down
because she saw something

269
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:54,604
he didn't want her to see.

270
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:56,481
And short of us finding a witness

271
00:17:56,649 --> 00:17:59,686
or him walking up
on the street and confessing...

272
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:02,839
...there's nothing I can do.

273
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:07,083
Maybe there's something I can do.

274
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:28,567
I got your messages.
All eight of them.

275
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:32,125
So you wanna tell me
what the fight was about?

276
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,358
Actually, I was hoping Leo would,
but I gather he hasn't.

277
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:39,521
He's unreachable, apparently.

278
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:43,045
You know, this is very
awkward for me.

279
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:45,086
I don't wanna come across
as the jealous ex,

280
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,604
but that's not what this is about.

281
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:49,441
That's why I went to Leo first.

282
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:52,038
But, see, I started it.

283
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,802
I came at him very hard
with this, and...

284
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:56,958
With what?

285
00:18:57,329 --> 00:18:59,718
Do you remember my brother-in-law
who works for the State Department?

286
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,038
When I asked him about Leo?

287
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:03,997
Well, he found something wasn't right
with Leo's Army records.

288
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,528
- Dan...
- I know. I asked him

289
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:07,361
not to go any deeper
about this, okay?

290
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:09,688
But he did.

291
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:13,398
And he sent me this anyway,
something very unusual.

292
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:21,523
Leo isn't who he says he is.

293
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,807
But what you do with this
is all up to you.

294
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:30,766
You know, I'm...

295
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:33,443
I'm still here for you.

296
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:37,200
I'm still your friend.

297
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:48,237
What? Leo's married?

298
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:50,718
Yeah, there's even a picture of her

299
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:54,723
in his Army file being presented
his Purple Heart after he died.

300
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,278
She's pretty. Her name is Lillian.

301
00:19:57,449 --> 00:20:00,282
Prue, why didn't he tell me about her?
Why would he hide that from me?

302
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:01,922
I don't know. You have to ask him.

303
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:05,968
Well, I'd love to, but he's conveniently
out of the calling area at the moment.

304
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:09,845
Leave it to me to fall in love with
an angel who happens to be married.

305
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:13,843
Maybe he didn't tell me about her
because he's still in love with her.

306
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:15,444
No, come on.

307
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:18,561
How do you know
she's even still alive?

308
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:21,562
Well, I sort of did
a little Internet search.

309
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:23,885
I was thinking maybe I should
go have a chat with her.

310
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:26,768
No, Piper, I don't really think that
that's a very good idea.

311
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:30,922
But speaking of chats, I need to go
and talk to this pawnshop guy

312
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:33,603
before he closes, okay?
So we'll talk later?

313
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,760
Yeah. Okay.

314
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:59,525
We're closed.

315
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:01,884
- Well, it's only a quarter...
- I said, we're closed.

316
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:04,005
Get the hell out of here.

317
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:05,568
You know, you don't scare me.

318
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:07,642
Well, then you're stupid, lady.

319
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:10,682
And stupid people don't last long
in this neighbourhood.

320
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:12,607
Ask around.

321
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:17,765
Are you threatening me?

322
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:21,600
What, are you a reporter?

323
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:23,964
You work for the DA's office, what?

324
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:27,605
You know, I seen you over there
talking to that dead kid's old man.

325
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:29,725
- I know what you want.
- Is that right?

326
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,242
Yeah, and you ain't getting it.

327
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:34,282
Nobody's gonna mouth
on me. Nobody.

328
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:36,207
You're just wasting your time.

329
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:39,565
And you're trespassing.

330
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:48,567
You know, it must be something
living off of other people's pain.

331
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,006
I hope it doesn't
come back to haunt you.

332
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,683
If you saw anything, I'd appreciate it.

333
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:09,084
- Appreciate your help.
- All right.

334
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:34,886
Phoebe.

335
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:40,324
Sorry. I didn't mean to spook you.

336
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:44,159
So to speak. Charlene,
how are you feeling?

337
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:46,764
Do you feel any different?

338
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:52,237
My headache. I guess. Yeah.

339
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:56,118
I mean, I just feel
kind of weird in general.

340
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:58,808
I think that's to be expected.

341
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:04,600
I think she's mad at us.

342
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,597
Why don't we go over here so
we can talk and not disturb anybody.

343
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:16,609
Is something wrong, Phoebe?

344
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:20,442
Yes, Charlene, actually,
there is something wrong.

345
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:25,080
I think that the reason that you've
been feeling so weird lately

346
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:28,247
is because you're...

347
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:30,158
You're a ghost.

348
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,360
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, I know that this sounds crazy,

349
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:36,566
and it's probably really hard for you
to accept, but think about it, Charlene.

350
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:38,321
When was the last time
you ate something?

351
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:41,282
Or were hungry,
for that matter. Or slept.

352
00:23:41,449 --> 00:23:43,087
I mean, are you tired
right now, Charlene?

353
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,166
- Are you even tired?
- What are you saying?

354
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:47,758
I'm saying that I think
a demon killed you last night.

355
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:49,760
That's what I am trying to say.

356
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:52,324
And the only reason I can see you
is because I'm a witch,

357
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:53,717
and I'm supposed to help you.

358
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:57,209
I think you're the one
who needs help, not me.

359
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:00,528
Look, you don't believe me?
Try picking something up.

360
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:03,562
Now, you know as well
as I do that neophyte ghosts

361
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:06,243
cannot channel their anger
into moving material objects.

362
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:10,203
Try picking up a book.
See for yourself.

363
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:24,201
This is ridiculous.

364
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,963
I am not dead.
I've got a full life ahead of me,

365
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:29,922
and I will finish my thesis,
and I will be published.

366
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:34,005
Charlene. Charlene, wait.

367
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:11,004
- Anybody here?
- In here.

368
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:14,522
Hey. Good, I was looking for that.

369
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:16,247
Wait, what are you doing
with the Book?

370
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:18,405
I'm looking for the demon
that's gonna kill me.

371
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:20,247
I just love getting
those premonitions.

372
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:22,206
Okay, what premonition? When?

373
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:26,248
About an hour ago, right after I was
trying to tell Charlene that she's dead.

374
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:29,165
I'm lost.

375
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:32,966
Oh, sorry. Wrong sister.

376
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:36,121
Okay, Cliffs Notes version:
She is a student

377
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:38,320
who found proof that demons
really do exist.

378
00:25:38,489 --> 00:25:41,401
And this demon right here, Libris,
chopped off her head

379
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:44,322
and dumped her body behind
the library because of it.

380
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:47,089
There are a whole bunch
of Libris demons out there.

381
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:49,968
Wherever humans have the potential
to find unequivocal proof

382
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:51,881
of the existence of demons.

383
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:54,404
Yeah, talk about
your conspiracy theories.

384
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:57,169
Well, you just have to stop doing
whatever it is you're doing.

385
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:03,804
I can't. Charlene's spirit can't move on
unless I get justice for her murder.

386
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:06,278
So, what, by getting
murdered yourself?

387
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:08,286
Well, hopefully not.

388
00:26:08,449 --> 00:26:11,168
On the bright side, I won't have
to suffer through flunking college.

389
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:15,478
- So how was your day?
- Not as bad as yours,

390
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:18,721
but it's gonna get a hell of a lot better
as soon as I find the truth spell.

391
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:19,998
What do you need that for?

392
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:22,444
To catch a murderer who thinks
he can get away with it.

393
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:25,759
So you're gonna use the truth spell
to make him confess?

394
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,762
- Exactly.
- Not exactly. Prue, you can't do that.

395
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:31,039
We can't use our powers
to punish the guilty.

396
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:32,961
We learned that lesson
the hard way, remember?

397
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:34,761
Yeah, but it's not
the same thing, Pheebs.

398
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:37,238
I mean, I'm helping a father
with his grieving.

399
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:38,478
I'm helping him to move on.

400
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:40,844
It's more like protecting
the innocent.

401
00:26:41,449 --> 00:26:42,598
No, it's not, honey.

402
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:47,683
Phoebe, I see this man
on the bus bench every single day,

403
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:50,124
and he's just waiting there, hoping.

404
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:53,799
Why was I drawn to him if I can't
help him nail his daughter's killer?

405
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:58,321
- Why were you drawn to him?
- The look on his face, the pain.

406
00:26:58,489 --> 00:27:00,002
The pain of a father's loss?

407
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:02,044
Maybe.

408
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:05,246
I mean, I can't help
thinking about Dad,

409
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:10,403
and wondering if it hurts him as much
not having his daughters in his life.

410
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,965
- I think it does.
- Yeah, I wish I thought so too,

411
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:16,121
but, you know, I keep on bumping up
against this whole theory

412
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:18,041
that if it hurt him so much,
where is he?

413
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:28,319
Phoebe.

414
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:31,805
- Charlene. That's Charlene.
- You were right about me.

415
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:35,524
I went home, saw the folks crying,
then I knew it was true.

416
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:37,447
I've never seen my dad cry before.

417
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:40,203
Not over me anyway.
Then I got pissed.

418
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,003
If a demon did this to me,
I wanna get him.

419
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:45,957
I wanna prove
he doesn't exist anymore.

420
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:50,727
- Your friend, obviously?
- Yeah, the dead one.

421
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,999
Leo's Purple Heart.

422
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:09,928
He was a special man.

423
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:11,848
He always went out of his way

424
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:15,046
to try and help somebody,
even before he shipped out.

425
00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:17,279
He was studying to be
a doctor, you know.

426
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:21,408
- Yes, I know.
- He'd have been a great one too.

427
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:24,762
You know, he had
the most marvellous touch.

428
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:29,964
It was gentle, sensitive...

429
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:34,523
- Healing.
- Yes, exactly. A healing touch.

430
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:38,165
That was Leo. And they said
that he was doctoring

431
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:40,889
a wounded soldier
when it happened.

432
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:46,526
I'll never forget when they came
to give me that news.

433
00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:49,608
It sounds like you still love him.

434
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:54,408
I'll always love Leo, in a certain way,
for so many things,

435
00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:56,959
including helping me to move on.

436
00:28:58,089 --> 00:28:59,761
Move on. How'd he do that?

437
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:04,480
Well, one night, not long after he died,
Leo came to me in a dream,

438
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:10,047
and he was bathed in the most brilliant
white light that you could ever imagine.

439
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,968
He said I was not to worry
about him,

440
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:15,160
that he was in a good place.

441
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:20,359
He also said that I was
to let him go,

442
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:23,248
that there was another love
out there for me to find.

443
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:25,001
- Another love?
- Yes.

444
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:27,325
Another doctor, as it turned out.

445
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:28,763
A wonderful man.

446
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:35,442
He gave me two wonderful children,
grandchildren, even a great-grandchild.

447
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:39,644
Leo was right.

448
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:47,397
Well, I think I've taken up
enough of your time.

449
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:50,648
But you haven't found
what you came for yet.

450
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:52,367
Actually, I think I have.

451
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:55,521
It was very nice to meet you, Lillian.

452
00:29:55,689 --> 00:29:56,963
You too, Piper.

453
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:07,482
So I was walking down the aisle,
and I heard strange voices,

454
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:11,278
whispers, sounded like Latin.

455
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:15,608
And then I went
to pull out a book, and...

456
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:18,524
I don't know.

457
00:30:18,969 --> 00:30:20,084
It all went dark,

458
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:23,207
until I was back in the library again
with that terrible headache.

459
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:25,803
You didn't get a chance
to see the demon?

460
00:30:25,969 --> 00:30:28,881
- Don't remember.
- All right, well, if it was Libris,

461
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:32,803
he must've grabbed her in the aisle
and taken her somewhere to:

462
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:35,963
- Sorry.
- That's okay. I'm over the shock.

463
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:40,197
You know, the question is,
how did he grab her?

464
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:42,246
And this vanquishing spell

465
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:44,604
isn't gonna do us much good
if we can't catch him first.

466
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,640
Well, we're gonna
have to do it in the library

467
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:49,164
if we're gonna keep
that premonition from coming true.

468
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:51,968
Maybe I can retrace
Charlene's steps

469
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:53,966
and that'll bring him
out into the open.

470
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:56,285
- Phoebe.
- And just before he grabs me,

471
00:30:56,489 --> 00:30:58,525
you and Piper can use
your powers to stop him,

472
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:00,486
and then we can
vanquish him, easy as that.

473
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,680
- No, that is way too risky.
- How is it risky

474
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:05,244
with two witches and a ghost
to back me up?

475
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:07,962
Prue, help me get my demon,

476
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:11,845
and I promise I'll do everything
I can to help you get yours.

477
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:18,043
- I'm home.
- Come on.

478
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,200
- Where are we going?
- We'll explain on the way.

479
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:22,041
- Who's that?
- Let's go. Let's go.

480
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:24,325
That's my dead friend.

481
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:29,125
Last thing I wrote
was under "Demonic Acts."

482
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:32,362
- There.
- You know, this is pretty accurate.

483
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:33,922
You were really
onto something here.

484
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:36,161
Obviously.

485
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:37,808
Sorry.

486
00:31:37,969 --> 00:31:40,961
- Okay, what was next?
- I went to find the encyclopaedia.

487
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:42,887
This way.

488
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:06,437
There's the book.

489
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:11,165
I don't hear any voices.

490
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:16,000
Okay, here it goes.

491
00:32:22,449 --> 00:32:24,440
Maybe demons can see ghosts.

492
00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:33,208
Phoebe!

493
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,802
Where is she? Where did she go?

494
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:48,804
No!

495
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:59,646
- What, the basement?
- Worth a try.

496
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:09,801
Demon, hide your evil face

497
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,847
Libris die, and leave no trace

498
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,126
Thank God.

499
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,799
Okay. All right.

500
00:33:26,969 --> 00:33:29,039
- That was close.
- Yeah.

501
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:30,608
Thank God you're a quick study.

502
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,118
At least justice was served.

503
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:34,847
So I guess that means
I'm moving on.

504
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:36,124
Bye, Phoebe.

505
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:38,923
Thank you for this.
Thank you for helping me.

506
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:41,040
You're welcome. Take care.

507
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:53,167
Why am I not moving on?

508
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:54,883
I have no idea.

509
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:06,287
I thought you said all we have to do
is get justice for Charlene's murder?

510
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:09,043
- I said, maybe that is all you had to do.
- You did not say maybe.

511
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:11,809
- Yes, I did. I absolutely did.
- I did not hear the word maybe.

512
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,721
Yes, I did.

513
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,198
You guys aren't helping.

514
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:18,599
Are you sure that
vanquishing spell really worked?

515
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:22,245
- Maybe Libris isn't really gone.
- You know, you're getting good at that.

516
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:25,201
I'm just frustrated, that's all.

517
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:27,361
I told you she was a quick study.

518
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:29,599
Maybe Charlene's right,
maybe you didn't vanquish him,

519
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:32,408
- like the Demon of Illusion.
- No, he is definitely gone.

520
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:34,964
I mean, the spell was
specifically written for Libris.

521
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:38,286
Yeah, and he wouldn't have left
his sickle behind if he were still alive.

522
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:40,360
But the question still remains:

523
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:43,089
If justice was served, then what
is she still doing here?

524
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:45,761
Damn it!

525
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,358
Sorry.

526
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:52,001
Wait a minute.

527
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:54,239
- That's it.
- What? What is it?

528
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:57,959
Maybe she has to get justice
for somebody else.

529
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,280
Who's there?

530
00:35:57,049 --> 00:35:59,324
Gibbs.

531
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:11,165
You really think you're tough
with that gun, don't you?

532
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:16,277
"Tyra."

533
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:26,323
- What the hell's going on?
- You wanna know what's going on?

534
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:29,049
- Who are you?
- Who do you think I am?

535
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:31,245
So how does it feel
to be pushed around?

536
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:39,807
Murderer.

537
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:44,004
I'm the woman you murdered.

538
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:47,085
Leave me alone!

539
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:53,122
Admit it.

540
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:55,399
Admit you killed me,
or I will haunt every minute

541
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:57,400
of every day of the rest
of your miserable life.

542
00:36:57,569 --> 00:36:59,958
Okay, okay!
Okay, I did it. I killed you.

543
00:37:00,129 --> 00:37:03,599
- Say it. Say my name, damn it!
- Tyra Wilson! Tyra Wilson!

544
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:06,522
I killed Tyra Wilson, I admit it!

545
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:10,443
I've been waiting a long time
to hear you say that, Gibbs.

546
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,526
- Did you get that?
- I got every word.

547
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:17,599
- What the hell is this?
- Justice.

548
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,329
What's the matter, Gibbs,
you look like you've seen a ghost?

549
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:23,122
I hope you rot in hell.

550
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:29,368
How's this connected
to Charlene again?

551
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:32,037
It's a cosmic thing, Darryl.
Don't worry about it.

552
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:42,445
Are you okay, Mr. Wilson?

553
00:37:45,169 --> 00:37:46,921
Yeah, I guess.

554
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:50,764
It's an empty feeling, though.
You know, it...

555
00:37:51,209 --> 00:37:54,246
This doesn't bring her back,
it doesn't take away the hurt.

556
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:56,365
No, but at least you can
move on with your life.

557
00:37:56,529 --> 00:37:58,247
Tyra would've wanted that.

558
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,048
I wish I could tell her how much
I love her just one more time.

559
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:07,045
I think she'll get the message.

560
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:11,607
Thank you...

561
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:16,042
...for however
you made this happen.

562
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:28,406
Thank you.

563
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:40,328
Well, even if I could never seem
to please my own father,

564
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:42,759
at least I could please
someone else's.

565
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:44,197
I know what you mean.

566
00:38:48,569 --> 00:38:50,560
I think it's time.

567
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:27,279
Hey. Ask me how I did on my final.

568
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:30,925
- How did you do on your final?
- Oh, thank you for asking.

569
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:32,886
I aced it. They just
posted the grades.

570
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:34,568
- Good for you.
- Thanks.

571
00:39:34,729 --> 00:39:37,243
Although, I did get
some perspective on the test.

572
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:41,527
After what happened to Charlene,
it just didn't seem important anymore.

573
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:47,248
Speaking of perspective,
I signed Dad's card.

574
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:49,041
- Really?
- Yes.

575
00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:51,080
Just in case he thinks of us too.

576
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:54,446
No, I definitely
don't need to sign that.

577
00:39:54,649 --> 00:39:57,766
I mean, I realize that Dad is never
gonna be the father that Cleavant is,

578
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:00,841
and I just need to accept that

579
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:04,319
and stop thinking that magically
he's somehow gonna change.

580
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:12,441
Excuse me.

581
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:19,198
How'd you get in?
I thought whitelighter pay sucked.

582
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:23,766
I sort of didn't tell the bouncer
I don't work here anymore.

583
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:27,120
Imagine that. Like you sort of
didn't tell me you were married?

584
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:33,846
Look, Piper, I didn't tell you,
because I didn't want you to get upset.

585
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:36,045
And it was literally
a different lifetime for me,

586
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:40,043
one that has nothing to do
with this one, with us.

587
00:40:40,209 --> 00:40:43,201
I know that, and I'm not mad,

588
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:46,600
but you can't not tell me stuff
because you think it might hurt.

589
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:48,561
If we're gonna have
a normal relationship,

590
00:40:48,769 --> 00:40:51,920
at least as normal as possible,
then you need to be honest with me.

591
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:56,203
You're right. I'm sorry.

592
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:59,048
- Forgive me?
- I'll think about it.

593
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:08,128
So how much do you think
Dan really knows?

594
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:11,242
I don't know.
We'll worry about it later.
