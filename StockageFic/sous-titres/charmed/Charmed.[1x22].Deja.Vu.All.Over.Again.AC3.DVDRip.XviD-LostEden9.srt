1
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:42,083
- Tempus, I never...
- Expected to see me?

2
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,253
Of course not.
You were not worthy before now.

3
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,089
What is the name
you are using here?

4
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,802
- Rodriguez.
- Ah, yes.

5
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:58,058
I've been sent to you, Rodriguez,
as a gift.

6
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,102
- Sent? By who?
- I think you know who.

7
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,146
And why.

8
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,648
I can defeat the Charmed Ones
on my own.

9
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,359
I don't need any help.

10
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,111
Really?

11
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:14,782
What makes you think you've actually
found the Charmed Ones?

12
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,618
You kidding?

13
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:19,245
After so many of my colleagues
had mysteriously vanished

14
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,456
in San Francisco this year?

15
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,291
There could only be one reason why.

16
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,589
I posed as a cop because
I believed one was covering for them.

17
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,009
And I was right, he was.
That's how I found them.

18
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,344
But, of course, you already know
all that, don't you?

19
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:37,847
It's what makes me
so worthy now, right?

20
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,058
Watch your tongue, Rodriguez,
lest I split it for you.

21
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,936
It's one thing to have found
the Charmed Ones,

22
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,938
it's quite another to defeat them,

23
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:49,859
as those who have gone before you
have already discovered.

24
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,279
Tomorrow is Wednesday.

25
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:58,576
I want you to get all three witches
together in one place by midnight,

26
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,162
and give it your best shot.

27
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:05,583
- But if you fail...
- I will not fail.

28
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:10,755
Well, if you do,

29
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:15,176
I'll be there to help you
learn by your failures.

30
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:17,928
Trust me.

31
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:23,684
Now, how do you expect
to get them together?

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,395
Trudeau.

33
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,245
<i>Good morning, San Francisco.</i>

34
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:45,831
<i>It looks like it's going to be
a beautiful Wednesday...</i>

35
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:48,792
Piper, what are you doing at Quake?
It's 8:00 in the morning.

36
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,794
- Morning.
- Morning.

37
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:54,757
All right. Yes, I'll be there
in an hour. Bye.

38
00:02:54,923 --> 00:02:56,884
You'll be where in an hour?

39
00:02:57,092 --> 00:02:59,470
Quake. Piper's doing that thing
for the Food Network,

40
00:02:59,636 --> 00:03:01,472
and she needs me to bring her
another dress

41
00:03:01,638 --> 00:03:04,558
because she spilled marinara sauce
all over the one she's wearing.

42
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:06,810
- Just stay out of my closet.
- Oh, don't worry,

43
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:08,896
don't think she'd want to ruin
another of yours.

44
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:12,024
- I don't believe this.
- I'm kidding. Don't have an aneurysm.

45
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,818
No, I'm talking about the paper.
Did you see the front page?

46
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:23,327
Where did you park my car
last night?

47
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:25,620
In the driveway, I think.

48
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:35,255
- Mrs Henderson's car.
- Oh, thank God.

49
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,135
I mean, that your car is in the driveway,
and I'm not in the doghouse.

50
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:43,013
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, just a little fender-bender.

51
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:44,431
No big deal.

52
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:47,684
- Phoebe, Andy's in trouble.
- What? Why?

53
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:55,525
They think that he killed
that Internal Affairs cop? No way!

54
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:59,029
Maybe it's a setup trying to
force him to reveal our secret.

55
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,739
Let me see that.

56
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:10,415
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

57
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:15,837
I saw Andy, Prue.

58
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:20,550
He was dead.

59
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:03,444
You said that you didn't see a demon
or a warlock in your premonition, right?

60
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,947
No, but the way he was hurled across
the room, there had to have been one.

61
00:06:07,114 --> 00:06:09,158
- This room, here?
- Right here, yeah.

62
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:10,951
Okay, and you're positive
it was Andy?

63
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:13,287
- Prue...
- I just wanna be sure, all right.

64
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:16,039
This isn't just anybody
that we're talking about, you know.

65
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:19,626
- I know. And I care about him too.
- I know you do. I'm sorry.

66
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:24,047
All right, why don't you fill in Piper,
and I'm gonna go warn Andy.

67
00:06:24,214 --> 00:06:26,842
How? He said it was too risky
for you to be seen with him.

68
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,886
Well, I don't care. Let Internal Affairs
find out that we're witches.

69
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:34,141
- Andy's life is a lot more important.
- Okay, just please be careful.

70
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:36,810
We don't know what kind of demon
we're up against here.

71
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:43,692
You ask me, I wouldn't be surprised
if Rodriguez whacked his own partner.

72
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:45,110
IA already cleared him.

73
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:47,946
- IA clearing IA. Go figure.
- Yeah.

74
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:53,618
- What are you doing here, Morris?
- Backing my partner, Rodriguez.

75
00:06:53,785 --> 00:06:55,787
Something you wouldn't know
anything about.

76
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:59,165
This is just between him and me.

77
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,251
It's okay, Darryl.

78
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:11,261
Just for the record,

79
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,847
I'm not saying anything
without my lawyer present.

80
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,807
You don't need a lawyer.

81
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:18,351
Not if you're willing to help me.

82
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,813
You want me to help you?

83
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:27,068
What, you can't frame me
yourself, Rodriguez?

84
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:30,446
- Look, Andy...
- Oh, it's Andy now?

85
00:07:32,824 --> 00:07:36,744
I don't think you had anything to do
with my partner's murder. That's right.

86
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:40,832
But what I do think
is completely off the record.

87
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,543
And I think you'll understand why.

88
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:48,756
It's my partner,
or at least what's left of him.

89
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:51,968
No human could've
done that to him.

90
00:07:52,135 --> 00:07:55,680
I think he was killed
by something supernatural.

91
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:58,391
And I think you can help me
figure out who or what it is.

92
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:01,561
- Really? What makes you think that?
- Come on.

93
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:04,272
I know all about those
unsolved cases of yours.

94
00:08:04,522 --> 00:08:07,567
And I know who's behind them too,
who you've been covering for.

95
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:09,569
It's very noble.

96
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:14,323
You must care about her very much
to give up your career for her.

97
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:17,368
Prue Halliwell is a witch.

98
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:23,249
A witch, huh?

99
00:08:23,582 --> 00:08:26,419
You wait here.
I'll go warn the Wizard of Oz.

100
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:30,005
I don't have time
to screw around, Trudeau.

101
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:32,466
I want you to arrange a meeting
between her and me.

102
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:34,051
It has to be tonight.

103
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:36,470
If she can help me find
who killed my partner,

104
00:08:36,637 --> 00:08:40,140
I'll drop all charges against you,
and I won't tell anybody about her.

105
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:43,143
You think about it,
but not too long.

106
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,325
- You all right?
- I'm not sure.

107
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:00,703
I gotta go see Prue.

108
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:05,541
That's funny. She called and said
she had to see you too.

109
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:32,317
Well?

110
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:34,528
I'm sure I made Trudeau
suspicious of me.

111
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:37,823
He'll go to Prue, she'll have no choice
but to meet with me.

112
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,867
But you have to get
all three of them together.

113
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:45,497
Trudeau cares about her.
He won't let her risk meeting me alone.

114
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:48,208
He'll insist she have
the power of three there with her.

115
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,501
For protection.

116
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:52,629
And you think you have the power
to defeat them all?

117
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:54,965
You don't think I do, do you?

118
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:58,426
- You think I'll fail.
- Time will tell.

119
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:06,476
Phoebe, over here.

120
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:10,897
Thank God. The segment producer's
gonna be here any minute,

121
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:12,774
and I'm a complete and total wreck.

122
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:14,859
I thought I was gonna
have to pull a Céline Dion

123
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:17,862
- and wear my dress backwards.
- Piper, you've gotta listen to me.

124
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:20,573
I had a premonition of Andy dying.

125
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:23,159
- What? When?
- This morning.

126
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:26,162
Don't you check your voice mail?
I called and said it was important.

127
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:28,414
- Oh, no. Where's Prue?
- She's warning him.

128
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:30,875
In the meantime, we have to
figure out who the demon is.

129
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:33,253
Piper?

130
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:35,505
Piper Halliwell?

131
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:40,927
I would recognise you anywhere.
You have not changed one bit.

132
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:43,262
You don't recognise me, do you?

133
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:45,932
It's Joanne.

134
00:10:48,518 --> 00:10:51,312
Joanne Hertz.
Baker High, class of '92.

135
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:54,774
Oh, sure. Of course. Joanne.

136
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:59,112
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the segment producer.

137
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,199
You're the segment producer?
She's the segment producer.

138
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:04,575
I heard.

139
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:08,955
Wow, what a small world.
I thought you moved to New York.

140
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:12,375
I did, and that's where I met
my fabulous husband,

141
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:15,044
who had this crazy idea
about starting this little cable show,

142
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:16,754
and putting me in charge
of everything.

143
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:20,257
And here we are, the Food Network's
most popular show.

144
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,301
Talk about dreams coming true.

145
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:25,846
Anyway, enough about me,
what have you been doing?

146
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,437
- Why'd you do that?
- What am I supposed to say?

147
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:36,148
That I'm a cash-strapped,
single restaurant manager

148
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:38,984
who still lives in the same house
I grew up in with my sisters?

149
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:41,821
- And the cat. Don't forget our cat.
- Phoebe, this isn't funny.

150
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:45,491
Look, I don't know why you're getting
so upset. She is a freak.

151
00:11:45,824 --> 00:11:48,661
I'm sorry, but no one is
that successful at age 26.

152
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:50,579
Besides, you are successful.

153
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:52,831
You're talented, you're creative,

154
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:54,959
and the Food Network
is here to see you.

155
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,545
Not me, not her, you.

156
00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:01,507
- Feel better now?
- Very little.

157
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:04,051
Good. Unfreeze that bitch in heels.

158
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:07,221
You've got a segment to shoot,
and we've got a demon to find.

159
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:11,600
Has Phoebe ever been wrong
about her premonitions before?

160
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:14,394
No. But the good news is,
every other time,

161
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:16,104
we've been able
to affect the outcome.

162
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:19,566
- Stop the demon or warlock before...
- Before I get killed.

163
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,610
Can I get that in writing?

164
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:24,196
Andy, you just have to be
extra careful

165
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:28,825
until we figure out who this demon is
and why he's after you, okay?

166
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:32,245
Andy?

167
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:36,333
I was just thinking,
what if the demon is Rodriguez?

168
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,335
Why would you say that?

169
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:40,879
He pulled me into the station house
this morning.

170
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:42,714
I thought he was gonna arrest me,

171
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,966
but what he really wanted
was a meeting with you.

172
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:46,218
Meet with me? Why?

173
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:48,637
He thinks his partner was killed
by a supernatural being

174
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:52,432
and somehow, I don't know how, Prue,
he knows you're a witch.

175
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:56,978
- How would he know that, unless...?
- Unless he's the demon.

176
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:06,029
All right, tell Rodriguez to meet me
at the manor at 6:00.

177
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:09,032
- It's too dangerous, Prue.
- I don't have a choice.

178
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:12,410
If I don't meet with him,
he'll frame you and try and expose me.

179
00:13:12,577 --> 00:13:14,746
But if he is a demon,
and it turns out to be a trap?

180
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:17,666
I'll have Piper and Phoebe there
to back me up. The power of three.

181
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:23,797
- Plus one. Me.
- No, you can't be there, Andy.

182
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,051
That's where you were
in Phoebe's premonition when...

183
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:33,681
Just promise me you'll stay away.

184
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:37,393
- I can't do that, Prue.
- I mean it.

185
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:41,231
Don't make me use my magic on you.

186
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:48,112
I don't want anything
to happen to you, Andy.

187
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:52,450
You know how much
I still care for you.

188
00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:55,328
Okay. I promise.

189
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,485
All right, let's go over
the plan again.

190
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:30,488
Yeah, let's, because I wanna know
why I'm the one answering the door.

191
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,990
Because you're the one
who knows martial arts, all right.

192
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:35,576
If Rodriguez shows up
and tries something right off the bat,

193
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:36,786
you can knock him down.

194
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:39,163
Then I can come in from
the living room and freeze him.

195
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,749
And I can come down the stairs
and send him flying.

196
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,667
Still feel like cannon fodder.

197
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:49,465
- What time is it?
- Just before 6.

198
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:54,595
That's a little too anxious.
That's not a good sign.

199
00:14:54,762 --> 00:14:58,849
Which means if he doesn't wanna
kill Prue, he wants to date her.

200
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:03,020
All right, come on,
let's get this day over with.

201
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:04,480
Okay.

202
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,275
All right already.

203
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:12,029
Inspector Rodriguez.
I'm here to see Prue Halliwell.

204
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:13,864
Yeah, no kidding.

205
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:17,493
Prue, Piper, company.

206
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,005
Phoebe!

207
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:33,842
Phoebe.

208
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:43,310
Oh, my God.

209
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:47,773
- Oh, God, Phoebe.
- Prue, is she okay?

210
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:54,946
She's dead.

211
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,324
What?

212
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:59,201
Phoebe!

213
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,077
Phoebe!

214
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,994
Hurts to die, doesn't it?

215
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:46,080
Especially at the hands of a witch.

216
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:50,084
Wait. What happened?
Where am I?

217
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:54,047
Exactly where you were
when you first met me.

218
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,967
Time has been reset.
Or, rather, I have reset time.

219
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:00,553
But they killed me.

220
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:07,977
That was Wednesday night, this is
Wednesday morning all over again.

221
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:10,730
This is why I have been sent to you:

222
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:14,233
To keep resetting time
until you learn from your failures.

223
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,988
Only you will carry with you the
memory of what has happened before.

224
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:22,366
And each time you fail,
you will learn more

225
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:27,121
until, ultimately,
you will kill all of them.

226
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:41,343
<i>Good morning, San Francisco.</i>

227
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,971
<i>It looks like it's going to be
a beautiful Wednesday...</i>

228
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:48,559
Piper, what are you doing at Quake?
It's 8:00 in the morning.

229
00:17:48,726 --> 00:17:51,562
- Morning.
- Morning.

230
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:53,606
Wait a minute.

231
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:59,486
I am freaking out.

232
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:02,031
Okay, I'll be there in an hour.

233
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,325
Be where in an hour?

234
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,537
- Okay, pinch me.
- What?

235
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:11,582
No, I mean it, pinch me.
I wanna make sure I'm awake.

236
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,002
Because if I am,
I am having one killer déjà vu.

237
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:17,171
So it's just a déjà vu.
Everybody gets them.

238
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:22,050
Not like this, they don't. Look, Prue,
something weird is going on here.

239
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:25,053
- I don't believe this.
- No, trust me, okay.

240
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,181
This has happened before.
Everything!

241
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:29,725
I'm talking about the paper.
Did you see the front page?

242
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:34,688
See? Like that, right there.
You said that before, I know it.

243
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:38,692
Okay, and that has happened
before too.

244
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:40,527
Where did you park my car
last night?

245
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:44,698
In the driveway. And I told you that
already the last time you asked me.

246
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:49,494
I think I'm having an aneurysm.

247
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:52,622
Mrs Henderson's car.

248
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:56,209
Just a little fender-bender.
No big deal.

249
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:57,836
Prue, I am not nuts.

250
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,047
Okay, maybe just a little,
but that's irrelevant here.

251
00:19:01,256 --> 00:19:03,216
- Phoebe, Andy's in trouble.
- What?

252
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:09,472
Let me see that.

253
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:20,609
Now, that was a premonition
which I've had before.

254
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:23,236
- Of what?
- Of Andy, here...

255
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,530
...being killed by a demon.

256
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:38,418
- What are you doing here?
- Backing my partner.

257
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:40,795
- You got a problem with that?
- Get out. Now!

258
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:46,968
It's okay, Darryl. I got it.

259
00:19:55,685 --> 00:19:57,854
Just for the record,

260
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:00,440
I'm not saying anything
without my lawyer present.

261
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:02,817
Forget your lawyer.
I'm not screwing around this time.

262
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:05,778
This time?
What are you talking about?

263
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,991
Bottom line, I know my partner
was killed by a supernatural being,

264
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:12,660
and I think Prue Halliwell
can help me figure out who did it.

265
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:14,203
Really?

266
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:16,372
I'll just get the commissioner
to signal Batman

267
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:18,332
and then I'll get right on it.

268
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,460
You think I'm joking?
I know everything, Trudeau.

269
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:23,963
Including the fact that
Prue Halliwell is a witch.

270
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,549
You're gonna arrange a meeting
with her tonight, understand?

271
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:29,218
Or else I'm gonna bust your ass
and expose hers.

272
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:40,021
- What was that about?
- I'm not sure.

273
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:02,793
- Well?
- Trudeau will set to meet,

274
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:06,922
but what I need to know is how to avoid
the pain of getting vanquished again.

275
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:10,217
Depends on whether you've learned
enough to vanquish them first.

276
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:11,427
What do you remember?

277
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:14,555
Last time, I killed the youngest one,
Phoebe, without a fight.

278
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:17,558
But then when I turned to kill Piper...

279
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:19,727
I think she's the one
who has the power to freeze.

280
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:20,978
Adjust.

281
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:23,814
Simply anticipate where
she's coming from earlier,

282
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:27,568
before she has the chance
to freeze you.

283
00:21:27,735 --> 00:21:29,945
Then kill Prue.

284
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:37,744
Andy dies?
Are you sure that's what you saw?

285
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:41,290
Even worse, I know that I've had
the same premonition before.

286
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:44,459
I mean, before I had it earlier today.

287
00:21:44,626 --> 00:21:49,131
- You mean, like yesterday?
- Yes. I mean, no.

288
00:21:50,257 --> 00:21:52,968
It's not just the premonition
I've seen before, it's everything.

289
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:56,013
And don't tell me that it's just déjà vu,
because I know that it's not.

290
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:59,182
- Okay, all right, then what is it?
- Piper?

291
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:02,352
Piper Halliwell?

292
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:07,732
I would recognise you anywhere.
You have not changed one bit.

293
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:10,110
You don't recognise me, do you?

294
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:12,279
- It's...
- Joanne.

295
00:22:12,445 --> 00:22:16,116
Joanne Hertz, right?

296
00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:19,160
- I'm right, aren't I?
- I'm sorry, have we met?

297
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:22,455
Yes. I mean, sort of. Before.

298
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:29,337
Baker High, class of '92.
Although, I wasn't in that class.

299
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:32,799
Oh, sure. Of course. Joanne.

300
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:35,719
- Phoebe, how did you...?
- That's what I've been trying to tell you.

301
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:39,013
I think we're in some
funky time loop here.

302
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:42,976
- Phoebe.
- Freeze her. I'll show you.

303
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:47,439
Okay, Joanne here is
the Food Network segment producer.

304
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:50,984
She's about to brag how she's
happily married to some rich guy,

305
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:55,196
how she's following her dreams,
how she's had a really bad nose job.

306
00:22:55,363 --> 00:22:57,198
Okay, I added the last part.

307
00:22:57,365 --> 00:22:59,158
But this is all gonna make
you feel like

308
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:02,161
you're wasting your life away
in comparison.

309
00:23:02,328 --> 00:23:04,205
Unfreeze her.
Go ahead, see for yourself.

310
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:12,088
- Are you the segment producer?
- Why, yes, I am.

311
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:16,259
Following your dreams, are you?
Happily married? Stinking rich?

312
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:21,472
- Well, I don't mean to brag, but...
- Oh, God.

313
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:23,975
All right, Phoebe, spill it.

314
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:26,644
Okay, the best I can figure is
some demon has cast a spell,

315
00:23:26,811 --> 00:23:28,604
and I'm the only one
who can sort of see it

316
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:32,400
because my power lets me see things
that have happened in different times.

317
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:34,485
- Do you have a better explanation?
- No.

318
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:36,404
All right, so if you're right,

319
00:23:36,571 --> 00:23:38,948
you think this has something to do
with Andy being killed?

320
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:42,118
I don't know, but we'll never find who
the demon is unless we get to...

321
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:44,954
<i>Book of Shadows.
I'm right behind you.</i>

322
00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:47,456
What if he is a demon,
and it turns out to be a trap?

323
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:50,376
I'll have Piper and Phoebe there
to back me up. The power of three.

324
00:23:50,543 --> 00:23:52,211
Plus one. Me.

325
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:55,256
What is it?

326
00:23:55,423 --> 00:23:58,467
This seems a little familiar to me,
that's all. Kind of like déjà vu.

327
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:02,471
Never mind.

328
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:05,182
Andy, you can't be at the meeting.

329
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:07,852
In Phoebe's premonition,
that's where you were when...

330
00:24:09,854 --> 00:24:12,189
Just promise me
that you'll stay away.

331
00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:15,526
- Prue, I can't do that.
- I mean it.

332
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:17,611
Don't make me use my magic on you.

333
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:26,495
Andy, I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

334
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:31,792
You know how much I still love you.

335
00:24:36,046 --> 00:24:37,631
No...

336
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:39,758
...I didn't.

337
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:10,789
Anything in there about time loops?

338
00:25:10,956 --> 00:25:12,916
A spell to accelerate time,
that's about it.

339
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,544
I'm telling you,
this is all part of his evil plan.

340
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,464
I just haven't had enough time
to figure it out yet.

341
00:25:19,923 --> 00:25:23,260
- What time is it?
- Just before 6.

342
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:26,304
I'll get it.

343
00:25:30,225 --> 00:25:31,977
All right already.

344
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:35,271
Phoebe!

345
00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:55,250
Oh, my God, no!

346
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:01,130
Piper!

347
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:31,744
Son of a bitch!

348
00:26:32,703 --> 00:26:35,414
- Failed again, I see.
- Yeah, but I learned.

349
00:26:35,581 --> 00:26:39,168
This time I got two of them.
Third time is the charm.

350
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:54,141
<i>Good morning, San Francisco.</i>

351
00:26:54,392 --> 00:26:57,561
<i>It looks like it's going to be a beautiful
Wednesday in the Bay Area...</i>

352
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,855
Don't tell me, I already know.

353
00:27:00,022 --> 00:27:03,192
You spilled marinara sauce
on your dress, right? Am I right?

354
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,904
Think, Piper, think. Doesn't all of this
seem awfully familiar to you?

355
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:08,614
- Morning.
- Freeze.

356
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:10,658
No, not you, Piper.

357
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:13,994
Kit knocks over pepper, meows.

358
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:17,414
Hold that thought.

359
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:20,125
Okay, Piper, you need to get home
as soon as you can.

360
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:22,211
Okay, we've got major
demon hunting to do.

361
00:27:22,378 --> 00:27:25,130
Oh, and if you run into someone
named Joanne from high school,

362
00:27:25,297 --> 00:27:28,926
just tell her to go stick it.
I will explain later, just hurry.

363
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:32,763
- Okay, what's going on?
- Quick, follow me.

364
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,362
Five, four, three, two, one.

365
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:52,241
Car honks, skids, crashes.

366
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,662
Mrs Henderson's car,
a little fender-bender.

367
00:27:56,828 --> 00:27:59,081
Good thing I parked your car
in the driveway last night.

368
00:27:59,248 --> 00:28:00,374
How did you know that?

369
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,459
Because this has all happened
once before, Prue.

370
00:28:02,626 --> 00:28:04,086
Maybe even more than once.

371
00:28:04,252 --> 00:28:07,714
The day keeps repeating itself.
I know it.

372
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:11,635
And every time it happens, I think
I figure it out just a little bit faster.

373
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:15,013
It must be my power of premonition.

374
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:17,474
Premonition.

375
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:20,560
I'm supposed to be having
a premonition right about now.

376
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:22,854
Supposed to? What do you mean?

377
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:26,233
The paper. Look at the front page.

378
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:32,697
- Andy...
- Is in trouble.

379
00:28:32,864 --> 00:28:34,074
More than you know, Prue.

380
00:28:34,699 --> 00:28:38,078
If I touch that paper,
I will have a premonition.

381
00:28:38,244 --> 00:28:39,955
The same one that I've had before,

382
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:44,292
where Andy gets killed, here,
by a demon.

383
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:46,628
You have got to believe me.

384
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:49,214
No, I believe you. The question is,
what do we do about it?

385
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:51,383
Well, you've gotta go warn Andy.

386
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:53,468
Keep him away from our house
at all costs.

387
00:28:53,635 --> 00:28:55,804
<i>Meanwhile, I've gotta dig through
the Book of Shadows,</i>

388
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,057
find a way to vanquish this time demon
before he can kill Andy.

389
00:29:12,654 --> 00:29:14,739
You really shouldn't have done that.

390
00:29:14,906 --> 00:29:19,077
You shouldn't do anything differently
if you expect to succeed tonight.

391
00:29:19,243 --> 00:29:21,996
I will succeed tonight, old man.

392
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:23,623
There will be no more time loops.

393
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,376
This time I'll kill Prue first
and then the other two.

394
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:27,919
And when they die,

395
00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:32,924
they're gonna feel every ounce of pain
they've given me and then some.

396
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:40,348
Joanne, I'm so sorry,
but I can't do this segment right now.

397
00:29:40,515 --> 00:29:43,351
Something's happened.
Something bad. I have to go.

398
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:46,854
What? Run out of marinara sauce?

399
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:48,272
Kidding.

400
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:52,944
Look, I know I don't have
the flashy job or the flashy ring

401
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,278
or the flashy designer suit,

402
00:29:54,445 --> 00:29:56,989
but that doesn't make me
less than you or anybody else.

403
00:29:57,156 --> 00:29:59,575
And just because I may not
have realised my dreams yet

404
00:29:59,742 --> 00:30:02,912
like you think you have, doesn't mean
I won't find a way to do exactly that.

405
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:06,040
And when I do, you can be damn sure
I'll be doing it with my own nose

406
00:30:06,207 --> 00:30:09,418
and not the one
some discount doctor gave me.

407
00:30:12,838 --> 00:30:16,050
A time loop? You mean demons can
actually do that sort of thing?

408
00:30:16,217 --> 00:30:18,427
None that I've ever seen before.
But if it is a demon,

409
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:21,138
it's the most powerful one
that we've ever come up against.

410
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:23,974
And he's going through all this
just to kill me?

411
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:26,101
No way, Prue.

412
00:30:26,268 --> 00:30:29,104
If he's as powerful as you say,
then he's gotta be after you.

413
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:30,356
Please let us handle this.

414
00:30:30,522 --> 00:30:33,192
Whatever you do, promise me
that you'll stay away from the manor.

415
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:35,235
I can't promise you that.

416
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:38,614
If you're right and Rodriguez
is the demon, then it's a trap.

417
00:30:38,781 --> 00:30:41,867
I'll have Piper and Phoebe there
to back me up. The power of three.

418
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:43,744
What if he wants all three
of you together?

419
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:45,579
If that's the reason he
set the time loop?

420
00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:48,373
- We'll have to take our chances.
- You could get killed, Prue.

421
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,751
I mean it. This is not your fight.

422
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:53,504
Don't make me use my magic on you.

423
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:56,840
Andy, I would die
if anything happened to you.

424
00:30:58,425 --> 00:31:00,052
I love you.

425
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:03,305
I love you too, Prue.

426
00:31:33,168 --> 00:31:34,544
Oh, my God! Prue!

427
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:42,886
The devil's sorcerer, Tempus, he can
manipulate time any way he chooses.

428
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:45,013
Does it say how to vanquish him?

429
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:50,018
Take him out of the time that he's in,
whatever that means.

430
00:31:58,318 --> 00:31:59,819
No!

431
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,238
Andy!

432
00:32:15,418 --> 00:32:19,130
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Is Prue okay?

433
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:22,508
Yeah. She's out cold.

434
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:36,981
Oh, my God.

435
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,066
He's dead.

436
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,671
The only reason you're still alive

437
00:33:00,838 --> 00:33:04,216
is because I haven't figured out
how to kill you yet.

438
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:08,554
Go ahead, kill me, witch.
I don't care.

439
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:11,098
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- I'm trying to save Andy.

440
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:14,101
Andy? Andy's dead.
You can't save him, Phoebe.

441
00:33:14,268 --> 00:33:16,479
No? We're in a time loop, aren't we?

442
00:33:16,645 --> 00:33:19,565
All we have to do is start
this day over, and Andy lives.

443
00:33:20,858 --> 00:33:26,030
And I'm willing to bet that his death
somehow triggers the time loop.

444
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:29,366
I'm impressed.
I was told you wouldn't know that.

445
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:30,951
Really?

446
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:32,912
By who?

447
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:37,583
Tempus? Yeah,
we know about him too,

448
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:40,127
and we also know
that you're not him.

449
00:33:40,294 --> 00:33:43,130
Otherwise, you would've restarted
the day by now.

450
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:46,925
- So where do we find him?
- In your nightmares.

451
00:33:49,053 --> 00:33:50,596
Kill me.

452
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:52,723
I dare you.

453
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,687
Why is he so willing
to let us kill him?

454
00:33:58,854 --> 00:34:01,315
Who cares? He dies, Andy lives.
End of story.

455
00:34:01,481 --> 00:34:03,483
What if that's exactly his plan?

456
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,111
To reset the day
and he can kill us all next?

457
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:09,698
Doesn't matter. The day's gonna
reset itself anyway,

458
00:34:09,865 --> 00:34:12,075
and there's not a damn thing
you can do to stop it.

459
00:34:12,242 --> 00:34:14,453
Shut up. Come on,
we have to wake up Prue.

460
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:18,373
Prue.

461
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,543
Prue, come on,
we need your help.

462
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,880
<i>- Prue.
- Prue. Prue.</i>

463
00:34:25,047 --> 00:34:27,382
<i>Come to me, Prue.</i>

464
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:31,845
Andy, what's going on?
Where are we?

465
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:34,848
I'm not quite sure, really.

466
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:38,685
I hoped I'd end up here,
but not so soon.

467
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:41,813
One thing I do know, though,
is that I'm staying.

468
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,733
You're not.

469
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,526
I don't understand.

470
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:51,823
I broke my promise, Prue.

471
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,491
I came to your house tonight.

472
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:58,371
Turns out Phoebe's premonition
was one you couldn't stop after all.

473
00:34:58,538 --> 00:35:00,999
Weren't supposed to stop.

474
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:06,212
- Wait a minute, Andy, no.
- It's okay, Prue, really.

475
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,506
Trust me.

476
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,843
This is my destiny, I know that now.

477
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,388
Yours is to continue on.

478
00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:18,683
Everything happens for a reason,
remember? You taught me that.

479
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,603
- This isn't fair.
- You need to go back.

480
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,022
You need to keep the time loop
from being reset again,

481
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,774
or you and your sisters
will be killed,

482
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:28,985
and I will have died in vain.

483
00:35:29,485 --> 00:35:32,697
- I'll kill Rodriguez for this.
- No, you won't.

484
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,282
You're not a murderer, Prue.

485
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,576
You're a good person
who does good things.

486
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:41,581
- I don't wanna lose you.
- Don't worry, you won't.

487
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,218
I'll always be there for you, Prue.

488
00:36:01,183 --> 00:36:03,185
<i>Prue.</i>

489
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,569
Prue, come on, wake up, sweetie.
Come on.

490
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,154
Come on, we need your help.
Come on.

491
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,281
Easy, easy, easy.

492
00:36:15,448 --> 00:36:18,242
- Okay.
- Where's Andy?

493
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,911
Prue, something terrible
has happened.

494
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,915
Oh, my God.

495
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,418
It all happened so fast, Prue.

496
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,753
He ran in the door
when Rodriguez attacked.

497
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,506
He was trying to save us.

498
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:38,762
And he'll succeed.

499
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:42,308
<i>- Where's the Book of Shadows?
- It's right here.</i>

500
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,772
Why?

501
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:52,067
Where's the spell that you saw
to accelerate time?

502
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:53,986
- What are you doing?
- There.

503
00:36:54,153 --> 00:36:55,195
What's going on?

504
00:36:55,362 --> 00:36:57,448
We don't wanna accelerate time,
we wanna reverse it.

505
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:59,741
No, we don't, trust me.
The only chance that we have

506
00:36:59,908 --> 00:37:03,537
to get rid of Tempus is to do this
by breaking the time loop, okay?

507
00:37:03,704 --> 00:37:06,915
But if we break the time loop,
we won't be able to save Andy.

508
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:09,668
- I know.
- Prue, are you sure?

509
00:37:10,377 --> 00:37:12,421
No, I'm not.

510
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,510
<i>"Winds of time, gather round
Give me wings to speed my way"</i>

511
00:37:18,677 --> 00:37:19,720
Wait a minute.

512
00:37:19,928 --> 00:37:24,141
<i>"Rush me on my journey forward
Let tomorrow be today"</i>

513
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:25,642
What's happening?

514
00:37:42,242 --> 00:37:44,494
No!

515
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:00,719
Prue?

516
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:10,645
You know what, just untie him.
Get him out of here.

517
00:38:10,854 --> 00:38:13,273
What? He'll kill us!

518
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,817
No, he won't.
He doesn't have the power to kill us.

519
00:38:16,025 --> 00:38:17,902
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
needed Tempus.

520
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:20,488
I will not untie him, Prue.

521
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:28,204
Get out of here
before I change my mind.

522
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,248
You stupid witch.

523
00:39:07,076 --> 00:39:10,037
We may not be murderers,
but we're no angels either.

524
00:40:58,812 --> 00:41:00,063
<i>Good morning, San Francisco.</i>

525
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,732
<i>Well, it looks like it's going to be
a gorgeous Monday morning</i>

526
00:41:02,899 --> 00:41:04,401
<i>here in the Bay Area...</i>

527
00:41:05,151 --> 00:41:08,196
She really needs another shtick,
that one's getting boring.

528
00:41:08,363 --> 00:41:11,074
Maybe she should hire Joanne Hertz,
boost her ratings.

529
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:13,660
Speaking of the she-devil herself,

530
00:41:13,827 --> 00:41:15,912
did you ever call
to reschedule your segment?

531
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,664
No, I'm not going to.

532
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:20,375
- Why?
- I've decided to quit my job.

533
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:21,793
What?

534
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,379
And, actually, I owe it all to Joanne.

535
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:26,840
She made me realise
that somehow I'd forgotten

536
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:28,842
what my dreams were.
Still are.

537
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,469
I always wanted to be a chef
and have my own restaurant,

538
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:32,887
not manage one.

539
00:41:33,054 --> 00:41:36,266
It's a good job and the pay's okay,
but it's not my dream job.

540
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:39,519
I think that's great. I really do.

541
00:41:39,852 --> 00:41:45,942
And don't worry, if you need any help
trolling the classifieds, I am an expert.

542
00:41:54,992 --> 00:41:57,912
Prue? Are you all right?

543
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,957
Yeah, actually, I am.

544
00:42:01,457 --> 00:42:04,627
Andy's been exonerated.
They're now looking for Rodriguez.

545
00:42:04,794 --> 00:42:06,629
Good luck.

546
00:42:07,421 --> 00:42:09,966
Hey, are you sure you're all right?

547
00:42:10,132 --> 00:42:11,759
Yeah.

548
00:42:12,134 --> 00:42:14,303
I was just thinking about
all that we've been through

549
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,514
since we became witches.

550
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:18,224
- Give you a headache?
- No, actually.

551
00:42:18,391 --> 00:42:20,142
It gave me a good feeling.

552
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:21,727
I mean, look, it's a hassle

553
00:42:21,894 --> 00:42:23,813
and can sometimes screw up
our personal lives...

554
00:42:23,979 --> 00:42:28,359
- Amen to that.
- And we do good things together.

555
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,237
It helps offset the bad things.

556
00:42:33,614 --> 00:42:35,658
I'm gonna really miss Andy.

557
00:42:36,826 --> 00:42:38,744
It's gonna be very sad without him.

558
00:42:40,913 --> 00:42:43,457
Something tells me
that he'll always be with us.

559
00:42:48,003 --> 00:42:50,381
We better get ready for work.

560
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:54,802
I'll tell her later.

561
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,096
- Tell me what?
- Nothing. It's not important.

562
00:42:57,262 --> 00:43:00,474
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
