00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,961
Previously on Charmed

2
00:00:03,286 --> 00:00:05,171
VoilÃ .
New identities.

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,872
How is it you can see your other selves reflected in the mirror ?

4
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:09,195
It's part of the spell.

5
00:00:09,196 --> 00:00:11,255
You know, this just might work.

6
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:13,175
What's your name anyway ?

7
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:14,180
Billie.

8
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,201
How long have you been a witch ?

9
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:20,649
Not that long, just up to really recently.
I noticed I had these... these powers.

10
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:21,685
Who is he ?

11
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:25,513
I don't know his name.
He's some guy that I used to see in the elevator all the time at work.

12
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:27,331
I'm Julie, Phoebe's cousin.

13
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:29,279
Dex, Dex Lawson.

14
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:32,166
- Hey the paper called for you.
- Really ? What did they want ?

15
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:35,171
I think they wanna talk to you,
or cousin you.

16
00:00:35,172 --> 00:00:38,535
Apparently the newspaper is having a hard time getting the advice column out.

17
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:40,415
So they asked me to help out a little bit.

18
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,806
Which I thought that was kind a weird, but I said sure.

19
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,110
Did you have something...

20
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,863
I ran into here out of the elevator, I told her I thought,

21
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:48,337
you might be able to help.

22
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:53,270
Piper, you're gonna be late.

23
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:55,061
I can orb you.

24
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:58,657
No, no. We no orb, we drive like normal people.

25
00:00:58,695 --> 00:01:00,741
Yeah but normal people get stuck in traffic jams.

26
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:04,458
Did you know put my several earrings back after you borrowed them ?

27
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,578
Piper, you're stalling.

28
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,830
I'm not stalling.

29
00:01:08,437 --> 00:01:09,468
Well, you look great.

30
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:14,246
It's ok, if you're scared.
I'ts understandable.

31
00:01:14,272 --> 00:01:15,418
I'm not scared.

32
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,950
Oh yeah right, that's why you changed outfits three times.

33
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,812
Alright, maybe I am a little nervous.

34
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:23,166
I don't really know why I'm doing this anyway.

35
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:25,393
Maybe you're doing this because it's what you wanna do.

36
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:28,271
What if you get nothing else at being dead to the world.

37
00:01:28,316 --> 00:01:29,755
And to the underworld.

38
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:31,466
At least you went out and tried to do something new.

39
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,719
You know, you expended your own rises.

40
00:01:34,097 --> 00:01:35,387
Who writes your stuff ?

41
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:39,202
The thing is you just need to relax a little, ok.
Piper, it's just an interview.

42
00:01:39,203 --> 00:01:41,838
With the corporate head hunter who is gonna do what,

43
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:44,954
- give me a job at I.B.M. ? I don't think so.
- I thought you wanted this.

44
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:47,115
No, actually it was Dad's idea.
He said it'll help.

45
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:49,256
Because he knew you wanted to try something new.

46
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,207
No, I am perfectly happy running P3.

47
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,664
You were not happy last week about anything.

48
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:56,406
One little minute down, ok ?

49
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,328
I'm aloud.

50
00:01:57,415 --> 00:02:00,862
Ok, look. The point is you've got a new recent life.
We all do.

51
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:03,365
And you need to just pick your own advice, you know?

52
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,840
Get out there. See if there are other people you wanna mingle with and talk to.

53
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:09,358
And what about all the demons in the world ?

54
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:10,969
We've got Billie for that.

55
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,311
And she's just a kid, what if she can't handle it ?

56
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:17,111
She will. She's learning, and I've got her upstairs studying right now.

57
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:20,419
Yeah and as far is the play date you know I've got it covered.

58
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,394
I know.
But really little canny is...

59
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:25,516
is allergic to peanut butter, I know.
You told me, you're stalling.

60
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:30,665
I just wish I didn't feel like this cause it's a fraud.

61
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:33,066
All you need to do

62
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:34,765
is remember the you

63
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:36,644
that's on the inside, ok ?

64
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:38,199
And besides,

65
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,824
who's gonna figure it out ?

66
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:41,551
Jenny.

67
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:47,742
Put your hands on your head.

68
00:02:47,873 --> 00:02:48,634
Now.

69
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:00,494
Save it Maya, I know you understand me.

70
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,460
You're under arrest for murder.

71
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:10,217
Damn you !

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000

Particular thanks to Any1

78
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:56,866
Oh my God ! Oh my God she...

79
00:04:57,858 --> 00:04:58,844
Are you ok ?

80
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:02,316
Yeah, yeah, I'm ok.

81
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:06,315
That was... that was awesome !

82
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:09,624
Awesome ?! You almost blew the house up.
How was that awesome ?

83
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:13,321
Oh just the addict besides this place is a ragged.
You guys ever put anything away ?

84
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:15,367
You were just supposed to be reading.

85
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:17,092
- That what I was doing !
- Although what happened ?

86
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:20,100
I don't know. Remember,
I'm very very new at this.

87
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:23,248
You read the spell aloud, didn't you ?

88
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:25,047
Yes, I read it aloud.

89
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:27,053
That's not reading, that is chanting.

90
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:28,084
And that,

91
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,008
is how things go boom.

92
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:34,008
Ok, cool. Lesson learnt.
What's next ?

93
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:35,594
What's next ?

94
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:38,716
It's that you go back to college and take a break from all this.

95
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:42,130
Why ? It was just one little mistake.
Haven' t you heard of the learning curve ?

96
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:44,274
Look, I'm her because you need me, right ?

97
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:47,481
So you girls can go, have a normal life,
while I go kick some demon ass.

98
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:50,782
So the more you teach me,
the more I can get out there and go do my thing.

99
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:52,632
The first thing you're gonna be doing,

100
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:54,620
is cleaning up your mess.

101
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,373
Why ? Can't you just cast a spell and make it pick itself up ?

102
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:02,933
That would be something called personnal gain,
which is something we don't do. Ok ?

103
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:07,146
Plus, we wanna keep to use magic to a minimum
so the demons don't find out we're still alive.

104
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:11,932
Oh. Okay, yeah. I have three chicks move in under the same roof.
Hello, how dumb can they be ?

105
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:13,683
Sorry.

106
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,029
Look. I get that spells and witchcraft and potions, they're really fun.

107
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:21,586
It was not long ago that I was kind of going throuh the same thing,
learning her ropes.

108
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:22,635
But here's the deal.

109
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,431
It's actually really dangerous
and until you respect that,

110
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:28,533
you're not gonna really truly learn anything.

111
00:06:28,644 --> 00:06:32,569
Ok, you might be right. I will.
I will respect it, I promise.

112
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:33,873
Thank you.

113
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:35,561
So when can we go vanquish demons ?

114
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,157
Hey. Don't look at me.
You're her whitelighter.

115
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:43,122
Yes I realize she's there to help us all Paige, but I'm working.

116
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:46,554
And you will too as soon as she's got your stuff together.

117
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,751
- Julie ? Dex Lawson's here to see you.
- Oh I got to go, I got to go.

118
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:53,269
My future husband's here, my future's husband's here,
I got to go, I'll see you at lunch, I'll see you...

119
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:57,724
- Bad time ?
- No, this is a great time. Come on in.

120
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,144
You wanna sit ?

121
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:01,969
I can't, I got to get back to work.

122
00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:04,574
I just wanna stop to see how the new job is going.

123
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:05,610
The new job ?

124
00:07:06,461 --> 00:07:08,950
Oh right, I'm sorry.

125
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:10,784
I completely blanked.

126
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:13,009
Uh... it's great.

127
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,623
It's like I've been here for years.

128
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:18,435
Well chose, sounds just like her.

129
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:19,474
Who ?

130
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:21,157
Phoebe.

131
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:23,049
The column advice.

132
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:24,691
Right, of course.

133
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:26,390
Yeah, I mean it Julie. It's uncanny.

134
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,305
It's... it's almost like you channel on her or something.

135
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,881
Oh I've gotta to work on that cause that's kind a weird.

136
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:36,455
So, you called about something ?

137
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:38,911
Yes I did.

138
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,509
How do feel about art shows ?

139
00:07:42,826 --> 00:07:44,532
Eh bien, Ã§a dÃ©pend de l'art.

140
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:47,364
- How do you feel about my art ?
- I love it.

141
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:48,936
Good answer.

142
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:53,456
Look, I know we've only gone out a couple of times, but

143
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:55,942
I was just wondering if...

144
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:58,767
I'd love to.

145
00:07:58,768 --> 00:07:59,665
Love to what ?

146
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:01,789
I'd love to come to your art show tonight.

147
00:08:02,258 --> 00:08:04,653
If that's what you were asking.

148
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,295
I was trying to.

149
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:08,410
How did you know ?

150
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:09,711
I'm psychic.

151
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:20,923
What happened ?

152
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,466
The Earth moved.

153
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:26,728
Sometimes life just throws you a curve ball.

154
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:31,285
And I'm Piper's cousin, so somebody had to stop and to take care of the kids.

155
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:33,257
Of course, it's very noble of you.

156
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:38,955
- Still. How do you expect to work full time if you...
- Oh well, I have two other cousins

157
00:08:38,956 --> 00:08:41,170
who can pitch in and the boys,

158
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:43,712
well, they have a man around,

159
00:08:43,713 --> 00:08:44,837
an other cousin,

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,117
by marriage,

161
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:47,073
my marriage.

162
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:48,157
I'm married.

163
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:50,295
It's all on the application.

164
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,336
Isn't it ?

165
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:54,835
Yes, yes it's all here, miss Bennett.

166
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:55,794
Jenny.

167
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:57,156
Jenny.

168
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,106
I'm wasting your time.

169
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,954
No, no. It's not that at all.

170
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:04,188
Your resume is

171
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:05,459
very impressive.

172
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,298
Really.

173
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:09,409
Anybody Victor recommends for that is alright about me.

174
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:10,365
Just,

175
00:09:11,447 --> 00:09:12,380
Just what ?

176
00:09:12,771 --> 00:09:15,343
Frankly I get the impression you don't really wanna be here.

177
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:17,448
Oh no, no that's not true.

178
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:18,376
Really.

179
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,672
Well, maybe it's a little bit true.

180
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:22,658
But,

181
00:09:23,307 --> 00:09:24,291
honestly,

182
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,871
I really don't know what I'm doing with my life at the moment.

183
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,749
This change,

184
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:32,548
this tragedy,

185
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:38,258
has really forced me to open my eyes,
and see just how far my life got off track.

186
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:41,847
And after a while it just seems like one big battle after another.

187
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:44,723
Oh yes, the metaphor of battles we face each day.

188
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:45,715
Yeah.

189
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,480
Except my more little more is litteral.

190
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:52,428
But my point is I'm here because I wanna find myself again.

191
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:55,998
I wanna dedicate part of my life to a new purpose.

192
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:59,220
And really, I work very hard.

193
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:00,810
And I'm very good with people.

194
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:03,251
- You don't have to sell yourself on me Jenny.
- I don't ?

195
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:05,816
No, the credentials speak for themselves.

196
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,298
Besides,

197
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,133
you're honest, straightforward,

198
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:12,352
very important traits every high level exert should have.

199
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:14,310
high level exert ?

200
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:17,713
That why I place you based on everything I'm seing here.

201
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:19,432
Smile.

202
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:23,661
It's for the background check, it's pro forma.

203
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:25,181
Background check ?

204
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:28,622
Give me a couple of days 'til I can come up with,
and we'll meet again wednesday.

205
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:30,789
- Is that alright ?
- Are you kidding ?

206
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:32,281
That's great.

207
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:33,561
Thank you.

208
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:35,018
Sure.

209
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:10,007
We've got a problem.

210
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:12,301
Actually, it wasn't a problem at all.

211
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:14,684
It went a lot better than I thought it would.

212
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,101
Well I won't say I told you so.

213
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:17,743
Good, don't.

214
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,132
How is the model crew ?

215
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,132
They're doing fine,
they're enjoying their sundaes as we speak.

216
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:26,829
Actually I was talking about the mums,
be careful of Eve.

217
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,630
- She's kind of the evil.
- Piper.

218
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:29,517
What ?

219
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:32,335
I can handle it.
Enjoy your lunch, celebrate.

220
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,756
Celebrate what ?

221
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,207
Your new life !

222
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,030
Use your words sweetie.

223
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:45,270
Uh ! I swear if Edith of one more time ???
she's gotta go.

224
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,136
Get rid of her ciment shoe city.

225
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:49,358
This is jocking, of course.

226
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,161
Oh, I get it.

227
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:51,889
Just, pretend I'm one of the girls.

228
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:54,710
Mummy said use your words.

229
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:57,561
Does this aggro stage ever stop ?

230
00:11:57,562 --> 00:11:59,360
Not if you're like my husband.

231
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:03,058
Believe it or not, some men are sensitive.

232
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:04,978
Look at you, what you're doing.

233
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,705
Taking care of your cousin's kids.

234
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,630
It's what family does.

235
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:12,072
Yeah but most won't set aside their carrier for the sake of the children.

236
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:13,895
God, I just...

237
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,306
I really admire you.

238
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:18,219
Ok, enough.

239
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,576
I'm sorry sweetie, but mummy told you if you can't use it safely
she's taking it away.

240
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,886
Come on.

241
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:25,829
And all on your own.

242
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:27,573
No ring.

243
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:29,413
You're not married ?

244
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:32,580
Oh, uh... actually it's a long story.

245
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:35,255
Mummy, mummy !

246
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:40,252
Oh God ! I'm so sorry.

247
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:42,681
- Oops !
- It's ok, it was just, it was an accident.

248
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:44,179
Here, let me clean that off.

249
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,535
Oh God !

250
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:02,702
Suspect is considered armed and dangerous.

251
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:05,117
So approach with extreme precautions Maya Holmes.

252
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,863
We don't wanna hurt civilians.
Copy then.

253
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:10,677
I don't know, I'm not just used to it I guess.

254
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:12,199
What ? Feeling happy ?

255
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:16,063
No, I mean the guy's probably just blewing smoke anyways.

256
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:18,501
He probably not gonna call with any real opportunities.

257
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:21,200
Oh that's the old Piper we all know and love.

258
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,127
Jenny.

259
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:23,362
Nobody's listenning.

260
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,602
And nobody cares !

261
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,723
That should be the effect.

262
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:28,506
You know what ? I hear that Dex cares.

263
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,791
Yeah until the earth quake destroys everything he's ever worked for.

264
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:33,667
What earth quake ?

265
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:35,560
I mean, talking about ruining a moment.

266
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:36,623
What moment ?

267
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:37,493
You know

268
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,536
the moment.

269
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:41,331
When you look into each others' eyes and you gotta feel

270
00:13:41,703 --> 00:13:43,795
the romance and the passion

271
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:45,284
the desire.

272
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:48,726
When such a very long moment since I've had a moment.

273
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,650
I mean, how am I supposed to marry a guy that I don't even know

274
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,016
without having the moment ?

275
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:56,314
But really back to this earth quake.

276
00:13:56,315 --> 00:13:59,366
Maybe your premonition was so you could stop it from happenning.

277
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:01,444
How am I supposed to stop an earth quake ?

278
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:04,195
Five point five, six, seven,
what are we talking about here ?

279
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:05,437
How am I supposed to know ?

280
00:14:05,438 --> 00:14:06,625
Maya Holmes,

281
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:08,021
this is the police.

282
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:10,681
Stand up, put your hands on your head.

283
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:14,947
I think they're talking to you.

284
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:25,904
There's somewhere you need to be ?

285
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:28,004
Oh yeah, you know, I just need to stop an earth quake.

286
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:29,045
Phoebe.

287
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:30,683
What ? It was your idea, Paige.

288
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:33,773
Yeah, that was before Piper got arrested for murder.

289
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,724
Oh my God !

290
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:41,146
Five minutes. Making count.

291
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,185
Oh honey,

292
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:44,169
orange is so not your color.

293
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,017
- Paige!
- What ? It's true.

294
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,739
Don't worry, because we fight demons,
we fight warlocks. This a just a minor blip.

295
00:14:52,444 --> 00:14:55,296
I don't think so.
They think I'm somebody else.

296
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:57,119
Well, you are somebody else.

297
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,359
No ! But I'm not a fugitive.
That's not the alias that I picked,

298
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,226
at least, not intentionnally.

299
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,095
Now, have you called Darryl ?

300
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,147
We did, and we left him a message,
but he's on the east coast now,

301
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:09,124
so I don't think he's gonna be able to help us.

302
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:11,618
Why did you choose this disguise anyway ?

303
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,546
I don't know, I just did.

304
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,785
Well you had to have got it somewhere,
you couldn't just plucked it out of the cosmos.

305
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,510
Well, no, I guess not.

306
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:22,084
Ok you have to try to remember.

307
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:24,323
You must have seen her face somewhere. Maybe

308
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:28,391
TV or internet or the newspaper, something.
Think.

309
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:30,798
Maybe it was a magazine.

310
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,555
A magazine, ok, good.
Any idea of which magazine ?

311
00:15:33,556 --> 00:15:34,726
How am I supposed to know ?

312
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:38,424
- Once in your hands, you always have them around the house.
- And you're going where with this ?

313
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:41,302
Well, I'm just thinking if we can find the picture that inspired her,

314
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,637
then we can use that to scry for the real Maya.

315
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,607
And that helps me how exactly ?

316
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:48,249
Because we'll orb you out and orb her back in.

317
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,435
- Get the real killer behind bars.
- Phoebe you can't orb me out of jail !

318
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:54,813
Yeah, I think we can if we do it simultaneously
nobody'll ever know.

319
00:15:54,814 --> 00:15:57,282
And you've got your own cell so there's no exposure risk.

320
00:15:57,284 --> 00:15:58,598
- Yes, but...
- No buts !

321
00:15:58,847 --> 00:15:59,884
This is what we're gonna do.

322
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:02,513
I'm gonna go to the newspaper and search the archives for Maya.

323
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:03,798
You go home and look for magazines.

324
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:04,783
Got it.

325
00:16:04,905 --> 00:16:06,166
Just, you know.

326
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,078
I saw a documentary on prison once.

327
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,348
You gonna be just fine.
All you have to do is

328
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:12,703
keep you eyes low and your shoulders high.

329
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:15,921
We're gonna have you out of this unflatting color in no time.

330
00:16:19,402 --> 00:16:20,842
Show no fear.

331
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:30,123
Uh... I thought I was gonna be alone.

332
00:16:30,124 --> 00:16:32,222
Now you've got company.

333
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:33,846
Play nice.

334
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:37,999
Lock it all Jones !

335
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:43,853
What are you smiling at ?

336
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:47,006
Me? I didn't smile.

337
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:51,331
I wasn't looking at nothing, and smiling at nothing.
I'm not doing nothing.

338
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:54,764
Ok.

339
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:58,890
Eyes low, shoulders high.

340
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:00,971
Leo!

341
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:03,258
You know, you really don't have to do that.

342
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:06,982
I insist. It's the least I can do since how my Tommy did the mess.

343
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:09,943
Are you sure that undershirt isn't dirty too ?

344
00:17:10,123 --> 00:17:10,998
Why don't we wash it ?

345
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:12,457
You know I can just throw it in the wash machine.

346
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,356
- Non sense.
- Here, let me.

347
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:14,901
Hey there !

348
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:16,755
Excuse me. Am I...

349
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:18,835
interrupting anything ?

350
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:20,625
Jo !

351
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,998
Eve. Jo. Jenny's cousin.

352
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:27,118
So, Louis, may I speak to you for a second ?

353
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:37,494
What the hell are you doing ?

354
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:39,080
What do you mean what am I doing ?

355
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:42,925
I gave the kids some sundaes and Eve's little son Tommy's spilt on me.

356
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:45,868
Yeah, whatever.
Why don't you just explain that to your wife

357
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,593
after we get her out of jail ?

358
00:17:47,622 --> 00:17:48,376
Jail ?

359
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:51,888
If you we'ren't so busy flirting,
maybe you would know about that already.

360
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:54,038
Look I wasn't flirting, ok ?
It was Eve.

361
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:55,355
You know what ? Nevermind.

362
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,763
What is going on ?

363
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,640
What happened is that Piper chose the wrong disguise

364
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:02,641
which unfortunately she found out after she was arrested for murder.

365
00:18:02,642 --> 00:18:03,932
- Murder ?
- Yes.

366
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:07,697
And apparently she thinks she got her alias out of a picture of one of these magazines.

367
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:08,885
Wait a second.

368
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,183
I don't have time for this. Neither does Piper.

369
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:13,070
So if you really really wanna help,

370
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,386
maybe go get rid of your lady friend.

371
00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:17,241
You know what? She's not my lady friend, ok ?

372
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:19,755
She is a friend but she is just a lady.

373
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:23,216
Whatever. Just please help me find Maya Holmes,
the real Maya Holmes.

374
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,498
Who ?

375
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,669
Just go.

376
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:49,950
Something's going on !

377
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,989
Is that a demon problem ?
Is it ? Is it ? Is it ?

378
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,950
Not now Billie.

379
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:54,991
Are you making a potion as in a vanquishing potion ?

380
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,652
Oh come on Paige, teach me.
I'm here to learn, amn't I ?

381
00:18:57,915 --> 00:19:00,392
It's a big problem, ok ?
It's a big problem.

382
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:01,452
I've been studying the book.

383
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:03,684
- I know how vanquishing demons, I know...
- It's not a demon problem !

384
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,021
What kind of problem is there ?

385
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:06,827
It's Piper in jail the problem.

386
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:07,913
In jail ?

387
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:11,802
They're confusing her with somebody and
that's somebody else is who

388
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:13,005
I have to scry for.

389
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:15,378
- Oh scrying I love that.
- No, no, no.

390
00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:16,938
What if it doesn't work ?

391
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,656
It has to work.
That's why we're doing this the old fashionned way.

392
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:21,854
No laptop scrying.

393
00:19:22,046 --> 00:19:24,054
Old fashionned. Keep it simple.

394
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:26,484
Oh, please work !

395
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:32,779
Let's just hang on a second cause we could work something out here,
you know.

396
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:36,708
We're both grown adults and I wasn't smiling and you weren't smiling at me.

397
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:38,390
Holmes ! You've got a visit.

398
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:41,320
Holmes ? That's me !

399
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:43,047
I got to go !

400
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:44,164
Ok !

401
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:46,358
See you later !

402
00:19:57,651 --> 00:19:58,513
Hello Maya.

403
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:03,879
Good to see you.

404
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,842
It's good to see you too.

405
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,742
Are you my lawyer ?

406
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:11,564
No, I don't think so.

407
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:14,044
I think I'll be prosecuting this one.

408
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:15,838
Personnally.

409
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:18,977
I see.

410
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:21,197
So what do you want ?

411
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:22,873
I just want to see you again,
that's all.

412
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,991
In private.

413
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:31,118
Did you really think you'd get away with it ?

414
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,203
Running from the law ?

415
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:35,316
Running from me ?

416
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,047
I guess I did.

417
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:42,410
What did I ever do to you Maya ?

418
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:45,346
What did I ever do to deserve this ?

419
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:48,232
Why don't you tell me.

420
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:49,819
I offered you the world.

421
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,980
I gave you everything I could.

422
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:53,106
And then you just...

423
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:55,972
You just threw it back in my face, didn't you ?

424
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:58,461
What did you expect?
I just let you get away with it ?

425
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,823
It was time for me to move on.

426
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:04,205
No, it wasn't time.

427
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:06,170
It wasn't time at all.

428
00:21:07,193 --> 00:21:09,041
Not until I said so.

429
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:12,406
I warned you not to mess with me, didn't I ?

430
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:14,704
I told you what would happen if you left me for that

431
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,520
that photografer.

432
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:17,774
What did you ever saw in him ?

433
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:20,303
What could he possibly given you that I couldn't ?

434
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,662
Just youth ?

435
00:21:23,878 --> 00:21:25,316
Well it didn't hurt.

436
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,524
Yeah it did. It hurt a lot.

437
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:30,532
It costed his life, didn't it ?

438
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:34,037
And now I'm gonna see to what costs you yours.

439
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:38,668
It was you ?

440
00:21:39,393 --> 00:21:41,132
It wasn't her at all.

441
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:43,284
What kind of game are you playing now ?

442
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:45,244
What do you like to know ?

443
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,669
You don't have anything on me.

444
00:21:48,816 --> 00:21:50,669
You wouldn't have caught, if you did.

445
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,745
Are you sure about that ?

446
00:21:54,457 --> 00:21:55,961
I'll see you in court.

447
00:22:01,794 --> 00:22:04,026
You won't get that far Maya.

448
00:22:27,205 --> 00:22:29,782
- Anything on Maya yet ?
- You did just ask me like two minutes ago.

449
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:33,797
- Well I've got dead lines too, you know.
- Well you would do in fugitive's advice now too ?

450
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:35,942
Sorry.

451
00:22:35,943 --> 00:22:38,085
Just give me another minute.

452
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:38,757
Ok.

453
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:41,137
Hey Greg ! I've been looking all over for you.

454
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:42,813
- How is the baby ?
- Fine.

455
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,475
How do you know about her ?

456
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,905
Well, what ? Of course I know about the... I mean...

457
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:51,333
You know, do I have to explain this everytime ?

458
00:22:52,817 --> 00:22:53,527
Nevermind.

459
00:22:53,528 --> 00:22:55,452
- Let's talk earth quakes.
- Earth quakes ?

460
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:58,600
Yeah, earth quakes.
I think it's really important that we run a story,

461
00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:01,094
maybe even in tonight's edition,

462
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:03,341
about earth quakes preparedness.
What do you think ?

463
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:04,249
Why ?

464
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:05,646
Why,

465
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,320
well, I think it's really important that people are prepared for earth quakes.

466
00:23:10,352 --> 00:23:12,681
You know, I mean one can strike at any time,

467
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:15,078
one could even hit tonight, you know.

468
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:16,818
I think I have got something.

469
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:20,390
Ok. Evening edition, right ?
Safety first, right ?

470
00:23:20,396 --> 00:23:21,681
- Ok, let it on me.
- Ok, so.

471
00:23:21,682 --> 00:23:26,166
Basically Maya Holmes was a local model used to date
Walter Nance, the ADA.

472
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:26,800
Ok.

473
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:29,515
Ok well, she left him for some photografer

474
00:23:29,516 --> 00:23:32,477
who was found shot to death in his appartment two weeks later.

475
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:35,489
It was a lovers' core.
Crime of passion, this kind of things.

476
00:23:35,528 --> 00:23:38,227
Right, she did it. I get it.
What I wanna know is how can I find her ?

477
00:23:38,228 --> 00:23:41,739
But she's already been found.
I mean they arrested her this morning.

478
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:44,267
Yeah, but

479
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:48,611
I mean, wouldn't it be just crazy if she had a twin ?

480
00:23:48,783 --> 00:23:49,787
Well that's the story.

481
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:52,193
Keep looking, ok ?
I wanna know relatives,

482
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:55,039
agents, friends, whatever you can find.

483
00:23:57,345 --> 00:23:58,514
Remind you somebody ?

484
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,861
Ok. You gotta be careful.

485
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:09,319
Oh come on. How dangerous can a model be ?

486
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:14,903
Lamp !

487
00:24:17,742 --> 00:24:19,452
Oh, that was close.

488
00:24:19,486 --> 00:24:21,037
Good! Fear !

489
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:22,413
You're making progress !

490
00:24:25,771 --> 00:24:27,561
Guess what ?

491
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:32,711
Lunch time for the guards means me and you get to finish what we started.

492
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:39,545
Ok, right.
Now,

493
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:43,488
you'll see you had to be a tough guy.

494
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:50,334
There is more with that came from !

495
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:03,073
No, wait, don't, don't hit me again.
I, I won't hurt you, I promise.

496
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,125
It worked !

497
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,457
What happened ?
What did you do?

498
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:14,153
We switched you out with the real Maya Holmes.

499
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,931
Oh, well, that's great.

500
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:18,260
But she is innocent.

501
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:21,758
I tried Judge Watkins, and Judge Kingley,
and none of them called me.

502
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,263
Then call Chief Aliss.

503
00:25:23,492 --> 00:25:25,105
Remind him he owes me.

504
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:27,510
I want Maya released now.

505
00:25:27,587 --> 00:25:30,722
With all due respect sir,
don't you think you might be overreacting ?

506
00:25:30,755 --> 00:25:32,506
I mean, after all, how do you know she's not bluffing ?

507
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:36,044
Are you willing to bet your carrier on it ?
Because I'm sure you're not.

508
00:25:36,626 --> 00:25:39,934
I know Maya.
She should have been scared but she wasn't.

509
00:25:40,817 --> 00:25:42,325
She's got something on me.

510
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,211
And I got to stop here before it gets out.

511
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:48,618
- Stop her how ?
- How do think ?!

512
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,976
I still say you should let the system do its job.

513
00:25:51,977 --> 00:25:54,125
I am the system !

514
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,595
Where's Harvey ?

515
00:25:57,705 --> 00:25:59,123
I'll look my best,

516
00:25:59,264 --> 00:26:00,780
for Maya.

517
00:26:06,835 --> 00:26:08,107
Botox ?

518
00:26:08,427 --> 00:26:09,162
No.

519
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:10,486
Thanks.

520
00:26:14,352 --> 00:26:17,024
How were we supposed to know.
They said you're alone.

521
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,989
Well, obviously, I wasn't.

522
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,225
You're sure she didn't see you orb ?

523
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:25,181
No, fortunately I think she was seing stars at the moment.

524
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,794
Can we get back to why you think Maya is innocent
and what we're gonna do about it ?

525
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,687
I don't think Maya's inncocent,
I know she is.

526
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:34,167
Nance basically admitted to killing the photografer.

527
00:26:34,168 --> 00:26:35,813
Nance, the District Attorney ?

528
00:26:35,935 --> 00:26:37,363
- Yeah.
- Great.

529
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:38,833
Well can't we just vanquish him ?

530
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:43,104
We don't usually vanquish humans.

531
00:26:43,191 --> 00:26:44,693
Just asking.

532
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,033
Billie, maybe you should go upstairs
and study for a little bit.

533
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,631
What ? Why ?
I've been studying all day! I...

534
00:26:49,855 --> 00:26:51,507
Billie, just... Please.

535
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:52,643
Fine.

536
00:26:53,162 --> 00:26:54,500
Just like living at home again !

537
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,729
Pratice patience !

538
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,595
So if Nance's guilty,
we need proof.

539
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:02,241
She must have something on him.

540
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:05,104
Either, why didn't she use it ?
Why run ?

541
00:27:05,303 --> 00:27:07,876
She's probably scared.
He's a high powered district attorney.

542
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:10,760
He's well connected,
and she wouldn't stand a change against him.

543
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,314
Which is why you need to switch us back.

544
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:15,277
What ?
No way to put you back in jail.

545
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:18,175
Just long enough for you to find out what she's got on him.

546
00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:19,557
What about your cell mate ?

547
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:22,173
I think I can take care of myself.

548
00:27:22,653 --> 00:27:25,953
Ok, well, I think that should give me enough time to stop Dex's show.

549
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:27,291
Excuse me ?

550
00:27:27,554 --> 00:27:28,667
Look, I didn't ask for this,

551
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,564
and if I don't do something,
then the premonition about us getting married...

552
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:32,722
not gonna happen.

553
00:27:33,023 --> 00:27:35,787
And the future child premonition,
that's not gonna happen either.

554
00:27:36,062 --> 00:27:38,179
Yeah, ok, go.
Fantastic, good idea.

555
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:39,413
Ok.

556
00:27:39,983 --> 00:27:41,344
Eyes low, shoulders high !

557
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,224
I'm gonna go check on Billie.

558
00:27:44,922 --> 00:27:46,149
That's a good idea.

559
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:50,630
Well, I get it.

560
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,877
Hi Karl !

561
00:27:57,996 --> 00:27:59,559
You're the dude banging on my wife ?

562
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:03,787
What's going on ?

563
00:28:04,222 --> 00:28:05,554
Uh... I don't know.

564
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:07,210
Uh... Yeah, I didn't do anything.

565
00:28:08,113 --> 00:28:09,212
It was Eve.

566
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:11,918
What exactly did Eve do ?

567
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,576
Oh come on Piper.

568
00:28:15,718 --> 00:28:17,285
You know me !

569
00:28:17,554 --> 00:28:21,693
I do, and I also know Eve.
So you must have done something to encourage her.

570
00:28:21,944 --> 00:28:23,856
No, nothing.
I, except, maybe, you know,

571
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:25,329
she thought that I was single.

572
00:28:25,928 --> 00:28:28,155
Oh! You didn't tell her you were married.

573
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,304
No, look. It all happened so fast !

574
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:33,541
We've never really got the chance to discuss.
You know.

575
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:37,783
Everything without the disguises.
I mean, we don't even have our rings on our fingers, so...

576
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:40,175
That's a good story.

577
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,794
Now, get back into position.

578
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:44,643
What ? Why ?

579
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,569
Well, we've gotta save Maya,
we've got stuff to do.

580
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:49,639
So let's get this over with you guy going get back into position.

581
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,896
You are so enjoying this, aren't you ?

582
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:53,874
Yeah.

583
00:29:00,937 --> 00:29:03,912
Wow. Now, don't you feel better ?

584
00:29:03,963 --> 00:29:07,462
Ok, thanks for stopping bye Karl.
Say hi to Eve for me, okay ?

585
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:10,149
See you later.

586
00:29:21,452 --> 00:29:21,990
You wanna do what ?

587
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:23,526
Cancel my show ?

588
00:29:25,214 --> 00:29:27,159
Well, maybe not cancel,
maybe just postpone.

589
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:28,758
Why ?

590
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:29,736
Why ?

591
00:29:30,255 --> 00:29:34,003
Did you not read the article on earth quake preparedness in the newspaper today ?

592
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:37,535
I mean, we're do for a major shaker at any moment.
Actually, over do.

593
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,570
A major shaker, uh ?

594
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:44,587
Yes, a major shaker and imagine what it will do to your art work.
It will be desasters.

595
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:49,455
- I think I can risk it for the night.
- No.

596
00:29:49,523 --> 00:29:51,084
You can't.

597
00:29:51,347 --> 00:29:55,187
- Wait, you're serious, aren't you ?
- Yeah, I'm really serious.

598
00:29:55,187 --> 00:29:58,884
Julie, I can't cancel my show.
I got every major accredit in town incoming.

599
00:29:59,237 --> 00:30:00,151
Let's make a break from me.

600
00:30:01,194 --> 00:30:05,691
Ok, then, if we cannot move the show,
we're gonna move your art work.

601
00:30:06,254 --> 00:30:08,410
- To that is safe, you know ?
- Hey, easy with that.

602
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:10,617
You put that right there, good.

603
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:14,673
And now I'm thinking if we had some like rope, you know,
and some crazy glue...

604
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:15,454
What are you doing ?

605
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:17,571
Are you nuts ?

606
00:30:17,936 --> 00:30:18,300
No.

607
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,824
I just want anything to ruin your moment for tonight.
That's all.

608
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:26,002
Oh my God !
Did you feel that ?

609
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:27,263
Yeah.

610
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,329
Well hurry up !
We've got work to do !

611
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,977
You move this one here.

612
00:30:36,756 --> 00:30:38,161
Maybe we shouldn't have let Billie do this.

613
00:30:39,121 --> 00:30:41,830
Oh it's better her going in to see if it's safe for us to orb

614
00:30:41,865 --> 00:30:43,899
especially since you still look like Maya.

615
00:30:44,449 --> 00:30:47,578
Besides, if Billie's gonna start helping,
she might as well do it now.

616
00:30:47,871 --> 00:30:50,468
Yeah but she's supposed to be helping us with demons, not cops.

617
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,849
Oh, here she comes.

618
00:30:55,503 --> 00:30:57,378
Hey, bad news.
Maya is not in there.

619
00:30:57,678 --> 00:30:58,670
What do you mean she's not in there ?

620
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:00,513
They just released her to a Nance's custody.

621
00:31:00,786 --> 00:31:01,709
Nance ? Why ?

622
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,281
So he can shut her up.

623
00:31:05,915 --> 00:31:08,976
You seemed so much sure of yourself today in jail, Maya.

624
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:11,445
Not so sure of yourself now, are you ?

625
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:12,745
What are you talking about ?

626
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:15,098
I told you I didn't see you in jail today.

627
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,982
I don't even know how I got in jail.

628
00:31:16,982 --> 00:31:18,226
That's not what you've said before.

629
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,798
You said you wanted to get caught!
You said,

630
00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:24,060
I believe the exact words were :
"see you in court."

631
00:31:24,725 --> 00:31:26,458
You should know better than to threaten me.

632
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,327
Now, what exactly is it you have on me, Maya ?

633
00:31:38,848 --> 00:31:40,328
Walter, please, calm down.

634
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:44,775
- See, don't you hit bring her here?
- So he can kill her, everyone knows he billed her out.

635
00:31:45,094 --> 00:31:48,293
Yeah, I know Nance,
he's probably already thought about that.

636
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,602
What do you mean know Nance ?
You met him once ?

637
00:31:50,954 --> 00:31:52,323
Once was enough, believe me.

638
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:56,496
I'm telling you the truth I don't know what's going on.
I swear, I don't have anything.

639
00:31:56,496 --> 00:31:57,850
I don't believe you.

640
00:31:58,707 --> 00:31:59,635
I can't risk it.

641
00:32:00,556 --> 00:32:02,962
I beg you, don't kill me too.

642
00:32:03,307 --> 00:32:04,733
It is n't murder, Maya.

643
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,940
It's suicide.

644
00:32:08,585 --> 00:32:11,156
- Oh my God !
- Orb orb !

645
00:32:15,847 --> 00:32:16,679
Oh that was close.

646
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:18,906
Hurry, get the mattress.

647
00:32:19,488 --> 00:32:20,611
What is it doesn't work ?

648
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:22,275
Well then it was a bad idea !

649
00:32:23,052 --> 00:32:24,267
Mattress !

650
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:37,439
- Where I am ?
- You're dead, come on.

651
00:32:47,188 --> 00:32:47,706
Here.

652
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:49,966
It'll soon make you feel better.

653
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:53,398
I just...

654
00:32:54,254 --> 00:32:55,553
I still don't understand.

655
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:57,551
- I've never heard of...
- witches ?

656
00:32:57,902 --> 00:33:00,160
Ok, come on, sure you have.
It's like the Wizard of Oz.

657
00:33:00,665 --> 00:33:02,055
Except we're not wicked.

658
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,140
You've seen the Wizard of Oz, right ?

659
00:33:04,511 --> 00:33:07,313
Yeah, of course, but I never thought witches were real.

660
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,925
Real enough to save you.

661
00:33:10,185 --> 00:33:13,416
You actually seem more like guardian angels to me.

662
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:15,911
I don't know about that. I mean

663
00:33:15,963 --> 00:33:18,060
I'm actually pretty new at this myself.

664
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,583
I only met the sisters, I mean,

665
00:33:19,794 --> 00:33:23,133
the cousins, a couple of weeks ago.
They do this sort of things all the time.

666
00:33:23,448 --> 00:33:24,848
Or at least, they used to.

667
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,031
I...

668
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:28,020
I don't know what to say.

669
00:33:28,021 --> 00:33:30,976
There is nothing else to say,
all that matters now is that you're safe.

670
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,059
Sorry, I kicked you in the face.

671
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,875
I'm sorry we almost got you killed.

672
00:33:37,622 --> 00:33:39,779
He's not gonna stop coming after me, you know ?

673
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:41,889
He'll figure out I'm alive, sooner or later.

674
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,094
I know, I know. They're working on that.
Isn't there any sort of proof you have...

675
00:33:45,095 --> 00:33:47,387
If I did, don't think I would have use it by now ?

676
00:33:47,388 --> 00:33:52,422
I mean, Walter is crazy, obssessed.
He thinks I betrayed him, but I didn't.

677
00:33:52,602 --> 00:33:55,879
The only crime I committed was leaving him for a younger man.

678
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,237
What do you mean ?

679
00:33:57,418 --> 00:34:01,822
Walter can't stand the fact he's getting older.
He's like paranoid about it.

680
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,990
He does everything he can to pretend it's not happenning,

681
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:07,901
like lift, Botox, implants...

682
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:11,991
Even has a manucure coming over every night to keep his nails neat and trim.

683
00:34:12,138 --> 00:34:13,815
Like that was any good.

684
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:18,751
Now what if if we swap Maya's identity for a new one ?

685
00:34:18,812 --> 00:34:19,857
Are you kidding ?

686
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,647
I think we're having enough identity issues as it is.

687
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:25,352
Well, we're running out of options people.

688
00:34:25,353 --> 00:34:27,124
No, there's gonna be another way.

689
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,788
What if she went back on the run ?

690
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:32,389
No, that's just a matter of time before she get caught.
I mean, she's the prime suspect.

691
00:34:32,473 --> 00:34:33,944
You can't magically make that go away.

692
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,547
Excuse me guys but I have this great idea.

693
00:34:36,548 --> 00:34:39,445
It's too bad we can't prove that he threw her from his balconney.

694
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:43,571
Now it's gonna look like she escaped from him.
At least that's the way he's gonna spin it.

695
00:34:43,572 --> 00:34:44,779
So you see though, I have a great ...

696
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,945
I think the only way to save Maya,

697
00:34:46,946 --> 00:34:49,463
is to get him to confess to the murder somehow.

698
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:52,155
Oh, that happens when, before ar after hell freezes over ?

699
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,507
- But I'm telling you!
- Wait a minute.

700
00:34:53,514 --> 00:34:54,753
What about a true spell ?

701
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:57,094
- We've gonna have to get close.
- We can try orbying.

702
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,868
Or you could try listenning to me !

703
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:01,304
Thank you.

704
00:35:02,758 --> 00:35:08,150
According to the book of shadows,
this would not be the first time you scare somebody into confession, right ?

705
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:11,176
Six or seven years ago,
it was upon Broka or something ?

706
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,483
Waouh! Someone's done her homework !

707
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:15,660
I'm impressed.

708
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:19,454
Yeah, but we didn't do it. We got a ghost to do it.

709
00:35:19,455 --> 00:35:21,660
Yeah, I know, but you guys can change looks, right ?

710
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,433
You can make him think he's seeing a ghost.

711
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:25,114
Where are you going with this ?

712
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:27,821
I'm going,

713
00:35:28,928 --> 00:35:30,478
to the demon of fear.

714
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:32,791
You want us to conjure Barbas ?

715
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:35,088
Are you out of your mind, after everything he did to...

716
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:38,088
kill you? No, I'm not suggesting you conjure him.

717
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:41,422
I'm just suggesting you think of him as some sort of inspiration.

718
00:35:41,652 --> 00:35:44,377
Pray on Nance's deepest fears.

719
00:35:54,097 --> 00:35:55,836
You do very nice work.

720
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,076
Much better than the other girl.

721
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,803
Thank you sir.

722
00:36:01,983 --> 00:36:03,636
What did you say happened to her ?

723
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,228
She's just sick, I'm filling in for the day.

724
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:08,394
Perhaps on a more permanent basis.

725
00:36:08,471 --> 00:36:12,153
I'm sorry, I attend to work with a much younger clientÃ¨le.

726
00:36:12,154 --> 00:36:14,347
Ouch. Watch it.

727
00:36:14,364 --> 00:36:19,357
Things can tend to be more susceptible to damage on the hands of someone old as you.

728
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:21,046
You are sixty or something ?

729
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:22,443
Get out of here.

730
00:36:22,444 --> 00:36:25,153
I am so sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to offend you.

731
00:36:25,213 --> 00:36:28,121
- Are you sensitive about your age ?
- No, I'm not.

732
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:31,967
You know, I can usually tell how old somebody is just by looking the lines on their hands.

733
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:33,597
Go ahead, see for yourself.

734
00:36:33,598 --> 00:36:35,138
What are you talking about ?

735
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:42,184
What !

736
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:43,846
Is something wrong ?

737
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:48,020
What the hell...

738
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,014
You're dead !

739
00:36:50,944 --> 00:36:52,508
- You could not have...
- lived ?

740
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:54,755
Sorry to disappoint you.

741
00:37:12,548 --> 00:37:15,978
What's the matter old man ?
Seeing a ghost ?

742
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:18,436
Because you killed me,
just like you killed Curtis ?

743
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:20,463
No, it's not possible !

744
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:22,470
- It's a, it's a...
- a nightmare ?

745
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:24,674
One you won't ever wake up from.

746
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:27,986
Guilt's a terrible thing Walter.
It haunts you forever.

747
00:37:27,987 --> 00:37:29,827
No, get away from me !

748
00:37:30,363 --> 00:37:31,843
Leave me alone !

749
00:37:42,598 --> 00:37:43,702
Drop dead !

750
00:38:03,273 --> 00:38:04,610
What's happenning to me?

751
00:38:05,122 --> 00:38:08,603
Well, Walter, the way I see it, you have two choices.

752
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:11,019
You can confess,

753
00:38:11,726 --> 00:38:14,635
or you can meet the pavement.

754
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,534
What do you say ?

755
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,848
Well, Nance and everyone involved, are in jail.

756
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,042
Maya set free. Not on a bad day.

757
00:38:48,332 --> 00:38:52,007
Yeah, except for the part where I have to come up with a new identity.

758
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:57,442
- So much for my future in a corporate world.
- It's ok. I don't think that would fit you very well much anyway.

759
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,125
I guess not.

760
00:38:59,465 --> 00:39:01,155
I can't change my whole life.

761
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,185
Although, you could have mentionned that earlier.

762
00:39:03,244 --> 00:39:06,547
No. Plus my lesson is no one tells you what to do.

763
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:09,453
So, missy, where do you gonna take your next alias from.

764
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:11,590
Time magazine, Vanity Fair...

765
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:13,737
Let me guess, National Inquirer ?

766
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:16,916
No, I think I can come up with this one on my own, thank you.

767
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:19,363
Well just make sure it's not one of the most wanted at least, ok ?

768
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,450
Trust me.

769
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:21,940
Another cousin ?

770
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,221
Yes, actually,
one that you'll be married to this time.

771
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,121
Hey, that was all about Eve.

772
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:29,547
Oh buddy, some old movie.

773
00:39:29,548 --> 00:39:32,501
- One that I don't wanna see again anytime soon !
- Fine to me !

774
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:35,428
So, guys, how do you think our fair Billie did ?

775
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:36,672
It sounds like she did good.

776
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,817
Except for the fact that she was inpired by a demon.

777
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:40,929
Oh come on !

778
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:45,457
Did you guys feel that ?

779
00:39:57,811 --> 00:39:59,846
I was speaking I think you're not gonna show.

780
00:40:00,873 --> 00:40:02,606
You moved it all back.

781
00:40:03,385 --> 00:40:07,588
Yeah.
It's some art show hidden in corner it's hard for people to see.

782
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,436
Come on, you can't be serious about an earth quake.

783
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:14,541
You can laugh of me all you want,
but I am serious.

784
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,184
Is everyone alright ?

785
00:40:33,342 --> 00:40:34,468
Are you ok ?

786
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:37,043
- The moment.
- Sorry ?

787
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:40,771
I wasn't supposed to stop the earth quake.
I was supposed to be here for it.

788
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,745
What do you talking about ?

789
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,799
Oh Dex, look at your work !

790
00:40:48,523 --> 00:40:50,520
Most of it is still ok.

791
00:40:53,482 --> 00:40:55,487
How did you know ?

792
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you. I'm psychic.
