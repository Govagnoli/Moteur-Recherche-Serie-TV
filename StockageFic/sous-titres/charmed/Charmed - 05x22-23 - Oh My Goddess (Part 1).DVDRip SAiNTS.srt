1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,868
I am really glad
Elise made me call you.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,235
You're exactly the kind
of guy I've been looking for.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,915
- Is that so?
- Oh, it is "so" so.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,036
You're cute,
you're sweet, you're smart.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,988
And from what I hear,
you're raking in the dough.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,469
Well, you have quite the way
with words, don't you?

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,519
Yeah, well when it comes to
helping needy children, I'm shameless.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,356
Come on, Evan, please do the
charity auction. It'll be fun.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,956
It'll be fun to be auctioned
off like a side of beef.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,233
Yeah, well, it's not like we're
asking you to marry the highest bidder.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,679
It's just, you know, one little date
and one little tax-deductible donation,

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,195
you know, to match your lady's bid.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,557
Is there any chance "Ask Phoebe"
will be doing some bidding?

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,999
Well, you'll just have to
sign up to find that out.

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,909
Then I graduated from
Stanford Law in '98.

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,549
Harvard Law.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,039
That's impressive.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,918
So do you want to
give to a charity or what?

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,798
I said Stanford, not Harvard.

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,077
Let me ask you something.
Have you been having any kind of

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,630
end-of-the-world, fire-and-brimstone
doomsday kind of dreams lately?

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,189
Wait a minute. Is this
some sort of religious charity?

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,959
No, it's not, it's for children.

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,116
Right.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,277
Hey, to each his own.

26
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,675
But I'm not into the
whole fire-and-brimstone thing.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,755
Paige, you're supposed to be flirting
with the bachelors,

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,956
- not frightening them.
- I'm sorry.

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,872
I guess I'm just a little off.

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,072
My boyfriend moved to Hong Kong.
I'm thoroughly depressed.

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,516
But I still managed to
sign up six people and you have...

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,389
- I have none people.
- None people.

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,438
Paige, I know you've been in a bad
mood, but this is getting a little crazy.

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,559
What? I barely slept all week,
I keep having these strange dreams

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,837
about ancient wars
and weird magic...

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,638
It's all very disturbing.

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,075
- Do you think they mean something?
- I don't know.

38
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,832
It could be hormones.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,752
More likely it could be
my subconscious

40
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,751
trying to tell me something.

41
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,718
It worked! You're alive!

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,149
- How long?
- How long?

43
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,276
Three thousand years,
give or take a century.

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,112
What?

45
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,757
- Who are you?
- Me?

46
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,710
I'm the demon who spent
decades trying to free you!

47
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,031
Now you're gonna return the favour.

48
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,749
It wasn't easy either.

49
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,753
The world's forgotten about you.

50
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,475
But I had a vision.
If I could somehow revive you,

51
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,350
I could use your power
to bring myself to glory.

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,870
Rule the underworld
as I was always meant to!

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,314
Lmbecile.

54
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,678
Oh, I love it when you
smite so unexpectedly.

55
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,311
We have to find
Cronus and free him as well.

56
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,075
Do we have to?
You know he'll be furious.

57
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,277
I am counting on it.

58
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,592
For the love that is
everything good and pure

59
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,513
why have we never
bothered to get air conditioning?

60
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,432
Because we live in San Francisco

61
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,831
where the temperature
rarely goes above 75 degrees.

62
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,032
Okay, well, it's at 90 now,
can we get one today, please?

63
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,837
Yeah, we could, if it was
not for this little expenditure here.

64
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,196
Yeah, that's a lot of phone
calls to Hong Kong.

65
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,554
Yes, it is.

66
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,598
Okay, before you start yelling,
let me just explain to you

67
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,633
that I'm trying to figure out where
Jason and I stand and to do that

68
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,279
it requires a lot of phone calls.

69
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,351
You're gonna throw that
glass at me, aren't you?

70
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,078
No, honey, I get it.

71
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,595
You know, it is a very big phone bill.

72
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,793
But if you have to choose between
true love and air conditioning

73
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,598
I'd say it's a no-brainer.

74
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,791
Who are you and what
have you done to my sister?

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,150
What, I can't be in a good mood?

76
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,029
No, Mary Poppins wouldn't be
in a good mood in this kind of heat.

77
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,350
Well, Wyatt is finally
sleeping through the night

78
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,715
and my hormones
are back in whack

79
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,189
and you know,
Leo and I are finally...

80
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,790
- Back in the saddle?
- So to speak.

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,719
Yay, you!
God, I miss sex!

82
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,838
I gotta tell you, life is feeling
pretty damn good at the moment.

83
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,639
So where is your lucky
husband and my perfect nephew?

84
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,837
They are shopping for
a present for Darryl's son.

85
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,037
Look at you.
You're like soccer mom.

86
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,590
Dare I say it,
your life is almost normal?

87
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,399
There is nothing
normal about this heat.

88
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,993
Good morning, sunshine.

89
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,435
Oh, save the quips
and pass the caffeine.

90
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,033
I have work to do.

91
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,556
Are you gonna scry for Mother Nature
and have a Wiccan word with her?

92
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,154
Okay, you're way too perky,
all right?

93
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,117
And you're frightening me.
I'm just saying.

94
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,998
So you think this
weather's demonic?

95
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,276
I don't know,
there's just something weird.

96
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,869
I keep waking up all week
long with these fiery dreams.

97
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,230
What am I supposed to think?

98
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,630
You're not getting a God
complex or something, are you?

99
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,119
They've got medication for that.

100
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,716
I didn't say my dreams
caused it, I'm just...

101
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,518
I don't know what I'm saying.

102
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,870
Honey, maybe you need to
get out a little more.

103
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,032
Well, this isn't just
me being obsessive.

104
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,034
Okay, maybe a little bit, but it's
not just psychological or emotional,

105
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,509
I really, really think
there's something...

106
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,796
Magical?

107
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,076
Yeah, for lack of a better term.

108
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,834
Listen, I don't wanna be a downer,

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,515
<i>but I'm gonna go hit the Book so I can
figure out what the hell is going on.</i>

110
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,236
- Should we be worried?
- I don't think so.

111
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,590
But I just wish she'd
stop looking for trouble.

112
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,716
Because with our luck,
she's gonna find it.

113
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,312
There he is, as wrathful as ever.

114
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,516
All the more reason to leave him be.

115
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,352
Careful, Meta.

116
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,273
Demetrius, I'm telling
you we don't need him.

117
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,871
We have more than enough power
to rule without him, you know that.

118
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,153
Just imagine,
a new plague every day.

119
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,471
A monsoon every week.

120
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,875
It will be devastating.

121
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,075
Nevertheless, we will need his
strength to revenge our captors...

122
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,071
...and that is something we all want.

123
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,549
Oh, now, don't pout, Meta.

124
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,876
You might start a hurricane.

125
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,315
And alert them.

126
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,277
Now, go and find the whitelighters.

127
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,952
It won't be long before I free Cronus.
You know how impatient he can get.

128
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,719
Daddy, Daddy, show us your trick!

129
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,952
Trick? I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

130
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,432
Hold on a second. Wait,
you have something in your ear.

131
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,711
I do?

132
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,438
Yeah.

133
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,992
You call that magic?

134
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,594
Okay, who wants hot dogs?

135
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,632
Let me guess, first time
the baby slept all night, huh?

136
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,994
How'd you know?

137
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,594
First few months after Mikey
was born were rough, you know.

138
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,830
No sleep, no time for each other.

139
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,194
That sounds familiar.

140
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,592
Yeah, but right about three or four
months, things start to level off.

141
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,588
- Really good again.
- Till he hits 2.

142
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,360
Oh, don't scare them.

143
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,916
Piper, I have to go.

144
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,596
- But we just got here.
- I know, baby, but it's the Elders.

145
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,870
Don't worry, she knows.

146
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,349
Your secret's safe with me.
Argue away.

147
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,395
Honey, I'm sorry,
but it sounds urgent.

148
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,031
Okay, well, then I need
to express to you

149
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,998
that this is gonna make
me feel a little abandoned.

150
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,998
All right, well, I understand.

151
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,790
I acknowledge your feelings and
I want to let you know that I love you,

152
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,838
even though I have to go.

153
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,719
- Darryl, stop.
- What's so funny?

154
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,952
Nothing, just...
Marriage counselling, huh?

155
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,273
Honey, we did it too.
We recognize the tools.

156
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,630
I think I hate the tools.
I'd rather just snipe later

157
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,315
than be open and honest
about my feelings now.

158
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,277
Yeah, we felt the same way.

159
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,352
But you know what?
Turns out the tools really helped.

160
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,078
- Piper, I have to go.
- Fine, go.

161
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,516
I mean, thank you
for considering my feelings,

162
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,399
and I love you and I will
see you later at home.

163
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,073
Okay.

164
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,837
Very good.

165
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,354
So you'll introduce
the bachelors from here

166
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,795
and then they'll enter from over there.

167
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,477
- Phoebe, you with me?
- I am all over him.

168
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,511
I mean it, all over it.

169
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,434
Phoebe, the newspaper only
sponsors one charity event a year,

170
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,437
and I want this to
go off without a hitch.

171
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,397
It will, I promise.

172
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,198
Okay, that's what I like to hear.

173
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,033
Oh, and please thank your
sister again for donating her club.

174
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,192
I just hope everyone doesn't melt
by the time they get here.

175
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,557
It's gonna be kind of hard
to auction off bachelor soup.

176
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,075
It is bizarre weather, isn't it?

177
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,034
I spoke to Jason this morning and he
says it's the same way in Hong Kong.

178
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,111
You spoke to Jason?

179
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,433
Did he mention me?

180
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,834
Look, not that it's
any of my business...

181
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,956
...but are you sure you
wanna tether yourself

182
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,997
to a boyfriend who's
halfway across the world?

183
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,149
I know.

184
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,632
And the truth is, this heat is
kind of making me a little boy-crazy.

185
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,398
It just feels really weird to end
a good relationship so abruptly.

186
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,199
- He's the one who moved away.
- I know.

187
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,790
And at the risk of advising
an advice columnist...

188
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,599
...I say you bid on a
bachelor or two tomorrow.

189
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,995
That way I can live
vicariously through you.

190
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,873
Oh, Elise, you brazen hussy!

191
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,548
Oh, my God!

192
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,678
- What, what is it?
- Nothing. Hold that thought.

193
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,829
What thought?

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,719
Paige, are you out of your mind?

195
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,552
As it turns out, I am not.

196
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,517
Listen, we are in big trouble.

197
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,592
Yeah, you almost exposed
our magic to a room full of people.

198
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,234
No, listen. I studied the I Ching,

199
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,836
tarot cards, runes and tea leaves and
they're all giving me the same reading.

200
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,718
That you need a good night's sleep?

201
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,031
No, that there's something big
going on in the supernatural world.

202
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,951
If my reading is right,
it's not just the thunder and the heat.

203
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,270
We could be in store
for a big earthquake or worse.

204
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,512
Okay, so what do you want us to do?
Do you have a plan?

205
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,432
Not so much a plan as a location.

206
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,160
I scryed for evil and one place
kept coming up red-hot.

207
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,549
Take this. You're gonna need it.
We're going on a trip.

208
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,950
Okay, there's a reason nobody
lives in this part of the world,

209
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,192
and it's because
they all died from the cold.

210
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,197
I thought you said
you wanted air conditioning.

211
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,753
Oh, this sucks!

212
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,751
Scorch mark, see if
you can get a premonition.

213
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,558
I don't have my gloves!

214
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,399
Tough it out, I got us this far.

215
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,592
Okay, fine.

216
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,754
- Did you get anything?
- Yeah, frostbite. Shush.

217
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,870
- Oh, hot, hot, hot!
- Hot?

218
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,951
No, not here hot.

219
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,395
- In my vision.
- Vision? Good, tell me what it is.

220
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,468
Two very large someones
coming out of that wall.

221
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,395
- Who?
- I don't know.

222
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,794
Demetrius.

223
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,833
My lord.

224
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,638
They did this to me.

225
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,674
To me!

226
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,991
- They will be punished.
- Punished?

227
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,550
I will obliterate them!

228
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,990
Earthquake. Did I call it or what?

229
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,275
Did I mention this sucks?

230
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,158
Yeah.

231
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,478
I know it's cooled off a little bit since
this morning, but what are you doing?

232
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,273
Defrosting.

233
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,715
Is this them?

234
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,438
- No.
- Who's them?

235
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,033
We're not sure yet.

236
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,191
- How was the party?
- Oh, just super fun.

237
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,237
Leo got called away
and I got to use my tools.

238
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,958
- What?
- Is that them?

239
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,795
No, they looked a little
bit more... ancient.

240
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,195
Will someone please
tell me what's going on?

241
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,952
A whitelighter's disappeared.

242
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,997
A whitelighter?
Like from a darklighter?

243
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,395
No, a darklighter's poison
is slow and painful.

244
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,079
This was more instantaneous,

245
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,629
and the Elders have no
idea what it could have been.

246
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,950
- It's all connected.
- What's connected?

247
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,350
Whatever it is that
escaped from that ice cave.

248
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,754
You were in an ice cave?

249
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,757
The heat wave, the earthquake,
my dreams,

250
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,751
this is bigger
than any one whitelighter.

251
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,190
I better drop out
of that charity benefit.

252
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,231
- Maybe we should cancel counselling.
- Hold it.

253
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,393
Wait a minute. This is exactly what we
are supposed to be learning in therapy.

254
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,471
When to put our lives on hold
and when not to.

255
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,392
But, Piper, a whitelighter was killed.

256
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,749
We don't know that.

257
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,354
He could have just clipped
his wings and he's in hiding.

258
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,755
- Is that possible?
- Yeah, I guess.

259
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,758
Look, people, we just need to
manage our lives a little bit better.

260
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,070
Dr. Barenson says that
needless worry and panic

261
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,550
serve absolutely no purpose, except to
prevent the possibility of happiness.

262
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,029
I am all for
the possibility of happiness.

263
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,999
Good, so we need to address
the immediate problem at hand

264
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,071
and circle the wagons
only when we have to.

265
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,152
Leo, maybe you should get the Elders
to put a ban on whitelighters orbing

266
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,390
until we figure out
exactly what's going on.

267
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,755
Okay, I'll meet you at therapy.

268
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,478
Okay, don't be late.

269
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,517
Is it safe for you
to orb up there right now?

270
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,240
Yeah. No worrying, remember?

271
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,838
What's going on?

272
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,951
What's with all the activity?
I just left here.

273
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,270
- It's not your concern.
- Roland, please.

274
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,271
Actually, we're not sure, Leo.

275
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,516
But we do know that
something's not quite right.

276
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,636
- Has another whitelighter been...?
- No.

277
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,358
It's something else.

278
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,075
Something we're not at liberty to
discuss outside the council of Elders.

279
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,112
Anything to do with heat waves?
Earthquakes?

280
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,749
What do you know?

281
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,673
Not much, just that Paige has been
having these strange dreams lately.

282
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,478
Dreams that seem pretty prophetic.

283
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,995
You think she foresaw
these earthquakes?

284
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,276
- Yes.
- That's not her power.

285
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,550
It's not a power,
it's more of an instinct.

286
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,154
An instinct?
That's what you're basing this on?

287
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,754
Well, it hasn't let her down
so far, has it?

288
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,310
Look, excuse me, but I've
just learned to rely on her instincts.

289
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,879
All of their instincts.

290
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,230
As well you should have, Leo.

291
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,834
Now, what did you
come up here to tell us?

292
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,639
Just that the girls think...

293
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,791
...well, that we all think
that maybe we should

294
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,270
ground all whitelighters
until we know for sure that it's safe.

295
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,074
We agree.

296
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,669
We'll initiate the orders
as soon as you've returned to them.

297
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,473
In the meantime,
keep them working on this.

298
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,029
It's important.

299
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,838
You're worried, aren't you?

300
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,837
You know me better than that.

301
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,676
At the end of the day, even we
can't change what's meant to be.

302
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,632
Just remember,
no matter what happens,

303
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,837
you must always
follow your instincts too.

304
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,309
Christa!

305
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,277
It's about time
you came to heal your charge.

306
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,234
Who are you? What do you want?

307
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,311
A whitelighter.

308
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,074
It's good to see you again, my lord.

309
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,352
You never were a good liar, Meta.

310
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,515
Where's the third one?

311
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,355
Unfortunately, whitelighters are
not as easy to find in this time.

312
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,669
Much has changed. Magic is
no longer practiced so openly.

313
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,999
Much may have changed,
but you certainly haven't.

314
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,352
You know, it always...

315
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,875
...amazed me how someone...

316
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,471
...as beautiful as you
could so easily turn a mortal to stone.

317
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,956
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

318
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,671
- She stays behind.
- No, she can't!

319
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,838
We are stronger as three than two.

320
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,877
We will need
every ounce of that strength

321
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,792
if we are to take
revenge on our captors.

322
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,072
But if we wait, we risk them
finding out we've been awakened.

323
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,118
Then even with orbs,
we will not be able to break in.

324
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,236
Then that is a risk
we will have to take.

325
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,197
Says who?

326
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,834
You, Demetrius?

327
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,992
- Are you challenging me?
- No!

328
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,192
No, of course he's not, Cronus.

329
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,198
I've brought power
enough for both of you.

330
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,791
You can take them and use them
to find a third whitelighter for me.

331
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,952
And if we can't?

332
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:00,269
Then I suppose I'll just
have to let you boys handle it.

333
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,631
- Leo?
- Sorry, honey.

334
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,392
I was starting to get
worried about you.

335
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,195
I know, I know,
I came as fast as I could.

336
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,960
Well, what happened?
What took so long?

337
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,913
I don't know.
They don't know.

338
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,599
But we can talk about it later.

339
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,552
Right now our first priority is us.

340
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,439
Good answer, because I don't think
there's enough tools in the box

341
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,198
to handle being stood up
at the shrink.

342
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,191
No way. Are you kidding me?

343
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,072
It sounds important.

344
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,232
- But you were just there.
- I know.

345
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,914
Look, I acknowledge that
this is very difficult for you.

346
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,111
You know what, screw that!
Damn it!

347
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,600
I'm just scared.

348
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,636
But I told you it was
safe orbing up there.

349
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,233
No, not about that.

350
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,238
I'm scared that, you know,
every time something good happens,

351
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,233
every time I actually think we
can have a normal life together,

352
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,674
something goes wrong.

353
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,070
Piper, I have to go.

354
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,789
I know.
And I know it's not your fault.

355
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,238
It's just the way that it is.

356
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,395
I love you.

357
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,714
Phoebe!

358
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,438
Hey, Phoebe!

359
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,038
- Did you find something?
- Do "Titans" ring a bell?

360
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,714
Titans, like from ancient Greece?
You have got to be kidding me.

361
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,154
Ancient gods who were entombed

362
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,231
because it was
the only way to stop them.

363
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,710
Okay, well, even if it is them,
how did they get out?

364
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,070
- And why go after the whitelighters?
- I don't know.

365
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,272
Maybe one of them was hurt,
maybe they needed healing powers.

366
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,113
I do know that because of
the Elders' no-orbing edict

367
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,074
that the only way they're gonna
get another whitelighter is if one:

368
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,073
Oh, no way, Paige.
Forget about it.

369
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,549
Why not? If I'm right,
they will come right to us.

370
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,915
Oh, and you're saying this
like it's a good thing?

371
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,719
It is! This is why
I haven't been sleeping.

372
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,916
This is what I've been
preparing for all year.

373
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,640
I have got potions here
that are stronger

374
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,314
than the ones
that we used on The Source.

375
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,831
Okay, devil's advocate: Until we
figure out how powerful they are

376
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,359
we shouldn't use you as bait.

377
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,432
Witch's advocate: There are evil
gods running around on the loose

378
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,790
that we should eliminate
before Wyatt gets home.

379
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,188
That's dirty. Why do I feel like

380
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,158
you're making me choose
between my sister and my nephew?

381
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,078
Because you're slightly over-dramatic?

382
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,992
I'm a little over-dramatic?

383
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,593
Look, can we just do this, please?

384
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,557
Okay, fine.

385
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,792
Bring on the
earthquake-causing gods.

386
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,996
Watch this.

387
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,078
Don't look into her eyes!

388
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,519
You all right?

389
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,270
Oh, my God, Paige!

390
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,270
Don't worry, she's all right.

391
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,836
Well, I mean, she's not completely all
right, obviously, but she's not dead.

392
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,439
Are you sure she's not?

393
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,959
Frankly, you see this a lot.

394
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,190
Museums, universities, town centres,

395
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,437
most of those
statues aren't really statues.

396
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,957
They're people like your sister
here who've been turned into stone.

397
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,876
- Who are you?
- Chris.

398
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,591
Chris Perry.
I'm... from the future.

399
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,514
Oh, my God!

400
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,150
Tell me that's just a really
good likeness of Paige.

401
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,912
No, it's Paige.

402
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,991
- A Titan turned her to stone.
- A who?

403
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,230
- Who are you?
- That's Chris.

404
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,716
- He's from the future.
- Yeah, but just like 20 years or so.

405
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,392
- Friend or foe?
- I'm not so sure yet.

406
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,755
What do you mean?
I saved Paige, didn't I?

407
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,797
Oh, you call that saving, do you?

408
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,071
Hey, I'm the one who
put my life on the line here.

409
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,157
I didn't have to drop
everything I was doing

410
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,958
just to orb in
and save her butt from...

411
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,317
You...? You orb?
You're a whitelighter?

412
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,556
Look, where I come from,

413
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,473
history shows Paige didn't get
turned to stone on this day.

414
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,709
She died.

415
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,951
And with her death,
the power of three died too

416
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,317
allowing Titans to rule and
create a world you don't wanna see.

417
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,239
Trust me.
I'm here to alter history.

418
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,918
- To help you save the future.
- Who sent you?

419
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,070
- I can't answer that.
- Why not?

420
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,309
Because anything I tell you

421
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,829
could risk changing the future
in ways we don't want.

422
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,155
Who's "we"?

423
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,232
All I gotta say is that
if I hadn't gotten here when I did,

424
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,436
Paige would've been
the third whitelighter victim.

425
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,950
Wait, third?
I thought only one was missing.

426
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,915
Not anymore.

427
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,270
Leo? Leo!

428
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,992
Honey, I'm sorry
I missed counselling but...

429
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,111
Forget that,
we've got bigger problems.

430
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,072
- What happened?
- Forget that too.

431
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,559
How many
whitelighters are missing?

432
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,318
- What?
- How many?

433
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,318
Two, that's what
the Elders just called me for.

434
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,832
Believe me now?

435
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,632
Who's he?

436
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,630
What was that?

437
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,438
Sorry.

438
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,678
We'll pay for that.

439
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,158
So long as you can
keep the world from ending.

440
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,669
It was a trap.
You were tricked.

441
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,229
Still, there are other whitelighters.

442
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,112
No, we have been discovered.

443
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,475
Your incompetence
has endangered us all!

444
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,710
My incompetence?

445
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,348
I only went where I was told...

446
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,509
...my lord.

447
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,954
It doesn't matter.

448
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,839
We can go back, they will be
no match for the three of us.

449
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,834
Out of the question. We have to attack
our enemies now while we still can!

450
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,718
I won't leave Meta behind.

451
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,314
It's all right, Demetrius.

452
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,948
You won't have to.

453
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,559
No!

454
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,793
Careful, Demetrius.

455
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,871
Either you're with me...

456
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,156
...or you're with her.

457
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,112
Come on, come on,
prance this way.

458
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,474
Here we go, here we go.

459
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,155
Move it, move it, move it, today!

460
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,788
Hey, quit manhandling us.

461
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,918
- We're not your pets.
- No, you're just a pain, now go on.

462
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,389
And don't let the neighbours see you.

463
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,916
Check out the size
of that oracle's... ball.

464
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,237
Phoebe, focus.

465
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,193
Oh!

466
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,108
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

467
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,555
Stay away from those windows.

468
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,349
What the hell
is going on around here?

469
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,239
If you haven't noticed,
the world's a mess out there.

470
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,994
Something terrible's going on.
Everyone senses it.

471
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,392
- The Titans?
- Must be.

472
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,870
So you guys just all came here
figuring we would stop them?

473
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,077
Well, you are the Charmed Ones,
aren't you?

474
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,470
Do you always leave
the little one unattended?

475
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,238
- No!
- No!

476
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,868
Well, just sounds like
he needs to be changed.

477
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,871
- I'll take care of it.
- Hold it!

478
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,552
You are not the nanny,
we rejected you.

479
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,676
No, I rejected you.

480
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,950
But I suppose I could fill in,
just for a bit.

481
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,549
Did she just hire herself?

482
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,789
You need to go watch her.

483
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,269
What about the Elders? They need
to know the Titans are back.

484
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,080
Can't Chris tell them?
He's a whitelighter, isn't he?

485
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,593
Wait a minute.

486
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,198
Where is he?

487
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,714
<i>- Upstairs with Paige.
- And the Book.</i>

488
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,393
All right, you, to the elf.

489
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,437
You keep an eye
on our magical houseguests.

490
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,239
Herd them into the basement
or something.

491
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,270
I'm gonna go see
what future-boy is up to.

492
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,714
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

493
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,309
I'm trying to find a way to free
stone-cold Paige over here.

494
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,993
Step away.

495
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,555
Please, like I haven't
looked in this before?

496
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,039
By the way, you should
update your goblins entry.

497
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,839
It'll come in handy someday.

498
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,672
- Goblins?
- Yeah. Trust me, it's gonna get ugly.

499
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,393
<i>Look, obviously you don't trust me.
But I touched the Book, right?</i>

500
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,431
<i>And the Book thinks I'm good,
shouldn't you?</i>

501
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,398
- Maybe you found a way around that.
- Piper, come on.

502
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,079
I'm just trying to help.

503
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,949
Well, then, if that's true, why don't you
tell me how to vanquish the Titans?

504
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,390
Except you can't vanquish them.

505
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,392
You mean not without
the power of three?

506
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,913
Maybe not even with that.

507
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,719
The only way the Elders could stop
them 3000 years ago

508
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,314
was by infusing some mortals
with a hell of a lot of power,

509
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,674
way more than you guys have.

510
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,353
So they can do that again.

511
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,078
Not after what happened last time.

512
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,357
When the mortals trapped the Titans,
the power went to their heads.

513
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,830
They declared themselves gods
and forced the world to worship them.

514
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,231
The Elders swore they would
never allow that to happen again.

515
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,597
Hang on a second,
I'm having a 9th-grade flashback.

516
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,752
You're talking about the Greek gods,
Zeus, Athena, Aphrodite?

517
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,115
- They were mortals?
- Mythology left that part out.

518
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,914
Not the only inaccuracy, by the way.

519
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,518
Phoebe, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be...

520
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,029
I know, I know. But I thought
they could help us free Paige.

521
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,589
After all, a leprechaun's luck
has helped us before.

522
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,228
He's the leprechaun,
I'm one of the seven dwarfs.

523
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,231
Try to keep it straight, will you?

524
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,199
Sorry.

525
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,038
It's gonna take a lot more than
just me luck to free this one.

526
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,231
We're gonna need
some pixie dust too.

527
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,073
I'll get a fairy.
I left my axe downstairs anyway.

528
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,515
Okay, so where are we?

529
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,712
Screwed, possibly.
One thing I'm still not clear about:

530
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,316
If the Titans are roaming around,
why are they killing whitelighters?

531
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,033
Because they need
their orbing power.

532
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,708
Their orbing power? What on
earth would they wanna do with...?

533
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,592
Oh, my God.

534
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,193
Leo!

535
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,430
What did I miss?
What did she just figure out?

536
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,397
Nothing good.

537
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,709
How did you know he was cold?

538
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,592
Babies are what I do.

539
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,313
Leo?

540
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,033
The Titans are after the Elders.

541
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,758
- What?
- You have to go warn them,

542
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,797
but don't stay up there too long.
Hurry.

543
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,878
No!

544
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,079
Now, laddie!

545
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,675
Don't know what else to try.

546
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,558
Running out of gold too, I'm afraid.

547
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,359
Okay, well, there's gotta
be something we can do.

548
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,033
Just keep trying.

549
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,393
- What are you doing over here?
- Nothing.

550
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,631
You guys keep this stuff forever,
you know that?

551
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,195
You knew the Titans were
after the Elders, didn't you?

552
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,238
Why didn't you tell us?

553
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,868
I told you, there's some things
I can't tell you.

554
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,076
Some things you need
to figure out on your own.

555
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,310
Even at the risk
of making things worse?

556
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,838
All right, what's going on?

557
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,629
Leo's not responding to any of my calls
and it's been over five hours.

558
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,598
- I really don't know.
- Well, I really think you do.

559
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,876
Look. You're the one
who wanted him to go up there

560
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,190
in the first place. Not me.

561
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,032
All right, fine. Maybe I do know.

562
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,589
And if I'm right, he's gonna
need some serious alone time.

563
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,513
You know what? Cut it out
with the cryptic crap.

564
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,240
You need to go up there
and bring him back, now.

565
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,594
No more games.

566
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,478
Okay. Fine, I'll go.

567
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,835
But if I were you two,
I'd focus on freeing Paige

568
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,276
because you're
gonna need her, soon.

569
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,790
I swear to God,
if he does not come back with Leo,

570
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,838
I'm gonna blow his ass
back to the future, orbs and all!

571
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,268
You know what?

572
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,035
Why don't you go be with Wyatt, and
I will take care of everything up here.

573
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,231
I will call you
if anything happens, I promise.

574
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,793
- You're not breathing.
- Nope.

575
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,359
Breathe.

576
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,359
Okay, next sister.

577
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,278
Leo?

578
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,639
Why didn't you tell me?

579
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,995
- Why did you let this happen?!
- Easy, easy.

580
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,355
- Why?
- Because this had to happen!

581
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,988
It had to happen so you
could do what has to be done.

582
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,595
What are you talking about?
They're all dead.

583
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,593
- Gone.
- No.

584
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,352
Not all of them.

585
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,112
Some of the Elders
escaped back to Earth,

586
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,636
but it won't be long before
the Titans hunt them down too.

587
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,436
But you can still stop them.

588
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,790
You can still defeat the Titans.

589
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,353
How?

590
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,556
I think you know how.

591
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,071
It's too dangerous.

592
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,351
The Elders forbid it.

593
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,913
True.

594
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,550
But then again, the Elders aren't
around to stop you now, are they?

595
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,673
That's right, Leo.

596
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,637
This is what it's all about.

597
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,634
This is why they had to die, so you
could do something they'd never do.

598
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,195
To save the future for your family.

599
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,954
For your son.

600
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,068
- This is crazy.
- Maybe.

601
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,635
But it's our only chance.

602
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,236
Like it or not, you've been put in
the situation for a reason, Leo.

603
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,311
We both have.

604
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,629
Says you.

605
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,748
How do I know you're not trying
to manipulate this situation

606
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,712
for your own future?

607
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,553
Just the way you've
manipulated everything else.

608
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,233
You don't.

609
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,072
But what choice do you really have?

610
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,308
There's certainly no future
unless you do something.

611
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,473
I don't know.

612
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,433
Even if I were to believe you...

613
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,750
...even if I were willing...

614
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,399
...I couldn't.

615
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,759
I'm no Elder.

616
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,959
Well, you better start acting like one.

617
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,039
Now!

618
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,519
Hit it!

619
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,473
Oh, honey! Hi!

620
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,279
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you. Are you okay?

621
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,874
What happened?
Where's the Titan?

622
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,751
What the hell
are these guys doing here?

623
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,639
Long story, I'll tell you on the way.

624
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,429
You're welcome.

625
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,990
There you are.

626
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,631
Okay, I get the whole epic Titan
thing but what I'm not getting

627
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,119
is the Chris thing.

628
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,838
We're still trying to figure that out.

629
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,195
- Look who's not stoned.
- Welcome back.

630
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,634
You've missed a lot.

631
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,719
Yeah, I can't help but think
it's kind of all my fault.

632
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,395
I mean I'm the one who lured the
Titans here. Insert "I told you so."

633
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,039
Done.

634
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:48,268
I just kind of was obsessed with
the whole weird dreams thing and...

635
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,230
But I am so sorry for any distress
I might have caused you, Piper.

636
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,953
Don't worry about it.

637
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,156
I should have listened
to you in the first place.

638
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,551
Just trying not to worry, or to panic.

639
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,553
But I've just got this terrible feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

640
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,990
What kind of feeling?

641
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,790
That Leo's not coming back.

642
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,552
Sweetie.

643
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,476
Of course he's coming back.

644
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,438
How could he not?

645
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,875
I don't know, it's just
something that Chris said

646
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,077
about Leo having to
go through this alone.

647
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,954
I don't know.

648
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,954
What the hell is he doing up there?

649
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,793
Sorry to interrupt,
but we're all leaving now.

650
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,829
- Wait. Why?
- Didn't you hear the distress call?

651
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,710
The surviving Elders have all been
flushed out. They need our protection.

652
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,949
"Surviving"?

653
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,033
The elf will stay behind to take care
of the kid while you battle the Titans.

654
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,676
Wait, who said anything
about us battling the Titans?

655
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,592
Leo.

656
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,872
Leo!

657
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,309
- Piper.
- No.

658
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,550
- But she needs me.
- Not as much as the rest of us do.

659
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,238
You need to stay here.
Even afterwards, to coordinate.

660
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,318
All right.

661
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,553
Then you should go.
Otherwise the girls won't understand.

662
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,479
Good luck.

663
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,358
<i>Leo!</i>

664
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,518
<i>Leo!</i>

665
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,632
Leo, for God sakes,
if you can hear me...

666
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,832
You? Where's Leo?

667
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,195
He's safe, for now.

668
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,869
- Paige, hi.
- Hi.

669
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,431
Forget that.
What do you mean, for now?

670
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,358
- What's going on?
- What is this about us

671
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,397
supposedly battling the Titans?

672
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,993
You're about to find out.

673
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,750
What's that supposed to mean?

674
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,755
- That's what that means.
- What happened?

675
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,035
What are we?

676
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,673
You're gods.

677
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,393
You expect us to beat
the Titans dressed like this?

678
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,959
Maybe at a costume party.

679
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,238
That's not a costume, that represents
your new position and power.

680
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,356
- Power?
- Power's good.

681
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,431
I like power.

682
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,598
- Why do I like power?
- Because you are the goddess of war.

683
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,513
Oh, well I guess
that explains the pitchfork.

684
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,716
It's not a pitchfork, it's a trident.

685
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,632
Be careful,
that's a formidable weapon.

686
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,677
Right on.
Who wants to fight?

687
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,478
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

688
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,319
- You're the goddess of love.
- Naturally.

689
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,789
Well, then, that must make
me the goddess of sanity

690
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,712
because I find this ridiculous.

691
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,992
Actually, Leo gave you dominion over
the earth and all its natural elements.

692
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,515
Wait a minute.
You're saying that Leo did this to us?

693
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,798
Chris, you never told us.

694
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,520
Do you have a girlfriend
in the future?

695
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,996
As you can see, all of you have drives
and urges based on your powers.

696
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,435
Don't let them distract you, all right?

697
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,953
Stay focused.

698
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,439
Focused on the Titans.

699
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,478
Hold it, pal! I don't know what
what kind of game you're running here,

700
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,312
but Leo is not
in the god-making business.

701
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,919
How old are you anyway?

702
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,311
The Elders forbid it. And if anything,
Leo is a company man.

703
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,870
The Elders did forbid it.
And guess what? They're dead.

704
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,314
Most of them.

705
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,596
Leo's in charge up there now,
and he's taking a huge risk

706
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,469
that you won't lose your humanity
like the ancient Greek... Whoa!

707
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,989
You killed the Elders,
you could have prevented it.

708
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,513
I say we castrate him.

709
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,636
A little control here, ladies, please?

710
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,394
Can't we figure out
something else to cut off?

711
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,753
I told you, stay focused!

712
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,354
In my future,
all the Elders were killed.

713
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,080
That's why I came back,
to help Leo give you the power

714
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,151
so this would never
have to happen again.

715
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,992
Hey, guys, watch this.

716
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,514
Put that thing down!
You're gonna hurt someone.

717
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,709
I certainly hope so.

718
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,791
Do you know the kind of
damage this thing could do?

719
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,518
- A lot.
- Paige.

720
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,756
Make love, not, you know...

721
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,110
There's no door love can't open.

722
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,197
No wall love can't climb.

723
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,318
No hurdle love can't... hurdle.

724
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,277
This is Leo's strategy?

725
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,793
Well, he must have lost it up there,

726
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,110
because these girls can't
be seen in public, much less...

727
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,192
Oh, that reminds me.
I'm late for the bachelor auction.

728
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,432
I'm gonna go pick up
a guy or two, or 12.

729
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,318
Phoebe!

730
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,595
Oh, that's a good idea.

731
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,718
I'm gonna go get in some
target practice on some demons.

732
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,836
Watch out, Titans.

733
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,914
I knew this was gonna happen.
You gotta go after them.

734
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,719
Oh, no, no, no, this was your
big plan, you clean up the mess.

735
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,314
No, your role is to provide balance.

736
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,596
That's why you feel
so grounded and in control.

737
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,320
Wow, Chris, that was
actually pretty good.

738
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,153
You almost sounded like a whitelighter.
Too bad I already have one.

739
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,878
And if he would like me
to do something,

740
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,792
he can come down
and tell me himself.

741
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,313
Do you hear that?

742
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,712
You want Leo?

743
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,999
Then vanquish the Titans.

744
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,994
If you can't do that, you're gonna find
out what a world of darkness feels like.

745
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,749
My world.

746
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,988
I can sense what's left of the Elders.

747
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,395
They're scared
and running for their lives.

748
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,712
You're still angry with me
for killing her, aren't you?

749
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,119
Demetrius, I'm sorry.

750
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,311
Meta was a distraction.

751
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,109
Once we control the heavens,
you can have any woman you want.

752
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,595
I want you to know
I did what had to be done.

753
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,671
We needed to hit
the Elders hard and fast.

754
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,432
And we did. Right?

755
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,554
Demetrius...

756
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,713
...let's go finish off the Elders.

757
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,712
Ladies, prepare your checkbooks,
because here comes Evan.

758
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,234
Oh, my, my, somebody
turn the heat down in here.

759
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,550
I don't have to take off
my clothes or anything, do I?

760
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,516
That's entirely up to you.

761
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,076
Okay, ladies, Evan's
an internist from Sausalito.

762
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,110
And he promises the highest
bidder a free physical on their date.

763
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,829
So who'll start the bidding?

764
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,671
- Four hundred!
- Excellent, do I hear 500?

765
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,308
One thousand dollars.

766
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,829
Phoebe!

767
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,917
Can I bid on her?

768
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,839
- If you insist.
- That isn't, this isn't, I don't really...

769
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,197
I got a $10,000
limit on my credit card.

770
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,476
- Well, okay then.
- Eleven thousand!

771
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,232
- Twelve thousand.
- Thirteen thousand.

772
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,152
- Fourteen thousand.
- Fourteen-five!

773
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,197
- Fifteen thousand.
- Sixteen thousand.

774
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,510
- Eighteen thousand!
- Easy, boys.

775
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,717
There's plenty to go around.

776
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,548
Come on, now,
hit me with your best shot.

777
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,513
Give me one firm spot on which
to stand, and I will move the Earth.

778
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,357
Archimedes said that.

779
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,318
Great warrior,
and he didn't even have a trident.

780
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,476
Okay, on your knees.

781
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,312
Kiss the hand of the Paige!

782
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,630
Paige, my liege.

783
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,511
Being a goddess
does have its perks.

784
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,950
Paige, what are you doing?

785
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,109
How did you find me?

786
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,073
Apparently it's one of my powers,
to keep an eye on you.

787
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,514
What is going on here?

788
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,836
Oh, I'm just building an army.

789
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,956
I figured, what better way
to smite the Titans

790
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,553
than with hordes of demons, right?

791
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,039
Wrong.

792
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,315
All of you, out!

793
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,596
We answer only to our liege.

794
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,549
- I see.
- See, they're very loyal.

795
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,077
And you know what? I don't know why
I was wasting time studying witchcraft

796
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,198
when I clearly should have been
earning my general's stripes.

797
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,154
I said go, now!

798
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,034
What did you have to do that for?
I had followers.

799
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,675
You can't have followers.
None of us can.

800
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,116
Now come on, before
I unleash my wrath on you.

801
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,036
Not in the house.

802
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,876
Now let's go find Phoebe.

803
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,030
My word, this is a house of ill-repute.

804
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,758
Hardly suitable for an infant.

805
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,672
What do you mean?

806
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,432
How does that feel, Phoebe?

807
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,633
Oh, make sure you
peel those for me, will you?

808
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,074
Yes, of course.

809
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,879
Phoebe, we need to talk.

810
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,473
Yes, we do.

811
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,518
The world would be overflowing
with peace and love

812
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,278
if only we just talked more.

813
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,714
What are they doing here?

814
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,317
Oh, worshipping me,
adoring me, exalting my name.

815
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,035
There is so much love in this room,
I can barely stand it.

816
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,669
Me neither.

817
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,717
It's time to send your
groupies away, now.

818
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,269
But serving me
makes them so happy.

819
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,874
Thank you, bachelor number three.

820
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,679
All right, all of you,
show is over, move along.

821
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,273
We live to serve Phoebe.

822
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,352
Oh you do, don't you?
That's so sweet.

823
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,318
Piper, you need to get
some followers of your own.

824
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,317
It's a really great confidence-builder.

825
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,999
Are you eyeing me, soldier?

826
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,312
What the hell is this?
Goddesses gone wild?

827
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,917
I told you to keep them in line.
What if the Titans attacked now?

828
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,237
Chris, I've got it, thank you.
All of you!

829
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,311
Out!

830
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,592
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

831
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,478
Time for a morality check.

832
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:06,191
Leo did not give us this power so
we could form armies or love cults.

833
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,119
The ancient Greeks
indulged in their whims that way,

834
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,429
and look what they became.

835
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,313
Petty, evil, vindictive...

836
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,153
Thanks, I've got it. Now.

837
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,914
Hi. Can you two get it under control?

838
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,152
"Reason and judgment
are the qualities of a leader."

839
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,959
Tacitus, 100 A.D.

840
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,510
"Love will keep us together."

841
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,240
Captain and Tennille, 1970s.

842
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,070
Fascinating. Now can we figure
out a way to beat the Titans?

843
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,391
Because I for one would
like my family back soon.

844
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,595
Is that a jingle?

845
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,109
There are no Elders up there.
Who's jingling?

846
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,750
- It's Leo.
- Leo can jingle?

847
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,037
Yep. He says
an Elder's under attack.

848
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,919
Like it or not,
it's time to face the Titans.

849
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,277
Stand back, wise one.

850
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,391
Such bravery in the face of death.

851
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,238
We ain't the ones
that will be dying today.

852
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,354
Remind me when we're through
with the Elders to do something...

853
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,351
...nice for the leprechaun community.

854
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,988
We've beaten you before, Cronus.

855
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,792
- We'll do it again.
- How?

856
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,033
Your numbers are dwindling. By day's
end, the great Elders will all be dead.

857
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,589
And we'll own the heavens.

858
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,152
Who are you?

859
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,318
The Supremes.

860
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,194
- She wields the powers of the gods!
- Just kill the Elder.

861
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,479
Somebody get the Elder out.

862
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,632
- I can't. I can't move.
- Me neither.

863
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,552
Leo!

864
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,076
Where did they go?

865
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,192
- Everybody okay?
- No. Is my hair singed?

866
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,515
You're fine.

867
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,678
I guess we're not so
all-powerful after all.

868
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,798
- How did we get out of there?
- I guess Leo must have orbed us out.

869
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,633
But I don't know how.
He doesn't have that kind of power.

870
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,876
Well, he must have
because we're out of there.

871
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,508
What is this place, a sewer?

872
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,953
This is... sanctuary.

873
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,275
Oh, my, my, my.

874
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,119
Aren't you just the edible Elder.

875
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,959
Have you taken a vow of celibacy?

876
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,957
- Phoebe, stay on target.
- Right.

877
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,917
What do you mean, this is sanctuary?

878
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,115
It's a safe house...

879
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,992
...set up by Leo to protect the Elders.

880
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,872
Well, it doesn't look so safe to me.

881
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,156
I can see unprotected
points of entry all over the place.

882
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,118
Don't worry.
The Titans can't sense our location.

883
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,629
We're hidden from them
by a web of fairy magic.

884
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,756
Another of Leo's ideas.

885
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,832
- Leo did all this?
- I was surprised myself.

886
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,833
I'm afraid I'm one of the Elders
who always sold Leo short.

887
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,117
What with him
marrying a witch and all.

888
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,350
- No offence.
- Offence taken.

889
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,875
I will never make that mistake again.

890
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,519
Without Leo, we'd all be dead.

891
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,113
He's out there now tracking Elders
as we speak, moving them here.

892
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,232
- We owe Leo everything.
- I guess so.

893
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,756
Well, good luck with the Titans.

894
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,989
One more question:

895
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,357
What are you wearing
under that robe?

896
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,516
More robes.

897
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,756
Oh, that is so hot.

898
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,519
This is getting tired.

899
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,477
A warrior preparing for battle
cannot be weary.

900
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,393
No, I'm tired of getting all
this information second-hand.

901
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,788
I would like to hear it from Leo.

902
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,959
Piper, I'm sensing a blockage
in your spiritual energy.

903
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,157
- What's wrong, sweetie?
- I need to talk to my husband.

904
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,677
I appreciate him becoming a magical
folk hero for the masses and all,

905
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,195
I really do.
But enough is enough.

906
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,588
Leo!

907
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,399
Remember me, your wife?

908
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,237
Don't you jingle me!
I need more than a jingle here, mister!

909
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,392
You will get down here right now!

910
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,395
Are you trying to alert the enemy?

911
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,673
Piper, I'm sure as soon as Leo
figures out how angry you are

912
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,400
he's gonna come
running down here.

913
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,991
Okay, you can come running now.

914
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,555
Look, sweetie,
it's not like he's not busy.

915
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,199
He's saving the world.

916
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,271
And buying us time
to vanquish the Titans,

917
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,914
although I don't know where
we're gonna get the strength from.

918
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,072
- They had no problem with my power.
- Then let's try my power.

919
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,995
I've been waiting for you...

920
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,119
...my whole life.
- You have?

921
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,509
Why?

922
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,671
Why?

923
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,873
It doesn't matter.

924
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:32,478
The only thing that matters
is that you're here, and I'm here.

925
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,270
- Do you know what that means?
- We're here?

926
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,993
Right.

927
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,991
Together.

928
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,277
- Do you want me?
- Very much.

929
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,596
I'm all yours.

930
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,513
But wait, what would Cronus think?

931
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,989
I don't care what Cronus thinks.

932
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,993
If he tries to stop me, I'll just...

933
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,435
What are you doing, Demetrius?

934
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,989
The goddess wants to seduce me.

935
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,991
I was just playing along
till you got here.

936
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,830
Phooey!

937
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,594
End war game.

938
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,548
- My way didn't work.
- Nothing's working. I need a break.

939
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,995
How did the Greeks do it?

940
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,913
Well, for one thing,
there were more of them.

941
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,877
Like an entire
mountaintop full of them,

942
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,479
until their powers consumed them.

943
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,398
Maybe declaring themselves gods

944
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,915
gave them strength
to defeat the Titans.

945
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,070
- I'd rather be flayed alive.
- Not an option for me.

946
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,079
God...

947
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,079
I miss Leo.

948
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,753
Leo?

949
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,676
- Oh, it's just you.
- Hello to you too.

950
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,875
So the Elders are taken care of.

951
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,478
- Where's Piper?
- She's upstairs with the baby.

952
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,514
- Could you bring us Leo?
- He's busy.

953
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,511
- How's it going here?
- Not so good.

954
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,148
I keep trying to come up
with a plan to defeat the Titans,

955
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,833
but every simulation
ends the same way.

956
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,956
With our death.

957
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,031
We could really use
Leo right about now.

958
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,553
I'm starting to get
that impression.

959
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,911
- Could you bring him back?
- For the last time, no.

960
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,752
What is wrong with you two, huh?

961
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,990
- You're acting hopeless.
- I don't know.

962
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,078
I guess I always feel like this
right before a big battle.

963
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,070
And then Leo comes down,
and I don't know how he does it...

964
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,152
...but he makes me feel like
I have the power to do anything.

965
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,317
Really?
It's different for me.

966
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,358
It's like I forget that I even
have any training and I,

967
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,559
and I can't concentrate. But Leo
helps me focus and calm down.

968
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,115
You know, I'm starting to think
that we take Leo for granted.

969
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,679
Are you sure
that you can't get him?

970
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,751
Leo is up there, okay?

971
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,388
And he's gotta stay up there until...
You know what?

972
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,556
I'm not gonna go over this again.

973
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,029
What can I do to get you two
over the hump here?

974
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,595
Try saying this,
it always works for Leo:

975
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,797
"Your power comes
from your emotions."

976
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,151
Or what about this?
"Trust the power of three."

977
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,469
Or how about this one?

978
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,119
"I'm gonna go
check with the Elders."

979
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,555
Do you actually think
he checks with the Elders?

980
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,228
No. He probably
just orbs to a sports bar

981
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,069
and buys his buddies rounds of drinks.
"My wife thinks I'm up there.

982
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,231
Here's to the Elders."

983
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,078
You really are helpless without him.

984
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,114
Somebody's still alive up here.

985
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,317
We don't know that, Cronus.

986
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,198
Maybe the world's magic
has increased

987
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,952
since we were frozen in that...

988
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,155
Demetrius!

989
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,754
The trident, she had the trident.

990
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,876
The Greek gods have been
re-created, which means

991
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,474
somebody up here released
their essence as mortals.

992
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,235
Which means
somebody is still up here.

993
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,318
If you're right, and the
gods have been re-created,

994
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,552
then we should be after them now
before their powers grow too strong.

995
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,119
No.

996
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,510
Whoever's up here
will just create new gods.

997
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,353
That threat must be dealt with now.

998
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,110
- I am sensing something.
- Where?

999
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,918
It's faint.

1000
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,953
There.

1001
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,199
Whoever created these gods,
whoever is hiding, they're trapped.

1002
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,750
They can't dematerialize
without exposing themselves to us.

1003
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,151
There's only so many
places up here they can hide.

1004
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,638
I could have sworn...

1005
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,114
I don't see anything.

1006
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,310
Keep looking.

1007
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,435
I know you miss him.
I miss him too.

1008
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,394
I need help.

1009
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,592
Excuse me.

1010
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,638
This is my bedroom, you can't
just walk in here anytime you want to.

1011
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,115
Yeah, I know.
But your sisters need you.

1012
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,796
I got them working on the Titans but I
don't know how long that's gonna last.

1013
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,351
- I thought you needed me.
- I did. I mean, I do.

1014
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,949
I need you because they need you.
Actually, they need Leo.

1015
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,156
Look, will you please
just go deal with them?

1016
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,392
What's the matter? Chris, the
all-knowing, running out of answers?

1017
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,993
Yes, yes I am.

1018
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,310
If that will motivate you,
yes, I'm losing control.

1019
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,677
I'm watching history repeat itself and
nobody's doing a damn thing about it!

1020
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,592
I feel your frustration.

1021
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,675
Piper, if it helps, I get it. Okay? I do.

1022
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,796
Really. You need Leo.

1023
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,513
Your sisters need Leo.

1024
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,910
- But if you can't stop...
- You forgot the baby.

1025
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,308
The baby needs his father too.

1026
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,311
Fine. But if you can't stop
missing your husband

1027
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,152
long enough to see
the bigger picture...

1028
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,992
There is no bigger picture
than my family.

1029
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,355
Well, then, pay attention,
because the world I grew up in,

1030
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,432
families hardly existed.
I never had a chance to know mine.

1031
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,511
- Not my fault.
- Not yet.

1032
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,595
Is that what this is about?

1033
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,472
You blame us
for what happened to you?

1034
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,796
I just want you
to get it right this time.

1035
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,752
Use your power of three.

1036
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,592
Use your power as gods.

1037
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,591
Save the world from going to hell.

1038
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,950
If that's what you want,
then I will say it one more time,

1039
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,439
and maybe you will hear me.

1040
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,397
We need Leo.

1041
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,996
Now, excuse me,
I have to go warm up a bottle.

1042
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,470
Don't worry.
You'll come to trust me in time.

1043
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,992
They all will.

1044
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,911
What are you doing?
You're gonna expose us!

1045
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,308
That's the idea.

1046
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,471
Did you sense that?

1047
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,517
Someone orbed.

1048
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,070
Hurry, go. Piper needs you.

1049
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,273
Leo, how could you leave us?

1050
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,310
Who are you?

1051
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,759
Hi, Piper.

1052
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,036
You're home.

1053
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,799
You heard my calls, right?

1054
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,109
Of course I did, honey.

1055
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,912
But I had to make sure
the Elders were safe,

1056
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,712
and then I was cornered
by the Titans.

1057
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,912
I'm just thankful you're okay.
My mind was just racing.

1058
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,917
I know, I felt it.

1059
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:41,317
- Good thing Chris came when he did.
- Chris?

1060
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,590
He distracted the Titans
so I could escape.

1061
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,719
Right now they're probably following
his orb trail, so we don't have...

1062
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,108
What's wrong with your hair?

1063
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,679
What?

1064
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,758
It's white.

1065
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,992
Is it?

1066
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,596
Wow, must be from
staying up there for so long.

1067
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,193
I guess so.

1068
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,554
Where are your sisters?

1069
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,435
Well, they can wait a minute
while we spend some time alone.

1070
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,192
And then you need to hold your son.

1071
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,715
Spoken like a true earth goddess.

1072
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,709
What are you talking about?

1073
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,912
You need to channel your hearth
and home instincts to fight the Titans.

1074
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,833
Leo, I was speaking
from the heart, not the hearth.

1075
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,036
Hi, I'm your wife. Remember?

1076
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,516
I do. But Chris can only
throw off the Titans for so long.

1077
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,358
We need to be ready
with a battle plan.

1078
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,397
Now let's find your sisters.

1079
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,114
Ma'am, I was just coming
to check on the baby.

1080
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,108
That's okay, because
he's actually sleeping so...

1081
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,393
Welcome, wise one.

1082
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,715
Oh, no, this is just my husband.
He's not an Elder.

1083
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,115
He's just wearing
this robe because...

1084
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,952
Why are you wearing this robe?

1085
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,951
It was windy up there.

1086
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,111
See? So you can take a break
because, you know,

1087
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,753
Wyatt's asleep and...

1088
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,111
Okay, here we go.

1089
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,597
It says in there that Cronus
swallowed his newborn children

1090
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,558
to keep them from overthrowing him.

1091
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,634
What if you lure the Titans to a field,
Piper lifts them with a tornado,

1092
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,360
and I hit them with my lightning?

1093
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,432
I'm afraid there's no way to beat a man
who eats his own children.

1094
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,511
- Those stories are fables.
- Leo!

1095
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,671
Welcome home, Leo.

1096
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,669
What do you have for me?

1097
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,673
Paige ran every battle plan she knows,
which as a war goddess

1098
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,310
is basically every battle
that's ever been fought.

1099
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,789
No matter how you spin it,

1100
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,151
warrior, seductress, earth mother,

1101
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,311
we don't have the power
to defeat the Titans.

1102
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,278
We can't beat them.
They're too strong for us.

1103
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:51,273
See how much
this family needs you?

1104
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,799
No.

1105
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,632
I don't.

1106
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,075
You can do this without me.

1107
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,955
And it's not because you have the
power of gods or the power of three.

1108
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,069
It's because

1109
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,717
you're the greatest force of good that
I know, and that's why I chose you.

1110
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,870
Oh, see? I can just feel
the confidence wash all over me.

1111
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,270
- He's doing it.
- What is he doing?

1112
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,598
Paige, you know exactly where to
find the power to conquer the Titans.

1113
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,799
- I do?
- Yes, you just need to focus.

1114
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,912
- We have to declare ourselves gods.
- That's how the ancient Greeks did it.

1115
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,118
Chris told us not to do that.

1116
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,474
Well, Chris is wrong.

1117
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,755
He doesn't know you like I do.

1118
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,673
But, Leo, the ancient Greeks
lost their humanity.

1119
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,235
You're not the ancient Greeks.

1120
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,759
You're the Charmed Ones.

1121
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,315
I didn't give you
anything you can't handle.

1122
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,195
Phoebe, you lost yourself to
the darkest love that ever existed,

1123
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,634
and you came back.

1124
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,432
Of course you can handle
being the goddess of love.

1125
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,079
I never thought of it that way.

1126
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,755
Paige, you're the goddess of war
because you've been consumed

1127
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,912
with gaining power, but you've never
let the power consume you.

1128
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,475
Piper...

1129
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,749
...is it any wonder I made you
the goddess of earth?

1130
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,351
You are everything that is
good and beautiful in this world.

1131
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,552
The mother of my son.

1132
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,877
You really have
that much faith in us?

1133
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,758
Do you really even need to ask that?

1134
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,719
It's like I've always said,
your power comes from your emotion.

1135
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,759
And right now you need to
dig deeper than you ever have before.

1136
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,639
Whatever motivates you,
your heart, your soul,

1137
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,792
your darkest fears, whatever it takes.
You need to find that

1138
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,076
and channel it into power.

1139
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,515
Power, not to capture the Titans,

1140
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,836
but to destroy them.

1141
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,792
Forever.

1142
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,989
Leo?

1143
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,910
What's happening to me?

1144
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,153
He's not here.

1145
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,311
Another dead end.

1146
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,714
No.

1147
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,519
The orb trail's getting stronger.

1148
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,830
We're getting closer.

1149
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,111
We'll push ahead.

1150
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,476
Wait, wait.

1151
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,757
Do you sense that?

1152
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,395
An Elder out in the open.

1153
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,590
Do you think it's our target?

1154
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,588
There's only one way to find out.

1155
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,318
I'll never leave you.

1156
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,590
I promise.

1157
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,151
Why would you?

1158
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,913
- Leo, what's going on?
- I'm not sure.

1159
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,951
What do you mean you're not sure?

1160
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,479
Chris, wherever you are,
get your ass over here!

1161
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,591
It's okay, Chris.

1162
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,108
This better be an emergency.

1163
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,118
You are gonna lead the Titans
straight to us.

1164
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,548
What's happening to my husband?

1165
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:06,949
Something amazing.

1166
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,519
You know what? Cut the crap!

1167
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,473
You knew the Elders were gonna die.
You coached Leo up there.

1168
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,517
You knew all of this
was gonna happen.

1169
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,148
- Did you?
- You're not serious.

1170
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,672
Whatever it is you think you're doing,
you need to make it stop.

1171
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,400
Piper, nobody chose this.
It chose Leo.

1172
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,552
What he did up there, for all of us,
was nothing short of a miracle.

1173
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,316
Now he's receiving
the ultimate reward.

1174
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,239
- A chance to become an...
- Don't you dare say it!

1175
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,710
The world needs sources of good
to watch over it.

1176
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,792
Do you know a source
of pure goodness better than Leo?

1177
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,471
Leo is not...

1178
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,272
He's not an Elder, okay?

1179
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:47,358
Because Elders don't live on Earth.
They don't have families, okay?

1180
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,670
Just tell him you're not an Elder.

1181
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,794
I don't know that I can.

1182
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,071
I think you should
get back to your sisters.

1183
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,436
No. Not until you tell him.

1184
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,589
They're waiting for you.

1185
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,876
Chris is right. You need to get back
to Paige and Phoebe.

1186
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,672
No. Not until you say it.

1187
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,757
The Titans are
gonna be here any moment.

1188
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,075
I said no!

1189
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,598
He'll be okay.

1190
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,837
You did it, Piper.

1191
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,230
You found your power.

1192
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,874
Now control it.
Don't let it control you.

1193
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,517
Piper!

1194
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,950
Where is the Elder
who created you?

1195
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,270
It's not nice
to piss off Mother Nature.

1196
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,478
- So much for the Titans.
- Thank God.

1197
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,308
You're welcome.

1198
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,152
You did it, Piper.

1199
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,075
You found the power you needed.

1200
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,269
You all did.

1201
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,399
Now it's time to give it back.

1202
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,875
Are you ready?

1203
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,469
Just get it out of me.

1204
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,272
How do you feel?

1205
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,398
Free.

1206
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,514
Anything on Piper?

1207
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,478
- Nope, I still can't get a read.
- Just keep trying.

1208
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:24,072
Okay, even if we do find her,
how are we gonna get her back?

1209
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,800
She's on this major power trip.
She destroyed the Titans.

1210
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,632
Not even the Greek gods
could do that.

1211
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,673
We just gotta hope she has
some humanity still left inside.

1212
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,914
If anyone can come back
from this, it's Piper.

1213
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,874
I've gotta go now.

1214
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,594
If you need me,
Chris knows how to get in touch.

1215
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,795
Where are you going?

1216
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,119
The Elders have returned
to the heavens, and they're calling me.

1217
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,673
Did he just bail on us?
Is that what he did?

1218
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,996
What about, you know,
helping us find his wife?

1219
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,434
He's trusting in you to do that.

1220
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,158
You need to find Piper
and talk her down

1221
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,630
before she sets up shop somewhere
and throws the world into chaos.

1222
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,949
Then it'll be too late for her.

1223
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:03,396
Okay, maybe you missed the part
about Piper being Leo's wife.

1224
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,518
Look, you have to understand.
Things have changed.

1225
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,070
The Elders need Leo up there
to help restore order.

1226
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,269
Cut to the chase, future man.

1227
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,789
Is this about Leo being
turned into an Elder, or what?

1228
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,829
He's on the path.

1229
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:20,436
Okay, don't give us
that creepy pod-people smile.

1230
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,670
Okay, in your world
being an Elder may be cool,

1231
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,916
but in our world,
it pretty much sucks.

1232
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,713
Leo is our brother-in-law.

1233
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,472
- And our whitelighter.
- And our friend.

1234
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,914
And we don't want to lose him.

1235
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,275
So listen,
you go up there and tell Leo...

1236
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,274
What is going on with this storm?

1237
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,109
Piper.

1238
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,669
- Piper's what's up with the storm.
- What do you mean?

1239
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,478
Remember when the Titans
were first released?

1240
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,352
The major weather shifts
and the earthquake?

1241
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,516
- Yeah.
- When you have power over the earth

1242
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,274
like the Titans did, it's bound
to suffer your emotional baggage.

1243
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,829
And, like Leo says, our power
comes from our emotions.

1244
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,829
Okay.

1245
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,276
Okay, so if you're a god,
and you're angry,

1246
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:08,553
and you're taking it out on the city,
where would you go?

1247
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:13,079
Somewhere high where I could
enjoy the damage I'm inflicting.

1248
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,952
Piper!

1249
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,473
Stay away from me.

1250
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,791
- We're taking you home.
- To your family.

1251
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,676
What family?

1252
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,235
To your son, Wyatt!

1253
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,074
- Remember him?
- He needs his mother.

1254
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,756
He already lost his father, don't take
his mother away from him too.

1255
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,588
Where is he?

1256
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,994
Where is Leo?

1257
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,111
Piper, what are you doing here?

1258
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,748
How can you do this?

1259
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,036
Excuse us for a minute.

1260
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:35,636
You asked me to marry you,
and I did.

1261
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,031
You wanted a family,
and I gave you a son.

1262
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:43,079
And now you want me
to watch you just walk away?

1263
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,275
It's not that simple.

1264
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,714
Then make it simple.

1265
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,474
Because I'm trying
really hard to understand.

1266
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,032
Piper, if I had a choice
in any of this, I would choose you.

1267
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,315
I always have.

1268
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,390
Then choose me now...

1269
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,676
...and let's go home.

1270
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,838
Don't you think I want to?

1271
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,589
I don't know.

1272
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,473
And that's what scares me the most.

1273
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,276
The Elders were wrong about us.

1274
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,796
They didn't think
our love could survive, but it did.

1275
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,072
Our love blessed us
in ways they couldn't even imagine.

1276
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:27,989
It gave you the strength
that you needed to take over for Prue.

1277
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:32,870
It produced a baby
with a greater future than any of us.

1278
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,798
And it made me...

1279
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,191
An Elder.

1280
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,317
Our love is transcendent, Piper.

1281
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:50,316
It lifted me up so high
that this was the only possible result.

1282
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,472
Being an Elder wasn't my destiny.

1283
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,269
But yet, here I am because of you.

1284
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,837
I can't just give up.

1285
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,349
I don't know how.

1286
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,155
You can't fight this.

1287
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,671
Not this.

1288
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,875
How am I supposed to do this alone?

1289
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,678
You have your sisters.

1290
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,954
It's not the same.

1291
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,471
Will I ever see you again?

1292
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,511
I don't know.

1293
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,990
I'll always be watching over you.

1294
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,994
But you won't be there for Wyatt.

1295
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,599
You're gonna miss so much.

1296
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,231
I will never leave Wyatt's side.

1297
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,232
He will always feel my presence.

1298
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,317
It's not the same as human love.

1299
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,911
He needs you for that.

1300
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,876
He's got me.

1301
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,438
And I hope that that's enough.

1302
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,673
But what if it's not?

1303
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:32,074
As an Elder, I have the power
to take your pain away.

1304
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:37,275
You can't make me forget you.

1305
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,033
No...

1306
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,076
...help you find peace.

1307
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,479
I know, Elise.

1308
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,916
Yeah, it really was a great costume.

1309
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,992
I'm just glad that the night
was a success.

1310
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:48,071
Okay. You too.

1311
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,719
Bye.

1312
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:55,234
Well, I managed to raise $18,000 for
the Bay Mirror Children's Foundation.

1313
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,668
Gotta admit,
being a goddess did have its perks.

1314
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,673
I even got a second date with Evan.

1315
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:04,157
What's Jason gonna think?

1316
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,038
You know, I miss Jason. I really do.

1317
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,236
But I can't put my life
on hold for him.

1318
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,436
You know, if he comes back
to San Francisco,

1319
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,192
then we'll give it another shot.

1320
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,995
How about you?
You miss being a warrior princess?

1321
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:19,434
No, I do not miss
being a warrior princess.

1322
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,956
In fact, I don't even think
I'm gonna miss being super-witch.

1323
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,469
What do you mean?

1324
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:29,470
I've been on this crazy
magic journey for so long now, I...

1325
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,796
I just think it's time to
slow down a bit, you know.

1326
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:35,475
I've kind of let my career slide,
let my friends slide.

1327
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,955
I think I'm just tired
and I need a break.

1328
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,118
You got it?

1329
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,554
You know, Paige, you should
be really proud of yourself.

1330
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,472
All that hard work paid off.

1331
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,835
We beat the Titans.

1332
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,070
Yeah, I am. That's great.

1333
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,317
I guess I'm just kind of looking
forward to a change, you know?

1334
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,233
To help me take my mind off
what we're losing.

1335
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,753
Oh, sweetie,
you can't look at it that way.

1336
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,638
We didn't lose him.

1337
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,199
He'll be watching over us.

1338
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,272
It's different.

1339
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,797
Come in!

1340
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,275
- Hi.
- Hey.

1341
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:14,754
Hi.

1342
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,271
Are you sure
you want us over today?

1343
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,194
Yeah, I mean,
we don't wanna intrude.

1344
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,279
No, you're not intruding.
This was Piper's idea.

1345
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:27,029
I can only imagine what
she's going through. How's she doing?

1346
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,269
We're not really sure.

1347
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,034
She wanted to be alone
with the baby last night.

1348
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,995
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if she
didn't come out of her room for a year.

1349
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,309
Hi, guys.

1350
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,198
- I'm so glad you could come.
- Hi.

1351
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,839
Hi.

1352
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,832
We wanted to show our support.

1353
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,638
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1354
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,153
Leo was...

1355
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,912
...is...

1356
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,798
...somebody who...

1357
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,829
Oh, come on, guys.
This is a celebration.

1358
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,752
Leo got promoted.

1359
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,273
We should all be happy for him.

1360
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,953
- I am.
- You are?

1361
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,479
Of course I am.

1362
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,196
Piper, you don't have to put on
a brave face. We're all here for you.

1363
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,591
Suppressing emotions
in this family can be dangerous.

1364
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,792
No, I'm not suppressing
anything, really. I'm okay.

1365
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,709
Now, let's eat before
the baby wakes up from his nap.

1366
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,270
Oh, I forgot the baby monitor.
Here. Be right back.

1367
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,839
Okay. Let's eat.

1368
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,036
- Go on.
- Yeah, come on, honey.

1369
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,231
Something's wrong with Piper.

1370
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,197
Maybe she's moved on.

1371
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,952
But Piper doesn't move on,
she fights.

1372
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,639
I'm telling you, that wasn't Piper.

1373
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,108
So did the Elders decide
what to do with me yet?

1374
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,872
Well, you've been the subject
of heated discussion.

1375
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,315
One thing we agreed upon is...

1376
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:01,072
...you can't return to the future.

1377
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:02,674
I figured as much.

1378
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,195
The time line's changed.
I don't even know what I'd go back to.

1379
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:08,993
So...

1380
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,118
...what did they decide?

1381
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,030
The Elders voted...

1382
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,671
...to make you the Charmed Ones'
new whitelighter.

1383
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,829
They did?

1384
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,032
As a reward for helping
defeat the Titans. But then...

1385
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,711
...somehow, I figured you knew that.

1386
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:29,075
You know, I can't stop thinking
about what Piper said,

1387
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,310
and wondering myself,

1388
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,436
if this wasn't part
of your plan all along.

1389
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,195
Take good care of them, Chris.

1390
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:41,159
Don't forget...

1391
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,719
...l'll be watching over you.
