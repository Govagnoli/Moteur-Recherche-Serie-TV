1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,050
Looks like they're all asleep.
Maybe I should sneak out of here.

2
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:11,637
No. Why don't you stay for breakfast.

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,056
How do you like your eggs?

4
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,934
- What about your sisters?
- What about them?

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,394
Whoa!

6
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,148
Sorry. You okay?

7
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,860
- What are you doing?
- Trying to fix the garbage disposal.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,113
- What are you doing?
- Messing around.

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,409
Hey, sorry. I should have told you
I was here.

10
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:39,456
No, don't be silly. Paige is a big girl.
She can hang out all she wants to.

11
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,750
Not that she does a lot. I mean...

12
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,002
- You can stop now.
- Right.

13
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,921
Hey, you mind if I take a look?

14
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,798
Sure, go ahead.

15
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,133
Okay.

16
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,556
What's wrong with the disposal
anyway?

17
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,267
Not disposing, washer not washing.
Cable not cabling.

18
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,144
- Don't forget the sink upstairs.
- It's next on my list.

19
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,565
- Sounds like fun.
- That's my life, actually. All about fun.

20
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,783
- There you go. It's as good as new.
- He's handy to have around.

21
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,411
Yeah. I thought you didn't use
magic anymore.

22
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,206
Just once in a while, for little things.
Want me to fix the washer?

23
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,791
- Yes.
- No.

24
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,377
Can you guys help me pick out
some earrings?

25
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,839
Hi. I didn't know you were here.

26
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,134
Hey, yeah. We got in late last night.

27
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,137
- I see.
- He fixed the garbage disposal.

28
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,431
- Really?
- Magically.

29
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,975
Really?

30
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,981
Can you help me with my earrings
out here, please?

31
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,400
Sure.

32
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,570
Excuse me.

33
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,825
So how do you like your eggs,
scrambled or over easy?

34
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,704
Okay, listen, was that weird?

35
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,289
Why are you so dressed up?

36
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,083
Because I have a date with Jason,
but that's besides the point.

37
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,378
Didn't Richard lose it the last time
he used magic? I mean, really lose it?

38
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,215
I can assure you that he stayed
in complete control

39
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,133
over the garbage disposal.

40
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,969
It's 7:00 in the morning,
how can you have a date?

41
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,347
Because it's 7 here,
but it's evening in Hong Kong.

42
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,600
Okay, so you're not concerned
about Richard using magic?

43
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,562
Yeah, I am, but I'm more concerned
with Paige being really pissed off

44
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,814
because we butted into
her business again.

45
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,651
Yeah, I know, but we're sisters,
that's what we're supposed to do.

46
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,655
Back to your date, I don't understand,
is Chris orbing you to Hong Kong?

47
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,198
No, we're video conferencing.

48
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,201
We just open our laptops
and there we are, in colour.

49
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,078
In each other's laps.

50
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,705
So do you think we should
talk to Paige about Richard?

51
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,792
- We don't really know him.
- I know we don't.

52
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,877
And neither does she.
That's the problem.

53
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,966
- What, can't I worry?
- From afar. Yeah.

54
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,594
Now, excuse me,
I have to go unclog a sink.

55
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,649
Well, maybe a little magic
couldn't hurt.

56
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,910
Help me!

57
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:35,132
Okay, so watery lady
pops up from the sink.

58
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,594
- You sure she's not a demon?
- I'm sure she needed help.

59
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,470
- What else did she say?
- That was it.

60
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,472
"Harding Park, pond,"
and poof!

61
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,812
Over there.

62
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,416
They're coming! Take this,
it does not belong to them!

63
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,079
I'm liking these odds.

64
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,918
Wuss.

65
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,003
The sword.

66
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,549
The sword is...

67
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,679
Where'd she go?
What did she say?

68
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,099
She said something about the sword.
Where is it?

69
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,601
It's in the stone.

70
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,193
The sword in the stone?

71
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,697
Oh, you gotta be kidding me, right?

72
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,597
Okay, could you maybe
miss the table?

73
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,642
I'm sorry, I've never orbed anything
that heavy before.

74
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:17,020
- Or that historic.
- Is that glowing?

75
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,898
No, it's the sunroom,
there's a lot of light.

76
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,693
What part of this aren't you getting?
Sword, stone, lady in lake.

77
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,194
It was a pond.

78
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,282
- You think she's from Avalon?
- Yeah, I think she was flushed out

79
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,577
by whoever's after Excalibur.
The maker of kings.

80
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,789
Look, we're not talking about Camelot,
right, because that's not real.

81
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,834
You never believed in King Arthur
and the Knights of the Round Table?

82
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,546
Yes, I did, when I was 7.
And then I grew up.

83
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,507
Yeah, you grew up to be a witch

84
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,759
that fights demons
and silly-looking dragons.

85
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,345
- That's different, that's real.
- And this isn't real?

86
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,348
- What is real are those hooded freaks.
- Who are not gonna give up

87
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,684
- now that the sword's in the open.
- How do you know?

88
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:59,354
Whoever has Excalibur
is unstoppable.

89
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,110
Okay, there's definitely nothing
in the Book.

90
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,613
Oh, hi. How you doing?

91
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,741
Phoebe, please put a stop
to this nonsense.

92
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,784
- Didn't realise you were here.
- That's okay.

93
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,494
You can talk freely in front of him.

94
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,955
Lord knows,
you've been through enough.

95
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,709
- No, not really.
- Phoebe.

96
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,587
Look, I should probably go.

97
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,924
Don't be ridiculous. You're great.

98
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,551
Okay, anyway, Book, Excalibur?

99
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,011
Yeah, nothing, nada.

100
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,638
- Really?
- Told you.

101
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,099
You know, hey, maybe it's been out
of circulation since ye olden days,

102
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,852
and maybe no Halliwell has ever
come across it before.

103
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,772
Well, we have run across these guys,
executioner demons,

104
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,484
- lower-level badasses for hire.
- Who hired them?

105
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,111
This higher-level badass.

106
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,073
"A power-mad paladin
of destruction."

107
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:55,661
Maybe... You know, maybe we
should just kind of hang out later.

108
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,956
Yeah. Okay. Bye.

109
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,707
Bye.

110
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,753
I don't know.

111
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:09,967
- Be careful with all this.
- Always. I had...

112
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,346
...a really good time last night.
- Me too.

113
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,932
What?

114
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:21,103
I just don't think your sisters
like me very much.

115
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,438
- No, that's not true.
- Really?

116
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:27,276
Okay, maybe they're just doing
the overprotective sister thing.

117
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:29,695
Well, that's a good thing.

118
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:33,156
Because I don't want anything
to happen to you.

119
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,449
Don't worry.

120
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,249
So he's an upper-level demon,
which means

121
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,878
you should be able to make
a vanquishing potion.

122
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,006
Okay. Wait. Me? Why me?

123
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:52,676
Because, hello, I have a few
hundred things to do

124
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,887
around here, in addition
to raising a small child.

125
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,763
I know, you have so much to do.

126
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,558
You're my hero. But I can't,
I have to go to work.

127
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,102
I still don't have an assistant,
and I'm swamped.

128
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,854
But... Phoebe!

129
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,317
Paige, potion?

130
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,820
Oh, I'm sorry, honey, the temp
agency's already got me a new job.

131
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,448
But that hardly compares with...

132
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,325
Come on, you know
there's a magical reason

133
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,993
that I've had every one
of these jobs,

134
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,037
and who am I to interfere
with destiny?

135
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:23,707
Okay, so you want me
to add "babysit the sword"

136
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:27,169
and "mix vanquishing potion"
to my never-ending to-do list.

137
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,005
Look, the sword is stuck
in the stone. You know it, I know it,

138
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:33,050
the bad guys know it. Nobody's gonna
get it out till King Arthur does.

139
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,219
When that happens,
there'll be lots of fireworks.

140
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,054
- When might that be?
- How should I know?

141
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,264
Maybe a couple thousand years?

142
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,361
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying.

143
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,995
Oh, but I do blame you.

144
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,582
The sword is now locked in stone.
You promised me murderers,

145
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,627
what you delivered
was cannon fodder for witches!

146
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,587
Those weren't just witches.

147
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:14,091
Tell me, demon, will your thick head
still spout excuses

148
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,926
when it's cut from your neck?

149
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,303
If the sword is
with the Charmed Ones,

150
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,056
it means we need a better class
of executioners, that's all.

151
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,812
And how much more
will this cost me?

152
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,816
- The Charmed Ones are formidable.
- How much?

153
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,776
To provide you
with more executioners

154
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:36,613
and the training needed to drown the
Charmed Ones in their own blood...

155
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,370
...a seat at the table.

156
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:51,795
If your goal is to unite all evil under
the corrupted power of the sword,

157
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,590
you could do far worse
than have me at your side.

158
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:04,141
- Responses to last week's columns.
- How'd you get into my e-mail?

159
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,144
Your e-mail account is maxed out,
so your fans are using ours.

160
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,440
Oh, I'll tell you, Elise better find me
a new assistant because pretty soon

161
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:15,277
she's gonna have to ask Phoebe
to take my foot out of her...

162
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,073
Hello, Phoebe Halliwell.

163
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,451
Oh, hey, Laura.

164
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:24,453
I have that down...

165
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:30,083
...for this morning. Oh, my God,
I missed it. I'm so sorry.

166
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,712
No, of course I can reschedule.
Absolutely.

167
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,384
Actually, Laura, can I call you back
when I have my book in front of me?

168
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,639
Okay, great. I'm so sorry.
Thanks. Bye.

169
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:47,017
Hi, I thought you had
a new temp job today.

170
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,520
- I do.
- Why aren't you there?

171
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,647
Apparently I am.

172
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,400
- What? Here?
- Yep.

173
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,861
- As my assistant?
- Well, I think I'd prefer

174
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,404
to be called your desk manager.

175
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,824
Wait, but I thought you get all
of your temp jobs for divine reasons.

176
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,159
Usually I do.

177
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,787
Yeah, but I don't need divine help,
I need filing

178
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,331
and faxing
and desk-management help.

179
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,668
I'm your girl. I really am.
We'll just, you know, see if

180
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,170
the divine stuff kind of appears later.
It usually does.

181
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:19,383
Yeah, but I can't tell you what to do.
I mean, how weird is that?

182
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,301
Well, it's no weirder than usual.

183
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,638
- I see.
- Just kidding, sort of.

184
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,641
Listen, you get back to your column.
I will call Laura and reschedule.

185
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,309
I will...

186
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,229
...help stuff.

187
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,160
Perfect.

188
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,424
Hey, lady!

189
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,889
We could really use
an authority figure out there.

190
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,142
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

191
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,978
I'm getting pushed around!
I just lost my place in line.

192
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,646
What line?

193
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,781
What...? What's going on here?

194
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,580
Never.

195
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,792
- What is this?
- Natural selection.

196
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,754
Naturally, I hope the sword
selects me to be king.

197
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,923
Finally get a little respect around here.

198
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:50,933
You people, you creatures, whatever.
You can't be here. You gotta go.

199
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,769
We have a divine right to try our hand.

200
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:55,896
- Wow.
- Yeah.

201
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,773
Ten feet's pretty much the distance.

202
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,192
Back of the line, please.

203
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:01,652
Hoof it, sister!

204
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,364
Chris! Chris. Get down here.

205
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,450
- Where's Chris?
- Busy.

206
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,452
Let's go.

207
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,120
- What's going on?
- Busy with what?

208
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:15,207
Other charges. I took him
off your account again.

209
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,417
- Our account?
- You know what I mean.

210
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,048
- Whoa, is that what I think it is?
- No. No, it's not.

211
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,717
Okay, now look, you gotta get
all these people out of here

212
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,803
because I can't do this right now.

213
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,722
Hey, hey, hey! No cuts, buddy.

214
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,690
Hey, how was the staff meeting?

215
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,650
Endless. How's my new assistant
working out?

216
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:44,862
Oh, she put a fire under the interns,
that's for sure.

217
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,572
Really?

218
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,241
Okay, who can help me with that?

219
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:53,120
Great, you got it. And what about
collating and cross-referencing?

220
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,497
You. And so you would
have databasing.

221
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:58,500
All right, great. You boys
have your marching orders.

222
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,878
I will check back with you
in a couple hours.

223
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,718
Wow, who works here?

224
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,721
You do. Who rocks?
That would be me.

225
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,182
By the end of the day,
we'll have a system in place

226
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,934
that tracks your column ideas,
your columns written

227
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,477
and your columns considered,

228
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,772
plus a separate file for your questions,
comments and fan mail.

229
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,275
- I can't believe it.
- Well, believe it because you,

230
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:26,403
my dear, are never going to miss
anything again.

231
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,197
- That's good.
- It is good news

232
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,157
because you, my dear,
need to concentrate.

233
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,825
Yes, I do.

234
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,912
Yes, you do.
Starting with tomorrow's column.

235
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,499
- I already wrote tomorrow's column.
- Yeah, you did.

236
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,878
Is there a problem with it?

237
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,130
Well, I mean, I'm no expert,

238
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,424
but I was just thinking
about this one question.

239
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,802
Okay, the girl's family wants her
to break up with him

240
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,513
because they think
he's an alcoholic.

241
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,932
And absent of any proof,
you're telling her to end it.

242
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,603
Well, you know, not really end it,
just slow it down a bit.

243
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:03,815
Okay, but slowing it down
by not seeing each other is,

244
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,442
in effect, ending it.

245
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,986
I just think you should
keep your eyes open.

246
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,405
Keep my eyes open?

247
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:13,617
I mean, I think that she should keep
her eyes open.

248
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:17,246
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

249
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:22,501
- This column's about Richard, isn't it?
- No, it is not about Richard.

250
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:24,086
Don't be ridiculous.

251
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,799
You hate him. I can tell,
and what's worse, he can tell.

252
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,219
Look, Paige, if you're sensing
anything from me, it's just concern.

253
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:36,056
I'm concerned that you're falling
too fast for a guy you barely know.

254
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,394
But, you know,
it's none of my business.

255
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:44,064
You're right. It's not
any of your business.

256
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,693
Right.

257
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,113
Hey, Piper needs your help, now.

258
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,085
Pest.

259
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,548
Oh, my!

260
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:13,010
- I was afraid this would happen.
- You could have mentioned that.

261
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,679
- And they won't leave?
- Oh, no. No.

262
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,932
- More show up every minute.
- But no bad guys yet, right?

263
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,185
What is that stench?
What is that stench?

264
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:24,146
We gotta get this thing out
of here. Leo refuses to orb it.

265
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,815
The Lady of the Lake came to you.
I'm not messing with that.

266
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:31,570
Oh, for God's sakes, if you
will not get rid of it, then I will!

267
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:38,994
Your Majesty.

268
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,581
Wow.

269
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:01,099
I bet you didn't expect this
when you got up this morning.

270
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:04,019
- L...
- The sword has chosen.

271
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:07,314
You are the new saviour.

272
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,358
The champion of good,

273
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,276
the master of Excalibur.

274
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,198
- Welcome to your new destiny.
- Oh, crap.

275
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,954
Okay, let's go. Nothing to see
here anymore,

276
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,957
- no more show, adiós, scram.
- Your Majesty, seriously,

277
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:28,293
if you need anything, anything at all.
Castles built, suits of armour,

278
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,879
you name it, I got connections.

279
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:37,678
Is it just me, or does it still
smell like ogre in here?

280
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,973
I'm telling you, guys,
this is all a big mistake.

281
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,226
- Stop that.
- It's drawn to you,

282
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:47,396
- just like you're drawn to it.
- Do I look like I'm drawn to it, pal?

283
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,065
- You will be in time.
- No, I don't have time

284
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,275
to play Queen Arthur.

285
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,572
Oh, come on, Piper, have a little fun.
Don't you realise what this means?

286
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,282
One more thing on my to-do list?

287
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,451
No, it means you, my dear,
are the chosen one,

288
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,496
the first in centuries to have
power over the sword.

289
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:06,123
Tell her all about it, Merlin.

290
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:10,878
Oh, actually, the name's Mordaunt.
Merlin was just a fairy tale.

291
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,756
But Camelot was not.

292
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,384
And thanks to you, it can rise again.

293
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:20,846
So, what are you, a wizard,
a sorcerer?

294
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,433
Actually, I'm neither.
I'm just a humble teacher

295
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,268
in service of the sword.

296
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,604
And we must begin
instruction immediately,

297
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,272
before your enemy attacks.

298
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,857
- The Dark Knight.
- You know him?

299
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,525
Yeah, we've already kicked his ass.

300
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:37,154
And if he shows up again, we have a
vanquishing potion ready and waiting.

301
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,656
- What's in it?
- It's a mandrake variation

302
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,909
with a little bit of griffin's blood.

303
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:46,163
Good, if you're going up against
a pustulous knave, which you're not.

304
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:50,042
If you want to fight the Dark Knight
with magic, this is what you need.

305
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,295
I thought you said
you weren't a sorcerer.

306
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:57,424
I picked up a few things along the way.
The Dark Knight is no trifle.

307
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,635
You'll have to hit him
with everything you have.

308
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,221
I've never even heard of half
of these ingredients.

309
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,389
Looks like he picked up
quite a bit.

310
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,143
What do you think?

311
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,898
- Can't get a read on him.
- Your distrust is expected,

312
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:15,692
but don't let it blind you.
If I haven't taught Piper

313
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:19,363
how to master the sword
before the Dark Knight returns,

314
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,365
your survival depends on that potion.

315
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:24,576
Okay, so where are we supposed
to get the ingredients?

316
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:29,331
I think I know a place. Leave it to me,
your trusty assistant.

317
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,876
All right, I guess I will go check
with the other Elders

318
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,254
and see what they know.

319
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,256
You want me to take Wyatt?

320
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,425
Piper.

321
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,219
Do you want me to take
Wyatt with me?

322
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:43,846
Oh, yeah. Sure.

323
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:48,475
I'll be fine.

324
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:52,938
En garde!

325
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,320
Not bad.
Better than Arthur's first time.

326
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:04,241
- Really?
- Now, I'm gonna come in low.

327
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:09,997
Believe in Excalibur.
Just let it flow through you.

328
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,046
- These are your best?
- The highest quality.

329
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,716
- They'll get the job done.
- They'd better.

330
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,677
If they don't, it's not me
they'll have to answer to.

331
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:26,555
- I thought you were...
- I serve a greater power.

332
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,515
Whose?

333
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,312
We've got a problem.

334
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,523
Hey!

335
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:44,406
Well. Should have figured
you'd be after the sword.

336
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:47,242
- Tell him.
- Kiss my grumpy ass.

337
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,578
Tell him.

338
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:52,915
You're too late.

339
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:56,752
Piper Halliwell has Excalibur.
And she's being trained how to use it.

340
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,880
By who? Who's training her?

341
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:09,765
- Does this change anything?
- It changes everything.

342
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:22,361
I think we got everything you need.
Plant roots, fungi, herbs,

343
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:25,656
- creature parts, insects.
- Creature parts?

344
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,324
Fairy wings.

345
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,201
Wait, fairy wings?

346
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:31,829
Well, I didn't kill them
if that's what you're wondering.

347
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,580
- Then how'd you get them?
- Phoebe.

348
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,874
- What? Fair question.
- Actually, I'm not sure.

349
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,419
My family's been stockpiling this stuff
for years because of the feud.

350
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,630
Yeah, but the feud's over, right?

351
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,590
Hey, you know,
I think we're gonna need

352
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:46,635
a mortar and pestle for the potion,
do you have one?

353
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:48,053
Yeah.

354
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,807
What are you doing?

355
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,642
- What?
- You don't have to treat him

356
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,271
- like he's evil.
- Paige, I'm just reacting to what I see.

357
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:00,941
I mean, how many guys do you
know that stockpile gremlin ears?

358
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:03,235
Okay, first your not-so-subtle column,
and now this.

359
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,571
Why don't you come out
and admit it? You hate him.

360
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,782
Paige, I don't hate him.
I'm just worried.

361
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:10,951
Well, don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

362
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:13,787
Okay, so are you telling me
that it doesn't bother you at all

363
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,290
that he's using magic again?
Or that he has this...?

364
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:19,042
This room hidden?

365
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:23,088
What part of "this is not
your business" are you not getting?

366
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:26,133
Oh, Paige, I am worried about you.

367
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,052
Okay, just like you were worried
about me when I was dating a demon.

368
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:33,015
- Richard is not a demon.
- No, I know he's not a demon, Paige.

369
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:35,267
But he has a dark side
and powerful magic.

370
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,144
And that's a very dangerous
combination.

371
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:40,731
L... I'm worried about you, okay?
I'm sorry.

372
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,946
- Here.
- Thanks.

373
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,366
Everything all right?

374
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,788
Let's just get this over with.

375
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:19,144
- You're a quick study.
- You're a good teacher.

376
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:23,357
So you feel the sword's power?

377
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,734
- Yes.
- How's it feel?

378
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:27,903
Not bad.

379
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:32,241
You and Excalibur are becoming one.

380
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:36,203
Soon, nothing will matter.

381
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:39,248
Nothing except the desire to rule.

382
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:51,385
You.

383
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:54,388
I was wondering when you'd show up.
Take him!

384
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:11,280
- "Wereboar tusk, one pinch.
- Okay.

385
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,198
Nymph hair, one lock.

386
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,410
Oh, I hope this isn't
from someone we know.

387
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,455
Wraith essence, three drops.

388
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:25,085
- One, two, three.
- And black poppy,

389
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:27,963
- one level teaspoon."
- I've never even heard of black...

390
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,464
No!

391
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,136
Phoebe, you okay?

392
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:40,309
- Richard.
- Wait, watch.

393
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:45,063
Don't ever mix wraith essence
and black poppy.

394
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:48,817
- Ever.
- Why would Mordaunt do this?

395
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,527
Because he wants you dead.

396
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,638
- I thought we made a deal.
- I don't need you

397
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,598
to get the sword anymore.

398
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,102
I've got her.

399
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,485
Your assimilation is complete.

400
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,363
You are now one with Excalibur.

401
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,240
Now what?

402
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:41,078
- It's just us.
- He's not what you think he is.

403
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:43,580
- He tried to kill us.
- He wants the sword.

404
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,374
But the sword chose me.

405
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:48,919
No, he's just using you, he wants
the power of the sword for himself.

406
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,797
You're not meant
to control the sword.

407
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,549
But I do control it.

408
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:57,803
And you don't think I can.

409
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,306
Perhaps we should leave.

410
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,310
- Paige. Paige, Paige, Paige.
- Excalibur!

411
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,775
Don't do that again.

412
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:15,612
It appears your queen has spoken.

413
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:22,786
Her Majesty has left the building.

414
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:24,913
Or Her Madness.

415
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:34,131
Doesn't look like much of a kingdom.

416
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:37,342
Well, this is just where it begins,

417
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,970
where you form your inner circle.

418
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:43,390
Let me guess,
the Knights of the Round Table?

419
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:45,767
The knights of your Round Table.

420
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:50,731
You're on a new path now,
a new destiny.

421
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:55,319
That's good because I was
getting a little bored of the old one.

422
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,696
A world of adventure awaits you.

423
00:28:57,863 --> 00:29:01,325
Warfare, conquest,

424
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:03,494
Camelot.

425
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:09,041
- And what exactly is Camelot?
- Whatever you want it to be.

426
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,543
It's your kingdom to make.

427
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,754
Could you be a little more specific?

428
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:18,926
There will be no one above you,
no one to challenge you.

429
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:22,137
You will have free rein
to reshape the way things are,

430
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:25,807
to create a world of your dreams.

431
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:29,853
All will bow down before you.

432
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:32,481
All will serve your every desire.

433
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:36,985
- Including you?
- Especially me, my queen.

434
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,923
What is it?

435
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,969
Well, we must...

436
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,263
...build your kingdom first.

437
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,767
And to do that, we need to fill
your Round Table with knights.

438
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,729
- Very well, I have a few ideas.
- No.

439
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:18,110
Let me be your counsel.
I know best who will serve you well.

440
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:19,862
But they will not come easily.

441
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,615
You must challenge them
on fields of battle.

442
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:25,617
Force them to join you.

443
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:36,712
I think I can do that.

444
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:47,097
- Anything?
- Nope, can't find Piper anywhere.

445
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:49,933
Well. Keep looking, she's bound
to show up somewhere.

446
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,768
- Yeah, to do what?
- I don't know.

447
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:55,063
I don't understand. If she wasn't
supposed to pull the sword out,

448
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,649
- then why was she able to?
- According to the other Elders,

449
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:01,069
she was only meant to pass it on
to whomever it was really meant for.

450
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,698
So she's not the new King Arthur,
but she is the new Lady of the Lake?

451
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:07,868
- Basically, yeah.
- Well, why is it turning her evil?

452
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:10,704
Because only the ultimate power
on Earth can handle Excalibur.

453
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:12,456
That's why the lady
stayed in the lake,

454
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:14,416
to insulate herself
from the sword's power.

455
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:17,419
Okay, so we should find Piper
and then drown her.

456
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:20,839
- Oh, I'm just kidding, Leo.
- It's no joke.

457
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:24,134
It's the only way to keep the power
from consuming her, destroying her.

458
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:27,721
Still, what does Mordaunt
want with Piper?

459
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:31,225
I mean, he's tricky, but he's hardly
the ultimate power on Earth.

460
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:33,352
But he can use Piper
to become that power.

461
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:37,981
Guess who just surfaced.

462
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:49,117
- Should I kill him?
- You're the queen.

463
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:52,287
I need one more knight
to sit at my Round Table.

464
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:56,375
- Care to join me?
- Join you? Which side are you on?

465
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:59,837
All we're interested in
is the greatest power.

466
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,421
Become one of us.

467
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,342
- What he said.
- What do I get out of it?

468
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:07,553
You? You get to live.

469
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,306
- Piper!
- I should have known it was a trap!

470
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:16,186
- You stay put. You, I warned you.
- Sorry, Your Majesty.

471
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:20,315
Paige, now, orb her.

472
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:31,910
Impressive, huh?
Now, make your queen proud.

473
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,878
- What just happened?
- I don't know,

474
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,671
but I don't think it's good.

475
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,720
Leo!

476
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:56,018
Welcome.

477
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:58,770
I assume you're all wondering
why you've been gathered here.

478
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:03,025
But don't worry, if I wanted to kill you,
I would have done so already.

479
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:07,279
You are the chosen few
who will help chart a new world order,

480
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,364
united under me.

481
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:12,659
Excuse me, Your Majesty,
we're getting ahead of ourselves.

482
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:16,705
- Are we?
- The small matter of the loyalty oath.

483
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:20,667
Yeah. That's right.

484
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,338
- Administer that oath.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

485
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:27,758
If you will all put
your left hand...

486
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,220
...or claw

487
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:34,181
on one of the five points
of the pentagram in front of you.

488
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:51,365
Supreme demonic powers,
leave your hosts!

489
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,118
And find a new home
in this willing heart!

490
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:57,454
What are you doing?

491
00:33:57,746 --> 00:33:59,623
Stop!

492
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:16,098
You vanquished all my knights. Why?

493
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:24,815
Fulfilling my centuries-old quest...

494
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,651
...to control Excalibur.

495
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:31,738
- But it belongs to me.
- No. It doesn't.

496
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:36,076
It never did. But thanks to you

497
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:39,079
and the combined powers
of your knights,

498
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:40,956
now it belongs to me.

499
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:44,084
I'm the ultimate power.

500
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:46,628
I don't understand.

501
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:50,382
It's simply a transfer of power,
that's all.

502
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:52,593
And now all that remains
to do...

503
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:56,138
...is to eliminate the true recipient
of Excalibur

504
00:34:56,305 --> 00:35:00,225
before he grows old enough
to fulfil his destiny

505
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:03,145
as the son of a Charmed One.

506
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:07,274
You can't hurt him, he's protected.

507
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:10,652
I couldn't before.

508
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:14,615
But I can with this.

509
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:32,591
Feeling any better?

510
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:37,679
No, I'm pretty sure "ow" signifies that
I am not, in fact, feeling any better.

511
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:43,060
I am getting tired of this whole
soul-separating-from-my-body thing.

512
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:44,978
It's getting to be a disturbing pattern.

513
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:48,524
It was pretty close too. Your souls
were getting ready to move on.

514
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,443
- Move on to where exactly?
- Nice try.

515
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,364
I can't believe Piper.
Did you see the look in her eyes?

516
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:58,700
Hey, at least it looked like
she was having fun for once.

517
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,245
- Find her yet?
- No, nothing.

518
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:04,748
Keep trying. Just like last time, they
can't do anything until they resurface.

519
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:07,543
Yeah, unless Mordaunt wants her
to help him rule the underworld.

520
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,462
There's gotta be another way
to get her out of this.

521
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:12,923
I just wish we knew
who King Arthur is.

522
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:16,385
- Wait, what do you mean?
- I mean, if we need to separate

523
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:18,887
Piper from the sword,
what better way than figure out

524
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:20,889
who she's meant to give it to?

525
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:26,770
No.

526
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:31,316
It's Wyatt. Oh, my God.
It has to be.

527
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:35,821
- What's the matter?
- It's Piper, she's hurt.

528
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:41,285
- Harding Park. Let's go.
- I got Wyatt.

529
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:50,752
Don't worry, it'll all be over soon.

530
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:53,630
Once they come for you,
I'll go for him.

531
00:36:57,092 --> 00:36:59,011
- Hurry! Hurry, hurry!
- I am, I am.

532
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:05,684
Where's Wyatt?

533
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:15,611
My apologies, King Wyatt.

534
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,822
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

535
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:30,083
What?!

536
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:33,253
And that's his favourite teddy bear.

537
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:39,885
Hey.

538
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:44,223
Bet you didn't expect this
when you got up this morning.

539
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,600
But I've still got Excalibur!

540
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:48,852
- Not for long.
- Go for it, Wyatt.

541
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:17,422
Okay, sweetie,
that's very, very good.

542
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:23,262
But we need to put this away
so you don't put an eye out.

543
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:25,597
At least until you're 18.

544
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:36,483
How are you?

545
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,362
Oh, fine. Think you can orb this
into the attic?

546
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:42,239
Absolutely.

547
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,703
Away from any furniture?

548
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,415
Sorry.

549
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,042
Don't worry,
I'll just add it to my list.

550
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:13,896
Hey, I just finished the last of the filing.

551
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:17,649
- Great, thanks.
- Is that tomorrow's copy?

552
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:20,152
Yeah, I'm just doing some
last-minute changes.

553
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:23,989
This woman right here
is worried that her mother

554
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:26,116
- might be marrying the wrong guy.
- Really?

555
00:39:26,283 --> 00:39:28,452
Yeah, she thinks he might be
the devil incarnate.

556
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,205
Didn't we vanquish
the devil incarnate?

557
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:34,041
I told her

558
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:37,878
that unless she has absolute proof,
she should probably butt out

559
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:39,963
and let her sister live her own life.

560
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:43,509
- I thought this was about a mother.
- Yeah, well, you know what I mean.

561
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:44,843
Yeah, I think I do.

562
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,972
It's funny, this is the first job I've gotten
without a magical reason behind it.

563
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:52,184
Well, there may not have been
a magical reason,

564
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:53,810
but there was definitely a reason.

565
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:57,689
I just have to learn
to take my own advice.

566
00:39:57,856 --> 00:40:01,193
Yeah, well, don't stop
worrying about me too much.

567
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:02,820
Okay.

568
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:08,283
Hey, sorry to interrupt.
You ready to go?

569
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,328
Yeah. We're going out.
Do you wanna join?

570
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:14,873
I would love to, actually,

571
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,334
but I'm gonna take a rain check.
It's been a long day.

572
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:18,585
Okay. Good night.

573
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:24,883
Hey, Paige,

574
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:29,638
- you're fired.
- Actually, I quit.

575
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:53,620
Listen, I want you to promise me

576
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:56,623
that before we take that thing
out of storage,

577
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,710
that you're gonna play lots
of football and baseball

578
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:04,381
and have lots of normal toys,
and maybe we'll even get a dog.

579
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:06,175
What do you think?

580
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:09,219
How we doing?

581
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,931
His Highness seems content.

582
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:15,976
- What about you?
- I'm doing all right.

583
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:19,062
At least I have my priorities straight
now. I was so busy doing stuff,

584
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:21,315
and all I really wanted to do
was hang out with him.

585
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:25,027
Well, you should have more time
for that now.

586
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:28,280
- I fixed the washer.
- You did?

587
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:33,660
And the sink and the cable
and the toilet.

588
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:38,207
Wow, I forgot how handy you were
to have around the house.

589
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,004
Pretty strange, huh?

590
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:47,216
Kind of scary, actually.

591
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:49,426
- Why?
- Well, we've seen what he can do

592
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:53,055
without the sword. I can't begin
to imagine what he could do with it.

593
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:56,058
Well, whatever it is,
it's meant to be.

594
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:59,853
Doesn't make it
any less scary, though.

595
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,690
But that's tomorrow's problem.
I'll worry about it then.

596
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:06,026
Okey-dokey.
