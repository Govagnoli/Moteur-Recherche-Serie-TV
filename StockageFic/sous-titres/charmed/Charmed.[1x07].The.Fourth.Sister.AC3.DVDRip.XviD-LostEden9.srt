1
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:32,073
Come to me, Kali.

2
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,285
I conjure thee, Kali.

3
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,454
Come to me, Kali.

4
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,332
I conjure thee, Kali.

5
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,208
<i>I'm here, Aviva.</i>

6
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,882
<i>- It's been over a week.
- I know. Be patient, Aviva.</i>

7
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,884
But I've done everything
that you've asked.

8
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,887
I've followed the Halliwell sisters.
I know their every move.

9
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,557
<i>Which will all become valuable
in good time.</i>

10
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,350
<i>You must trust me.</i>

11
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,854
<i>You must make them want you
as badly as you want them.</i>

12
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,527
<i>- I talked to my mom today.
- How is she?</i>

13
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,112
I don't know.

14
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,198
She's better, I think.

15
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,159
I miss her.

16
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:20,580
<i>- She's going to be so proud of you.
- Yeah?</i>

17
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,081
I hope so.

18
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,459
<i>Are you ready
to receive your power?</i>

19
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,922
<i>- You know I am.
- Remember, it's a sacred power.</i>

20
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:34,802
<i>If I give it to you,
you must use it only as I say.</i>

21
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,764
I will. I promise.

22
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,432
<i>Very well.</i>

23
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,393
<i>Reach for the mirror,
put out your hands,</i>

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,353
<i>feel the power.</i>

25
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:06,250
<i>You know what to do.</i>

26
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,378
<i>Go to Phoebe, Piper and Prue.</i>

27
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:47,291
Well, I think I see... Yeah,
there's definitely something here.

28
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,667
Definitely.

29
00:02:50,794 --> 00:02:53,714
My, Santa, you've changed.

30
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:56,675
- He's looking for Kit.
- The cat. Right.

31
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:59,595
Four legs, fur. I remember.

32
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:08,478
Sorry. You know,
have you tried the shelter?

33
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:11,106
- Yeah, nothing.
- Well, she had her collar on, right?

34
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:12,524
With your number on it?

35
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:17,321
- A very distinctive collar, actually.
- Anyway, thanks for looking.

36
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:19,406
I'm sure you must be hungry
after all that work.

37
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:20,949
All what work?

38
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:26,038
Oh, that's just Piper.
She's gotta be everyone's mom.

39
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:29,082
Think of her as your mom.
I know I do.

40
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:33,170
Isn't she a scream?

41
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,589
Well, thanks.

42
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:40,051
Let me go put these fliers up first,
and I'll be right back, okay?

43
00:03:40,218 --> 00:03:44,097
- Oh, careful. You all right? Careful.
- Yeah, I'll just...

44
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:45,849
- Antique.
- Thanks.

45
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:48,059
Grandma's, yeah.

46
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:52,689
Quite possibly the finest glutes
in the city.

47
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:54,774
- In the state.
- In all the land.

48
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:57,027
I saw him first.

49
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:36,852
Here you go, Leo.
Non-fat milk, right?

50
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:40,105
- Thanks.
- Just don't call me "Mom."

51
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:44,067
Trust me, one hot night is all
you guys need to get back on track.

52
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:48,071
- Yeah, I hope you're right.
- Andy's a cop, you're a witch.

53
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:49,823
Expect complications.

54
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,951
- Hey, Leo. How's it going?
- Good.

55
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:57,372
This wall only needs two coats, then
I gotta do the moulding, and I'm done.

56
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,042
Are you sure
it doesn't need three coats?

57
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:05,797
Nice outfit for 9:00 in the morning
with no place to go.

58
00:07:06,923 --> 00:07:08,091
I'm glad you like it.

59
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:12,971
Leo, come here.

60
00:07:15,056 --> 00:07:16,099
Got milk?

61
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:20,103
Phoebe, come here.

62
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:24,524
Phoebe!

63
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:31,864
I think that Piper likes Leo.

64
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:34,575
What's not to like?
He's a great guy.

65
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:39,122
- I mean, really likes him.
- Your point being?

66
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:44,210
- Never mind. Classic Phoebe.
- Wait, define that.

67
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:45,461
I think you know.

68
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:49,841
Okay, look, Prue, I think we need to
put some major closure on this,

69
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:53,344
or we're gonna be in rocking chairs,
slurping oatmeal out of rubber spoons,

70
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:56,097
and I'm still gonna hear
about Roger.

71
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:58,808
Piper, am I a boyfriend thief?

72
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,101
Totally.

73
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:03,521
Besides Roger, whom again, Prue,
I never touched.

74
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:05,898
My boyfriend, Billy Wilson.

75
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:13,739
- Billy Wil... Eighth grade Billy Wilson?
- You kissed him at homecoming.

76
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:18,369
No, I did not kiss him at homecoming.
I was helping him find a contact lens.

77
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:23,332
Oh, please. You were all over him,
with your breasts all... Whatever.

78
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:27,461
- I didn't even have breasts back then.
- Phoebe, you've always had breasts.

79
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:32,424
So I think I'll just let you two
work this out on your own,

80
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:35,386
but just remember, I get the house
tonight. Just Andy and me.

81
00:08:35,553 --> 00:08:38,681
No warlocks, no innocents to protect
and especially no sisters.

82
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:45,104
So you know...

83
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:48,691
...it's not like either one of us
has a problem finding guys.

84
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:51,110
Please.

85
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:55,447
So if one of us got Leo,
it'd be okay with the other one.

86
00:08:55,864 --> 00:08:56,907
Absolutely.

87
00:08:57,074 --> 00:09:00,536
So we can just consider this
a friendly competition.

88
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:02,871
- Sibling rivalry.
- War.

89
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:05,541
Exactly.

90
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:17,010
Dear Diary...

91
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:19,429
Aviva, open the door.

92
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:21,807
...life sucks here.

93
00:09:21,974 --> 00:09:24,643
I'm gonna be late for work.

94
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:29,856
So that part about this being my room,
that was a lie?

95
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:31,692
It's my apartment, Aviva.

96
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,945
So you keep reminding me,
Aunt Jackie.

97
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:38,281
Why don't you get light
and air in here?

98
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:41,410
Because I like it dark and stale.

99
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:44,788
Why are you so antagonistic to me?

100
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:47,082
How come you haven't called
my mom yet?

101
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:49,626
- What?
- To see how she's doing.

102
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:52,295
Or just to say hello.
It would help her, you know.

103
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:54,881
I mean, it's not like
she's got a lot of family.

104
00:09:55,048 --> 00:09:57,092
She has to take responsibility
for her own actions.

105
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:59,344
She's not in jail.
She's in rehab.

106
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:02,806
She didn't do anything wrong
to take responsibility for.

107
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:06,434
She's sick, and that's it.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

108
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:08,186
Whatever.

109
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:19,030
<i>Have you seen
Lethal Weapon 3?</i>

110
00:10:19,197 --> 00:10:21,324
Not very romantic.

111
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:23,451
Right.

112
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:26,871
<i>Hey, how about Double Indemnity?</i>

113
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,751
It's black and white.

114
00:10:33,086 --> 00:10:36,381
- Right.
- Video paralysis.

115
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:37,799
Excuse me?

116
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:41,135
You're probably two minutes away
from leaving without a rental.

117
00:10:41,302 --> 00:10:45,348
You mind if I help?
After all, I am a pro.

118
00:10:45,556 --> 00:10:47,058
Sure.

119
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:53,481
Doesn't really matter
what we pick anyway.

120
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:55,900
Probably never get around
to watching it.

121
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,945
Oh, yeah?

122
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:01,072
Pretty cocky.

123
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:05,201
Actually, what I meant was
something always seems to come up,

124
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:07,453
- get in our way.
- That's not true.

125
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:11,541
Okay, well, maybe
sometimes it's true,

126
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:13,417
but there's always
a perfectly good reason.

127
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:15,711
Prue, there's never
a perfectly good reason.

128
00:11:15,878 --> 00:11:18,256
As a matter of fact, there's never
usually a reason at all.

129
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:20,508
Good, bad or otherwise.

130
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:22,301
All right.

131
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:26,931
You, me, alone tonight.

132
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:31,685
Nothing, and I mean nothing,
will get in our way. Guaranteed.

133
00:11:31,852 --> 00:11:33,187
I'll hold you to that.

134
00:11:33,854 --> 00:11:35,606
Okay.

135
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:38,651
I got it.

136
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:40,611
<i>Body Heat.</i>

137
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:42,780
We'll take it.

138
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:46,075
I conjure thee, Kali.

139
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:48,911
<i>I'm here, Aviva.</i>

140
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,164
I'm going crazy here, Kali.
I can't wait any longer.

141
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:54,792
<i>The Halliwells don't understand
our way.</i>

142
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,253
<i>They don't yet know the full uses
and joys of their powers.</i>

143
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,548
<i>- I'll show them.
- You must gain their trust first.</i>

144
00:12:01,715 --> 00:12:04,385
<i>You must let them welcome you
into their coven.</i>

145
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:06,887
I won't disappoint you.
I swear.

146
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,515
<i>Then it's time.</i>

147
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:22,194
<i>Take the cat
back to the Halliwells.</i>

148
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:40,212
About done for the day?

149
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:42,422
Just about.

150
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,342
Well, Prue has a date tonight,
so we kind of gotta clear out.

151
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:47,844
I was thinking about catching
a movie. Wanna go?

152
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:49,930
I can't do it.

153
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:53,475
- Okay.
- You know...

154
00:12:55,018 --> 00:12:56,686
...these are original to the house.

155
00:12:57,229 --> 00:13:00,357
I mean, they really should be sanded
down, finished off with steel wool

156
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:04,027
and restained, not covered in paint.

157
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:06,029
Oh, right.

158
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:08,615
Kind of like making risotto
with Minute Rice.

159
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:12,118
It's a cooking analogy.

160
00:13:12,285 --> 00:13:13,328
Yeah.

161
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:16,873
Anyway...

162
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,501
...I have stain samples at home
if you're interested.

163
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,670
I could bring them by tomorrow and
show them to you and your sisters.

164
00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:25,256
Better yet, why don't you just
bring them by the restaurant?

165
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:29,177
Say about lunchtime? Prue's so busy,
and Phoebe doesn't really care.

166
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:30,970
She's more into stucco.

167
00:13:31,346 --> 00:13:33,598
- Okay.
- Okay.

168
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:35,099
So, what time is that movie?

169
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,643
I got it.

170
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:42,941
Kit! Oh, my God! Where did you
find her? We were worried sick.

171
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:45,526
I was just walking by,
and I saw one of your fliers,

172
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:48,696
and poof, there she was.
Like magic.

173
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,202
I can't even believe
she let you hold her.

174
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:57,747
Welcome home, kitty.

175
00:13:58,498 --> 00:14:01,751
- You must be starving.
- I fed her.

176
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,836
I thought you said
you just found her.

177
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:06,339
I did. Well, a couple of hours ago,
I mean.

178
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:08,007
And she didn't try to scratch you?

179
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:10,426
You know, I'll take
the fliers down tomorrow.

180
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:13,804
- Let me clean up before the movie.
- Movie? What movie?

181
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:16,599
- A war movie.
- I love war movies.

182
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:19,310
- Mind if I tag along?
- Sure.

183
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,647
Why not? I'll be right back.

184
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:26,567
You guys aren't going out, are you?
You just got your cat back.

185
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,528
Oh, she'll be fine.
Let me get my purse.

186
00:14:29,737 --> 00:14:33,074
- What's your name?
- Oh, no, no, I don't want your money.

187
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:35,451
- Hey, Andy.
- Hey, Andy.

188
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:36,660
Hey.

189
00:14:36,827 --> 00:14:39,246
Hey, I thought we all
had plans tonight.

190
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:41,415
- This girl just found our cat for us.
- Aviva.

191
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:43,709
Well, that's great.
Is 50 bucks enough?

192
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:47,796
I don't want a reward.
We need to talk.

193
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:50,174
- About what?
- About Wicca.

194
00:14:54,678 --> 00:14:59,099
Andy Trudeau, this is Leo Wyatt.
You guys chat. We'll be right back.

195
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,392
- Okay.
- Hey.

196
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,354
- Thanks again.
- Yeah, I'm sorry you can't stay.

197
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,397
I'm not leaving.

198
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,025
Don't you understand?
I'm one of you.

199
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:15,282
No!

200
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:18,452
Very cool.

201
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:25,167
She didn't... She didn't...
You didn't freeze.

202
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:28,337
- It's because I'm a witch too.
- A what?

203
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,839
Look, I just wanna be friends.

204
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:33,759
Guys, we have about 20 seconds
until they unfreeze.

205
00:15:33,926 --> 00:15:35,302
How did you find out about us?

206
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,596
I'm gonna need
more than 20 seconds for that.

207
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:39,514
We need to move things
along here, Prue.

208
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:41,224
Okay, you need
to get out of here now.

209
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:42,434
What? Why?

210
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,519
We don't know who
you really are, so just leave.

211
00:15:44,686 --> 00:15:46,813
- Okay, go, go, go.
- No, I'm not leaving.

212
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,649
- I just saved your cat.
- Leave now or else.

213
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,151
Or else what?

214
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:05,832
What the hell?

215
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:12,422
Hey, where did that girl go?

216
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:13,715
She just...

217
00:16:14,382 --> 00:16:15,926
Left.

218
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:27,103
Why wouldn't they accept me?

219
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,189
You said if I brought them back
their cat...

220
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,358
<i>Was it the oldest?
Was it Prue who sent you away?</i>

221
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:34,944
<i>- Yes.
- Avoid her.</i>

222
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:37,822
<i>She's the strongest.
You must separate them.</i>

223
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:40,200
<i>Together they're charmed,
impenetrable.</i>

224
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:43,453
<i>- But what if they don't want me?
- Phoebe will.</i>

225
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,623
<i>In her own way, she's searching
for someone to relate to.</i>

226
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:50,126
<i>Someone to share
her witchcraft with.</i>

227
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,045
<i>What's the problem?</i>

228
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:54,714
I... I don't know.

229
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,841
<i>You're the one who came to me,
remember?</i>

230
00:16:57,008 --> 00:16:59,552
<i>You're the one who wanted sisters.</i>

231
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,221
I know I want a family.
I don't have anybody.

232
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:08,770
What do you get out of it? I mean,
you know, you never really said...

233
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:13,566
<i>Halliwell magic is old and powerful,
and I want it.</i>

234
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,986
<i>And since they're new to the craft,
if I'm ever going to get it,</i>

235
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:20,114
<i>it has to be now.
Through you.</i>

236
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:23,326
<i>Just do as I say, Aviva.</i>

237
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:29,582
<i>Make Phoebe covet your power,
then we'll both get what we want.</i>

238
00:17:35,713 --> 00:17:39,050
It's not what you think, Andy.
It's hard to explain. It just...

239
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:41,093
Another one of those things
you can't explain.

240
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,553
It's a broken record, Prue.

241
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,055
Look, I wanted you to stay.
You have to believe me.

242
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:47,016
What happened? Why'd you
want me to leave?

243
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:49,018
I told you, something came up.
Sister stuff.

244
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:52,563
I can't really go into detail
without betraying someone's secret.

245
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,858
- Prue...
- Look, Andy, I'm unpredictable, okay?

246
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:58,652
That is just part of who I am,
and you have to accept that,

247
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:00,237
because I can't change it.

248
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:03,490
I don't want you to change, Prue.
I just...

249
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:09,038
I just wanna have a normal date,
that's all. Is that too much to ask for?

250
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:16,003
All right, let's just try again tonight.
Same time, same place?

251
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,212
Same movie?

252
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,842
Yeah.

253
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:24,219
Okay. So, what, 8:00?

254
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:26,513
I'll be there. Bye.

255
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,390
All right, bye.

256
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:33,061
If I ever see that little arsonist again...

257
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:38,233
Just got done dodging Leo's questions
about her. That was close.

258
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,277
Too close.
The question is, who is she?

259
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:43,697
- And what does she want?
- Let us not forget Aviva found Kit.

260
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:46,533
Yeah, she's probably the one
who stole the cat in the first place.

261
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,453
Hello, paranoia chick.

262
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:51,663
Phoebe, for all we know,
she's a warlock.

263
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,542
- She can't be. She didn't freeze.
- Besides, she said she was a witch.

264
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:59,379
- Okay, a bad witch maybe.
- A bad witch with a really cool power.

265
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:02,591
- Better than mine, that's for sure.
- Why are you so quick to defend her?

266
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:04,843
Why are you so quick
to condemn her?

267
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:08,889
If she is a witch, a good witch,
then it might be kind of cool,

268
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:10,849
considering she's the first
we've run across.

269
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,267
- Exactly.
- Guys,

270
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:13,518
we don't know about her.

271
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,896
How she got her powers,
how she found out about us.

272
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:18,773
She tried to tell us,
but you kicked her out.

273
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,110
Yeah, she would've exposed us
if I hadn't.

274
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:23,737
Prue, she's just a kid.

275
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:29,200
Besides, if she's a witch, she probably
feels just as alone as we do.

276
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:30,994
Maybe she just needs some friends.

277
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,872
Or maybe she's out to destroy us.
It wouldn't be the first time.

278
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,832
- Okay.
- All right,

279
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:40,253
until we know who she really is,
let's just steer clear, okay?

280
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:42,922
I'm late for work.

281
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,632
Me too.

282
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:53,099
Hello.

283
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,143
Aviva?

284
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,983
I'm so glad that you came.

285
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,068
I'm glad that you called, actually.

286
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:07,280
- Bet you got a few questions, huh?
- A few.

287
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:10,825
- What time does school let out?
- Now.

288
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:13,828
Whoa! Whoa!
Hey, what are you doing?

289
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:17,415
Oh, the same thing I'm sure you did
a thousand times.

290
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:20,001
- Am I right?
- Well...

291
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:22,587
I am right.

292
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,047
You didn't tell your bitch sister
about this, did you?

293
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:26,799
Hey, watch your mouth.

294
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:29,719
Prue had every right to be upset
with what you did.

295
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:32,680
It's funny how you knew that I was
talking about Prue and not Piper.

296
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:36,934
Hey, come on, let's go for a ride.

297
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:41,439
I'll tell you everything
that you want to know.

298
00:20:57,663 --> 00:20:59,290
Table for one, sir?

299
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:04,211
- You own this place?
- No, I just run it.

300
00:21:06,297 --> 00:21:09,883
Actually, I used to be the chef here.

301
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,853
I'm impressed.

302
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,690
Good. I mean,
good that you came here.

303
00:21:24,857 --> 00:21:27,776
As opposed to the house
and Phoebe.

304
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:32,239
How about those stain samples?

305
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:36,243
I only brought the ones authentic to
the era in which the manor was built.

306
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,995
Great.

307
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:39,621
Hungry?

308
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:43,041
Oh, it's on the house.

309
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:46,295
You're big on food, aren't you?

310
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:49,673
You know, and that's good. You know,
actually, in the Mayan culture,

311
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,509
the cook was second in the hierarchy
only to the medicine man.

312
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:55,804
Mayans? You know about Mayans.

313
00:21:56,263 --> 00:21:58,640
Well, you certainly are a handyman,
aren't you?

314
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:02,728
So does Phoebe work here too?

315
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:06,022
Phoebe, work? No, no, no.

316
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:09,109
She's probably at her gay and lesbian
group right about now.

317
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:11,695
So, what will it be?

318
00:22:17,284 --> 00:22:19,160
This is the dining room.

319
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:21,830
This is the parlour.
That's the conservatory,

320
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:24,332
which is really just a fancy name
for family room.

321
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:27,919
This is so totally cool.
Oh, I love it here.

322
00:22:28,086 --> 00:22:30,880
And welcome to planet Leo.

323
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:35,093
- You are lucky Miss Leo?
- Maybe.

324
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,264
Doesn't he like you? I mean, how
could he not? You are so gorgeous.

325
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:44,394
Well, you see, Piper and I sort of have
this little competition going over him.

326
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:49,023
So just use your powers.
Cast a spell on him or something.

327
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,985
- You do have powers, don't you?
- What makes you think I do?

328
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:54,362
Please. You're a witch.

329
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:58,032
Yeah, which brings us back
to how do you know that?

330
00:22:59,492 --> 00:23:01,411
You promised.

331
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:07,709
I have this teacher.

332
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:11,170
She's great. She's like my mom.
She told me.

333
00:23:11,337 --> 00:23:12,380
- Who is she?
- Another witch.

334
00:23:12,547 --> 00:23:14,507
Like a high priestess or something.

335
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:17,760
She said you were the coolest,
that I would like you the best.

336
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:21,055
- She was right.
- Well, I'd like to meet her sometime.

337
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:22,682
Yeah?

338
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:24,600
Is your room up there?

339
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:30,857
Come on, I wanna share something
with you.

340
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:32,984
You're gonna love it.
I promise.

341
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,819
Come on.

342
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,202
I like mirrors.
They never lie to you.

343
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:46,330
They always tell the truth
whether you like it or not.

344
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:49,291
It's basic black.
The colour of my soul.

345
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:52,878
- Do you wanna try it?
- Your soul's not black.

346
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:55,714
You know the feeling that I mean.
You're different.

347
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:58,050
You know, you'll never want
what they want.

348
00:23:58,217 --> 00:24:02,930
You belong on the edge.
We aren't pink people, Phoebe.

349
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,853
You wanna see something incredible?
Better yet, do you wanna try it?

350
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:10,062
Try what?

351
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:12,523
I'll show you my power
if you show me yours.

352
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:16,568
Anybody home?

353
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,780
Better not be.

354
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:22,700
Don't be afraid.

355
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:29,915
- Okay, now what?
- Watch.

356
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:38,507
- She's giving it to you too.
- Who is?

357
00:24:38,674 --> 00:24:40,717
- Giving me what?
- The power.

358
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,553
Here.

359
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:44,471
Touch this.

360
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:53,188
It's the power of heat.
Your hand is like the sun.

361
00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:54,564
Whoa.

362
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:56,984
That's pretty cool, huh?

363
00:24:57,442 --> 00:24:58,944
Phoebe, are you...?

364
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:02,114
- Prue.
- What are you doing?

365
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,157
- Get out. This is her room.
- Aviva...

366
00:25:04,324 --> 00:25:06,785
No. She treats you worse
than my aunt treats me.

367
00:25:06,952 --> 00:25:09,830
- It's not right.
- It's okay. Relax.

368
00:25:20,882 --> 00:25:22,551
<i>Chianti, Body Heat.
What do you think?</i>

369
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:27,180
- Prue, I can explain. Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

370
00:25:27,347 --> 00:25:28,848
Let me guess, rain check?

371
00:25:29,015 --> 00:25:30,642
- Andy...
- Prue, this is...

372
00:25:31,518 --> 00:25:33,561
- It's getting ridiculous.
- I know.

373
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:35,939
Believe me, you have every right
to be upset,

374
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:40,235
and I can't talk about it right now,
but I will. I promise.

375
00:25:40,402 --> 00:25:43,279
Tomorrow, Quake, 1:00, please?

376
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:46,741
Okay. Tomorrow, 1:00.

377
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:54,541
I am so sorry. I totally forgot.

378
00:25:54,707 --> 00:25:56,584
What is she doing here?
What's the matter with you?

379
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:59,295
This is her house too, okay?
She can do whatever she wants.

380
00:25:59,462 --> 00:26:01,172
Aviva.

381
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:04,092
- She's not what you think she is.
- She doesn't understand, Phoebe.

382
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:06,719
She'll never understand.

383
00:26:16,562 --> 00:26:19,732
<i>If there were no Prue,
Phoebe would be with us now.</i>

384
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:22,318
I hate her,
and I wish that she were dead.

385
00:26:22,485 --> 00:26:25,071
Aviva, what's going on?
Who's in there with you?

386
00:26:27,323 --> 00:26:29,492
You skipped school today,
and I wanna know why.

387
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:30,952
Get out of my room!

388
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,287
How dare you speak to me
in that tone!

389
00:26:33,454 --> 00:26:35,456
What's going on in here?

390
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:39,502
I said, get out of my room!
Leave me alone, or I'll...

391
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:47,218
Aunt Jackie!

392
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:51,764
Oh, my God!

393
00:26:52,473 --> 00:26:54,058
Aunt Jackie!

394
00:27:13,702 --> 00:27:15,120
<i>What did you tell the police?</i>

395
00:27:15,287 --> 00:27:18,624
That the candle caught her dress
on fire, and she fell down the stairs.

396
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:23,087
Oh, my God. What have I done?
I didn't mean to hurt her.

397
00:27:23,254 --> 00:27:25,172
<i>Your powers are growing.</i>

398
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:27,132
I know, but as soon as
Aunt Jackie wakes up,

399
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:29,301
she'll tell them
what really happened.

400
00:27:29,468 --> 00:27:31,011
<i>- I gotta get out of here.
- No!</i>

401
00:27:31,178 --> 00:27:32,680
Why not?

402
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:35,265
<i>You must go back to the Halliwells.</i>

403
00:27:35,432 --> 00:27:37,851
<i>You must complete what you started.</i>

404
00:27:38,018 --> 00:27:41,063
<i>- But how?
- Piper won't stop you,</i>

405
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,609
<i>and Phoebe's already an ally.
Only Prue stands in our way.</i>

406
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:48,278
<i>You must use your powers.</i>

407
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:51,782
<i>You must take Prue's place
in the power of three.</i>

408
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:57,704
<i>Don't disappoint me, Aviva.</i>

409
00:27:57,871 --> 00:28:00,540
<i>You said you wanted a family.</i>

410
00:28:00,707 --> 00:28:03,043
<i>And now you'll have one.</i>

411
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:11,635
Thanks.

412
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:14,513
- You poor thing, you're shivering.
- I'm okay.

413
00:28:15,305 --> 00:28:16,765
I know that you don't like me,

414
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:19,392
and I know the last thing
you wanna do is help me,

415
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,896
but I don't know where else to turn.
I don't have anybody else.

416
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:27,567
She's telling the truth.
Her aunt was admitted to the hospital.

417
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:29,027
How is she? Is she okay?

418
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:31,279
She has a broken arm
and a concussion.

419
00:28:31,655 --> 00:28:35,325
- How did she fall again?
- I don't know. I...

420
00:28:35,492 --> 00:28:37,077
I heard her scream,

421
00:28:37,244 --> 00:28:40,580
and then I found her on the floor,
and I called 911.

422
00:28:40,997 --> 00:28:44,292
I promise, if you just let me spend
the night and get some sleep,

423
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:47,837
I'll tell you everything you wanna know
about me tomorrow.

424
00:28:48,004 --> 00:28:51,925
- She can't stay alone.
- She can sleep in my room.

425
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:55,053
- No magic.
- I swear.

426
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:11,236
<i>Now is the time.</i>

427
00:29:41,182 --> 00:29:42,725
What are you doing?

428
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:47,730
- I was just looking for the bathroom.
- Down the hall, to the right.

429
00:29:47,897 --> 00:29:50,816
Great. Thanks. Good night.

430
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,882
I'm going to the hospital to see
her aunt. In an hour, I'll be back, okay?

431
00:30:16,383 --> 00:30:19,094
- Sorry, didn't know you were there.
- That's okay.

432
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:21,555
I'm gonna see your aunt
and let her know where you are.

433
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:24,558
- We'll talk when I get back?
- Yeah. Sure.

434
00:30:24,725 --> 00:30:26,852
- Tell her I love her.
- Okay.

435
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:29,605
Come on, let's get something to eat.

436
00:30:34,526 --> 00:30:36,779
I don't understand.
Why is Aviva staying with you?

437
00:30:36,945 --> 00:30:39,365
I don't even know who you are.

438
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:41,867
Well, actually,
we just met your niece.

439
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:44,244
We lost our cat,
and she found it for us.

440
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:47,539
- Oh, that's what she was hiding.
- Hiding?

441
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:50,375
In the closet. She wouldn't let me
go anywhere near it.

442
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:53,795
You're lucky she didn't sacrifice
the poor thing.

443
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:55,255
I'm sorry?

444
00:30:57,508 --> 00:31:00,093
She's a strange kid.

445
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,305
Very troubled.
Into all sorts of weird stuff.

446
00:31:03,472 --> 00:31:07,100
Black magic, voodoo,
God knows what else.

447
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,603
No wonder she doesn't have
any friends.

448
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,773
What makes you think
she's into black magic?

449
00:31:13,815 --> 00:31:15,817
You should see her room.

450
00:31:16,318 --> 00:31:21,698
It seems like every time I walk past,
she's in there chanting or something.

451
00:31:21,865 --> 00:31:25,160
Sometimes, I swear,
I even hear other voices.

452
00:31:26,203 --> 00:31:28,288
I know she's not happy there.

453
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:32,959
I'm only taking care of her
until her mom gets out of rehab.

454
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:38,048
Do you mind if I stop by your place
and pick up some things for Aviva?

455
00:31:38,215 --> 00:31:39,257
No.

456
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,927
Great. Thanks.

457
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:43,136
Feel better.

458
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:52,562
Andy, I can't seem
to get ahold of Prue.

459
00:31:52,729 --> 00:31:54,230
I know she was going to the hospital.

460
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:56,441
That's all right, Piper.
Thanks for trying.

461
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:59,778
- I'm sure there's a perfectly good...
- Explanation.

462
00:31:59,944 --> 00:32:01,821
Wanna bet?

463
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:50,745
"Kali says we're close to taking over
the Halliwell coven.

464
00:32:50,912 --> 00:32:53,247
I hate lying to them."

465
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:03,090
<i>- Hello.
- Phoebe, it's me.</i>

466
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:04,425
Prue, where are you?

467
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:07,053
Piper called, said you were
supposed to meet Andy at Quake.

468
00:33:07,845 --> 00:33:10,014
Listen, we have a bigger problem
to deal with.

469
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:12,558
<i>Call her back and tell her
to come home right away.</i>

470
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:14,185
I'll explain it to you guys later.

471
00:33:14,351 --> 00:33:18,063
And Phoebe, whatever you do,
don't let Aviva out of your sight, okay?

472
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:21,442
- Yeah, sure.
- All right. Bye.

473
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:26,614
Prue's on her way home.

474
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,158
We can have our little chat
when she gets here.

475
00:33:29,325 --> 00:33:31,243
Yeah, okay.

476
00:33:32,536 --> 00:33:36,165
Do you mind if I go upstairs
and lie down? I'm not feeling real well.

477
00:33:36,457 --> 00:33:40,044
- Sure, go ahead.
- Okay.

478
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:12,576
This last coat of stain's gotta dry.

479
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:15,621
I'm headed over to Fillmore
in a few minutes to do an estimate.

480
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,372
Wait, you're finished already?

481
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:21,418
Yeah, I'll be back tomorrow to make
sure everybody's happy with my work.

482
00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:28,592
What?

483
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:32,387
Just out of curiosity...

484
00:34:34,097 --> 00:34:35,891
...are you and Aviva...?

485
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:40,437
- I mean, Piper said that...
- Piper said what?

486
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:46,526
Nothing. I think I need some water.

487
00:34:58,246 --> 00:35:01,624
Wait. Leo, what did Piper
say to you?

488
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:04,627
It doesn't matter really.
Forget it.

489
00:35:05,962 --> 00:35:09,966
Well, whatever she said, you should
probably take it with a grain of salt.

490
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:14,679
Sometimes her medication
makes her say the strangest things.

491
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,639
But not to worry,
her shrinks are on it.

492
00:35:16,806 --> 00:35:18,474
Shrinks?

493
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:33,990
Oh, my God, Aviva.

494
00:35:35,658 --> 00:35:37,452
Prue's home.

495
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:38,870
Oh, no.

496
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,628
Aviva? Aviva?!

497
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:52,800
What the hell are you doing?

498
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:57,430
Phoebe, I'm sorry.

499
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:11,319
Maybe we should take you
to the hospital.

500
00:36:11,485 --> 00:36:13,154
No, it's not that bad.

501
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,406
Well, how did it happen anyway?

502
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:20,995
Candles. Aviva had some candles lit,
and I guess the sweater got too close.

503
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:25,207
- And then she ran out of the house.
- Sure caught fire fast.

504
00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:28,752
Leo, we got this. We wouldn't
want you to be late for that estimate.

505
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:30,546
Are you sure? I don't mind.

506
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:33,090
No, Prue's right. I'm fine.
You go ahead.

507
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,301
Okay. I'll stop by later
to see how you're doing.

508
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:37,219
- Great.
- Great.

509
00:36:40,723 --> 00:36:42,641
Okay, so how did this happen?

510
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:47,604
I had a premonition
that Aviva was going to hurt you,

511
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:51,608
so I tried to stop her.
I should've listened to you, Prue.

512
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:54,111
You were right about Aviva.
She's evil.

513
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:57,656
No, actually, she's not,
but she is being used by an evil spirit.

514
00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:01,243
And I think I know which one,
so come on.

515
00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:14,172
<i>- Where are you going, Aviva?
- Go away!</i>

516
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:18,176
I don't want anything to do with you.
I don't wanna be a witch anymore.

517
00:37:18,343 --> 00:37:20,554
<i>But you haven't finished
what we started.</i>

518
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:23,265
But I'm hurting people!
Don't you understand?

519
00:37:23,432 --> 00:37:27,602
First Aunt Jackie, now Phoebe.
I have to leave.

520
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:30,188
<i>Aren't you going
to say goodbye first?</i>

521
00:37:31,189 --> 00:37:33,024
<i>Touch the mirror, Aviva.</i>

522
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:36,862
<i>It's okay. I'm not upset.</i>

523
00:37:37,028 --> 00:37:40,532
<i>Touch the mirror,
and I'll go away too.</i>

524
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:55,839
Hello, Aviva.

525
00:37:57,048 --> 00:37:59,509
Kali, Kali, Kali...

526
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:00,885
There, there.

527
00:38:01,052 --> 00:38:03,346
"An evil sorceress cursed
into her own dimension,

528
00:38:03,513 --> 00:38:06,141
she appears in reflections and has
the power to possess..."

529
00:38:06,307 --> 00:38:08,768
"Innocents and uses them as pawns
to steal a witch's power."

530
00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:10,395
Wait, I don't understand.

531
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:13,565
So she was using Aviva
to try and turn us into bad witches?

532
00:38:13,731 --> 00:38:15,733
Does it say anything
about how to get rid of her?

533
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,944
Yeah, to get rid of her,
shatter her reflection.

534
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:20,572
However the hell we do that. Here.

535
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:24,409
- Aviva.
- Hello, Phoebe.

536
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:27,203
- How's the arm?
- You're not Aviva.

537
00:38:27,495 --> 00:38:29,205
You're not kidding.

538
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:35,920
- Phoebe, help me!
- Never mind.

539
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:43,803
My powers are greater
than yours, Prue.

540
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,722
It's only a matter of time.

541
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:48,558
- Time. Piper, that's it. Freeze her.
- Aviva doesn't freeze.

542
00:38:48,724 --> 00:38:49,767
Yeah, but Kali will.

543
00:38:52,478 --> 00:38:53,980
No!

544
00:39:02,613 --> 00:39:05,241
Prue, the mirror.
Get her to the mirror.

545
00:39:08,494 --> 00:39:10,079
<i>No, no!</i>

546
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:23,467
<i>No, no!</i>

547
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:31,642
Thanks for the dress.

548
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:33,978
No problem. It's Prue's.

549
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:39,024
- All set?
- Yeah, I'm all set.

550
00:39:40,234 --> 00:39:42,027
You okay?

551
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:47,199
I don't think looking into a mirror
is ever gonna be the same.

552
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:50,703
Yeah, well, the demon's gone,
Aviva. Forever.

553
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:54,790
Yeah, well, unfortunately
all the other ones remain.

554
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,545
- It's so hard.
- Oh, I know.

555
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,506
It was hard for me too
when I was your age.

556
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,968
- Yeah?
- Are you kidding?

557
00:40:06,135 --> 00:40:09,513
These are the hardest years
of your life.

558
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,518
The one thing I learned
is you just gotta be yourself.

559
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:17,980
It's easy for you to say.
What if yourself sucks?

560
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,357
Well, you don't have
to worry about that.

561
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:25,112
No, Aviva, I'm serious.
You are a great kid.

562
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:28,323
I could totally see us hanging out
together in school.

563
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,076
A couple of troublemakers.

564
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:35,247
I'm really gonna miss being a witch
and having powers

565
00:40:35,414 --> 00:40:38,667
- and having sisters.
- Yeah, well, you've got your mom.

566
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:41,837
And your aunt will be home
from the hospital tomorrow.

567
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:45,048
Okay, now remember,

568
00:40:45,215 --> 00:40:48,677
do not tell anyone
about us Halliwell sisters, all right?

569
00:40:48,844 --> 00:40:50,053
It's just our little secret.

570
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,014
- I promise.
- Okay.

571
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:10,657
- Hey.
- Hey.

572
00:41:11,408 --> 00:41:13,702
- Can we talk?
- Is there really anything to talk about?

573
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:15,495
Andy.

574
00:41:16,413 --> 00:41:18,540
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

575
00:41:19,207 --> 00:41:20,416
What do you mean by that?

576
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,836
Oh, come on, who are we
kidding? I mean, let's face it.

577
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:25,797
One of us is more interested
in this relationship than the other.

578
00:41:25,964 --> 00:41:27,131
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

579
00:41:27,298 --> 00:41:29,759
How come I'm always the one
left standing there like a jerk?

580
00:41:29,926 --> 00:41:32,053
- I can explain.
- No, you can't.

581
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:34,597
Or you won't.

582
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:42,021
Damn it, Prue, I still love you.

583
00:41:42,188 --> 00:41:46,234
I'm not saying you have to explain it all
to me, Prue. That's your prerogative.

584
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,528
All I'm saying is...

585
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:53,116
...it hurts that you don't
trust me enough.

586
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:54,784
I do trust you, Andy.

587
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:59,539
It has nothing to do with you.
It's just...

588
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:05,127
It's just something that I don't know
if I can ever share with anybody.

589
00:42:05,628 --> 00:42:08,381
Well, I hope that's not true
for your sake.

590
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,635
All I know is there's nothing more
I can say or do to reassure you

591
00:42:12,927 --> 00:42:15,304
that I'm there for you.

592
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:20,977
Andy.

593
00:42:24,772 --> 00:42:26,899
Are you saying that you don't
wanna see me anymore?

594
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:29,735
I don't know what I want anymore.
