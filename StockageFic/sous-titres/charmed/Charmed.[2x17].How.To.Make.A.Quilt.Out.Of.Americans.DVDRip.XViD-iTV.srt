1
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:09,638
Humbled by his power
We invite him into our circle

2
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,281
We call on the demon Kryto
Reach back throughout the ages

3
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:21,319
Humbled by his power
We invite him into our circle

4
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:24,402
- Are you all right?
- Just keep chanting.

5
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,520
We've been chanting
for 15 minutes.

6
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:31,757
It's a séance, Amanda, not AT&T.
He'll come, he has to. Come on.

7
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:37,242
We call on the demon Kryto
Reach back throughout the ages

8
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:43,161
Humbled by his power
We invite him into our circle

9
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,324
Who dares summon me?

10
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:55,362
Three who are humbled
by your presence, Kryto.

11
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:59,482
- What do you want?
- That which only you can give.

12
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:04,286
Youth, beauty, health.

13
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,798
What can you give me?

14
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:09,566
We know how to make
you whole again.

15
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:12,448
- We can bring you back.
- But I want more.

16
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:16,363
I want powers. Great powers.

17
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:20,847
- Don't ever summon me again.
- We can get you great powers.

18
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:25,407
The power to move things
with your mind,

19
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:28,925
to stop time, to see into the future.

20
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:32,678
Do so, and you'll have your youth.

21
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:36,439
I had to say something.
We were losing him.

22
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:38,241
You lost him already, Gail.

23
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,641
Why would you promise him
something we can't get?

24
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:43,128
What if it makes him angry?

25
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:46,123
I can get the powers, Helen.
I have to.

26
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,325
I'm not ready to die.

27
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:54,480
I'll be back. Just be sure you have
the quilt finished by tomorrow night.

28
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,761
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi. What's up?

29
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:25,122
Have you made an appointment
to see the optometrist yet?

30
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:28,162
Prue, I keep telling you,
I do not need glasses.

31
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,524
Oh, well, then...

32
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:33,205
...this might help.

33
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:35,683
Unrelated.

34
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,205
Look, I really need your help.
Piper's throwing out her boots.

35
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,843
The tan ones.

36
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:50,039
Piper, what are you doing?
Those are your favourite boots.

37
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:52,439
I know. Demon blood
from one of our vanquishings.

38
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:56,284
And I can't get it out, and I can't exactly
explain it to the shoe-repair guy, can I?

39
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,519
It's the third damn pair this month.

40
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:01,442
- What's the matter, honey?
- Nothing.

41
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:03,804
I gotta go to the club.
Dan's waiting for me.

42
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,561
Are you really gonna
break up with him?

43
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:09,718
I have to. I mean, I love him,
but I love Leo more.

44
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,723
Not that I'm any closer to figuring out
how that's gonna work either.

45
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:16,843
Sometimes being a witch sucks.

46
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,008
Wicca PMS?

47
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:22,888
I have a feeling
it's a lot more than that.

48
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:33,405
- Aunt Gail.
- My beautiful girls.

49
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:35,804
- Hey.
- Hey.

50
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:21,365
I knew we had an old picture of you
and Grams somewhere.

51
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,759
Oh, my God.
Look how young we were.

52
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:29,686
I remember when this was taken
right outside our sorority house.

53
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:31,885
- We just met.
- A couple of hotties.

54
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:35,121
Well, that was then. This is now.

55
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:37,007
Hey, now looks pretty good.

56
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,525
Believe me, the golden years
are anything but.

57
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:42,441
Mostly it's regret.

58
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:48,484
Oh, I miss your Grams.
I still can't believe she's gone.

59
00:05:50,609 --> 00:05:53,203
You just never know
when it's your time, do you?

60
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:56,918
Anyway, you both sound
like you're doing very well.

61
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:01,685
You and Piper and your careers,
and you back in school.

62
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,608
- Good for you.
- Yeah, we're doing all right.

63
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:07,567
What about men?
Anyone special in your lives?

64
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:09,122
Nope.

65
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:13,368
Well, I mean,
Piper's got someone, sort of.

66
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:15,520
I think we're just picky.
We don't wanna go through

67
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:17,281
all the husbands that
Grams went through.

68
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:18,964
Don't be too picky.

69
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,882
You don't wanna end up
an old spinster like me.

70
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:25,566
Are you okay?

71
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:27,685
Here, have some of this.

72
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:33,727
Thank you. Damn allergies.

73
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,847
So, what brings you
to San Francisco?

74
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:40,158
Well...

75
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,884
...my dears...

76
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,684
...you do.

77
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,087
Do you remember
the bridge clubs

78
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:52,207
your Grams always hosted
here every other Saturday?

79
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:56,039
Did you actually see
any of us play any cards?

80
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,286
No, Grams always
sent us outside to play.

81
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:02,680
That's because it wasn't
a bridge club.

82
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:05,124
It was her coven.

83
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,840
Your Grams was the most
skilful witch any of us ever knew.

84
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:14,117
- Witch?
- Oh, well, I still practice

85
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:17,281
the craft myself every now and then.
I don't have any real powers.

86
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:20,043
Mostly I just play around with it.

87
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:23,565
Wow. You and Grams,
witches, who knew?

88
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:27,280
You don't have to pretend with me.
Your Grams told me everything,

89
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,328
including what you'd become
when she died.

90
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:34,968
The Charmed Ones.

91
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:47,398
- Hey.
- Hi.

92
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:50,077
You're... You're late.

93
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:52,319
Sorry, a little jet lag.

94
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,919
I was walking by a store window
on Fifth Avenue,

95
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:04,162
- and I couldn't resist.
- Oh, no.

96
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:10,848
Please don't be a ring.

97
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:17,923
I hope you like it.

98
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:23,481
They're beautiful.

99
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:26,527
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

100
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:32,208
- If you don't like them, you can...
- It's not that, Dan, it's...

101
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:37,559
- Did you think it was a ring?
- No, of course not. Don't be silly.

102
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:40,199
It's just that...

103
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:45,042
- Did you need to get that?
- No, the machine will pick it up.

104
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:47,518
- Hi. Leave a message.
- Dan, we have to talk.

105
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:50,880
Piper, it's me. Look, I know
you're there. Just pick up.

106
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:53,438
- Talk about what?
- Well, to be honest...

107
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:57,761
Aunt Gail's in town and guess what.
She knows we're you-know-whats.

108
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:01,447
Hi. I'm not alone here, remember?

109
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,526
I thought that that
would get your attention.

110
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:05,884
Prue, this is a really bad time.

111
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:08,199
Okay, well, I'm sorry,
but it's important.

112
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,877
Hey, wait. How does
Aunt Gail know that we're...?

113
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:14,166
You know what, never mind. You can
tell me later. I have to go, Dan is here.

114
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:16,599
Look, Aunt Gail needs our help.
She's in trouble.

115
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:18,083
What do you mean?
What kind of trouble?

116
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:22,123
The kind of trouble you can't talk about
with Dan right there. Demon trouble.

117
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:23,968
Of course, why not.

118
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:28,202
All right, I'll just put my life on hold
one more time and I'll be right there.

119
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:34,079
- A little trouble at home?
- When isn't there?

120
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,842
Well, you wanna talk about it
on the way to your car?

121
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:40,284
No, I don't.

122
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:42,920
How about dinner tonight?

123
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:45,125
Let's make it tomorrow night
just to be safe.

124
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:48,361
- I don't wanna have to cancel on you.
- It's a date.

125
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:09,327
- Have you contacted the police yet?
- And tell them what?

126
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:12,526
That I think there's a demon
running loose in our streets?

127
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:15,482
- They'd think I was crazy.
- Try getting your boots cleaned.

128
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,438
Don't ask.

129
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:20,248
So you said that corpses
have been found dug up and skinned.

130
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:22,286
I mean, what do the police
think about that?

131
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:25,407
- I don't know.
- Maybe it's just a sicko grave robber.

132
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:27,764
Well, it's more than that.

133
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:32,918
I may be wrong, but I think I remember
seeing in your Book of Shadows that...

134
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:36,961
Okay, wait,
you know about that too?

135
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:39,997
And one evening when
your Grams was showing it to me,

136
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:42,763
I think that I remember
seeing something

137
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:47,445
about a skinned demon, or something,
who made people young again.

138
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,446
Young again? Well,
what's so bad about that?

139
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:53,120
There's gotta be a catch.
There's always a catch.

140
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:56,366
Are you sure that the book
said it was skinned?

141
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:02,083
I think so. But maybe
we better go look.

142
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:11,083
- You ready?
- All set.

143
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:13,086
Okay.

144
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:21,402
Do you think Gail will really
be able to get their powers?

145
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:25,164
Well, she better, and soon.
The skin quilt is almost done.

146
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,880
Here's something.
"Kryto, the demon of vanity."

147
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:34,928
Kryto, that sounds vaguely familiar.
What does it say?

148
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:38,365
"In the 16th century, Kryto travelled
from dukedom to dukedom

149
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:41,123
preying on people's vanity,
bestowing youth and beauty

150
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:43,200
in exchange for their souls."

151
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,599
Youth for souls. Why would
anybody make that trade?

152
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:48,323
Believe me, I know a lot
of people who'd consider it.

153
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:50,559
Age, disease.

154
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:53,607
That's why I'm so worried.

155
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:58,206
I know so many potential victims
in Santa Costa, friends.

156
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:03,524
- Are you squinting?
- No.

157
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:07,846
"Kryto was found out and skinned alive
by a group of witches

158
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:12,525
who believed it would keep his spirit
from ever being resurrected again."

159
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:15,443
- You were right.
- But those witches obviously weren't.

160
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,679
Otherwise, there wouldn't be
a vanquishing spell in the book.

161
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:21,199
So someone is skinning people
to give him a new skin?

162
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:25,288
Well, give him a new body,
summon his spirit, makes sense.

163
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:27,605
Well, at least it's an easy
vanquishing spell.

164
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:29,122
I mean, if Kryto really does exist,

165
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,405
it shouldn't be a problem
getting rid of him.

166
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:34,288
Goodness, you must be
really powerful witches.

167
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:36,480
Oh, rub it in.

168
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:40,758
How soon can you come
to Santa Costa?

169
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,848
Prue, Phoebe, can I talk to you
for a sec out here?

170
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,560
Take your time.

171
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:04,281
Piper, Gail is like family.
You love her. We all do.

172
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:05,882
She was like a second Grams to us.

173
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:08,085
Yeah, only a nice one,
one that never said no.

174
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:11,606
I know that. But something about
her story... It's just... It's not right.

175
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:13,839
I mean, bodies are being
dug up all over town,

176
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:15,806
skinned, and she's
the only one who's noticing?

177
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:18,523
I admit it's funky, but what
are we supposed to do?

178
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:21,078
- Tell her we're not gonna help her?
- No, of course not.

179
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:24,082
It's just that it's never-ending.
I mean we have no lives.

180
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:26,558
I don't even have time
to break up with Dan properly.

181
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:51,358
Look, honey, Santa Costa
is right over the bridge.

182
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:55,204
We'll leave early, go check things out,
be back by tomorrow night, okay?

183
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:58,924
Hi. So we'll be there at 9:00
tomorrow morning, okay?

184
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,080
Would you like to stay here?
We have plenty of room.

185
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:06,204
Oh, no thank you, I have to get home.
Cats to feed, you know. Thank you.

186
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:09,008
You'll never know how much
this means to me.

187
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:20,242
We call on the demon Kryto
Reach back throughout the ages

188
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:25,767
Humbled by his power
We invite him into our circle

189
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:47,844
Well done, ladies.

190
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:51,569
Now, make us young.

191
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:54,602
First, the powers you promised.

192
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:58,603
They'll be here soon.

193
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:27,525
Nice work, Pheebs.
Only a couple hours late.

194
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:30,965
- Yeah, next time I'll navigate.
- It's this map. It's messed up.

195
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:34,007
There is no connector road
on Highway 28.

196
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,679
No? What is that?

197
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:42,325
- That little squiggle?
- Yeah.

198
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:46,327
I didn't see that. And don't tell me
I need glasses, okay,

199
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:48,081
because anybody
could've missed that.

200
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:50,638
There is absolutely nothing wrong
with wearing glasses.

201
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:53,528
- I mean, I wear them.
- I know, but you're older.

202
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:56,879
- Well, you are.
- Right.

203
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,206
Well, you know, I really hope
that demon of vanity isn't after you

204
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:01,722
because your soul would be toast.

205
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:04,687
I'm just gonna ignore that comment
and go ask for directions.

206
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:06,567
Okay.

207
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:13,802
Cute, huh? Still holding hands.

208
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:17,686
That could be you and Leo
in, like, 50 years.

209
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:21,804
Me maybe, but not Leo.
Whitelighters don't age, remember?

210
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:23,721
They're not supposed
to date witches either,

211
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:26,039
so maybe I don't
have to worry about that.

212
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:27,881
Piper.

213
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:30,199
I know, I'm sorry
I've been a drag lately,

214
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:32,564
but I've just been confused
and frustrated.

215
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:35,358
I mean, nothing's changed really
since Leo and I met,

216
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,442
except that I'm two years older
and still have no idea what we're doing.

217
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:43,358
Sometimes I worry we're all gonna
end up like Aunt Gail.

218
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:47,923
Then you take Hotsman to the light.

219
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:51,320
You turn right, pass
the fire station to Sycamore.

220
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:54,003
Yeah, and then straight up the hill,

221
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:56,842
and there's a big Victorian
on the left.

222
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,563
Well, you can't miss it. It's not far.

223
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:02,641
Okay, straight up the hill.
Great. Thanks.

224
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:06,444
- Pheebs, come on.
- Okay, okay.

225
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,206
Oh, excuse me, honey.

226
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:11,877
These your glasses?

227
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:15,563
No, no.

228
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:17,879
No, those aren't mine.

229
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:22,645
We are all set.
All words, no squigglies.

230
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,561
Let's go.

231
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:43,479
- They're here.
- Finally.

232
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:45,924
How long after
they drink the potion

233
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:48,239
before we can
call their powers to Kryto?

234
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:49,842
It doesn't say.

235
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:52,569
But it shouldn't be long.

236
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:08,966
- More tea, girls?
- No thanks. I...

237
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,157
...would love some. Thank you.

238
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,923
- How about you?
- It's better to humour her, Piper.

239
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:16,727
She won't take no for an answer.

240
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,079
Well, then, by all means, fill her up.

241
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:24,118
So, Aunt Gail, who else knows
about Kryto and us?

242
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:28,288
Well, I hope you won't be too upset.
I had to tell Amanda and Helen.

243
00:18:28,449 --> 00:18:32,488
Actually, they were the first ones
to tell me about the dug up corpses.

244
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:33,638
Really.

245
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:38,759
Don't worry, we won't tell a soul
about you being witches and all.

246
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,683
- Our little secret.
- That's good to know.

247
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,562
- Something the matter?
- It's just...

248
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:48,084
What kind of tea is this?
It's different.

249
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:49,802
It's a special blend.

250
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:52,927
Listen, maybe you
had better get going

251
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:55,962
to start to look for whoever
might be trying to summon Kryto.

252
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:59,127
- Gail...
- Two of the corpses were found

253
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:02,247
in that old furniture warehouse
out on Route 10.

254
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,525
- Weren't they, Helen?
- Yes. I think so.

255
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:08,558
- That's not really a lot to go on.
- Well, you have to start somewhere.

256
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:14,247
You just go up Route 10, and then turn
up Willow and it will be right there.

257
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:18,926
Okay, so I guess we'll be back later.

258
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:20,761
Yeah, we'll be here.

259
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:25,003
Kryto said they weren't
supposed to leave.

260
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:26,801
I know, but they
were getting suspicious.

261
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:28,925
Are you sure you're not trying
to protect them?

262
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:30,608
Of course I'm trying to protect them.

263
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:32,720
I feel bad enough
about stealing their powers.

264
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:36,558
But they're family, and no demon
is going to hurt them.

265
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,525
Come on.

266
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:46,763
We just have to keep calling for their
powers until the potion takes effect.

267
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:05,801
You guys see anything?

268
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:07,448
Are you sure this is the right place?

269
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:09,918
Don't look at me,
I didn't navigate this time.

270
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:12,239
Are either of you thinking
what I'm thinking?

271
00:20:12,449 --> 00:20:14,201
Wild goose chase?

272
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:16,519
Why would Aunt Gail send us
out here for no reason?

273
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:19,926
I don't know, but she seemed
in an awful hurry to get us out of...

274
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:23,127
You okay?

275
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,964
No, I'm kind of feeling
light-headed all of a sudden.

276
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:30,128
I'm not feeling so hot
myself right now.

277
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:37,003
Powers of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies

278
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:42,163
Come to us who call you near
Come to us and settle here

279
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:43,842
It's not working.

280
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,523
- It will.
- It better.

281
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:52,002
Powers of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies

282
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:57,482
Come to us who call you near
Come to us and settle here

283
00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:02,928
Powers of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies

284
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:09,164
Come to us who call you near
Come to us and settle here

285
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:25,158
Time for you to hold up
your end of the bargain.

286
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:39,399
Oh, my God, Gail.

287
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,082
It worked.

288
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:52,360
Now, us.

289
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:55,403
- It's our turn.
- Yes, it is.

290
00:21:57,929 --> 00:21:59,806
What are you doing?

291
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:06,768
You see, I can take youth away
as quickly as I can grant it.

292
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:09,648
But why?

293
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:12,488
It takes three witches to summon me,
and three to banish me.

294
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:14,048
You do the math.

295
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,359
I wanted more powers
to protect myself.

296
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:21,239
Now, I want you to introduce me
to other willing souls

297
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:22,848
who want to be young again,

298
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:25,768
unless you care to end up
like your friends.

299
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,358
Beauty has its price.

300
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:57,245
- Aunt Gail?
- Anybody home?

301
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,048
I don't understand
what the hell is going on.

302
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:02,643
- I told you something wasn't right.
- Well, what's not right

303
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:05,607
is I have a feeling it's Gail and her
friends who summoned this demon.

304
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:07,521
If that were true,
why would Aunt Gail

305
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:10,157
want us to come to Santa Costa?

306
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:16,440
- It stinks.
- This is what I'm saying.

307
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:21,002
I think it's coming from here.

308
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:27,883
What is that smell?

309
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:30,246
Wait a minute.

310
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:32,965
What are those?

311
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:35,679
Oh, I would say
by the looks of things,

312
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:39,728
that's Amanda
and that would be Helen.

313
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:42,204
Oh, God.

314
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:44,445
I hope that didn't happen
from drinking the tea.

315
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:47,038
No, that must have happened
when they tried to summon Kryto.

316
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:50,963
Although, I don't see Aunt Gail here.
That's a good sign, I hope.

317
00:23:56,249 --> 00:23:57,967
- What's the matter?
- I don't know,

318
00:23:58,129 --> 00:24:00,563
- but I can't freeze the rat thing.
- What?

319
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:03,158
You try. Move it.

320
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:08,202
Okay, what the hell
is going on with our powers?

321
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:13,769
Maybe we ought to ask Aunt Gail.

322
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:26,766
Well, they were definitely making
a potion in there. A serious one too.

323
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:29,124
- Hemlock root.
- No wonder the tea tasted funny.

324
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:32,201
- How did we let her do this to us?
- I guess we trusted her.

325
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:34,843
Yeah, well, she just got crossed off
my Christmas list.

326
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:37,688
Aunt Gail was Gram's best friend.
She used to bake us cookies.

327
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:39,163
And now she's spiking our tea.

328
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:41,246
But why? Just to be young again?

329
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:44,283
I mean she had to know she'd be
giving up her soul in exchange.

330
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:48,079
Maybe it wasn't just for youth.
Maybe it was for health.

331
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:50,558
These are all doctor bills,
recent ones.

332
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:55,042
Radiation treatments, chemotherapy.
I don't think she had very long to live.

333
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:58,601
That still doesn't excuse
what she did.

334
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:00,920
What she did to us.

335
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:03,683
I mean, you can't use magic
to save yourself.

336
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:05,681
No, not without consequences.

337
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:07,885
And there's no bigger one
than giving up your soul.

338
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,047
I just don't understand.
Why steal our powers?

339
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,040
Kryto must've wanted more
out of the bargain,

340
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:15,769
and Aunt Gail was desperate
enough to give it to him.

341
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:17,482
We shouldn't have
left her alone in the attic.

342
00:25:17,689 --> 00:25:19,202
Okay, well, we have the potion.

343
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:23,038
If we can find the spell, then we should
be able to transfer our powers back.

344
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:25,479
You kidding? We won't be able
to get anywhere near him.

345
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:26,883
Well, he has our powers,

346
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:30,439
but that doesn't necessarily mean
he knows how to use them.

347
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:33,483
Besides, do you have a better idea?

348
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,517
Go home and call it a day?

349
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:38,884
Funny, come on.

350
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:54,521
See? You're not the only one, Gail.

351
00:25:54,689 --> 00:25:57,442
Everybody wants to be young
and attractive.

352
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:00,760
The difference is I knew what
I was giving up. They don't.

353
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:03,483
Oh, they will, one day.

354
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:05,526
Their last.

355
00:26:07,689 --> 00:26:09,839
Do you know that one?

356
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,727
- Introduce me.
- No.

357
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:15,046
Tired of being young again already?

358
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:31,963
Hiya, toots.

359
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,561
Wait a minute.

360
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:38,607
Tell me those aren't the same guys
you asked for directions.

361
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:42,045
Okay, Kryto's close. Let's drive.

362
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:45,523
The only catch is that
you have to keep it a secret.

363
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:47,925
You can't ever tell a soul.

364
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:51,082
I'm sure you understand why.

365
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:53,240
What, is this some kind of a joke?

366
00:26:53,449 --> 00:26:56,680
If you think it is,
then why are you still here?

367
00:26:56,889 --> 00:26:59,244
Because some part of you
is hoping beyond hope

368
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,401
that I just might be telling
you the truth,

369
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:04,958
that I can restore your youth.

370
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:07,367
Just like I did for...

371
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:11,247
...Gail Altman.

372
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:16,926
Gail?

373
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:20,798
Yes, Frank, it's really me.

374
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:43,438
You forgot your...

375
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:53,558
- What?
- Three witches.

376
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:55,328
You said you took care of them.

377
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:57,884
- What are you talking about?
- You lied to me.

378
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:01,918
Girls, run, hurry!

379
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:04,805
Aunt Gail?

380
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:08,843
So much for him not knowing
how to use our powers.

381
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:12,963
I've got one power he doesn't have.

382
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:17,041
- Phoebe.
- No, no, no. Okay, wait.

383
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:20,406
- It's just way too dangerous.
- Nobody's sending me back again.

384
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:23,077
- We can't just sit here.
- No, we have to think.

385
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:25,922
All right, what do we know about
our powers that he doesn't?

386
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:29,885
- Thank God.
- Stay away from me.

387
00:28:32,969 --> 00:28:34,925
All right, Phoebe's thinking
what we're thinking.

388
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,398
Great, what are we thinking?

389
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:40,598
You can't hide from me.

390
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:42,561
I didn't want to die.

391
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:44,082
I was wrong.

392
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:46,999
Here. You'll need this.

393
00:28:49,689 --> 00:28:51,486
The spell.

394
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:55,527
Just follow my lead. You ready?

395
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:59,046
- All right, we give up.
- Excuse me?

396
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:02,805
No, no, no, Phoebe, wait.
He'll freeze us.

397
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:09,444
That's a marvellous power.

398
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:15,678
Good witches don't freeze.

399
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,362
- I'll kill you.
- No!

400
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:28,007
Okay, what do we do
about Aunt Gail?

401
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,637
Well, without our powers,
there's not too much that we can do.

402
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:32,765
Okay, so we have to get back
our powers,

403
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:34,601
and then find Kryto
before he finds us.

404
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:37,363
Agreed. All right, let's go.

405
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,520
Piper, come on.

406
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:42,442
Piper, what's the matter?

407
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:44,008
- I've had it.
- What do you mean?

408
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:47,320
- You've had it with what?
- With being a witch.

409
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:54,959
You betrayed me.

410
00:29:55,129 --> 00:30:00,157
At least they got away
so they can destroy you.

411
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:01,882
No, they won't.

412
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:04,005
I know where they're going,
remember?

413
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,205
I saw it.

414
00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:09,438
No!

415
00:30:19,969 --> 00:30:22,529
- We can't just leave your car.
- We'll call a cab.

416
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:25,044
- That'll cost 100 bucks.
- I'm not going back to town.

417
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:27,359
- I'm through with demon hunting.
- Piper, come on.

418
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:29,406
There's really nothing more to say.

419
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:32,641
Well, if it's getting back our powers
you're worried about, I can do that.

420
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:35,642
- I have a spell that can do that.
- I don't want my powers back.

421
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:37,447
- You don't mean that.
- Don't I?

422
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,645
I think it may be the solution
to all my problems.

423
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:41,208
Piper, wait a second.

424
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:44,128
I know exactly
what you're going through.

425
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:46,967
Remember when Andy died?

426
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:49,324
I didn't want to be a witch
anymore either.

427
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:51,320
- This is different.
- How?

428
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:54,043
Not wanting to be a witch isn't
a symptom of something else

429
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:56,325
like it is for you, Prue.
For me, it's the problem.

430
00:30:56,489 --> 00:30:58,445
It's the cause.
It's the problem with everything.

431
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:01,123
I want a life that doesn't
have a lot of death in it.

432
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:02,961
I don't think that's too much to ask.

433
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:07,040
You can't do this.

434
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:10,281
Phoebe, we're all gonna do it,
sooner or later.

435
00:31:10,449 --> 00:31:12,440
I'm just doing it first.

436
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:27,403
What are you doing?

437
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:30,641
Piper, you can't do this.
It affects all of us.

438
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:33,926
Phoebe, I love you. You're one
of my two most favourite sisters,

439
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:35,886
but I don't wanna give up
having a life.

440
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:38,000
- I'm not asking you to.
- Yes, you are,

441
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:39,522
just by asking me to be a witch.

442
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:43,005
Piper, you were born a witch.
It's not a choice. It's a fact.

443
00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:45,882
Says who? Up until two years ago,
I didn't know I was born a witch.

444
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:49,206
Neither did you guys.
And we were perfectly happy then.

445
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,604
With perfectly normal lives.
I miss that, don't you?

446
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,481
- No.
- Yeah.

447
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:56,321
Well, sometimes.

448
00:31:56,489 --> 00:31:59,128
But I've accepted the fact
that I can't just turn back the clock

449
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:01,245
and pretend it never happened.
And neither can you.

450
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:05,528
I just... I don't wanna end up
like Aunt Gail, old and alone,

451
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,243
and wishing I was young again

452
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:09,718
so I could do all the things
I missed out on.

453
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,567
We won't let that happen to you.

454
00:32:14,969 --> 00:32:17,324
Just help us get our powers back.

455
00:32:17,489 --> 00:32:18,922
Please?

456
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:20,442
We can't do it without you.

457
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:23,601
- We won't do it without you.
- No.

458
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:35,080
How do we know Kryto
will even come here?

459
00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:37,046
If he's gonna look for us,
he'll start here.

460
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,558
We could try summoning him
like Gail and her friends did.

461
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:42,283
I think that only works
with spirits, Pheebs.

462
00:32:42,449 --> 00:32:45,566
I still don't understand how we can get
him to drink this without our powers.

463
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:49,159
We have to get him to use a power
he doesn't know how to use yet.

464
00:32:49,449 --> 00:32:50,928
- Astral projection?
- Exactly.

465
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:53,239
If we can distract him long enough
to be in two places...

466
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:56,964
We might be able to trick him into
thinking I'm still looking for the potion.

467
00:32:57,129 --> 00:32:58,608
I'm only doing this for you guys.

468
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,408
If I get killed, I'm gonna haunt
the both of you forever.

469
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:04,282
- Yeah, yeah. Got the spell?
- Yes.

470
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:07,046
I got it.

471
00:33:07,969 --> 00:33:12,804
Anybody home? I know you're here
and I know where you are.

472
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:32,359
Phoebe, get the potion.

473
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:34,847
No!

474
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,886
I got it.

475
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:47,323
Come on, come on.

476
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:49,963
- Pheebs, get the potion.
- Start chanting the spell.

477
00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:52,046
- We need the potion first.
- It won't work.

478
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:54,843
Just start. I've got a plan.

479
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:59,364
Powers of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies

480
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:01,645
Come to us...

481
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:04,162
- Get the potion.
- All right.

482
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:10,482
Pretty nifty power, huh?

483
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:15,725
Do it!

484
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,726
Give him all of it.

485
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:23,886
He's coming back.

486
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:35,161
Powers of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies

487
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:38,998
Come to us who call you near
Come to us and settle here

488
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:49,527
Wanna see what does freeze?

489
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:51,238
Pheebs.

490
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:52,728
What witch has done
And then undone

491
00:34:53,209 --> 00:34:56,884
Return this spirit back within
And separate him from his skin

492
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:14,519
- Ouch.
- That looked like it hurt.

493
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:16,879
Yeah, well, I hope so
for Aunt Gail's sake.

494
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:19,523
And Helen and Amanda.

495
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:37,523
Very nice.

496
00:35:37,689 --> 00:35:40,522
Well, we thought that you might
appreciate a pair without demon blood.

497
00:35:40,729 --> 00:35:42,765
I do, very much. Thank you.

498
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:45,244
So, Piper...

499
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:47,927
...Phoebe and I were
kind of wondering...

500
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:50,809
- Because we want you to be happy.
- Very happy.

501
00:35:51,009 --> 00:35:53,443
So we were wondering

502
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,760
if we should be budgeting
for more shoes or not.

503
00:35:58,529 --> 00:36:00,884
Well, I wish I could tell you
getting my powers back

504
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:03,279
made me appreciate what I lost.

505
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:05,202
But...

506
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:07,400
But I feel like I'm back
where I started.

507
00:36:07,569 --> 00:36:09,958
I mean, I understand what you guys
are saying and everything,

508
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:13,246
but I can't change the way I feel.

509
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:18,478
So you really are quitting?

510
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:21,722
I want to for all the reasons
we already talked about.

511
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:27,566
But I'm only gonna do that
if and when you guys want to also.

512
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:31,885
Well, I'm always gonna
wanna be a witch.

513
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:34,360
- That's for sure.
- She's young.

514
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:36,959
Oh, give me a break.

515
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,043
- All right, I gotta go.
- Good luck.

516
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:42,245
Thanks.

517
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:47,160
Poor Dan.

518
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,484
So do you think we should worry?

519
00:36:50,649 --> 00:36:55,325
- No, he'll be all right.
- I mean about Piper quitting.

520
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:59,640
Maybe, a little.

521
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:07,081
You little liar.

522
00:37:07,249 --> 00:37:08,762
You did go see the optometrist.

523
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:11,199
Yeah, well...

524
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:16,001
...let's just say I'm not as concerned
with my vanity anymore.

525
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:42,046
You hungry?

526
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:46,524
- No, unless you are.
- No, I'm fine.

527
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:52,125
What?

528
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:56,046
I was thinking that it
just seems like yesterday

529
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:59,645
you moved in next door,
and we, you know...

530
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:03,240
Piper, you don't have to do this.

531
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:06,959
- Do what?
- Go through this big explanation.

532
00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:10,726
I think I know what you wanted
to talk to me about.

533
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:15,923
You're breaking up with me,
aren't you?

534
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:18,999
Is it because of Leo?

535
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:21,806
I'm sorry.

536
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:26,163
It's really none of my business.

537
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:33,247
Dan, I will always love you.
This doesn't change that.

538
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:38,483
You've been really good to me
and treated me incredibly well.

539
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:42,561
But...

540
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:46,240
...I need to try and make
this work with Leo.

541
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:47,922
And it may not, I don't know.

542
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:49,602
But...

543
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:52,643
...we've never really given it a shot.

544
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:55,528
And I want to.

545
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:57,802
I have to.

546
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:04,358
I'm so sorry.

547
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:08,964
You don't have to be.
You're just being honest with me.

548
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:14,083
We're still gonna be
neighbours though, right?

549
00:39:14,249 --> 00:39:16,365
We'd better be more than that.

550
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:33,167
Well, I guess I better go.
