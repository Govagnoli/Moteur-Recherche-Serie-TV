1
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,175
Damn it!

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,719
Keep it down. I just got Chris to sleep.

3
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,597
If you were here to help me,
that would maybe help.

4
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,307
Yes, and I will do that.

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:18,560
First, I need to make sure
Wyatt's okay at preschool.

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,938
Preschool?
Don't you mean Magic School?

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,358
No, I mean preschool.
We enrolled him last week, remember?

8
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,652
You didn't tell me that. Did you?

9
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:31,740
Yes. And you said you were worried
about him using magic in public.

10
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,867
Oh. And what'd you say?

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,372
I said I was worried
about him having a normal life.

12
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,707
All right, cool.
I'm all up to speed now.

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,795
With these charges and these demons
attacking, I'm a little scattered.

14
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,713
That's different how, exactly?

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,174
I don't know why
the Elders couldn't see fit

16
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,177
to give me a local witch
instead of a New Zealand witch.

17
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,471
I don't know, but I need the phone.

18
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,681
No!

19
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,600
No, no using the phone.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,436
Why are all the handsets up here?

21
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,730
I am trying to prevent a demon attack.

22
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,400
- What?
- All the attacks have been different.

23
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,486
And all the demons
have had different powers.

24
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:13,240
One thing I notice is that every time
a phone rings, a demon attacks.

25
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:17,369
No, they don't. Phoebe called
earlier, and nothing happened.

26
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,038
Really?

27
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,124
Stop the jingling already.

28
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,794
I'll be there as soon as I can. Charges.

29
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,811
Piper!

30
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,401
You might be right
about that phone thing.

31
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,396
That was Wyatt's preschool.
I wonder what they wanted.

32
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,398
I am more interested in these demons

33
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,943
and what they wanted and trying
to figure out how to vanquish them.

34
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,072
It doesn't sound right. Why would
demons attack when the phone rings?

35
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,491
They're all different demons, remember?

36
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,702
The last one even looked kind of human.

37
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,289
Better add some mandrake root
in case they're shape-shifters.

38
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,542
The last attack happened
when the preschool called too?

39
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,421
Yeah, I think you're right.

40
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,841
Do you think Wyatt
is creating these demons?

41
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,510
That's ridiculous.

42
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,178
He created the dragons.

43
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:25,641
One! One lousy dragon, and you're gonna
hold it against him for his entire life!

44
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,478
Oh, no. Let me guess.
Another demon attack?

45
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,731
- Or Wyatt's acting up.
- Or Paige is overreacting.

46
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:37,694
Wyatt has been isolating himself at
preschool and only talking to himself.

47
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,489
Who said he's only talking to himself?

48
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,241
I heard the message.

49
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,826
- That's odd.
- No, it's not odd.

50
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,914
Just because he's talking to himself
does not mean he's creating demons.

51
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:52,251
- Except he's kinda quiet around home.
- So?

52
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,795
Wyatt's in his second stage
of development.

53
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,214
His sense of language
should be maturing.

54
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,342
He should be talking
to other people, not just himself.

55
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,845
I'm very sorry you
went back to college.

56
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,138
But it's really helping with my column.

57
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,684
That has nothing to do
with why Wyatt is creating demons?

58
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,394
He's not creating demons!

59
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,272
Let's see, maybe
it's a reaction to preschool,

60
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,775
some kind of Freudian transference
or something?

61
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,110
Mumbo jumbo!

62
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,780
Look, all I'm saying
is if he's talking to himself,

63
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,616
the problems may be normal, not magical.

64
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,535
Normal problems like what?

65
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,328
I have no idea.

66
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,372
It could be anything.

67
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,710
I could ask my professor.
She's the expert.

68
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,837
- But I...
- Be back soon.

69
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,300
Hey, what are you doing?
Put the phone down!

70
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,218
I have to call the preschool.

71
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,387
Well, then use your cell phone.

72
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,895
Miss Henderson!

73
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,938
I came as soon as I could.

74
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,399
Leo, what are you doing here?

75
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,401
You called about Wyatt, right?

76
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:03,572
Yeah, but I said it was nothing to worry
about. I thought I'd made that clear.

77
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,366
Well, I was in the area.
Is he all right?

78
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,202
He's just talking to himself.

79
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,830
I wouldn't have bothered
calling if your wife hadn't asked me to.

80
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,708
She's very protective.
He's a special kid.

81
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,376
They're all special, Leo.

82
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,712
Right, but he has special needs.

83
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,422
Special needs?

84
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,383
You never said Wyatt
was a special-needs child.

85
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,512
Not like that. He's... gifted.

86
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,180
First child?

87
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,349
Is it that obvious?

88
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,351
Do you want to see him?

89
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,102
Please.

90
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,609
Oh, there he is.

91
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,113
Oh, how long has he been doing that,

92
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,949
talking to himself?

93
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,702
I don't know, on and off since he first
started coming here, I guess.

94
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,498
And... is that normal?

95
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,667
Normal, no.

96
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:00,587
But I don't think you should be alarmed.
He's just playing by himself.

97
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,464
Lots of kids do that.

98
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,802
I really like our conversations, Wyatt.

99
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,930
But you know I'm a secret, right?
Nobody else can see me.

100
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,391
You're just not used to letting him go.

101
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,726
Happens to lots of first-time parents.

102
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,479
It's more complicated.

103
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,774
I see this every day.
Trust me, it's not.

104
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,403
He wasn't feeling
very well this morning.

105
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,238
Maybe I should take him home,

106
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,156
just... just to be safe.

107
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,618
Well, okay, if you think that's best.

108
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,330
We won't be able to talk much longer,
but don't worry, I'll be back.

109
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,040
I promise.

110
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:41,003
Okay, buddy, come on, you ready?
Let's go home, okay?

111
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:46,258
See you soon, Wyatt. I want to hear
more about that special teddy bear.

112
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,177
We'll see you later.

113
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,352
Vicus?

114
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,565
- I was getting worried.
- You failed me.

115
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:06,778
We didn't fail. We've been distracting
the witches for you, dying relentlessly!

116
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,157
But you haven't
sustained the distractions.

117
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,702
The father took the boy,
just as I was starting to make progress.

118
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,537
What?

119
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,957
Forget him, we don't need his powers.

120
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,668
Dealing with the Charmed Ones
is too dangerous.

121
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,714
Do you think you know how
to do this better than I do, Hugo?

122
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,674
That's not what I'm saying.

123
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,887
You've been working at this
for what, three weeks?

124
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,097
We're risking everything. For what?

125
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,267
For us! To add his power
to yours, to the collective.

126
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:42,648
Now, didn't I risk everything,

127
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,900
nurturing the evil within you, Hugo,

128
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,569
just as I did with all the others?

129
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,156
Yes, of course you did.

130
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,700
Then you must trust me.

131
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,788
Wyatt will become one of the most
powerful witches to ever walk the earth.

132
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,833
It's better he walk
with us than against us.

133
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,668
I just worry.

134
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,044
Don't.

135
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,881
I realise that I only have
a small window at this age

136
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,009
in which to change him, but I am close.

137
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,012
Very close.

138
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,607
Professor Slotkin?

139
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,862
I don't have time to discuss
your paper topic right now.

140
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,198
No, no, it's not about the paper.
It's actually personal.

141
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,741
Oh?

142
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,244
Yeah, it's about my nephew.
He's two...

143
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,205
...and a half, and he's just
going through some stuff.

144
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,791
I was hoping you
could help me understand it.

145
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,501
Terrible twos?

146
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,879
Well, I think it started out as that,

147
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,882
and now it's just...

148
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,467
Well, at preschool,
he talks to himself,

149
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,053
and then at home,
he doesn't talk to anybody.

150
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,223
Well, perhaps he has
an imaginary friend, although...

151
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,143
...he's a little early
for that, developmentally.

152
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,437
Oh, he's very advanced for his age.

153
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:07,232
And if it was an imaginary friend,
is that necessarily a bad thing?

154
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,402
Freud used to think
it was a sign of immature thinking.

155
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:15,032
Nowadays, we know that kids create
imaginary friends for lots of reasons:

156
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:18,035
Companionship, conflict resolution,

157
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,913
sometimes as a coping mechanism...

158
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,789
Let me write this down.

159
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,293
Oh, and that's Slotkin, with an S.

160
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,923
- You were planning on giving me credit?
- I'm sorry, what?

161
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:35,427
Well, last week we discussed
Lorenz's theory of imprinting in class,

162
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,055
and this week I read
about him in your column.

163
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:41,183
I imagine we're discussing
next week's content, no?

164
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,894
No. No, this is actually
about my nephew.

165
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,980
Please, we both know
why you're taking my class.

166
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,942
I'm taking your class
to be a better columnist

167
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,194
and to understand human behaviour.

168
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:56,073
I've spent years studying and teaching
psychology, Miss Halliwell,

169
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,950
dedicated my life to it.

170
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,911
I'll be damned if I'm
just gonna let you poach my class

171
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,038
to steal a sound bite for your column.

172
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,707
You want to learn
about imaginary friends?

173
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,837
Do the research. I look forward
to reading your paper on it.

174
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:15,175
We don't know if it's a problem or not.

175
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,678
Well, that's what has me worried.

176
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:21,932
You know, maybe putting him in
a normal school wasn't such a good idea.

177
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,977
But we agreed it was a good idea,
and when we did that,

178
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,896
we knew there was
gonna be some road bumps like this.

179
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:31,149
The problem is, we don't know
if the road bumps are magical

180
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,402
or just a normal
part of development.

181
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,530
I wish we could just ask him.

182
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:40,075
I think we're a few years away
from him giving you an answer.

183
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:43,370
Well, especially if he just
keeps talking to himself.

184
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,917
- Whoa!
- Exactly.

185
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,044
Okay, I like the Maori people,

186
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,298
but... I'm pretty okay
if I don't see them again.

187
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,052
I think I found out something
about who's been attacking us.

188
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,433
Leo, take Wyatt upstairs
so he doesn't hear that demon talk.

189
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,606
Buddy, let's go upstairs,
take your Wuvey with you.

190
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:15,110
As I was saying... I've been searching
through the library at Magic School.

191
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,362
I found something out
about the demons.

192
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:18,780
And?

193
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:23,202
Their offensive powers are traditionally
associated with good magic.

194
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,913
I thought these guys
were supposed to be demons.

195
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,373
Yeah, I thought so too.

196
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,668
But it supports the theory
that Wyatt's creating them.

197
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,420
Oh, for crying out loud!

198
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,756
I'm just saying...

199
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:44,264
This is ridiculous!
We can't live like this, it's crazy!

200
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,557
Where you going?

201
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:50,896
I'm going to figure out if Wyatt
is behind this once and for all.

202
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,527
Big guy.

203
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,154
You okay, buddy?

204
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,205
Hey, Wyatt.

205
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,457
I promised I'd be back, didn't I?

206
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,584
Yeah!

207
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,963
Wyatt?

208
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,514
Remember...

209
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,267
...l'm a secret, right?

210
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:31,562
I like your teddy bear.

211
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:36,942
Maybe you'll let me
hold him some day, huh?

212
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,987
I've got a great surprise
for both of you.

213
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:51,248
Shoot. What rhymes with "communicate"?

214
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:55,544
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Of course I'm sure.

215
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,005
What about the whole
personal gain thing?

216
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,299
Wyatt created a demon
who kidnapped him

217
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,843
and a dragon that
nearly destroyed the city.

218
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,262
I'm not real worried
about personal gain.

219
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,891
Because I'm a Whitelighter now,
I have to think of these things.

220
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,767
We're casting it on ourselves

221
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,813
so we can try to understand
what he's not telling us.

222
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,565
So if I switch...

223
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,901
...this and I leave that...

224
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,235
Okay.

225
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:23,864
Help this mother understand
the thoughts inside her little man

226
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,618
Though his mouth be quiet
let us hear his inner Wyatt

227
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:39,505
Mom?

228
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,343
It's me, Wyatt.

229
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:58,815
Wow!

230
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,193
Mom, look at you. You look great!

231
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,111
Right. Okay.

232
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,323
Looks like you're as surprised
to see me as I am to be back.

233
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,824
Yeah.

234
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,993
- Back from where?
- The future.

235
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,956
Oh, no. No, no, no.
We wanted to communicate with you.

236
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,251
I mean, the younger you,
the two-and-a-half-year-old you.

237
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,880
You guys taught me magic may work
in mysterious ways, but it always works.

238
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,550
Where did you hear that? That's nice.

239
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,761
In the future,
you're always telling me that.

240
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,305
Well, that's the future me.

241
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:33,809
I'm me now, who doesn't
have those kind of brilliant thoughts.

242
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:37,396
Right. Look, all I'm saying is,
if your spell brought me here,

243
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,439
there's gotta be a good reason.

244
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:44,111
I don't know. Do you remember anything
about when you were two and a half?

245
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,113
No, not really.

246
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,740
So then we're still
looking for that reason.

247
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:52,619
But still, this is a fantastic
opportunity the magic's brought us!

248
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,455
I mean, for me to see the past,

249
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,791
for you guys to learn
about the future...

250
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,334
Oh, no, no, no.

251
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:03,088
We don't want to know. We don't
want to risk changing it again.

252
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:04,339
Again?

253
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,633
- Don't ask.
- Okay.

254
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,303
But until we find out
why magic brought me back,

255
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,680
we could at least try
and enjoy the moment.

256
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,975
How did you become such an optimist?

257
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,351
From you, Mom.

258
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:20,272
You must have turned over
a new leaf in the future.

259
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,274
Don't count on it.

260
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:25,068
So that doesn't help
us with our Wyatt.

261
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,486
No.

262
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,864
Piper, you home?

263
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,491
Okay, the professor
gave me some information

264
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,286
that I think will be useful...
Who is he?

265
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,121
Aunt Phoebe, it's me! Wyatt!

266
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,040
Why what? Oh...

267
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,375
This is so amazing.

268
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,127
What, did a spell backfire?

269
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,795
- How'd you guess?
- Yeah.

270
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,798
Yeah, well, you know...
What did your professor say?

271
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:50,052
She said he probably was
talking to an imaginary friend,

272
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,679
I mean, not... not you,

273
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:56,767
you know, the other you when you were...
This is gonna be so confusing.

274
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,686
- You'll get used to it.
- Okay, imaginary friends,

275
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,855
- ring any bells?
- I'm afraid not.

276
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:06,151
She also said that he's a little young
for an imaginary friend.

277
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,570
- I mean, again, not you, just...
- I got it.

278
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,197
Right.

279
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,660
- Sorry.
- What language is that?

280
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:17,371
Maori. Your New Zealand charge, right?

281
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:21,166
Yes. He can wait because I think
this a little bit more important.

282
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,544
You said there's nothing
more important.

283
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,714
Look, I'm pulling double duty here,
so no guilt from the future for me.

284
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,008
Can we focus on helping him, please?

285
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,427
Someone told me that Whitelighters

286
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,222
are the glue that keeps
the magic world working.

287
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,224
Paige told you that?

288
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,601
Don't be so surprised.

289
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,937
Do I ever have a life in the future?

290
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,398
You should go. We'll figure this out.

291
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,236
Okay.

292
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,947
So you guys cast a spell
to communicate with me?

293
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,408
So let's go talk to me.

294
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,626
Dad! Hey, look at you!

295
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:08,589
You haven't changed! Maybe a little
less grey and a few pounds lighter.

296
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,591
- What?
- Future son.

297
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:17,055
Hey, is this Chris?
My gosh, he's so small!

298
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,975
Is this before or after
he swallowed the marble?

299
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,978
- What marble?
- Easy on the future information.

300
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,480
- You're right.
- But really, what marble?

301
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:26,815
What's going on?

302
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,985
They brought me here
to figure out what's wrong with me.

303
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:32,237
Is that still my room?

304
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,488
Explain.

305
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,741
If you let me see Mr Bear,

306
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,035
I will give him right back, I promise.

307
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:40,412
Hey, don't I know you?

308
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,165
You look familiar.

309
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:46,126
Wait. You can see me?

310
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,503
Of course I can.

311
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,422
Wyatt, who are you talking to?

312
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:51,924
What's going on?

313
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,343
- That man, you didn't see him?
- See who?

314
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,470
He was just there talking to... me.

315
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,056
Me? What do you mean, you or him?

316
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:01,892
Both.

317
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:10,192
The boy was just starting to trust me.
He was about to give me the bear.

318
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,444
Where did this other witch come from?

319
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:15,239
- What other witch?
- The one who saw me.

320
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,367
No. How is that possible?

321
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,285
It doesn't matter.

322
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:24,081
They know you now. I told you
this was going to be too dangerous.

323
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:27,167
I made it so that
only Wyatt could see me.

324
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,419
They found a way through your powers.

325
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:33,382
No. No, this witch
who saw me seemed surprised.

326
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,845
Still, he thought he knew me.

327
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:42,516
And his name was Wyatt too.

328
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,561
We may have an opportunity here.

329
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,479
I don't follow.

330
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:51,316
Don't you see? If I made it
so that only Wyatt can see me,

331
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:55,737
then that means this must be Wyatt too.
They conjured him from the future,

332
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,574
an older Wyatt, a good Wyatt.

333
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,451
But doesn't that make it worse?

334
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,704
If this future Wyatt is good,

335
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,748
then that means
you never infect the boy.

336
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,376
Gather the collective.
We need to attack now.

337
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,254
Distract the sisters
with everything you've got.

338
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,548
What do you plan to do?

339
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,552
I'm gonna get the boy
to give me that bear.

340
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,388
With it, I'll finally turn him,
and then,

341
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,349
I'll watch the future change
before my very eyes.

342
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,736
I know a demon when I see one.
That was a demon.

343
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,237
But you didn't see him.

344
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:41,200
Some creepy invisible guy standing
over my son, I'd say that's a demon.

345
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,786
He just didn't seem like a demon.
He wasn't threatening at all.

346
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,955
Maybe it was an imaginary friend.

347
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,708
No, imaginary friends are imaginary.

348
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:53,378
You said he's too young to have
an imaginary friend. He's two.

349
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:56,423
Actually I'm 25.
I... I know what you mean.

350
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,552
You don't have any idea
how much we've already been through

351
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,346
to make sure you turn out okay.

352
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:05,349
I know what you went through.
It's all gonna work out.

353
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:09,478
The fact that I'm standing here now,
happy and healthy, should tell you that.

354
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:12,731
Okay, fine, then you
won't mind IDing the demon

355
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:14,983
so we can keep you happy and healthy.

356
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,445
- Don't make me ground you.
- All right.

357
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,073
So...

358
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,200
...just out of curiosity,

359
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:26,203
do you have any cousins,
in the future?

360
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,498
No, don't answer that. Nice try.

361
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:30,958
Wait a sec.

362
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,835
I think you're right.

363
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,672
He is a demon.

364
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,007
"Vicus is a demon who preys on children,

365
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,093
turning them down the path of evil."

366
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,691
Okay.

367
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:58,652
Okay, buddy, Daddy's gotta
go check on Mommy, okay?

368
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:02,865
I'll be right back.
All right, you stay here, okay?

369
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:11,874
I'll never leave you, Wyatt.

370
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,334
I'll always be here, I promise.

371
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:17,296
Now, show me that you believe me.

372
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:20,382
Let me see your teddy bear,
just for a second.

373
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,634
Then I'll give you both a big surprise.

374
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,373
Enough!

375
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,334
Leave my family alone.

376
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,719
Everything all right up there?

377
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,721
Oh, yeah, we're fine.

378
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:18,524
Wyatt, what's going on?

379
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:22,444
- Piper!
- Good.

380
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,284
Don't touch it!

381
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,916
Dad, what happened?

382
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:43,590
Wyatt, what happened to you?

383
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,302
Who are you?

384
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,929
Who is who?

385
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,473
Who is he talking to?

386
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,226
The demon.

387
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,230
Follow me.

388
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,329
I just feel so free.

389
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,999
I can't believe I spent
a whole other lifetime

390
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:20,794
weighed down by the repressive
morality, by all that good.

391
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:25,048
Well, I'd like to give that feeling
to more good witches... with your help.

392
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:29,511
Why do you hole yourselves up
in this dank lair? It's so depressing.

393
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:33,557
Perhaps. But it's safer.

394
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:35,851
Down here, good doesn't dare attack us.

395
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,395
The future of evil
is above ground, trust me.

396
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:42,107
We shouldn't be hiding when we
have the power to take their world.

397
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:45,068
There'll be plenty of time
for conquering later.

398
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:48,906
For now, there's still
the matter of your family.

399
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:51,366
- They'll want to change you back.
- I know.

400
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,203
Soon they'll find a way
to scry for our location.

401
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,497
Then we must attack them
before they do.

402
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,332
No. We want them to find us.

403
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:00,167
I know them all too well.

404
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:05,130
It's too risky to fight them at the
manor. Here, we'll have the advantage.

405
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:07,174
You would kill your own family?

406
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:09,259
Watch me.

407
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:21,313
Are you telling me
that our child is evil... again?

408
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,317
However he changed future Wyatt,
it started with the bear, okay?

409
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,861
He cursed it somehow.
He made it glow.

410
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:31,198
Okay, then we need
to get that bear away from him.

411
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:35,077
Can I have this? Thank you. Okay.

412
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,500
Phoebe, don't make him angry.

413
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:45,045
We need to act fast. We need
to find a way to reverse the curse,

414
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:47,464
before future Wyatt
does something evil.

415
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:50,300
I think we should
take him to Magic School.

416
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,844
He'll be safer there.

417
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,180
Take the Book. There may
be something in there that can help.

418
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:58,767
- What are you gonna do?
- Get Paige, see if we can find Vicus.

419
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:01,728
Maybe if we vanquish him,
all of this will go away.

420
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,856
And if neither one of those works?

421
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,691
Then we're screwed.

422
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,402
Paige?

423
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,618
Luckily we have enough demon ash

424
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,496
that we should be able
to scry for Vicus' lair.

425
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:22,541
I wish I was a little bit
more confident in this potion.

426
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:23,917
What do you mean?

427
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:26,503
It's fine for the demon,
but what about Wyatt?

428
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,714
We're not gonna fight Wyatt.

429
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:32,676
- We might not have a choice.
- I don't think he'd try to kill us.

430
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:35,053
- How can you be sure?
- I can't.

431
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,347
But if Piper can't change Wyatt back,

432
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:40,976
then we're gonna have to vanquish
the demon and hope that does it.

433
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:44,855
And we have the added problem of not
even being able to see the demon.

434
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:46,899
Only Wyatt can see Vicus.

435
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,568
We're gonna have
to bring a lot of vials.

436
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:51,778
And just throw them everywhere?

437
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,780
Yeah. You have a better idea?

438
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,200
Normally yes, but sadly this time, no.

439
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,368
Oh! I got him.

440
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:01,205
Okay, better start filling those vials.

441
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:11,882
Oh, thank you. Sweetie, why don't
you let Mommy see the bear?

442
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:14,551
Come on, why do
you want that silly bear anyway?

443
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:17,763
- Lookit, come on.
- I don't think you'll convince him.

444
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,059
I just don't get it.
I mean, he seems as sweet as ever.

445
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:26,396
Of course he does.

446
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:29,358
So can you tell me how this boy

447
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,777
turns into the future of all evil?

448
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:33,904
It's not us as parents.

449
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:36,990
You can say that as much
as you want, but it's gotta be.

450
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:41,119
No, I found a reference
on cursed objects

451
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,248
changing children
in incremental degrees over time.

452
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:47,000
He's two. How much
could he really have changed?

453
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,503
Not much, but if he keeps
in this direction,

454
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,840
next 25 years,
he can be pretty far off path.

455
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,592
He will become the young man we saw.

456
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,261
This is ridiculous.

457
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:01,682
I mean, if it's all
because of that stupid bear,

458
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:04,393
then there's gotta be
a magical way around it,

459
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,104
a way to change it,
a way to change him.

460
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,566
Right. Of course.

461
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:13,610
Right, of course... but what?

462
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:18,365
It's... just that curses are difficult.

463
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:23,078
Oftentimes it's how it came about that's
more important than the magic itself.

464
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,998
Okay, well, we'll figure out
the why later,

465
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:28,792
but right now we need to fix this.

466
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:36,675
How much longer are we going to wait?

467
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:39,261
Patience. Scrying takes time.

468
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:43,223
There's a vanquishing potion to keep
my aunts busy for at least an hour.

469
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,850
Vanquishing potion?

470
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:47,519
You expect that they'll
show up empty-handed?

471
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,563
It's not gonna be that easy.

472
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:52,900
- I don't like this.
- Stop worrying.

473
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,944
The rest of the collective
is just a shimmer away.

474
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:59,406
Besides, my aunts won't be able
to see you when you're cloaked.

475
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:06,330
Wait. They're coming.

476
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,002
Have any trouble finding the place?

477
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:13,253
Where's Vicus?

478
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,881
Around. But you should
be worried about me.

479
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:17,216
We want to help you.

480
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,384
What makes you think I want your help?

481
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:21,929
Because we know you,
and we know you're good.

482
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,307
A lot of potions you got.
I thought you thought I was good.

483
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:28,936
These are for Vicus. As soon
as we get rid of him, this will be over.

484
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,521
Good luck finding him.

485
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:43,575
You girls are way off.

486
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,787
- We have lots more potions.
- Maybe I can help you out.

487
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:55,170
- What are you doing?
- Making a point.

488
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:57,005
Go ahead, vanquish him.

489
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:58,841
What?

490
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,763
So you thought
you'd change me back, did you?

491
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,891
- Why didn't that work?
- Because I'm not under any spell.

492
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:11,061
You can't change me back
by simply vanquishing Vicus.

493
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:12,396
He still got to me.

494
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,898
And this is how
evil grows over the years.

495
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:18,360
I don't plan on giving you
a chance to change me back.

496
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,112
I'm gonna make sure you don't.

497
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,907
But first, this should
keep you busy for a while.

498
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:31,957
These are the ones that killed Vicus.

499
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:34,668
Have fun.

500
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:38,297
Oh, and no orbing on Paige.

501
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,855
Try it.

502
00:30:55,022 --> 00:31:00,110
Evil taints what was once held dear
Remove this curse away from here

503
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:03,322
I guess we'll just try another one.

504
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:07,034
It's not gonna work, just like
the last 15 spells didn't work.

505
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:10,370
- Nothing's gonna change that damn bear.
- We can't give up.

506
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:13,832
What if it's not just the bear?
What if the problem is Wyatt?

507
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,169
- You can't think like that, Piper.
- Why not?

508
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:19,505
I mean, we try
and make the right decisions

509
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:22,132
and try and keep him away
from bad influences,

510
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:24,301
but ultimately, he's his own person.

511
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:26,345
We can't control him forever.

512
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:29,056
And we shouldn't try.

513
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:31,892
All you can do is try
to be a good influence on him.

514
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:35,646
Then a demon comes in right
under our noses and changes him.

515
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,357
We knew something
was wrong with Wyatt earlier.

516
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:41,151
We sensed it. We tried
to do something about it.

517
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:43,987
That's the best
you can hope for as a parent.

518
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,699
Or we can try another spell.

519
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:49,326
Maybe that's the problem.

520
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:51,870
We're just trying another spell.

521
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:55,666
- So?
- So why didn't the demon do that?

522
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,543
He didn't just appear today.

523
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:01,463
What kept him from taking the bear
and cursing it if it was that simple?

524
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,673
I don't know.

525
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,051
You know, maybe because...

526
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:08,428
...he needed something else from Wyatt,

527
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:11,849
and not just the bear, but his trust.

528
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:14,726
Mom, Dad.

529
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:17,020
How'd he get in here?

530
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:18,438
I'm still a Halliwell.

531
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:21,608
I always hated this place.

532
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:24,069
- What do you want?
- What do you think I want?

533
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:27,739
Young me. Make sure you don't screw
me up again, try to turn me good.

534
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:30,367
You don't really
have a choice in that matter.

535
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:33,704
What are you gonna do, Mom?
Kill me in order to protect me?

536
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:35,455
It's a thought.

537
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:38,167
You always said spanking was barbaric.

538
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:44,673
Ouch, that hurt.

539
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,802
I seriously never had you pegged as
the type of parents who'd hit your kids.

540
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,230
- You stay away from him.
- Should I stay away from this too?

541
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:02,232
You can't touch it.

542
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,569
Why not?
It's my magical inheritance, isn't it?

543
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:09,239
You're evil now.

544
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:23,670
Let go of him.

545
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:28,967
Don't wait up for me.

546
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:39,853
We were lucky to get out of there alive.

547
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,480
Sorry.

548
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:43,273
We weren't lucky.

549
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,569
Wyatt wanted us distracted
for long enough to grab Wyatt.

550
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:49,488
What is he gonna do with him?

551
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:53,575
He wants to take him to the future so we
can't change them both back to good.

552
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:55,702
That's why he wanted the Book.

553
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:59,206
He's gonna figure out a way
to get that Book.

554
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:00,791
Found him, let's go.

555
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,377
He's gonna be expecting that.

556
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:07,381
So? I can't just sit here
and let my son corrupt himself.

557
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:09,716
That was too easy.
It's gotta be a trap.

558
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:12,177
Whatever we do,
we have to be smart about it

559
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:16,265
'cause Wyatt is very powerful.
We're only gonna get one shot at this.

560
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,600
We know what his next move
is gonna be.

561
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,936
He's gonna go after the Book.

562
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:22,855
We should set a trap for him.

563
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:26,692
He's not gonna attack you here.
He doesn't want to have to fight you.

564
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:29,444
But you said if we go to him,
he'll be expecting it.

565
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:32,906
He will, which is why I agree
with Phoebe. We should set a trap.

566
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:35,200
I'll be the one waiting
for him, not you.

567
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,703
You don't have
any powers to fight him with.

568
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,080
Which is why he won't
sense me as a threat.

569
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:42,833
Any of you guys are here,
he's not gonna show up.

570
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,878
Say you get him here.
What exactly are you gonna do?

571
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:50,090
The demon needed Wyatt to trust
him, hand over the bear willingly.

572
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:52,634
- I just need him to give it back.
- Leo...

573
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:55,554
I may not have any powers,
but I'm not powerless.

574
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:58,974
- He's not gonna hurt me.
- No? Ever read Hamlet?

575
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:01,894
- Hamlet killed his stepfather.
- Close enough.

576
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,438
- Freud says according...
- Woman, can it!

577
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:08,025
It's the only way
it can happen, Piper. You know it.

578
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:10,527
All right, well,

579
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:14,281
any sign of trouble, you call
'cause we're just an orb away.

580
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:21,163
Be careful.

581
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,998
I will be.

582
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,189
You see that Book over there?

583
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:50,901
I want you to bring it to me.
Understand?

584
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:59,201
Come on, Dad.

585
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:00,786
You don't have any powers.

586
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:02,287
That's right, I don't.

587
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:05,290
So, what are you gonna do?
Take away my car keys?

588
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:09,002
I don't need to do anything.
You're gonna stop yourself.

589
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:14,049
That's what I always loved about you,
Dad. You're such a boundless optimist.

590
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:15,634
I know you.

591
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:19,346
I'm your father. And I know
you still have good in your heart.

592
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:21,807
Now your optimism just sounds pathetic.

593
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:25,853
You know how I know that?
Because this child right here

594
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:29,273
still has good in his soul.
Isn't that right, Wyatt?

595
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,816
Get the Book, Wyatt!

596
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:33,777
Now!

597
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:36,113
You can come over here
to me if you want.

598
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,573
Dad, seriously.

599
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:41,076
I don't want to have to hurt you.
But if you get in my way...

600
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:43,078
I don't believe that.

601
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:45,831
You mind if I come
over there for a second, Wyatt?

602
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:47,374
Stay away from him!

603
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,002
Is this your Wuvey?

604
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:51,795
Could I see him please?

605
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:54,840
Get away from him now,
or I'll kill you.

606
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:57,301
I don't think you will.

607
00:36:58,385 --> 00:36:59,887
I told you to stop.

608
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,181
I was there when you were born, Wyatt.

609
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,725
I gave up my powers for you.

610
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:07,019
I tried to change the world for you.

611
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:10,564
And I would do it again
in a heartbeat. You know why?

612
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:12,566
- I'm your father.
- Stop it!

613
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:15,486
You want to kill me?

614
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:19,198
Go ahead. I gave up
my life for you before.

615
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:21,700
Dad... please.

616
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,076
I love you.

617
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:26,455
Do you understand what that means?

618
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,419
Wyatt, can I see Wuvey
just for one second?

619
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:34,463
I promise I'll give him back to you.

620
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:37,299
You can trust me.

621
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:42,721
Thank you.

622
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,099
Here you go.

623
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:57,319
Dad?

624
00:37:58,195 --> 00:37:59,279
What did you?

625
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:01,865
What happened?

626
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,227
Miss Halliwell, do you have a moment?

627
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:31,478
Yeah.

628
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:35,357
I had a chance to look over your paper
on childhood imaginary friends.

629
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:37,568
Yeah, and let me guess.

630
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:41,363
You found it to be a shallow pop
psych. Examination on the subject?

631
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,990
Hardly.

632
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:47,911
An A-minus? Wow, really?

633
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:51,498
Well, your use of Kohlberg's
moral stages was a bit of a stretch.

634
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:53,792
But overall... quite insightful.

635
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:55,127
Thanks.

636
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:59,464
I especially liked your supposition
that the impact of an imaginary friend

637
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:01,842
can actually last well into adulthood.

638
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:03,802
I found that fascinating.

639
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:05,846
So do I.

640
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:11,602
I have to go. I have to go home
and see my nephew off.

641
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:13,645
Off? I thought you said he was two?

642
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,607
No, this is a different nephew.

643
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:20,152
Actually, he's older, and he lives
really far away. But I'm late.

644
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:24,114
Before you go. I...
I just wanted to apologise.

645
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:29,369
I prejudged you as a fraud,
and you are clearly anything but.

646
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,998
I look forward
to reading your next paper.

647
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:35,417
And... to your next column.

648
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:38,879
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

649
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:48,597
Please tell me Paige
is more punctual in the future.

650
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:51,642
I thought you didn't want
any knowledge of the future.

651
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,644
- A little wouldn't hurt.
- Piper.

652
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,938
What? It's not gonna change anything,

653
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:58,440
aside from my being
constantly irritated.

654
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:05,447
That's "sorry" in Maori.

655
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:09,451
Do I ever get the hang of this
in the future? What's so funny?

656
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:13,413
Nothing. It's just... who do you think
teaches me to be a Whitelighter?

657
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:15,457
Me?

658
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:20,254
Well, I guess I'd better get going.

659
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:25,133
Not that it matters with time travel
at all, but just to be safe.

660
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,595
Aunt Paige...

661
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:31,640
...thanks for everything
you're about to do for me.

662
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:33,559
You're welcome, I think.

663
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,313
Dad...

664
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,524
...thanks for not giving up on me.

665
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:42,067
You can count on it.

666
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:46,405
Aunt Phoebe...

667
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:49,908
...you should hold on
to that imaginary friends paper.

668
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:52,578
- Why?
- For my little cousin.

669
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,165
- Bye.
- Bye.

670
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:02,921
Don't worry about me
so much, okay, Mom?

671
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,467
Sorry. That's the one thing
that won't change.

672
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,185
- I'll see you.
- See you.

673
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:28,322
A son in the future, a son in the past

674
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:32,117
Seeing anew what once has passed
Return him now to whence he came

675
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:33,827
Right when he left

676
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:36,830
All now the same

677
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:45,464
Bye.

678
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,008
Mom, look.

679
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:52,221
Firetruck!
