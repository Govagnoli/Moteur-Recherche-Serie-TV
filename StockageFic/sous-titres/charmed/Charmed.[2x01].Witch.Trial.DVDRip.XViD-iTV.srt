1
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,046
Hello, anybody home?

2
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:15,723
Sister witches, guess what.

3
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:20,564
- Oh, are you nuts?
- What are you doing?

4
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:22,168
- Hi.
- Hi.

5
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,960
"Sister witches"?
I can't believe you said that.

6
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:29,085
- What's the matter with you?
- How was I to know

7
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:30,398
you'd be here with anybody?

8
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:34,198
Last I heard you were meeting
a banker friend about the loan.

9
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:38,284
- Is this the credit check?
- It's not what you think.

10
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,242
We were just...
We were just kissing, that's all.

11
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:44,088
You don't have to justify it.
You're single, you're responsible,

12
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:46,558
you're way overdue in the
sex department, I say go for it.

13
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:48,640
I'm not way overdue.

14
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,803
All right, maybe a little,
but that's besides the point.

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,881
I would never just sleep with a guy
to get something, you know that.

16
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:57,040
Give yourself a break.
You're going through a lot.

17
00:00:57,209 --> 00:01:01,646
No job, straining to buy the club,
you haven't heard from Leo in weeks.

18
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:04,568
All right, well, the preview is at 5
and the auction's Sunday at 11.

19
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:07,163
Oh, no, Prue, go back outside.
Go on, hurry.

20
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:10,723
Okay.

21
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:18,805
- So you must be Prue.
- No, actually.

22
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:21,437
All right, great.
Yeah, I'll see you then.

23
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:23,088
She's Prue. I'm Phoebe.

24
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:26,203
Rob, can we take a rain check
on the rest of the evening?

25
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,802
It's getting kind of crowded in here.

26
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:30,278
- Okay, sure.
- Yeah, okay.

27
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:35,047
So I'll meet you tomorrow
at the club at noon.

28
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:36,358
Great. Thanks for dinner.

29
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:39,124
- Okay. All right. Bye.
- Bye. See you.

30
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:43,928
- So did you get the loan?
- Hopefully. I'll find out tomorrow.

31
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:45,921
Well, my fingers are crossed.

32
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:49,440
Wait. You guys,
where are you going?

33
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,123
Oh, I have an auction coming up,
I have clients to call.

34
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:55,599
Wait, you guys, don't you
even know what tomorrow is?

35
00:01:57,089 --> 00:02:01,321
It's our one-year anniversary
of becoming witches. Hello.

36
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:04,083
- Tomorrow is, really?
- So...

37
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:07,645
"So"? "So"? It's a day to celebrate.

38
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,442
Not just because
it's our anniversary.

39
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:13,204
But because it falls on one of the most
powerful Wiccan days of the year,

40
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:14,927
the autumnal equinox.

41
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:17,967
Now, according to this witch
that I met today at the bookstore...

42
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:19,528
Hold it, a witch?

43
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:22,478
You didn't tell her about us, did you?

44
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:24,128
Well, yeah, sure I did. Why not?

45
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:27,725
I mean, I didn't tell her that we're
magical witches, obviously.

46
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:32,679
Look, I'm sorry, but I think
after everything we've been through,

47
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,761
it's important to learn as much
as we can about who we are.

48
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:37,362
Forewarned is forearmed.

49
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:39,845
And I think that we should leave
well enough alone.

50
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,477
I mean we've been demon-free
for over a month now.

51
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:44,879
- I'd like to keep it that way.
- Amen to that.

52
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,119
Prue! Piper!

53
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:08,718
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

54
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,563
Why does the book do that?
How does the book do that?

55
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:19,402
"Rite of passage, fight it with
the power of one or else."

56
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:43,001
What the hell was that?

57
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:46,047
The Book of Shadows.
Where's the Book of Shadows?

58
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,679
So much for being demon-free.

59
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:25,399
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing.

60
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:30,040
Whatever it was came out of nowhere
and disappeared into nowhere.

61
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,086
Well, it took the Book of Shadows
somewhere.

62
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:35,599
And he's powerful too. No other
demon's been able to steal the book.

63
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,283
Oh, but if he's so powerful,
then why didn't he kill us?

64
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:41,003
He probably didn't
want to go up against you.

65
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:42,158
Me? What do you mean?

66
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:43,762
That's what the
Book of Shadows says.

67
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:46,363
"Fight it with the power of one."
That's gotta mean your power,

68
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:47,803
- it's the strongest.
- Says who?

69
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:51,041
Says every demon or warlock
we've ever gone up against.

70
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,439
She's right, Prue, the power
of one's gotta mean you,

71
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:55,600
otherwise it would have said
the power of three.

72
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,885
The only question is,
how are we gonna find this demon?

73
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,528
We don't know anything about him.

74
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,361
Well, we better think
of something fast,

75
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:04,805
because without the Book of Shadows,
we're not the Charmed Ones anymore.

76
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,602
Coming!

77
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:23,564
- Hi.
- Can I use your phone, please?

78
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:27,558
- Well, actually we're...
- Please, it's an emergency. Please?

79
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:29,959
Okay, come on in.
It's right around that corner.

80
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:38,562
- Are you out of your mind?
- What was I supposed to do, say no?

81
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:40,606
- Look at that poor girl.
- Jenny?

82
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,885
Jenny, come on, talk to me.

83
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:47,927
International operator, please.
Saudi Arabia.

84
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:51,001
- Saudi Arabia?
- I'm sorry.

85
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:52,284
We're moving in next door,

86
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,122
or at least we're trying to.
The phone's not hooked up yet.

87
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,487
- So you're our new neighbours?
- Name's Dan. Dan Gordon.

88
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:02,482
I don't care if the circuits are busy.
I have to talk to my mom.

89
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:05,886
And that's my niece, Jenny,
who is obviously not talking to me.

90
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:10,166
Jenny? Sweetie, come on.

91
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:17,918
- I'm sorry. It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

92
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:21,398
I saw him first.

93
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:24,240
Demons now, drooling later.

94
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:26,240
I have to meet my client
before the preview.

95
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:27,478
Oh, wait a minute.

96
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:30,044
The scariest demon
we've ever run across

97
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,200
opens up some portal in our attic

98
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,441
and steals the Book of Shadows,
and you want to go into the office?

99
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:40,283
What's the matter with her?

100
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:44,006
It's the first demon
she's faced since Andy died.

101
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,205
Maybe it's bringing up
some bad memories.

102
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,686
- What are we doing here?
- Celebrating the equinox.

103
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:28,000
Can't you just feel it?
The energy in this place?

104
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,637
- It's a convergence.
- It's a crock.

105
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,529
I thought we were supposed to
meet your witch friend.

106
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:35,839
We are. This is where
she told us to meet her.

107
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:38,204
- Now, please, just relax.
- Relax.

108
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:42,157
My life was a mess before our little
wake-up call this morning, remember?

109
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:45,643
Oh, Stevie.

110
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:49,802
Hey, Phoebe.
I'm so glad you could make it.

111
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:53,325
Actually we're not here for this. We
needed to talk to you about something.

112
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:54,717
This is my sister Piper.

113
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:57,159
- Hi.
- Hey, Piper. It's very nice to meet you.

114
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,241
Are you a witch too?

115
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,478
Sort of. Maybe. I don't know.

116
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:06,447
Is everybody here one also?

117
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:09,487
Oh, no. No, no, no.
It's just a group of believers.

118
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,121
Women who know of this special place
and have come to celebrate.

119
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:16,359
By the way, happy anniversary.

120
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,480
That's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

121
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:22,198
Why did you say that today
was gonna be a powerful day for us?

122
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:24,485
Because your anniversary
falls on the equinox,

123
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:27,368
which is a powerful day
in and of itself.

124
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:31,198
For you, this convergence of powers
is even stronger,

125
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:33,837
the potential greater.

126
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:35,886
All you have to do is connect.

127
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,800
- You wanna try it?
- Try it? How?

128
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:44,040
Let us begin.

129
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:46,081
- I don't wanna connect.
- We have to connect.

130
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:47,238
I don't wanna try it.

131
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:49,559
- Okay, but we have to because...
- Why?

132
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:52,038
What have we got to lose, okay?

133
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:58,522
Well, apparently we've got
our clothes to lose.

134
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:01,283
- I see that.
- No.

135
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:02,962
Whoa! Whoa, wait!
What are you doing?

136
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:04,118
When in Rome.

137
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:07,486
No, no. We're not in Rome, Phoebe.
We're in California, and it's illegal here.

138
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:10,840
It's totally natural, okay?
Go for it. Come on.

139
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:13,648
God. This is ridiculous.

140
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:16,198
- Can I keep my shoes on?
- Yeah, but that's it.

141
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:20,123
- We have absolutely zero information.
- Everybody's naked, not just you.

142
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:23,201
- And now we're naked.
- Okay?

143
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:27,123
The power of three.

144
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,486
- Did you just hear that?
- Hear what?

145
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,647
The power of three.

146
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:33,208
That.

147
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:36,244
- Grams.
- Grams? What? Where?

148
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,445
I don't hear anything.

149
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:46,318
Mrs Milton?

150
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,360
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

151
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:51,003
Oh, no problem.
I was just looking around.

152
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:53,478
I think that we'll have
a great turnout for the preview.

153
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:56,117
We've gotten an excellent
response to your husband's collection.

154
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,166
I'm not surprised.

155
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:04,080
Now, the opening bid prices may look
a little low, but don't worry.

156
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:07,047
It should attract a lot of buyers,
which should result in a bidding war.

157
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,564
It's the best way to sell inventory
like this at top dollar.

158
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,045
Is that all right with you?

159
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:16,165
I guess I'm having
a little more trouble letting go

160
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:18,320
of John's things than I thought.

161
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:20,445
That's only natural. It's not easy.

162
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:23,169
I suppose that you
deal with death

163
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:25,285
quite a bit in your line of work,
don't you?

164
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:30,319
I mean, like this, auctioning off
some poor widow's inheritance.

165
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,879
This. Unfortunately, yes.

166
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:36,882
L... I just keep going over
and over in my mind

167
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:39,927
the last time I saw him
before the accident.

168
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,045
And I keep thinking if only

169
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:45,326
I'd done something or said something

170
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:49,277
to stop him from getting in the car,
maybe he'd still be alive.

171
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:17,923
Oh, God. Rob, I'm so sorry I'm late.

172
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:21,445
I got stuck at this thing, and then
my sister needed a ride, and I'm...

173
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:23,725
So I'm totally screwed
on the loan now, aren't I?

174
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:26,767
Don't be ridiculous. I'm just looking
around, checking things out.

175
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:31,088
It needs a lot of work, I know that.
But that's not a problem.

176
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:34,161
Just because the last two owners went
bankrupt doesn't mean it can't work.

177
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:36,479
I've done three separate
marketing studies

178
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,119
and found a 68-percent interest
in the target clientele.

179
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:41,483
- Piper...
- Running a restaurant

180
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:43,082
is very similar to running a club.

181
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:46,685
You've already shown me all this.
I've got it, I've got everything...

182
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,726
...except for an understanding

183
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:51,926
of why you want to put yourself
in a position to fail like this.

184
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:55,399
Clubs are an extremely
high-risk business.

185
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:56,843
Piper, you could lose your shirt.

186
00:12:57,369 --> 00:12:59,678
Well, it wouldn't be the first time today.

187
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:03,364
Look, I know what I'm getting
myself into. I know the risks.

188
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:04,723
Actually it's a lot less risk

189
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,119
and a lot less expensive
than starting my own restaurant,

190
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:09,120
which is what I really wanted to do.

191
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,644
The point is, I'm tired
of working for somebody else

192
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:13,606
and helping them
realize their dreams.

193
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:16,125
I want to run my own place.
This place.

194
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:19,167
And I can do it too,
but not without your help.

195
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:24,965
Well, at the risk of your never
wanting to go out with me again...

196
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:26,278
...congratulations.

197
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:29,764
- I got it?
- You got it.

198
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:32,001
Yay.

199
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,682
Were you vanquished
by the Charmed Ones?

200
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,519
Yeah. Why?

201
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:58,687
I'm giving you a second chance.

202
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:05,600
The power of three.

203
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:07,566
- Did you hear that?
- The power of three.

204
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:09,606
- Hear what?
- Grams?

205
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:15,478
You're dead, witch.

206
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:20,920
Oh, my God. Jeremy?

207
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:25,721
- Hello.
- Prue, thank God you're there.

208
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:27,845
- Jeremy just attacked me.
- Piper, calm down.

209
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:31,606
Jeremy? That is impossible.
We vanquished him a year ago.

210
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:34,158
Well, apparently he got
unvanquished somehow.

211
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:35,842
And since we don't have the book,

212
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,728
we'll have to remember the spell
together. I'm conferencing Phoebe.

213
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,238
- Phoebe, are you there?
- AT&T power of three.

214
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:45,799
Okay, wait, wasn't that it?
"The power of three will set us free"?

215
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:47,643
Grams.

216
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,726
- What's the matter?
- He's...

217
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:55,886
He's fighting through my freezes.
He's adjusting or something.

218
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:58,404
Okay, put us on speakerphone.
We have to say it together.

219
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:03,487
You're not getting away
from me this time.

220
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,158
Piper!

221
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:11,883
- Piper.
- Hurry, now! Hurry, now, now, now!

222
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:14,483
- The power of three will set us free
- The power of three will set us free

223
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,447
The power of three will set us free
The power of three will set us...

224
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:23,240
- Piper?
- Piper?

225
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,121
Piper?

226
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:29,519
It's okay, he's gone...

227
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:30,724
...again.

228
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:49,077
How can you not have seen
who attacked me?

229
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,238
How is that possible?

230
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:52,685
I don't know, I guess
I was blocked or something,

231
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:55,079
and then, he just
sort of disappeared, you know?

232
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:57,240
I'm starting to understand
why this place keeps going under.

233
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:00,328
Oh, no, it's not
a bad crime area, not at all.

234
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,400
Well, it's something
I'm gonna be checking into.

235
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,207
I can assure you of that.

236
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:06,441
Excuse me, ma'am.

237
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,525
Yeah, hey. How you doing?

238
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,847
Are you okay?

239
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,523
Physically, yeah.
I think my loan's on shaky ground.

240
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:23,568
I couldn't exactly tell Rob, "It was
just a warlock, don't worry about it."

241
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:26,004
Oh, it would be a shame
if the loan didn't work out.

242
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:29,684
I mean, this place is great.
I used to come here.

243
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:32,841
- It has a lot of potential.
- Yeah, you think so?

244
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:35,477
Care to loan me 60 grand?

245
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:37,446
Any ideas on where
Jeremy came from?

246
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:40,169
No, but I don't want to run
into any of the other demons

247
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:41,444
we've already vanquished.

248
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:44,282
Hopefully Phoebe can find some
answers in those new books of hers.

249
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:46,485
I sure wish
she had our book to look at.

250
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:49,243
Feels kind of lost without it.

251
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:51,838
- Although...
- Although what?

252
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:55,524
It was weird, but right before Jeremy
appeared, I swore I heard Grams.

253
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:57,566
- Grams?
- I was positive it was her.

254
00:16:57,729 --> 00:16:58,957
She said, "The power of three."

255
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:01,205
And Phoebe said
she heard her say it this morning.

256
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:04,162
Maybe Grams was trying
to warn me. Warn us.

257
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:31,642
Hey there.

258
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,881
- It's Jenny, right?
- Yeah.

259
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:39,157
We didn't really get to say hello before.
My name is Phoebe.

260
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:41,917
Phoebe Halliwell.
And this is Kit, the cat.

261
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:44,478
Get it? Kit cat?
Little play on words.

262
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:49,839
- So shouldn't you be in school?
- I'm taking the week off.

263
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:52,166
- Really?
- For the move, you know?

264
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:54,929
- So you're moving in with your uncle?
- Just for the school year,

265
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:57,364
- until my mom and dad come back.
- From Saudi Arabia?

266
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:00,478
My dad's with the State Department

267
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:03,766
- so he gets transferred a lot.
- That sucks.

268
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:07,964
So did you ever
get in touch with your mom?

269
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,528
It doesn't matter.

270
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:13,686
If it matters to you, it matters.

271
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,880
Your secret's safe with me.

272
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:22,920
Well, it's almost that time
of the month, you know? And...

273
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:24,727
Well, I need some...

274
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:27,365
- Tampons.
- Right, yeah.

275
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:29,645
And you don't want to talk
to your uncle about it?

276
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,482
But I did. But he went out
and bought sanitary napkins.

277
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:33,684
Like that's gonna work.

278
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,086
This is so embarrassing.

279
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:47,728
So do you think maybe you could
get some for me instead?

280
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:50,639
Sure, but...

281
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:54,200
- The connection.
- But what?

282
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:03,006
I'm really sorry, Jenny,
but I have to go.

283
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:04,238
Fine.

284
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:07,608
Look, I would love to help you out.

285
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:10,522
But I believe that your parents
wouldn't have left you with your uncle

286
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:14,204
if they didn't think you could trust him
with stuff like this.

287
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:16,599
Ask him again.
And if he stills screws it up,

288
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:22,287
remember, we're open 24 hours,
seven days a week, right next door.

289
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,441
Piper, wait up.

290
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:30,358
I think I figured out
how to find who the demon is.

291
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:34,124
All we have to do
is ask the Book of Shadows.

292
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:35,608
What?

293
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:38,078
It's been right in front of us
the whole time.

294
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:40,757
- Kit's collar?
- No! The triquetra,

295
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,159
the symbol of the power of three,
our symbol.

296
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:45,479
Maybe that's what Grams
has been trying to tell us.

297
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:47,048
Phoebe, you're rambling.

298
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:49,769
Stevie said all we would have
to do is find our connection, right?

299
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:53,320
That if we did, we'd be able to tap
into the power of the equinox.

300
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:54,968
Well this has got to be it.

301
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:58,963
The triquetra, it's us. It's on the cover
of the Book of Shadows.

302
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:01,359
I still don't understand
how we can ask the book for help

303
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:03,997
when we don't have the book.

304
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:09,558
The spirit board?

305
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:11,640
It told us how to find
the Book of Shadows, right?

306
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,198
It can do it again.
All you have to do is believe.

307
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:16,007
Now, come on.
We're stronger together.

308
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:18,121
- Okay.
- Come on.

309
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:20,757
Okay, close your eyes and feel it.

310
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:24,520
The power of three.

311
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,884
- Did you hear that?
- Grams?

312
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:34,406
- A.
- B.

313
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:38,089
- R.
- A.

314
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:41,366
X, A.

315
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:43,564
S.

316
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:45,878
Abraxas?

317
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:05,248
Okay, I found it.

318
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:09,877
"Abraxas, a demon of the astral plane
who destroys witches,

319
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:12,358
by demonizing their powers."

320
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,562
Okay, but what does that have to do
with the Book of Shadows?

321
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:17,481
That's where our powers
come from, isn't it?

322
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,605
Maybe Abraxas
is turning it evil somehow.

323
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:22,358
That would definitely
undo our spells

324
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:25,726
and explain why Jeremy
all of a sudden became unvanquished.

325
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:27,881
And the Woogyman.

326
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:29,801
When did the Woogyman
become unvanquished?

327
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:32,039
A couple seconds ago.

328
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:37,127
- Freeze it.
- It doesn't freeze, remember?

329
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:39,359
The spell. What's the spell?

330
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:40,598
Spell. Spell.

331
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:43,966
I am light
I am one too strong to fight

332
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,801
- I can't remember the rest.
- Yes, you can.

333
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:48,800
Okay, we can.

334
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:51,759
Return to dark where shadows dwell

335
00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:53,482
You cannot have this Halliwell

336
00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:58,406
Go away and leave my sight
And take with you this endless night

337
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:06,884
- That wasn't so hard.
- It's a good thing we were together.

338
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:09,768
Abraxas must be reading
the book backwards,

339
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:12,437
- that's how he's turning it evil.
- How do you figure?

340
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:14,998
The spell to vanquish Jeremy
was at the back of the book.

341
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,842
And the spell to vanquish
the Woogyman was right before that.

342
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:19,767
Which means more are on their way.

343
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:21,808
We gotta warn Prue.

344
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:33,082
What? What happened?

345
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:36,000
I saw the warlock Nicholas...

346
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:38,480
...killing Prue.

347
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:47,439
Prue, your sister Phoebe's
on the phone.

348
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:51,328
- Tell her that I'll call her back.
- She said it's important.

349
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:53,320
She always says that it's important.

350
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:56,128
Just tell her I'll call her back,
it's okay. Thanks.

351
00:22:58,249 --> 00:22:59,238
Mrs Milton?

352
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:01,923
- Oh, hi.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

353
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,479
I had no idea there would be
this many people interested.

354
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:07,685
You're obviously
very good at your job.

355
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:10,283
Actually, I think it says more about
your husband's collection

356
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:12,041
than it does about me.

357
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:15,598
How long has it been
since the accident?

358
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:17,558
Eight and a half months.

359
00:23:19,089 --> 00:23:20,647
How long has it been for you?

360
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:23,357
Not very long.

361
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:30,964
Nicholas.

362
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,001
Prue?

363
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:42,244
You remember the feeling, don't you?

364
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:53,887
Lavender, mimosa, holy thistle
Cleanse this evil from our midst

365
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:58,166
You're overheating. Your brain cells
are frying. It's over.

366
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,522
- Scatter its cells throughout time
- No!

367
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:04,448
Let this Nick no more exist

368
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:21,280
Well, your blood pressure's
back to normal.

369
00:24:21,449 --> 00:24:24,282
So is your temperature,
your electrolytes.

370
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:27,725
If I didn't know any better, I'd say you
were a perfectly healthy young woman.

371
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:30,926
- Does that mean I can go home now?
- Well, I'd like to run a few more tests.

372
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:33,285
Find out what caused
your body temperature to rise

373
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:35,041
spontaneously like that.

374
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:37,046
Has that ever happened
to you before?

375
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,961
It's happened to us all before.

376
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,122
Doctor, it's okay, really.

377
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:44,684
I know how to keep it
from happening again.

378
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,488
Well, all right. I'll see to your
discharge papers then.

379
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:50,119
- Thanks.
- All right.

380
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:56,323
- That was close.
- Too close.

381
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:59,447
No, I don't mean her, I mean you.
The paramedic said you almost died.

382
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:01,042
Yeah, what else is new?

383
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,677
We'd better figure out a way
to get the book back from Abraxas.

384
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:04,964
If we don't, we're dead.

385
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:07,405
But how? We don't know where
the astral plane is.

386
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:08,684
Yes, we do.

387
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:13,127
It coexists within our own plane,
remember? That's what Stevie said.

388
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:15,007
Still doesn't help find the demon.

389
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:17,769
Maybe, maybe not. I was thinking...

390
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:19,999
You know how we always thought
that nobody could take

391
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:22,319
the Book of Shadows
out of the house but us?

392
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:23,968
Maybe nobody did.

393
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:27,565
Maybe it's still in the house
just on a different plane.

394
00:25:27,729 --> 00:25:29,082
The astral plane.

395
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:31,809
That would mean Abraxas
is still in the house too.

396
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:35,758
Right. So we would need
to find a doorway or a window

397
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:38,568
to get to his plane
like he used to get to ours.

398
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:43,644
And we need to do this before the end
of the equinox by sunrise tomorrow.

399
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:48,724
And then Prue can kick some
astral ass with the power of one.

400
00:25:58,009 --> 00:25:59,886
Prue, what's the matter?

401
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:02,808
Nothing. I just think that
it's a long shot, that's all.

402
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:04,243
Well, at least it's a shot.

403
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,969
I agree. I mean who knows how
many other demons and warlocks

404
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:09,040
he's let loose
that we just don't know about yet.

405
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:11,598
Or even worse, if Abraxas
gets to the first page of the book

406
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,919
- before we get to him, we're toast.
- Why?

407
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:17,684
Because it's the incantation
that gave us our powers, remember?

408
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:19,840
If Abraxas says that backwards too,

409
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:21,886
then we'll lose them
and the book forever.

410
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:24,438
So we go back to
leading normal lives again.

411
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:26,361
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- What?

412
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:29,441
- Are you joking?
- No, Phoebe, I'm not joking.

413
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:35,360
Look, we always said that things
happen to us for a reason, right?

414
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:37,918
So maybe the reason
this time is to give us an out.

415
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,279
Prue, there's no out.
Abraxas will kill us.

416
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:44,408
Not if all he wants is the book.
After all, that's the real power, not us.

417
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:46,759
If all he wanted was the book,
he wouldn't keep sending

418
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:47,998
demons and warlocks after us.

419
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:50,967
We won't have to worry about
anymore if he gets to the first page.

420
00:26:51,129 --> 00:26:52,608
What are you saying, Prue?

421
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:55,647
Look, if we don't get to him,
we stop being witches.

422
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:59,404
Exactly. Which means we stop
risking our lives all the time.

423
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:03,926
Which means we stop watching
the people we love lose theirs.

424
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,763
- Prue.
- Let her be.

425
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:14,442
We're screwed, you know.

426
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:17,564
No, we're not.
If there's a window, we'll find it.

427
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:19,526
That's not what I meant.

428
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:23,805
- She'll come around.
- By sunrise? You know how Prue is

429
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:27,041
when she makes up her mind
about something. That's it.

430
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:29,848
- We're screwed.
- And we're out of wine.

431
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:33,279
I'll get it, you keep dreaming.

432
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:42,486
Oh, hi.

433
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:45,163
- Dan.
- Dan, right.

434
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:49,368
You're Phoebe? Jenny told me.
I hope it's okay to stop by.

435
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:52,807
Of course. We were just
doing some reading.

436
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:57,001
Well, I just wanted to give you this
to say thanks.

437
00:27:57,209 --> 00:28:00,838
You know, for talking to Jenny. Or
better yet, for getting her to talk to me.

438
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:05,958
That's really sweet. And timely too.
But it's not necessary.

439
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:09,804
Well, to be honest, I was sort of hoping
to get something out of it.

440
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:12,085
I mean, you know, for Jenny.

441
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:14,399
Just in case she needs
a woman to talk to again.

442
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:18,363
Of course. Anytime.
She seems like a great kid.

443
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:22,241
So did she tell you
what the problem was?

444
00:28:23,689 --> 00:28:26,647
Any idea what size I'm supposed
to get? There's like five.

445
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:31,247
- Junior is probably a safe bet.
- Right.

446
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:34,401
Thanks.

447
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:40,768
- Well, see you around.
- Hopefully.

448
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:44,005
- Night.
- Night.

449
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:51,327
No, I understand. Okay, bye.

450
00:28:53,729 --> 00:28:55,879
- Who was that?
- Rob, the banker,

451
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:59,678
or rather his assistant, telling me
that my loan has been denied.

452
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:02,927
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

453
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:05,284
Just wasn't meant to be, I guess.

454
00:29:05,449 --> 00:29:08,202
Really glad I never slept
with him though.

455
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:09,683
What was I thinking?

456
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:11,642
About Leo maybe.

457
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:15,082
Wine?

458
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:27,481
- Hey.
- Hi.

459
00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:31,165
- You wanna sit down?
- Sure.

460
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:39,245
They haven't assigned me
a new partner yet...

461
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:40,478
...since Andy died.

462
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:43,162
Here.

463
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:50,361
- I'm sorry I haven't come to see you.
- Yeah, me too.

464
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:59,478
I'm just glad you're here now, Prue.
I've been worried about you.

465
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:02,962
- I'm all right.
- Really?

466
00:30:03,129 --> 00:30:05,484
Then how come
you've been avoiding me?

467
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:08,447
And don't give me that crap about
being too busy, because I know better.

468
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,198
I know what you're
going through, Prue.

469
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:13,564
I lost him too, you know?

470
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:15,767
I know.

471
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:20,128
- It's just been so hard to...
- What?

472
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,844
To face you after what happened.

473
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:24,522
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

474
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:25,883
Darryl...

475
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:31,567
I need to know what Andy told you
about me and my sisters.

476
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:37,765
- About who we really are.
- Just that you were involved in...

477
00:30:38,209 --> 00:30:40,120
...some of our unsolved cases.

478
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:43,518
And that you somehow
helped stop the killers.

479
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,003
That's it? Nothing else?

480
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:51,248
He was my partner, Prue.
I didn't need to know anything else.

481
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:57,244
So, then, why did you cover for us
when Andy died at the house?

482
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,642
Because he asked me to.

483
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:04,364
That's why I've been trying
to get ahold of you.

484
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,848
To give you a message from him.

485
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:08,321
That morning after he saw you,

486
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:13,081
Andy told me to tell you that if anything
were to happen to him...

487
00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:18,086
...that it wouldn't be your fault.
He didn't want you to blame yourself.

488
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:20,123
Too late.

489
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:32,527
You really think that's the window?

490
00:31:32,689 --> 00:31:35,522
You said yourself, the triquetra's
the key, our connection.

491
00:31:35,689 --> 00:31:38,123
And besides, we keep hearing Grams
say "the power of three."

492
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:40,166
This is what that stands for.

493
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:42,968
Either that or I just screwed up
this wall for no reason.

494
00:31:43,129 --> 00:31:45,279
Well even if it is the window,
if Prue doesn't show up...

495
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:46,677
She'll show.

496
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:49,764
Better late than never, right?

497
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:52,807
Look, I know that I haven't exactly
been myself lately.

498
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:56,041
And I know that I'm
going through something.

499
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:59,519
And that I have some things
to work through.

500
00:31:59,689 --> 00:32:01,520
But I don't want
to let you down because of it.

501
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:04,883
Right now it's not about me,
it's about us.

502
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:07,520
Attagirl, Prue.
I knew you'd come around.

503
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:12,120
- Excuse me?
- Well, I did deep down.

504
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,121
Are you sure you're up for this?

505
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:21,564
I'm sure.

506
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:24,122
Okay, so when
the window opens,

507
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:26,086
Prue, you'll knock Abraxas away
from the book

508
00:32:26,249 --> 00:32:28,046
so Piper and I
can reach in and grab it.

509
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:29,722
Then, while you're
holding him back...

510
00:32:29,889 --> 00:32:31,845
You'll find a spell
to vanquish him, I got it.

511
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:35,919
- Okay.
- Okay.

512
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:38,523
We have to create a circle.

513
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:43,638
Three, two, one.

514
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:48,921
Hold on.

515
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,602
Now, Prue, now!

516
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:56,922
First the book, then you.

517
00:32:57,089 --> 00:33:00,445
- What's the matter with you?
- Prue, use your power.

518
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:02,678
Prue.

519
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:34,882
- Prue, what happened up there?
- Nothing.

520
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:37,802
Yeah, "nothing" is exactly the problem.

521
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:41,240
I never said that I had the power
to go against him. You did, remember?

522
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:43,764
- No, the Book of Shadows did.
- Well, maybe it was wrong.

523
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:45,681
Maybe Abraxas is just too strong.

524
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:47,919
Maybe. But that doesn't explain
why you hesitated.

525
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:50,364
- I didn't hesitate.
- The hell you didn't, Prue.

526
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,121
- I saw you.
- We both saw you.

527
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:55,087
So, what are you saying?
This is my fault, is that it?

528
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:59,720
- Because I can't defeat Abraxas?
- No, Prue, you can. You just won't.

529
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:02,323
Okay, something is holding you back.
Something big time.

530
00:34:02,489 --> 00:34:04,878
And instead of facing it,
you are running from it.

531
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:06,801
- Phoebe...
- But you can't keep running, Prue.

532
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:09,803
Because you have got to figure out
what your problem is,

533
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:11,203
otherwise we're all dead.

534
00:34:11,689 --> 00:34:14,157
Yeah, that's right, Phoebe.
It's my responsibility, isn't it?

535
00:34:15,529 --> 00:34:19,238
The oldest sister, always supposed
to be able to figure things out.

536
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:23,879
Well, if that's the case,
then how come I couldn't save Andy?

537
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:29,757
If I'm supposed to be so powerful,
how come I couldn't save him?

538
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:35,642
I mean, my God,
don't you understand?

539
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:38,528
Andy died because of me.

540
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:42,887
It doesn't matter what he said,
it was my fault.

541
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:45,884
How can it be good to be witches

542
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:48,609
if all it does is
get the people we love killed?

543
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,925
Sweetie.

544
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:05,163
Prue, it's not your fault.

545
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:08,480
You tried to keep Andy from
coming here that night, remember?

546
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,327
You tried to warn him,
but he came anyway.

547
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:11,842
He came because he wanted to.

548
00:35:12,049 --> 00:35:15,007
And there was nothing that
you could have done to stop him, Prue.

549
00:35:15,169 --> 00:35:18,525
He chose to walk through that door
not because of who you are, honey,

550
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:22,602
- but because of who he was.
- Protector of the innocent, just like us.

551
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:27,405
I just don't know
if I believe in it anymore.

552
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:33,524
Honey, we've done a lot of good
as witches too. You know that.

553
00:35:34,729 --> 00:35:38,324
You know, but that doesn't mean that
bad things still aren't gonna happen.

554
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:42,646
But just because we can't help that,
that doesn't mean that it's our fault.

555
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:46,438
Or yours.

556
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:50,644
Come here.

557
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:59,642
The power of three.

558
00:36:01,169 --> 00:36:04,684
- Okay, did you guys hear that?
- Grams.

559
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:07,164
The power of three.

560
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:08,842
How is that possible?

561
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:12,207
I don't know, but it's gotta be a good
thing if we're all hearing it, right?

562
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:16,328
- Maybe it means we're connected.
- To be as one.

563
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:19,401
Maybe that's what the book meant
by the power of one.

564
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:23,960
- The three of us working as one.
- That's what the triquetra represents.

565
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:26,608
Almost sunrise.

566
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:29,280
Do you think you're ready
to try the window again?

567
00:36:29,449 --> 00:36:31,360
Yeah. Yeah, but...

568
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:33,679
Abraxas will be ready for us here.

569
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:36,443
We have to take him by surprise,
go where we're the most powerful,

570
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:38,247
where we're the most connected.

571
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:48,362
Hear now the words of the witches
The secrets we hid in the night

572
00:36:48,529 --> 00:36:52,966
The oldest of gods are invoked here
The great work of magic is sought

573
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:05,399
In this night and in this hour
We call upon the ancient power

574
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:16,080
- Hear now the words of the witches
- The secrets we hid in the night

575
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:20,003
The oldest of gods are invoked here
The great work of magic is sought

576
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:30,167
- Prue, Piper.
- Keep chanting.

577
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:33,924
Hear now the words of the witches
The secrets we hid in the night

578
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:37,203
What are you doing?
How'd you bring me here?

579
00:37:37,649 --> 00:37:39,844
- The oldest of gods are invoked
- I will destroy you.

580
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:41,647
Where the great work
of magic is sought

581
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:45,404
In this night and in the hour
We call upon the ancient power

582
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:49,926
In this night and in this hour
We call upon the ancient power

583
00:37:50,129 --> 00:37:54,964
In this night and in this hour
We call upon the ancient power

584
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:03,280
And we didn't even have to get naked.

585
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:12,445
That's more like it.

586
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:14,600
I'll feel better
when we erase that window.

587
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:16,327
I don't want more demons
coming through.

588
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:18,684
They can't,
it's our window, not theirs.

589
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:20,965
Still, better safe than sorry.

590
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:24,844
Especially if we can expect any more
demons like Abraxas coming.

591
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:26,237
Well, apparently we can.

592
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:30,038
"Rite of passage.
Fight it with the power of one or else...

593
00:38:30,649 --> 00:38:33,368
...a more powerful evil that awaits
will destroy you."

594
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:36,202
Wow, I'm glad I didn't finish
reading that yesterday.

595
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:39,361
I'd have changed my mind about
not wanting to give up our powers.

596
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:41,042
No, you wouldn't have.

597
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:43,848
You like being a witch
too much, Phoebe.

598
00:38:44,009 --> 00:38:46,125
And you helped remind me
that I like being one too.

599
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:52,847
Hey, me three.
Too bad it doesn't pay the bills though.

600
00:38:53,609 --> 00:38:55,327
Did you get it?

601
00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:58,241
Get what?

602
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:01,767
What's this?

603
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:06,723
Sixty thousand dollars?

604
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:09,800
- Where did you get this?
- Home-equity loan.

605
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:12,244
We took a second out on the house
to help buy your club.

606
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:14,081
- Actually, our club, technically.
- Right.

607
00:39:14,249 --> 00:39:16,843
As long as you don't mind
being partners with your sisters.

608
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:19,887
Thank you.

609
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:24,040
The power of three.

610
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:27,603
Grams?

611
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:38,283
Hello, my darlings.
Oh, it's nice to see you.

612
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:41,003
Or rather, it's nice
being seen by you.

613
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:43,808
- But...? But how is this...?
- Possible?

614
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:45,402
All things are possible, my dear,

615
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:47,924
it's just simply a matter of your
being able to do them.

616
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:51,126
Wait, so you're the one that keeps
turning the pages in the book?

617
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,439
Just my way of looking after you.

618
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:55,167
As best I can, anyway.

619
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:58,808
Don't try to understand this.
You're not ready yet.

620
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:01,878
But the fact
that you could hear me before,

621
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:05,519
can see me now,
means that someday you might be.

622
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:09,046
Be good to each other.

623
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:12,807
I love you.

624
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:30,518
Is it just me, or is this attic
getting awfully crowded lately?

625
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:31,963
Look.
