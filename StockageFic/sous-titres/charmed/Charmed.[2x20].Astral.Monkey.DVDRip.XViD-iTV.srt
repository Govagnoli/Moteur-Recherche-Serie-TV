1
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:09,162
- Good morning.
- Hey, Pheebs.

2
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:10,887
Did you get the postcard from Dan?

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,041
Yeah, it sounds like
he's having a great time.

4
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:17,359
What's the matter,
is something wrong?

5
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:19,838
I got another letter
from Dr Williamson.

6
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,522
Williamson? Wasn't he the specialist
that treated you for Oroya fever?

7
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:26,601
That would be him.

8
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:28,248
That was months ago.
What does he want?

9
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:32,398
He wants me to come in for blood work
so he can make sure I'm cured.

10
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:35,840
An angel brought you back to life.
Trust me, you're cured.

11
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:37,880
I know, but I can't exactly
tell him that.

12
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,438
- So just throw the letter away.
- I have been. He keeps sending more.

13
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:46,077
Here's my granola.
What's it doing in the trash?

14
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:47,642
I just bought this two days ago.

15
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:52,081
- Who eats this besides me?
- Leo. But I'll replace it, I promise.

16
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,079
Piper, I don't want you to think
I mind, because I don't.

17
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:05,799
But if Leo's gonna be
living here, then I...

18
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:08,967
I think we should probably set
some ground rules, you know?

19
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,608
Leo doesn't live here.

20
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:12,448
He eats breakfast here.

21
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:16,358
- A lot.
- Maybe he just likes cereal.

22
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:20,282
You really think he's here that much?

23
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,320
He's like the big brother
I never wanted.

24
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:27,367
I mean, had.

25
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,208
Morning. Pheebs...

26
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,122
...Evan Stone, ever hear of him?
- Hello.

27
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:36,518
Red Death? I've only seen that movie,
like, five times.

28
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,920
Yes, I know. I'm doing a photo shoot
with him today.

29
00:01:40,089 --> 00:01:41,363
How much do I hate you right now?

30
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,046
Unless the tabloid rumours are true,
in which case, I really hate you.

31
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:46,801
He is supposed to be...

32
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:48,802
I do not wanna know
anything about him,

33
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:50,482
I just wanna take his picture
and leave.

34
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:52,207
And I need to go get ready.

35
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:57,122
Prue, you don't think
Leo lives here, do you?

36
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:00,440
I mean, yeah, of course he does,
but, I mean, it's fine. It's...

37
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:03,159
As long as you're happy,
that's all I really care about.

38
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,244
Not that I was unhappy when I saw
Leo all naked in the shower

39
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:10,400
and just all... wet.

40
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:13,442
Okay, so you guys just need
to make up some ground rules,

41
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:16,083
you know, what's acceptable
and not acceptable,

42
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:19,207
and... I'm serious.

43
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:34,168
Of course I got your memo.
You can't be serious.

44
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:35,358
Have you read my report?

45
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:39,163
Ninety days ago, Piper Halliwell
was admitted with Oroya fever.

46
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:41,479
Within 24 hours,
she was completely free of the virus,

47
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:43,605
though she failed to respond
to any of the treatments.

48
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:46,084
Dr Williamson, I may be new
to San Francisco Memorial,

49
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,319
but I am very aware of your project.

50
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:50,520
Then you're also aware of the fact
that her recovery

51
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:52,327
- makes no clinical sense.
- True.

52
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,845
But your subsequent tests failed
to reveal anything out of the ordinary.

53
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:58,609
Look, I just need more time.
I've only injected the primates

54
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,760
with samples of
the Halliwells' blood this morning.

55
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:03,364
Piper Halliwell is fine.

56
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:06,367
I want you to forget about her and
concentrate on people who are sick.

57
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:08,764
I am. Somewhere in this blood
could be the key

58
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:10,521
to unlocking a universal antibody.

59
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:13,482
And if I agreed with you, we wouldn't
be having this conversation.

60
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:15,964
- You will not terminate this project.
- Dr Williamson,

61
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,960
I believe I already have.

62
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,206
I am not giving up.

63
00:03:57,649 --> 00:04:00,322
All right, Prue.
Let's see how this affects you.

64
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:47,163
I said, be quiet!

65
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:02,159
- I have some time between appoint...
- Wait.

66
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:05,042
Dr Jeffries?

67
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:12,325
So I thought we might discuss...

68
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:14,400
How did you get over there?

69
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,765
- What happened in here?
- I had an accident.

70
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:22,602
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

71
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:25,960
- What happened to your neck?
- Nothing.

72
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:28,404
Listen, I need to get ahold
of the Halliwells immediately.

73
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:31,123
I told you that project's
been terminated.

74
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:34,401
Maybe you should take some time off.
You've been under a lot of pressure.

75
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:36,361
And I understand
your sister's been sick.

76
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,089
And I told you I need to get ahold
of the Halliwells immediately.

77
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:44,888
I want you cleared out of this lab
by the end of the day.

78
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:04,524
Get the PA to do it.

79
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:13,168
- Can you give me a hand with this?
- All right.

80
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:18,282
Tell him to get back here, all right?
I'm tired of waiting.

81
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,162
- Evan Stone?
- Yes?

82
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:28,599
Hi, I think we have a date.

83
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:33,648
I'm Prue Halliwell, 415 Magazine.

84
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:36,528
Ring security. I think I found
another tabloid photographer.

85
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,682
Me? No, I am not with a tabloid.

86
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,483
I'm with 415.

87
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:45,008
- I have an appointment.
- Sorry.

88
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:47,080
We've had photographers
sneaking in here all week.

89
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:50,440
That's why I'm here.
I'm Lucy, Evan's publicist.

90
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:54,402
And this is a temporary ID.

91
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:56,480
- This could be a problem.
- Yeah, that's because

92
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:59,004
I'm a new employee of the magazine.
You can call Gil Corso,

93
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:00,801
I'm sure he'd be happy to confirm it.

94
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:02,727
I'll keep an eye on her
while you do that.

95
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:05,842
Okay?

96
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:11,286
So, what happens if Mr Corso
is in a meeting?

97
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,043
What, you send me flying
with a tenchi nage kick?

98
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:16,319
I have an earth throw.
You know aikido.

99
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:19,647
Yeah, well, it comes in...

100
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:21,800
...handy with my line of work.

101
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,204
The photography business
must be rougher than I thought.

102
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,206
Only when publicists
don't trust temporary IDs.

103
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,561
Lucy's a really cool person.

104
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:33,687
Newly promoted, just struggling
to control her new power, that's all.

105
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:36,524
Yeah, I can certainly relate to that.

106
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:51,923
Ever done it on a cloud?

107
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:53,681
I don't know,
does a feather bed count?

108
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:57,285
- Phoebe. I thought you were Piper.
- Well, it is her room.

109
00:08:57,449 --> 00:09:00,088
- I am so sorry.
- No. No worries.

110
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,843
I mean, it could happen to anyone,
especially someone

111
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,603
that doesn't have to knock
to come in, you know?

112
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:08,927
You're so right.
But this will never happen again.

113
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:11,444
- You have my word.
- Okay. And you have my word

114
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:13,361
that I won't tell Piper.

115
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:16,399
Good idea.

116
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:19,761
I'm just leaving now.

117
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:22,760
- She's in the kitchen.
- Thanks.

118
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:35,278
Item number two:

119
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,521
Orbing in unannounced.

120
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:41,567
You're calling me at home?

121
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:44,766
Yes, Ms Halliwell. I need you to meet
me at my lab as soon as possible.

122
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:47,045
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Look, you don't understand.

123
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:49,279
- This is very important.
- Goodbye, doctor.

124
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:51,241
Look, I need your...

125
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,681
Piper?

126
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:07,319
Leo, hi.

127
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:10,049
- Everything okay?
- I don't know.

128
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,484
That was Dr Williamson.
He's been sending me letters,

129
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,209
trying to get me back to the hospital
for follow-up tests.

130
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:17,564
And I'm not going.

131
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:20,448
What are you doing here? Don't tell
me there's a demon running around.

132
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:23,567
No. I just figured
since it was your day off,

133
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:26,118
maybe you could spend it with me.

134
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:30,919
- Did you, now?
- Yes, I did.

135
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:36,927
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah.

136
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:38,920
I mean, it's not like
he's ever gonna figure out

137
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:41,728
that you were the one who saved me,
so I'm not gonna worry about it

138
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:44,039
because there's nothing
to worry about.

139
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:49,561
- Ms Halliwell?
- No, this is Nurse Jordan,

140
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:52,368
your sister's nurse.
I was wondering if you could...

141
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,079
- Is she okay?
- You need to get to your sister's room

142
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:58,764
- as soon as possible.
- I'll be right there.

143
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:17,848
Can you just lift your chin a little bit?
Because there's a shadow.

144
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,082
Thanks.

145
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:31,764
- What a cute monkey.
- Monkey?

146
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:33,960
Yeah, he's right behind you.

147
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:38,205
What are you talking about?

148
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:41,207
Okay, thanks.

149
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,877
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, I'm finished.

150
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:47,126
- We just got started.
- Right, and...

151
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,484
...I got a great shot,
it was perfect.

152
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:56,921
Ms Halliwell.

153
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:00,767
Your car keys.

154
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:15,528
You can shoot my picture
anytime, Ms Halliwell.

155
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:17,566
Thank you.

156
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,728
Hey, you are never going to believe
what happened today.

157
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:28,119
Yes, I will. I saw Notting Hill.

158
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:30,480
What are you talking about?

159
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,605
They're from Evan.

160
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:37,159
I hope you're happy.
You're stealing away my dream man.

161
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:41,004
"Prue, what really happened? Evan."

162
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:43,848
- Something happened?
- Yes, but not with Evan Stone.

163
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:44,998
Is Piper here?

164
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:47,325
Yeah, she's in the living room
with Leo, again.

165
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:50,367
Piper, Leo.

166
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:52,440
So are you gonna tell me
why he sent you flowers?

167
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:54,645
You know, I just have no idea.

168
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:57,997
And they say the youngest
is the most naive.

169
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:02,361
- Prue, you're back early.
- Yes, I am.

170
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:07,643
That's because a monkey
astral-projected to me on the set today.

171
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:09,441
A monkey?

172
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:14,448
- Astral-projected?
- Yeah, and it waved at me, okay?

173
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:16,998
Like it knew me or something.
I think it wanted my help.

174
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:19,882
Honey, I think you're working
way too hard.

175
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,880
You know, Phoebe, I saw it.

176
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:27,486
Okay, and it... And it had, like, an
ID bracelet from a hospital on its arm.

177
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:31,518
Prue, honey, I don't think
monkeys can astral-project.

178
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:34,920
- Can they?
- Not without powers.

179
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:37,125
And it would have to have
your power too, you know,

180
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:38,927
to find you, magic to magic.

181
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:42,201
My power? How can it have
my power? I have my powers.

182
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:46,204
All right, wait. So you're saying
that a monkey is sharing my powers?

183
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:48,208
Is that even possible?

184
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:50,525
After all you've seen and done
over the last two years?

185
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:52,486
You tell me what's impossible.

186
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:56,282
You said something
about a hospital wristband?

187
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,083
Yeah, it had a rose on it.

188
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:07,599
Did it look anything like this?

189
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:12,400
Yeah, exactly like this.

190
00:14:12,609 --> 00:14:14,486
Wait, is this
the same Dr Williamson?

191
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:17,278
Yeah, he's been
sending me requests for weeks,

192
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:20,088
and he called this morning
and said he wanted to see me.

193
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:22,359
- What?
- Wait, you didn't tell me he called you.

194
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:25,402
Well, there was nothing to say.
I hung up on him.

195
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:28,727
Do you think he found out
about our powers?

196
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:31,885
B. O.S.

197
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:34,688
B. O.S. Oh, Book of Shadows,
Book of Shadows.

198
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:43,078
- They say it's important.
- Okay.

199
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,479
- Come back soon.
- Okay.

200
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:55,407
My wife is dying.

201
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:57,446
She's 33rd on the wait list, Curtis.

202
00:14:57,609 --> 00:15:00,248
She's not gonna live long enough
to get a kidney.

203
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:02,684
There's nothing I can do,
Larry. I'm sorry.

204
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:05,483
No, no. Let me tell you
what's sorry, okay?

205
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:09,403
Look, I come here every day,
and for every minute that I'm with her,

206
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:14,085
some scumbag criminal is freed,
released on a technicality.

207
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,599
Curtis, listen to me.
She is your sister.

208
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:21,208
Isn't there anything you can do?

209
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,522
Larry, wait.

210
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:35,642
Oh, my God.

211
00:15:35,849 --> 00:15:37,202
Get the crash team, get a gurney.

212
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,007
This man's gonna have
a heart attack.

213
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:41,721
- I said, the crash team.
- Yes, sir.

214
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:47,600
If anyone looks like
they're gonna collapse, it's you, not...

215
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,087
Come on, let's go. Let's get in here.

216
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:56,162
Get his leg. Got him? All right,
give me two cc of adrenaline.

217
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:58,684
- How did you know?
- He's gone into full arrest.

218
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:01,198
- Check his airway. Bag him.
- Is an IV started?

219
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:03,246
- What's his pulse?
- 90/60, doctor.

220
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:04,848
Let's start compressions.

221
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:08,922
Listen, I'll save Edie too. I promise.

222
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:11,125
- You gotta get it up.
- Give me that lidocaine.

223
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:16,649
I need a list of all the criminals
who were admitted and released

224
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,208
from the hospital jail ward.

225
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:20,087
Now.

226
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:35,558
Wow, what a mess.

227
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,878
Well, too bad we can't ask them
where Williamson is.

228
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:43,923
- That's the same monkey.
- It does look like it knows you.

229
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:51,200
Okay, it looks like
they know all of us. Come on.

230
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:58,481
He named them after us.

231
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,685
That's really scary.

232
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:04,079
All right, we need to
take a look around

233
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:06,968
and make sure there's
nothing else here that could expose us.

234
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:10,842
Well, maybe that's why the monkey
projected to you, Prue.

235
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:12,647
Maybe she was trying to warn you.

236
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,361
- All of these files say "Halliwell."
- Yeah, well, look at all these tests

237
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:21,123
that he took. Okay, and not just
on blood that he took from you,

238
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:23,081
but blood that he took
from Phoebe and me.

239
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:24,841
He has spent months
trying to figure out

240
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:26,965
how I survived the Oroya fever.

241
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,962
Yeah, well, this grant request
says that he's searching

242
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:32,802
for the universal antibody.

243
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:37,367
Maybe he thought
it was in your blood.

244
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,157
Piper, Phoebe.

245
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:51,402
Okay, so I think it's safe to say
that Dr Williamson

246
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:52,797
probably knows about us.

247
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:56,325
Do you think he's been injecting
our blood into those monkeys?

248
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:58,480
I don't know, but we need
to get them out of here

249
00:17:58,689 --> 00:18:00,919
before somebody walks in,
sees something flying,

250
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:02,761
and everybody finds out about us.

251
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:21,884
Okay, not only does Williamson
know about our powers,

252
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:23,767
but he's got
one of them: Telekinesis.

253
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:26,518
Wait a minute. You remember
what he was like when I was sick.

254
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,408
He had the CDC here, the media.
If we don't stop him,

255
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:31,878
the monkeys aren't gonna be
the only ones in cages.

256
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:44,839
Well, it seems as though
you've stiffed me 30 hits.

257
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:46,965
Oh, you know what?
Let me tell you something.

258
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:49,689
I don't touch this stuff, all right?
I just sell it...

259
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:53,518
You Benny Ritter?

260
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:56,518
What are you doing?
That's my door, man.

261
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:04,366
- What the hell is this?
- House call.

262
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,078
Man, I gotta get up.

263
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,120
No. No, no.

264
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:49,285
- Okay, Piper, now.
- Wait.

265
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:53,641
A Showbiz Tonight exclusive.

266
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:56,198
Who is this mystery woman
in Evan Stone's life?

267
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:59,759
Why did he send her flowers?
Tune in tonight and find out.

268
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:01,641
I thought you said nothing happened.

269
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,084
Yeah, he was just returning
my car keys.

270
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:05,682
Hi. Hello, bigger problems.

271
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:07,562
It was more than a miracle.

272
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:10,482
It was as if he was clairvoyant.

273
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:13,678
He said his brother-in-law
was going to have a heart attack,

274
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:15,521
and ten seconds later, he collapsed.

275
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,601
And he could tell that
just by looking at him?

276
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:19,760
No, he touched him first.

277
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:23,080
I'll take premonitions
for 500, Alex.

278
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:27,240
Excuse me. I'm a patient
of Dr Williamson.

279
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:29,883
- Do you know where I might find him?
- The records room.

280
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:31,966
Okay, thank you.

281
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:33,966
So he's using our powers in public.

282
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:37,360
- At least he's not hurting anyone.
- Yet.

283
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:45,160
Williamson's long gone.

284
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:48,526
Wait, he came in here for a reason.

285
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:58,683
It's a list of names and addresses
of people who were admitted

286
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,487
into the jail ward in the hospital.

287
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:02,002
Benny Ritter is highlighted.

288
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:14,167
Accessed by Dr C. Williamson.

289
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,960
I've taken care of everything.

290
00:21:19,129 --> 00:21:21,245
You're going to be okay.

291
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:24,321
A lot of people are gonna be okay.

292
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:34,599
Get my sister prepped and ready
for a kidney transplant.

293
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:37,199
Tissue typing and cross matching
are confirmed.

294
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,127
Unrelated living donor,
but an exact match.

295
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:42,241
No questions. Do it. Now.

296
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:14,569
Should I be afraid to ask what
you're doing in this part of town?

297
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:16,600
We're not sure. What happened?

298
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,727
Some lowlife named Benny Ritter
had a kidney removed.

299
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:22,006
Not that he could tell us.
He was found sedated.

300
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:24,165
- Who is he?
- Drug dealer.

301
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:26,160
Busted last week,
out on a technicality.

302
00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:27,963
Any idea who did it?

303
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:30,524
Med tech said whoever gutted him
stitched him up,

304
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:35,086
left a note, something about internal
sutures secure, morphine for pain.

305
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:37,525
- He left a note?
- Yeah, we'll definitely be looking

306
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,078
- for somebody with medical training.
- You can't.

307
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:44,118
I had a feeling you were gonna say
something like that.

308
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:48,168
- Want to tell me why?
- Only that it's supernatural.

309
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,081
I can't really tell them that.

310
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:53,161
It's the best we can do
for now, Darryl.

311
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:56,243
You're the one that said you didn't
wanna know what we were into.

312
00:22:56,449 --> 00:22:58,280
But I suppose you want me
to keep you posted?

313
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:01,322
Yes, but more importantly,
just be careful.

314
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:07,645
So much for not hurting anybody.

315
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:10,721
Yeah, well, we have to find him
before the cops do.

316
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:15,161
Piper.

317
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:18,799
I keep thinking if I had
just answered one of his letters...

318
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:33,802
Mr Corso, you know
that I am not Evan Stone's girlfriend.

319
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:38,322
Are you laughing at me?

320
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:40,485
Could somebody please help me?

321
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:43,840
- Hi.
- There is nothing in here

322
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:45,806
about mortals or animals
having powers,

323
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,442
let alone how to get the powers
out of them.

324
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:50,004
We will find something, Piper.

325
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:54,361
Okay, when? Because Dr Williamson
has already stole someone's kidney,

326
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:56,360
and what's gonna be next?

327
00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:00,363
I can explain everything,
just not now. Okay, bye.

328
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:04,357
- Except for the magic monkey part?
- No, I thought I'd leave that part out.

329
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:08,125
- What's that?
- Oh, my God.

330
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:11,440
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
It's photographers.

331
00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:14,562
They're everywhere on the lawn.

332
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,839
Okay, close the curtains.

333
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:19,199
Okay. Hi.

334
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:20,888
God.

335
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:24,167
There are more coming.

336
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:25,802
I'll be right there. More coming.

337
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:28,682
- Do you think they saw anything?
- Yeah, like stolen monkeys.

338
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:32,522
Who knows, but at least
they didn't see any magic.

339
00:24:35,449 --> 00:24:37,519
Never mind.

340
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:39,881
Sorry.

341
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,562
I'll ask later.

342
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:46,603
Right now, I've got some bad news
about Dr Williamson.

343
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:49,277
That's the press. They're after Prue.

344
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:57,604
- Thanks.
- So, what's the bad news?

345
00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:00,363
Well, simply put...

346
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:02,441
...Dr Williamson is cosmically screwed.

347
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:05,043
He's got your powers
in his mortal body.

348
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:07,365
And it took generations
to prepare you for that.

349
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:09,440
You can handle it, he can't.

350
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:13,603
- So, what's going to happen to him?
- He'll go mad.

351
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:16,839
- Just from our powers?
- Yes.

352
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,119
Wait, are you saying that our powers
are in our blood

353
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:20,642
and he injected himself with it?

354
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:23,079
That blood, yeah.

355
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:26,446
You see, the spell that you cast
to cure Piper changed everything.

356
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:29,288
And now it's changing
Dr Williamson.

357
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:32,003
Your magic is meant for doing good,
but in the wrong person,

358
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:33,722
somebody not ready for it,

359
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:37,558
- that need to do good things...
- Could go bad?

360
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:39,487
Real bad.

361
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:43,685
Look, Piper, it's nobody's fault, all right?
Dr Williamson chose his own path.

362
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,360
This is not a consequence
of anybody's actions except his own.

363
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:50,447
Still, you have to find a way
to stop him before things get worse.

364
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:53,278
If they haven't already.

365
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:58,847
Okay, I'm gonna make a potion
to separate powers

366
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:00,368
- from witches.
- They're monkeys.

367
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:03,367
With witches' blood.
I don't know what else to do.

368
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:06,242
And maybe if it works on them,
it'll work on Williamson.

369
00:26:06,449 --> 00:26:09,043
All right, I gotta figure out a way
to get rid of these reporters,

370
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:12,804
otherwise we can't do anything and
figure out a way to go talk to Evan.

371
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,601
I'm gonna go call Morris.

372
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,242
He needs to know
what he's up against.

373
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,764
If only to keep yourself
from being exposed as witches.

374
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:22,966
- Yeah, that too.
- Piper, I'm gonna need your help.

375
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:32,408
Thank you.

376
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:35,363
You okay?

377
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:38,407
Well, considering our powers have
combined to drive a man crazy

378
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:41,481
and have put who knows
how many other people in danger...

379
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,529
...l'm terrific.

380
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:57,125
And cut.

381
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:00,247
Terrific, guys, print that.

382
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:05,562
Hi. Okay, I might hurt you.

383
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:06,923
Evan.

384
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:10,559
My front yard is filled
with photographers.

385
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,321
Okay? They are watching
my every move.

386
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:14,520
Come on. It'll blow over.

387
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:16,281
You're a normal,
red-blooded American girl

388
00:27:16,449 --> 00:27:17,768
with nothing to hide, right?

389
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:21,160
Right, but I can't really do my job

390
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:24,048
with flashbulbs going off in my face
every single second.

391
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:25,477
You can't fight back.

392
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:27,880
That's like struggling in quicksand.

393
00:27:28,569 --> 00:27:30,560
Don't play.

394
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:33,323
Whatever energy they're throwing
at you, just pass right on by.

395
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:35,520
Because eventually
that energy comes back around,

396
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:37,808
leads them to someone else.

397
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:40,487
Yeah.

398
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:44,722
Okay, I really appreciate
the whole "wax on, wax off" approach,

399
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:47,357
but couldn't your people just issue
some kind of a statement?

400
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:50,129
What, are you kidding me?
They're working the bad-boy image.

401
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:52,681
Evan, please.

402
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:57,443
You got a cell phone?

403
00:27:57,649 --> 00:27:59,287
Of course I do.

404
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:02,401
- Who are you calling?
- Celebrity Peep Shows.

405
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:05,925
They all use tipsters to tell them
what's going on, who's doing who.

406
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:09,767
And I'm a tipster.
Code name: Julius.

407
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,005
Hello, this is Julius.

408
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:16,878
Evan Stone and his new girlfriend
are at the Bayview sound stage.

409
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:18,448
They're going off to dinner.

410
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:20,844
Hurry down there
if you want to catch them.

411
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:23,721
I'd say you got 15 minutes
to get out of here.

412
00:28:23,889 --> 00:28:27,006
- You know you're gonna get trampled.
- I'll handle it.

413
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:29,637
I'll just tell them I dumped you.

414
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:34,919
- I'm a bad boy, remember?
- Sure you are.

415
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,922
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You deserve them.

416
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:41,047
Along with that quiet, normal life
you seem to want so badly.

417
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:43,887
Thanks.

418
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:55,399
You're a very bad man,
Mr McNamara.

419
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:58,129
Selling guns to children.

420
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:01,758
How truly heartless of you.

421
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:09,043
Prue must've done something
to light a fire under those idiots.

422
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:10,562
They're leaving.

423
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:12,521
Good.

424
00:29:12,689 --> 00:29:14,281
- Which one is that?
- Number eight.

425
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:16,280
I combined two
separation-of-power spells

426
00:29:16,449 --> 00:29:19,839
with a human-from-animal
extraction spell.

427
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:22,605
Okay, I have no idea
what you just said.

428
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:24,208
I'm getting the us out of them.

429
00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:27,208
And if it works, then hopefully
we'll find Dr Williamson.

430
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:30,079
- First things first.
- Right.

431
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:34,368
Okay.

432
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:39,279
Okay. Prue monkey, still hungry?

433
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:41,207
Look.

434
00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:50,289
- What was that?
- A delayed reaction.

435
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:53,401
- Phoebe, I think you did it.
- I did do it.

436
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:59,280
Okay. Here, I'll get it.

437
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:11,241
Tell me again I'm not hunting
down some demonic son of a bitch.

438
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:15,084
Darryl, I told you when I called,
he's a human being.

439
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:17,763
With a supernatural talent
for butchery.

440
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:21,359
In the past four hours,
this Dr Williamson has dropped off

441
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,645
two more coolers at hospitals,
and he's not bothering

442
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:25,959
to stitch up his victims anymore.

443
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:28,324
- He's killing people?
- Yes.

444
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:33,686
- Tell me where to find him.
- I don't know.

445
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:35,328
We've staked out all the hospitals,

446
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:37,957
but somehow he's getting in,
dropping off his gifts

447
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,359
and getting out
without anybody seeing him.

448
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,522
He's using your powers, isn't he?

449
00:30:42,689 --> 00:30:45,726
Yes, but we found a way to stop him.

450
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:49,604
- Not if I stop him first.
- Darryl, don't kill him.

451
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:52,086
Have you been listening to me?

452
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:53,921
He may not give me a choice.

453
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:58,718
The two people he killed,
Frank McNamara and Arlen Jackson,

454
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:02,518
they're criminals.
But nobody deserves to die like that.

455
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:05,639
If you try to stop him, he will kill you.

456
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:21,405
McNamara.

457
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:29,441
Phoebe, Leo.

458
00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:34,205
We have to call Prue.

459
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:35,683
I know where Williamson is.

460
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:45,161
Bobbie, it's been busy
while I was gone.

461
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:47,684
You got a buyer for these?
Because I met somebody in County

462
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:49,965
that might be able
to move them for you.

463
00:31:50,129 --> 00:31:51,687
Bobbie.

464
00:31:55,489 --> 00:31:57,684
Was that his name?

465
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:05,406
Get out of here now.

466
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:13,799
- Dr Williamson.
- Piper.

467
00:32:14,449 --> 00:32:17,168
Listen to me, you're sick.
You're doing terrible things.

468
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:20,721
- I'm saving lives.
- No, you're hurting people.

469
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:22,368
Piper, be careful.

470
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,606
We have medicine for you.
We think it might help.

471
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:30,729
You know, I really have you to thank
for all of this.

472
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:32,242
I couldn't do it without you.

473
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:35,844
Don't say that.

474
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:37,806
Here.

475
00:32:38,009 --> 00:32:39,806
Take this, it'll make you better.

476
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,084
Piper.

477
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:06,605
- We wanna help you.
- I don't want your help.

478
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:10,920
I'm doing great things.
I'm saving lives.

479
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,317
I got a lot of work to do.

480
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:17,806
Okay, well,
then this is for the monkeys.

481
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:21,241
And this is for my sister.

482
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:50,364
- Any luck?
- No, and I can't figure out

483
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,518
another way to find him.

484
00:33:51,689 --> 00:33:53,839
All I have to do is locate him
through his powers.

485
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:55,687
Yeah, but his powers
are our powers.

486
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:58,881
Right, exactly. So the crystal
keeps circling our street,

487
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:00,966
and I keep finding us.

488
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:03,200
Okay, keep trying.

489
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,689
Guys, we need to talk about
what we're gonna do.

490
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,481
What do you mean?
I thought we had a plan.

491
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:11,877
I mean, we have the elixir.

492
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:14,558
No, not anymore. He trashed it.

493
00:34:15,249 --> 00:34:18,559
- So we'll make more.
- With what? I have nothing left to use.

494
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:21,762
And the only shop that carries
what I need closed four hours ago.

495
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:25,166
And even if I made more elixir, Piper,
we'd never get it into him.

496
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:28,918
- He's much stronger than we are.
- Guys, he was my doctor.

497
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:31,922
- He tried to save my life, remember?
- He could've killed us, Piper.

498
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:34,484
- But he didn't.
- No, but he might be out there

499
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:36,207
right now trying to kill someone else.

500
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:39,159
Look, we need to face the fact
that he's one innocent

501
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:42,082
- that we might not be able to save.
- But he needs help.

502
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:44,367
I know that, honey.

503
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:46,765
Okay, then.
So, what are you suggesting?

504
00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:50,568
You guys wanna vanquish him?

505
00:34:53,249 --> 00:34:56,798
You can't be serious. He's not
a demon, he's a human being.

506
00:34:57,169 --> 00:34:59,319
Not anymore.

507
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:03,084
But... Okay. We can't use our powers
to punish anyway. You know that.

508
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,799
Piper, we're not punishing, all right?
We're saving lives.

509
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:07,448
All you have to do is freeze him.

510
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:10,368
And then what? You're gonna move
him into the path of an oncoming bus,

511
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:12,087
drop a building on him, kill him?

512
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,405
Leo, tell me you found
something, anything.

513
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,128
Sorry. I don't think there's any way
out of this one.

514
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:24,559
I don't believe this.

515
00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:28,638
I found him.

516
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:51,359
Dr Williamson.

517
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:56,081
We can help you. But you have to stop
hurting people. It's over.

518
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:58,485
If you say so.

519
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,321
Let's get out of here.

520
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:07,241
You should've stayed away.

521
00:36:10,649 --> 00:36:12,844
Okay, Piper, freeze him. Him. Him.

522
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:20,324
- It's not working.
- Whatever you do,

523
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:21,524
do not unfreeze that thing.

524
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:36,401
You know, I'm getting
pretty good at this.

525
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:37,644
Okay, he's really strong.

526
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:39,601
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

527
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:42,078
Piper, you do not let that go, okay?
You do not let that go.

528
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:43,722
Okay, yelling does not help.

529
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:48,162
- Piper, when I tell you to, just let go.
- What?

530
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:50,121
We're done playing around.
Hit the deck, now.

531
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:02,327
No.

532
00:37:04,129 --> 00:37:06,006
Oh, God. Please don't die.

533
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:09,002
Come on. Look at me, come on.

534
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:12,281
Don't do this. Come on.
Come on.

535
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:13,677
Please don't die.

536
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:18,882
Piper, honey.

537
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:23,287
I'm sorry.

538
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:31,199
Bye-bye, files.

539
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:39,281
Well, at least everything's
back to normal...

540
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:42,648
...for us.

541
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:44,447
At least we're safe.

542
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:48,238
- Yeah, what about them?
- Oh, they'll be safe tomorrow

543
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:51,287
when I drop them off
at the wildlife conservatory.

544
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:55,278
Hey, watch this. You guys,
what do you think of evil?

545
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:06,286
- You're gonna miss them, aren't you?
- Yeah.

546
00:38:08,609 --> 00:38:10,645
Hey, we've been wondering
where you've been.

547
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:15,597
You know what?
I have something for you.

548
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:18,084
What is this?

549
00:38:18,249 --> 00:38:20,399
Ground rules, for me.

550
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:25,281
"I want a man
who hates my brand of cereal

551
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:27,605
so there will always
be some for me.

552
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:30,243
A man whose love
will catch me by surprise."

553
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:35,080
- What is this?
- It's a wish list.

554
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:38,485
I hope I find someone
as great as Leo.

555
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:41,919
You deserve the best,
and I think you found it.

556
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:50,166
So you guys don't mind
if he's hanging around a lot?

557
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:52,401
We just want you
to be happy, honey.

558
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:04,878
Piper.

559
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:06,317
Are you okay?

560
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:09,960
His name was Curtis.

561
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:11,728
Whose name was Curtis?

562
00:39:12,649 --> 00:39:14,446
Dr Williamson.

563
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:22,242
I read it in his medical bio.
His first name was Curtis.

564
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:26,846
He never married
because he was working all the time.

565
00:39:27,009 --> 00:39:31,764
Saving lives was more important
to him than having a life of his own.

566
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:36,002
Now his life is over, and I can't help
but feel responsible for that.

567
00:39:36,169 --> 00:39:37,682
We tried to save him.

568
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:40,807
But we didn't.

569
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:42,488
Because we couldn't.

570
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:45,527
I couldn't.

571
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:53,880
Should we...?

572
00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:56,719
No, not this time.
