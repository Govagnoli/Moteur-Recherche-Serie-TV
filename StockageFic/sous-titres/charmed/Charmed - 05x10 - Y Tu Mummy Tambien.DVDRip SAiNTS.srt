1
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,349
The crystal. Where's the crystal?

2
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,142
- It's over there.
- Where?

3
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,269
In the cabinet.

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,027
Got it.

5
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,447
Isis.

6
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:31,907
Isis.

7
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,242
Don't die on me, not yet.

8
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,327
Not until we can
find you another body.

9
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,206
Call upon the witch within.
Use her powers.

10
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,958
I don't have the strength.

11
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,544
Find the strength.

12
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,963
It's the only way.

13
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,131
Okay.

14
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,516
I found one.

15
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,643
Good. Can you tell?

16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,020
Is she powerful enough
to hold your spirit?

17
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,606
I don't know.

18
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,744
Until we meet again, my love.

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,508
Like moths to a flame.

20
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:35,345
Remember, nobody's taken him yet.
So watch your backs, follow my lead.

21
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,805
Any questions?

22
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,390
Let's go.

23
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,584
Police, freeze!

24
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,966
Clear in the bathroom.

25
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,765
All clear in the bedroom.

26
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,480
Everything is locked from the inside.

27
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,482
How did he get out of here?

28
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,317
You don't want to know.

29
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,493
Phoebe Halliwell, please.
Tell her it's Inspector Morris.

30
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,539
It's important.

31
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,223
Piper, my hair is turning white.
Come out, already.

32
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,017
- No.
- Come on, it can't be that bad.

33
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,730
Oh, it's cute.

34
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,398
I don't want to be cute.

35
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,610
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

36
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,655
Your pants weren't even
buttoning any more, come on.

37
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,783
Well, I could have gone up
a size or two.

38
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,244
I don't need to resort to
maternity clothes.

39
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,790
Everything is just so bright
and cheery and "ruffley."

40
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,750
This thing makes me look like a...

41
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,587
Adorable. Absolutely adorable.

42
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,839
I think it's you.

43
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,967
I guess you don't know me
very well, do you?

44
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,385
Piper.

45
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,638
Look, do you have anything
that would go with combat boots?

46
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,265
You know,
something for the mom-to-be

47
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,766
who kicks some ass upon occasion?

48
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,309
You know, something in black

49
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,103
or grey?

50
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,605
I'll check.

51
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,525
Oh, motherhood.

52
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,445
Okay,
explain to me the touching thing.

53
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,407
Why is my stomach
suddenly public property

54
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,701
and perfect strangers
are always touching me?

55
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,703
It's weird space invasion.

56
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,998
- Are you listening?
- No, I'm not.

57
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,249
What's the matter?

58
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,668
It's this cramp.
I've had it for a couple of days.

59
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,961
Why don't you get a massage?

60
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,089
Oh, yeah, I'll pencil that in,
right between vanquishing demons

61
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,549
and training to be your midwife.

62
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,134
No.

63
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,637
Well, A, I don't need midwives
because I'm delivering with a doctor,

64
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,431
not sisters.

65
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,183
And, B, you need to
take care of yourself

66
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,560
because you're working more
than when you were working.

67
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,605
Someone has to pick up the slack,
especially with hermit lady...

68
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,149
...just laying around the house.
- The hermit lady?

69
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:00,068
Yeah, Phoebe. Have you noticed?
She hasn't left the house in weeks.

70
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,362
What do you mean?
She leaves every morning.

71
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,907
No, she leaves the house
to go to work.

72
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,284
I can understand
wanting to take a break from guys,

73
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,703
but come on, already.
She's gonna wear out the batteries.

74
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,581
- Oh, Paige.
- What?

75
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,419
Hello? Oh, hey, Phoebe.

76
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,671
We were just talking about you.

77
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,465
And your batteries.

78
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,800
Darryl's at the house?

79
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,012
Five murders, five cities.

80
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,515
But this is the first one
in San Francisco.

81
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,644
We were hot on his tail following a tip
and then he just vanished.

82
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,231
That's creepy, he's killing his victims
and then mummifying them.

83
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,649
What gives?

84
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,068
That's why I called Phoebe.
I'm hoping you could tell me.

85
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,487
Well, just because it's creepy
doesn't mean it's demonic.

86
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,781
I mean, there's plenty
of human wackos out there.

87
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,491
Stop fidgeting, would you?

88
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,868
- You look fine.
- I look ridiculous.

89
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,496
Phoebe, will you tell her
that she looks fine?

90
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:53,831
You look so cute.

91
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,917
If you ask me, there's nothing more
beautiful than a preg...

92
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,753
Do it and you pull back
a bloody stub.

93
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,216
She's a little sensitive right now.

94
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,343
- I can see that.
- Okay.

95
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,847
Demons, witches, fill them in,
will you?

96
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,723
I have an important
lunch date at the office.

97
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,559
You have a date?

98
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,855
Oh, well, it's actually more like an
appointment down the hall. It's a facial.

99
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,275
Look, we think... I think that the victim
may have been a witch.

100
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,569
So if she was, maybe they all were.

101
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,612
Which means
you need to watch your backs.

102
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,532
- Sand, don't forget the sand.
- Right. In each case there's been

103
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,117
a pile of sand
found by the mummy.

104
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,911
My guess is, it's got something
to do with how he escapes.

105
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,746
What's with the bug on the chest?

106
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,374
I already have Leo
asking the Elders about that.

107
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,127
If we leave now, I should be able
to go to the crime scene,

108
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,379
get a quick premonition
and be back at the office

109
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,464
in time for my appointment.
So who's driving?

110
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,092
Whoa, who says that you're going
to the crime scene?

111
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,343
Is that a problem?

112
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,553
Only with my reputation.

113
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,639
Look, it's taken me a long time
to lose the freaky-deaky rap.

114
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,184
No offence,
but I don't need it back right now.

115
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,060
Freaky-deaky rap?

116
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,687
You know what I mean.

117
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,481
Why can't you just tell them
we're psychics, like you usually do?

118
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,483
I can't risk it. I'm up for a promotion,

119
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,445
and if I get passed over this time,
there's not gonna be a next time.

120
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,489
All right, what do you want us to do?

121
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,826
The right thing, as usual.

122
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,204
Come on, follow me.

123
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,456
No, not you.

124
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,958
- You're pregnant.
- Yes, I am.

125
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,169
I am also invincible and self-healing.

126
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,213
Can I tell the other inspectors that?

127
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,549
I'm sorry, but not even pregnant cops
are allowed at crime scenes

128
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,218
because of the forensic chemicals.

129
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:33,680
We'll go, you stay here and look in
the Book of Shadows for mummies.

130
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,099
Mommy.

131
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,316
The linen wrapping,
though curiously airtight,

132
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:48,403
appears to be of a thread count
more consistent with a hand weave.

133
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,784
After I cut into it, forensics should test
and date the sample.

134
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,039
All right,

135
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,500
let's see what's inside.

136
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,269
Nobody messes with you,
do they, my love?

137
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,354
Sorry for leaving you back there.

138
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:25,482
But I needed to check
on your next body.

139
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,318
I think you'll learn to like it.

140
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,459
- They're with me.
- No, hold it, inspector.

141
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,545
- They gotta sign in.
- Right.

142
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:47,921
Sorry.

143
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,798
Phoebe Halliwell.

144
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,925
Paige Matthews.

145
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,260
Field of expertise?

146
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,928
We're psychics.

147
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,183
You got a problem with that, officer?

148
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,393
No, sir.

149
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:02,936
Psychics.

150
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,647
Your girlfriend's cheating on you,
by the way.

151
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,989
Forensics has been all through here,
so you can touch anything you want.

152
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,742
Just make it quick, okay?

153
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,827
I'll be back.

154
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,750
So that guy at the door
was kind of cute, huh?

155
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,126
Really? I hadn't noticed.

156
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,712
God, you've been out of commission
for longer than I thought.

157
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,215
Yeah, she was definitely a witch.
Look at all this stuff.

158
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,050
I guess I can understand, you know,

159
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,385
all the stuff you've been
through with Cole.

160
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,638
Okay, shush,
I'm trying to concentrate here.

161
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,515
But you don't wanna
let it go for too long

162
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,476
because that would be unhealthy
and you are anything but unhealthy.

163
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,520
Paige, don't worry about me,
I'm fine.

164
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,565
You know, it's just, the whole idea
of dating right now, it's just, like...

165
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,193
...you know.
I just... I need some time.

166
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,112
Well, just don't take too much time.

167
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,281
Look, a map.

168
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,494
She was definitely...

169
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,497
- Scrying?
- Yeah. But the question is for what?

170
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,082
Steal it.

171
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,459
I'm sorry?

172
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,545
I think I know a way
to figure this out at home.

173
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,964
Paige, that's evidence.
I can't steal evidence.

174
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,549
Crystal.

175
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,262
Did you get anything?

176
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:22,432
No, God, not a thing.
But we'll see you later.

177
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,241
I think you look beautiful.

178
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,245
How long have you
been standing there?

179
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,164
A minute or two.

180
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,959
Well, that's just not fair.
You're not allowed to orb in

181
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,586
unless I'm completely aware of it.

182
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,005
Sorry. I was mesmerized.

183
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,464
Oh, please.

184
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,550
No, I mean it, Piper.

185
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:00,345
I think you look absolutely stunning

186
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,514
and I can't believe
you don't think you do.

187
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,642
No, it's not that. It's just...

188
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,021
It's like suddenly I'm wearing
this big, fat neon sign that says:

189
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,940
"Look out, everybody,
she's pregnant, be careful."

190
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,984
And everybody's treating me
so differently.

191
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:18,197
I'm still me. There's just
a whole lot more of me going on.

192
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,743
Hey, guys.
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you ranting?

193
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,370
Yes, I was, but now I'm done,
thank you. Where's Phoebe?

194
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,415
She went back to work.
She didn't want to miss her facial.

195
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,335
- What?
- Relax, she's just an orb away.

196
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:35,255
- So did you find anything?
- Yeah, the demon, maybe.

197
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,383
His name is Jeric, and apparently
he's been at this for quite some time.

198
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,720
Only back then, the killings were
isolated to the Middle East:

199
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,223
Cairo, Istanbul, Tripoli...

200
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,724
So, what's he doing here?

201
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,100
The same thing he's been doing,

202
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:50,312
trying to find the perfect body
for his lover, Isis.

203
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:53,899
He keeps trying to find a body to host
her spirit, but the bodies keep dying.

204
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,276
No, you mean
the witches keep dying.

205
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,403
Right, two spirits
can't occupy the same body.

206
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,614
The invading spirit overloads it.

207
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,618
That's why he's trying to find a witch
with enough magic for Isis to use

208
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,537
to dispossess the host body.

209
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,955
Of course.

210
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,833
Are you telling me she's going to
evict someone from their own body?

211
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,084
That's rude.

212
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,710
Basically, yeah.

213
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,004
Okay, so, what do mummies
have to do with any of this?

214
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,632
Well, he mummifies a corpse
to trap Isis' spirit

215
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,343
to keep it from moving on
until he can find a new body.

216
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,387
That must be what she's scrying for.

217
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:32,938
Scrying secrets come to me
Drop again so I might see

218
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,356
See what?

219
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,444
Fifth and Hyde?

220
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,780
Well, that's Phoebe.

221
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,295
Great body.

222
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,547
Mind if I borrow it for a while?

223
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,340
Yeah, I do.

224
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:04,428
Phoebe, no.

225
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:22,946
Anything?

226
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,323
No.

227
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,782
What about you?

228
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,827
- Nothing.
- Well, this is just unacceptable.

229
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,705
We've got all the magic in the
world here, there's gotta be a way.

230
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,207
We cannot not find Phoebe.

231
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,042
Unless...

232
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,713
No, no unless. She's not dead,
she is possessed and that is all.

233
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,715
She's right. Jeric needs her body.

234
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,092
How long can she last
until she burns up?

235
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:46,720
I don't know. Probably not long.

236
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,516
All the more reason to find her faster.
You keep scrying, you keep sensing.

237
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:54,186
It's no use, Piper.
Jeric is blocking her signal.

238
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,563
You said if Phoebe was possessed,

239
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,774
she would be aware
of what's going on.

240
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,859
Right, but there's nothing
she can do about it.

241
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,070
The invading spirit
is suppressing her.

242
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,742
- Hello?
- Guess what.

243
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,244
The mummy is missing.

244
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,745
What?

245
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,957
Hold on, I'm gonna put you on
speakerphone. Say that again.

246
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,252
The mummy is missing,
the coroner is dead and I'm screwed.

247
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,753
Why is the mummy missing?

248
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,338
How are you screwed?

249
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,967
They're blaming me for losing him,
which means if I don't find him...

250
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,218
Bye-bye, promotion.

251
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:30,681
It pales in comparison to a killer
demon being on the loose, I know.

252
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:33,308
But you know,
it still matters to me and my family.

253
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,352
Yes, well, speaking of family...

254
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,522
...we got a few problems
of our own here.

255
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,773
What's wrong?

256
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,859
I'll catch you up later.

257
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:48,031
- Piper?
- We need to concentrate on Phoebe.

258
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,033
We can't leave Darryl high and dry

259
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,077
after everything he's done
for this family.

260
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:53,704
There's gotta be something
we can do.

261
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:57,624
Short of helping him arrest the demon,
I'm not sure what we can really do.

262
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,419
I have an idea.
But I'd have to break some rules.

263
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,462
So I think you should
break a few rules then.

264
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,006
We owe him.

265
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,091
You're right. You go do
what you gotta do,

266
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,510
and we're gonna do
what we have to do.

267
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,098
Easy.

268
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,392
Not so fast.

269
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:02,105
Welcome back, my love.

270
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,701
Are you sure
this is such a good idea?

271
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,745
Well, he's found her before,
hasn't he?

272
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,038
Yeah, but Cole is...

273
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,540
...crazy now.

274
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,381
Damn. Still here.

275
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,592
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm still alive.

276
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,344
For now.

277
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,805
What's the matter, Cole?
Forget you're indestructible?

278
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,016
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

279
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,811
Witnessing a meltdown, apparently.
Ever thought of therapy?

280
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,815
Thanks, I'd rather chop my head off
than have it examined.

281
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,233
Wait, that's an idea.

282
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:50,946
Oh, my God.

283
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,907
I can't wait to see how I survive this.

284
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,331
Okay, then, good luck with all that,
and we're just gonna go.

285
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,792
No, we gotta find Phoebe.

286
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:08,046
Did you guys actually want something
or did you come to add to my misery?

287
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,924
A demon has taken Phoebe
and we need you to find her.

288
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,719
Oh, yeah, really? Well.

289
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:23,770
Sorry, but just in case you forgot,
she's the reason I became like this.

290
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,939
So ciao.

291
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,109
Wait.

292
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,489
Can't you at least
let me not die in peace?

293
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,869
Cole, we think this guy Jeric
has possessed Phoebe.

294
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,413
Wait.

295
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,333
Did you say Jeric?

296
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,920
- The mummy guy?
- Do you know him?

297
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,756
Are you kidding?
He's legendary in demonic circles.

298
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,382
Oh, of course he is.

299
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:55,260
Actually, he goes all the way back
to ancient Egypt.

300
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:59,848
They didn't have the power to vanquish
him so they mummified him instead.

301
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,059
Mummifying...

302
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:04,311
Hey, stay with us here.

303
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,021
How did Jeric get de-mummified?

304
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:10,901
Oh, well, some evil witch cast a spell,
which released him

305
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:15,447
and then they fell in love
and she got killed by his enemies.

306
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:17,533
Flayed alive, if memory serves.

307
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,409
Poor guy's been racked with guilt.

308
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,496
He's been trying to find a
replacement body ever since.

309
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:26,208
Oh, it would almost be romantic
if he hadn't killed so many witches.

310
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,628
Hey, he's just a guy
trying to get his love back.

311
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,505
There's nothing wrong with that.

312
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,216
Actually,
we could probably work together.

313
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,884
What are you talking about?

314
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,055
Cole.

315
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,809
Looks like we just made
a bad thing worse.

316
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,748
Glad to see you're feeling so alive.

317
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,750
It's this body.

318
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,461
I've never felt
so much power before.

319
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,130
Passion.

320
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,590
Desire.

321
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,633
Maybe I should leave you two alone.

322
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,052
No. Just because the witch is in me

323
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,763
doesn't mean there's not
still room for you too.

324
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,140
Tempting.

325
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:26,351
But I suggest
you try to rid yourself of her first.

326
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:29,021
Can you come up with a spell?

327
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:31,398
The witch's knowledge
was very useful.

328
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:36,236
Then by all means, reward her.
Send her spirit into the afterlife.

329
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,656
Hopefully, she'll have enough
power to make it work.

330
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:48,540
Together no more through time
Expel her soul, leave only mine

331
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,298
Well?

332
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:58,050
I can still hear her thoughts.

333
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,261
Then you have to try again.

334
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,480
Sorry. But that's my witch.

335
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,659
Oh, please, is that all you got?

336
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:28,789
By the way, my compliments on the
tomb's protective charms. This place...

337
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,916
...is not easy to get in to.

338
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:35,712
- Who are you?
- Cole Turner.

339
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,131
I used to be
The Source of All Evil.

340
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,300
You're Jeric, right?

341
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:43,762
I feel like I already know you.
We've got so much in common.

342
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,722
Do we?

343
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:46,974
Yeah.

344
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,810
Well, you know,
we're both trying to get our love back.

345
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,479
Unfortunately,
your love is currently in...

346
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,899
...my love and that's where we have
our little problem.

347
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,986
Your love doesn't want you back.

348
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,405
I can feel it.

349
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,156
Yeah, but that's where you come in.

350
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,285
I want you to mummify her for me,
put her on ice for a while.

351
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,912
At least until I can figure out a way
to win her back.

352
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,247
Win her back?

353
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,790
After that?

354
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,500
Please, you're insane.

355
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,211
Probably.

356
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,172
Leave us.

357
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,923
Go back to where you came from.

358
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:23,135
Well, not until I get what I came for.

359
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:26,138
Let's not fight. I mean...

360
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:28,557
...I need you, you need me.
So let's just...

361
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,309
I don't need you.

362
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:33,896
I'm afraid you do. In case you haven't
noticed, you're running out of time.

363
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,775
Oh, no, it can't be.

364
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:42,821
The others lasted longer.

365
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:46,325
Yeah. The more powerful the witch,
the quicker the burnout.

366
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:48,202
That's really not very good.

367
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:52,206
But I bet the power of three
could fix that permanently.

368
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,626
The power of three.

369
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,671
That might work.

370
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,592
I can get it for you.

371
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:06,470
You interested?

372
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:14,311
We won't give up our body
without a replacement.

373
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:15,854
I figured.

374
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,775
How do you feel about redheads?

375
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,333
Leo, what are you doing here?

376
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,001
I'm here to help you.

377
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:39,503
Leo, I don't have time for this.

378
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:41,171
Somebody said the killer was here.

379
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,422
I know, I made the call.

380
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,842
I figured it'd look good for you
if you caught the guy.

381
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,593
You did?

382
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,220
Where is he?

383
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:52,641
What are you doing? You can't...

384
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:57,229
- Go on, arrest me.
- Leo, l... We are not going to do this.

385
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,523
Come on,
before the other cops get here.

386
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,024
I am not going to arrest you.

387
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,278
What did you do that for?

388
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,654
I'd hit me back if I were you.

389
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:07,030
I am not going to do this.

390
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:10,159
What are you doing?

391
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:11,952
Helping you out.

392
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,788
That is really, really,
not a good thing.

393
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,542
Way to go, inspector.
Good job.

394
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:22,671
Thanks.

395
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,898
I'm telling you, it's not gonna work.
We already tried it.

396
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:44,902
You tried it. The baby and I haven't.
If Cole can find her, then so can we.

397
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:48,155
But you can't just tap into the
baby's powers whenever you want.

398
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:49,489
No? Watch me.

399
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,869
What's happening?

400
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:55,412
I don't know.

401
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,967
I guess our map wasn't big enough?

402
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,552
Egypt?

403
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,179
Phoebe is in Egypt?

404
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:14,848
On the bright side,
we'll get to see the pyramids.

405
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,058
Quips later, orbing now.

406
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:18,727
You know,
this happened a little too easily.

407
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:22,022
- What if it's a trap?
- What if it is? I'm unbreakable, dude.

408
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:26,318
- Dude, I'm not unbreakable.
- You'll be okay. Here, orb faster.

409
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,825
Oh, Phoebe.

410
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,910
Wait, where's Jeric?

411
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:36,245
Piper.

412
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:37,746
Paige.

413
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:42,459
She recognizes us.
That's something, at least.

414
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:44,253
Well...

415
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:45,587
...I don't know.

416
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,549
Let's just orb her home,
we'll fix her there.

417
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,134
I told you they'd come for her,
didn't I?

418
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,399
Very nice.

419
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,159
Hey.

420
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,624
Don't fight it, my love.

421
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,501
Your new body awaits.

422
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,090
Hey.

423
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,177
I told you, that's my witch.

424
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:39,224
Get to work.

425
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,368
Excuse me.

426
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:27,523
Welcome back, my love.

427
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:43,956
Leo?

428
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:46,917
Leo, come on, I need you.

429
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,802
What did you do that for?

430
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:59,555
Leo, is that you?

431
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:05,143
Oh, sorry, I forgot.

432
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,520
You forgot?

433
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,897
What are you doing?
And what are you wearing?

434
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,650
This? They gave it to me in jail
when they arrested me.

435
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:15,362
Well, not me, obviously.
Jeric, or so they think.

436
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:18,365
I just figured it would help Darryl
get a promotion.

437
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,910
- I can't handle this right now.
- What?

438
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,996
I told you I was gonna
have to break a few rules.

439
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:25,789
No, no, no, you don't understand.

440
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:27,541
This is the least of our problems,

441
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:30,252
which ought to give you an idea
how bad our problems are.

442
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,129
Come on, it can't be that bad.

443
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:34,673
Unless I'm mistaken,
Cole has teamed up with Jeric

444
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,717
and tricked me into getting
Paige possessed

445
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:38,635
and Phoebe mummified.

446
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:40,012
What?

447
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:41,555
I've had it with this outfit.

448
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:46,310
What are you gonna do?

449
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:49,062
What does it look like I'm gonna do?

450
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:51,565
I meant about Paige and Phoebe.

451
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:55,110
Well, you're gonna orb me back there
so I can kick some demon ass.

452
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,613
And, honey, you know,
you can change too.

453
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,824
Felon orange
isn't exactly your colour.

454
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:04,703
I should have never gone to Cole
in the first place.

455
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:07,080
I don't know what I was thinking.

456
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:09,833
You were thinking about
saving Phoebe.

457
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,877
Yeah, that worked out
really well, didn't it?

458
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:15,005
The one thing I don't understand
is why Cole sent me back here.

459
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:18,217
I mean, he could have sent me
to the far reaches of the universe

460
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:20,636
or worse, but he didn't.

461
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,305
Cole sent you back? From where?

462
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:28,268
The only thing I can think of is that
he needs me for something.

463
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,728
But what?

464
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,313
Well, whatever it is,

465
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,107
going back there,
wherever there is,

466
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:36,026
would be exactly
what he wants you to do.

467
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:40,280
But I'm not gonna leave my sisters
in Egypt with two demonic perverts.

468
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:41,907
I'm the reason they're in this mess.

469
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:44,535
I lost Paige because I was trying
to save Phoebe.

470
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,662
Cole would never hurt Phoebe,
you know that.

471
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:48,997
And he must need Paige
for a reason.

472
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,166
Otherwise, why go through
the trouble to get her?

473
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,043
So, what am I supposed to do?

474
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,545
You're gonna do what you do best.

475
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,004
You're gonna go on the offensive

476
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,757
and you're gonna summon Cole
before he summons you.

477
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:12,145
Oh, right there.

478
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,147
That's perfect.

479
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:15,941
Yes, you're rather tense.

480
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:18,944
It's not me. It's this witch.

481
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:22,781
She's overworked this body
and she doesn't deserve it.

482
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,742
You'll have to finish
the power of three spell...

483
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:29,746
...if you expect to take it from her.
- I will, in a bit.

484
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:33,000
You can't put it off any longer.

485
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:36,837
This witch is as powerful as the last
and she'll burn out just as quickly.

486
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:39,840
Just a minute more.

487
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:44,178
Sorry. I think you've relaxed enough.

488
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:47,514
I don't.

489
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,558
But then again...

490
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:52,436
...I always have been such a bad girl.

491
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:54,229
We can be bad later.

492
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:58,275
Playtime is over, boys and girls.

493
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:00,485
Do you mind?

494
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:03,447
- No, I don't.
- Well, I do.

495
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,824
Did I ever tell you, Jeric,

496
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:10,037
that I have eyes for only one witch?

497
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:17,294
- How's the spell going?
- I was just about to finish it.

498
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:25,344
She can't expel the witch's soul
without the power of three.

499
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:26,887
How are you gonna get it for us?

500
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:29,890
Look around,
we're only one sister short.

501
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:32,935
Yes, but your love is a mummy.

502
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:36,605
- Yeah.
- You can't expect her to read a spell.

503
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:38,357
Well, she doesn't have to.

504
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:43,028
If her spirit is trapped inside,
all her sisters have to do is touch her,

505
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:44,655
to tap into the power.

506
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:46,281
And what about the third witch?

507
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:48,367
I doubt she'll read the spell willingly.

508
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:51,078
Leave it to me.
I can be quite persuasive.

509
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:56,083
Yes, you better be. Because Isis is the
only one that can bring Phoebe back.

510
00:31:56,708 --> 00:32:01,213
If my love doesn't get what she wants,
yours will stay wrapped up forever.

511
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:06,635
It's done.
The rhyme is a tad childish

512
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:08,387
but it should work.

513
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:11,932
Oh, good. All we need now is...

514
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,019
The witch must have taken him.

515
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,605
Oh, he'll be back.

516
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:20,983
The important thing is...

517
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,818
...we're alone.

518
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,444
Isis.

519
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:34,121
Well, I guess I should've
seen this coming.

520
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:36,874
I want my sisters back now, Cole.

521
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:39,376
Or what?

522
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,795
You got nothing, Piper.

523
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:44,256
You can't even vanquish me.

524
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,385
Doesn't mean I won't try.

525
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:52,931
Okay, if that's the way
you want to play it...

526
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:58,979
Impressive.

527
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,148
Wait.

528
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,378
Isis...

529
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:26,256
...should we be doing this?

530
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:29,176
It's my body now.

531
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:32,763
No, I mean, how are you feeling?

532
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:36,934
I love that you care.

533
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:57,996
Oh, no.

534
00:33:58,163 --> 00:33:59,540
Isis.

535
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:01,500
Isis.

536
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,710
Not yet.

537
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:15,013
Hey. What are you guys doing?

538
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,306
You're both invincible.

539
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,518
This is just pointless.

540
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:27,067
The man's got a point, Piper.

541
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:30,070
The sooner we stop this, the sooner
you can save one of your sisters.

542
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:33,282
What do you mean, one?

543
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:36,743
I mean that you're gonna
have to choose between them,

544
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,329
and if you don't, they'll both die.

545
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,333
Why? Are you gonna kill them?

546
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:45,836
No, I'm not gonna do anything.

547
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:47,421
The cards have already been dealt.

548
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,965
I'm just giving you guys
your options.

549
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:53,927
You're delusional if you think I'm
gonna choose between my sisters.

550
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,102
Am I? Isis is the only one
who knows how to revive Phoebe.

551
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:03,478
She's not gonna do that

552
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:09,067
unless you cast a spell
to eject Paige's spirit from her body.

553
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:11,570
I won't do that. Paige would die.

554
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:12,946
Fine.

555
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:15,240
Then eject Isis' spirit instead.

556
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:18,118
But, of course, you'd be saving Paige
and killing Phoebe,

557
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:20,120
because without Isis...

558
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,956
...there's no way to revive her.

559
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:24,333
What about Jeric?

560
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,543
He mummifies,
can't he de-mummify?

561
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,213
He traps spirits.
He doesn't bring bodies back to life.

562
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:30,881
That's Isis' job.

563
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,217
So...

564
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:36,345
...of course, as you can see, you...

565
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,014
...have to make a choice.

566
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:42,976
You sick bastard.

567
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,730
I can't choose, and I won't.

568
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:49,650
Then they'll both die.

569
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:51,693
Come on.

570
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,904
You're not gonna kill Phoebe.

571
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:59,326
That is why I am banking on your
lovely wife choosing to save her.

572
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:05,249
I mean, come on. After all,
she's like your, what, half sister?

573
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:06,959
You didn't grow up
with her or anything.

574
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,336
You've only known her for
like a year and a half, right?

575
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:11,255
So compared to Phoebe, she's like...

576
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:13,090
...a stranger.

577
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:16,760
She's still my sister.

578
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:19,471
And I will find another way.

579
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:21,849
There is no other way.

580
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:25,561
And if you waste time looking for one,
they'll both die.

581
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:37,489
How can you be so evil?

582
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:42,119
It's a gift.

583
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:43,954
Get out.

584
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:46,665
- Get out now.
- Okay, okay.

585
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:50,002
But when you've made a decision...

586
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:52,045
...you call me, okay?

587
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:55,924
Paige. Phoebe. Phoebe. Paige.

588
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:58,594
Call me.

589
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,321
There's nothing in the Book
that'll help.

590
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:19,656
Or from the Elders.

591
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:26,288
I can't do this, Leo.

592
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:29,208
We can't let them both die either.

593
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:31,376
I know that.

594
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:37,257
How can I be so powerful
and so helpless at the same time?

595
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:40,052
Well, Piper, your strength...

596
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:43,639
...isn't in your invincibility.

597
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,600
It's within you.

598
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:50,646
And believe it or not,
you are strong enough to do this.

599
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:52,356
To do what?

600
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:54,358
Kill one of my sisters?

601
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:55,651
Or not.

602
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:59,279
Maybe there's another way.

603
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:00,614
I don't know what it is,

604
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:03,534
but whatever it is,
the solution is within you.

605
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,370
Look...

606
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:09,331
...I know this isn't fair.

607
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,544
Like it or not,
this is the way that it is.

608
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:18,882
Now, look, you are gonna
have to call Cole back soon...

609
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:22,344
...if you hope to save
even one of your sisters.

610
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:28,600
How am I supposed to decide?

611
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:34,106
Listen to your heart, honey.

612
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:38,527
What is it telling you?

613
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,867
It's telling me that I have to choose.

614
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:52,833
He'll be back with the witch soon.

615
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,085
What if he's late?

616
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:56,879
He won't be.

617
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:02,009
You're welcome.

618
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:05,012
Apparently,
she has made up her mind, so...

619
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,513
Drum roll, please.

620
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,140
Let's just get this over with.

621
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:10,475
Who are you gonna save?

622
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:21,069
Phoebe.

623
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,031
The suspense was killing me.

624
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,659
You do realize once this is over,
I will find a way to vanquish you.

625
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:30,162
You do realize when this is over,
I might vanquish you.

626
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:33,499
Enough.
Isis is running out of time.

627
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:35,292
The spell.

628
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,252
I've got one of my own, thanks.

629
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:39,588
Got something
up your sleeve, do you?

630
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:41,465
I wish.

631
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:44,134
Paige, I know you can hear me.

632
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:46,094
And I know you understand.

633
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:47,930
But I can't lose Phoebe.

634
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,348
Just do it.

635
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:58,857
Two warring souls now burn inside
Where only one can reside

636
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:03,111
I call upon the power of three
To save her body and set Paige free

637
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:11,078
Isis?

638
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,834
Did it work?

639
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:20,170
Yes, it did.

640
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:25,217
And I know just how to celebrate.

641
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:43,110
Isis?

642
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:47,197
You really can't mess with sisters.

643
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:54,621
Well, at least they're together now.

644
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,878
Bravo. Bravo.

645
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:03,547
Congratulations. Well done.

646
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:06,091
You know, I gotta admit,

647
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,843
I thought I had you there
for a moment,

648
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,636
but you never really did choose,
did you?

649
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:13,390
I didn't have to. I figured if Isis
knew the spell to free Phoebe,

650
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:14,975
then Paige would know it as well.

651
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,645
Well, next time.

652
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:20,689
Next time?

653
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:23,108
What happened to you, Cole?

654
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:24,818
Me?

655
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:27,863
Gone mad.

656
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:35,245
No offence, but we really need
to find a way to kill him.

657
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,623
I'd say that's an understatement.

658
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:40,167
I wish it was that easy.

659
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:00,395
What?

660
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:02,648
Oh, my God,

661
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:05,234
you two could scare
the hair off a cat.

662
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:07,402
No demon dare drop by here.

663
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:09,613
We're just playing hooky.

664
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:14,660
Well, Paige, you can't play hooky
because, see, you're unemployed.

665
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:17,871
I resent that. I consider my
witchly duties to be a full-time job,

666
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:19,081
thank you very much.

667
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:20,624
We're having a day of beauty.

668
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:23,210
I'm showing Paige
how to pamper herself.

669
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:24,878
You're beauteous.

670
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:28,048
I'm getting quite good at it.
I like it. It's free.

671
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:30,092
Well, I'm glad. It's about time.

672
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,594
It is, isn't it?
I've been so long overdue,

673
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:35,514
- I'm so put upon, really.
- Wow.

674
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:40,185
Turn a girl into an Egyptian princess
for a day and look what happens.

675
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:44,022
By the way, Lieutenant Morris called
to say thank you.

676
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:47,776
Oh, he got his promotion.
That's so great.

677
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:51,697
Apparently, he got credit for the arrest,
despite Leo's little jailbreak.

678
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:55,117
What you got there?

679
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:58,036
Maternity clothes,
as if you didn't know already.

680
00:42:58,245 --> 00:43:01,165
- You caved.
- Yes, the time has come.

681
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:03,709
But I've come to the conclusion
that if you've got it...

682
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:05,711
...then you must flaunt it.

683
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:09,631
- That's my niece in that belly.
- She's my niece too.

684
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:13,802
Hi, niece.
It's your favourite, Aunt Phoebe.
