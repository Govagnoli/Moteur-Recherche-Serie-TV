1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:01,376
Previously on "Charmed"

2
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,712
To make a lover's dream come true...

3
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,672
Well, maybe at least this
one will help Phoebe out.

4
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,257
I love you, Mrs. Lawson.

5
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:10,636
If you wanna go down to city
hall and get this fixed--

6
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,637
To get it annulled ?

7
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,638
Well, yeah !

8
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,140
Maybe we made a mistake
faking our own death.

9
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,813
Agent Murphy, Homeland Security.

10
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:25,025
You wanna know more about who we
are and what we do, we will tell you.

11
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,277
And help you out with a few cases
along the way.

12
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,487
If you help us.

13
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,657
I can't talk about the specifics
of the case the sisters are involved in, ok?

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,992
All I can say is it involved
a threat to national security,

15
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,161
that our agency got involved
to protect them.

16
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,663
Welcome back.

17
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,594
Dang, what'd the pumpkin ever do to you ?

18
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,137
Nothing, I'm venting.

19
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,976
No. Don't get that.
It could be Oprah's people again.

20
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,770
They want to do a special on lady spies.

21
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:02,771
Lady spies ?

22
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,357
You heard me, and
some producer's been calling

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,860
for the movie rights to our cover story.

24
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,528
I guess it's better than T.V., right ?

25
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,572
Trust me. We won't be doing T.V., either.

26
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,991
Well, it's, uh-- it's a little
late for that, actually.

27
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,534
Little late for what ?

28
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:16,952
What are you doing here ?

29
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,453
Oh, it's funny you should ask.
Actually, I--

30
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,914
Ya know, Paige, we really need to do
something about this.

31
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:21,999
It's not good.

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,083
It's gonna blow over.

33
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,627
Really ? Does this look like
it's blowing over ?

34
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,632
It's a good picture. Well, it is.

35
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,385
Ok. This isn't about the witch secret.

36
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,096
They're just trying to figure out what
we're doing with Homeland Security

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,140
and you know what ?
They're not going to find out anything.

38
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,184
Well, they're going to keep
looking until they find something,

39
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,686
and that something could
easily turn into a witch hunt.

40
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,896
Oh, speaking of hunting--

41
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,647
Nothing is going to happen.

42
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,441
Really ? 'Cause something happened to Prue.

43
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,692
We die to have normal lives.

44
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,069
We come back from the dead
to get our old lives back, and,

45
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,821
somehow, we end up living in a fishbowl.

46
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,240
You know, Agent Murphy was supposed
to protect us from this.

47
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:59,203
Ok. Uhh. I'm going to disarm you now.

48
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,331
It's all gonna be ok. I promise.

49
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,749
How can you promise that ?

50
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,043
Well, I'm not entirely sure, but--

51
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,253
but I promise that it's gonna be,
because you know what ?

52
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,713
You're just gonna take care of Halloween,

53
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,592
and I am gonna deal with getting
the press off of our backs.

54
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,844
And I will focus on my demon.

55
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:17,846
What demon ?

56
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,140
Just the one I've been tracking.
No big deal. I can take him.

57
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,934
Oh, no. Actually, you're not taking anybody.

58
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,352
No, somebody's gotta take him down.

59
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,230
He's-- he's killing other demons
and gaining power by the day.

60
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,941
Great. Witch vanquishes demon.
Film at eleven.

61
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,756
No. The press doesn't even know who I am,

62
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,860
that's why I'm the perfect girl for the job.

63
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,111
Plus, I wanna do it.

64
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,321
Why do you want to do it ?

65
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,822
So I can show you guys that I can.

66
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,991
Come on. Please, I know I can do this.

67
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,286
Fine, but if you get caught on tape,
I will vanquish you.

68
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:45,999
She's serious ?

69
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,919
Just don't get caught.

70
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,506
Trick-or-treaters ?

71
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,258
A day early ?

72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,851
Seth Parra, Bay Mirror.
So, what's the big secret ?

73
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,773
We're screwed.

74
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,237

00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,419
Launka, Ronanasplit, Lucile76, Demonclem,
Chryssie, Titelilie, Kiff,

77
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,926
Hey, I think I figured out how to, uh --

78
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:20,677
What are you doing ?

79
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,138
I'm organizing the candy for tomorrow.

80
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:26,600
I have chocolate, sugar free,
and chocolate with nuts.

81
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,894
Well, isn't part of the fun of Halloween
the whole mixed bowl thing

82
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,397
No. I don't want any allergic reactions
or angry parents.

83
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,441
We've got enough problems as it is.

84
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,194
Speaking of those problems,
I think I have figured out

85
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,820
how to get the press off of our broomsticks.

86
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,864
Holy ! we have rats.

87
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,160
Yeah, they're everywhere. Get used to 'em.

88
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,037
So what's this big solution ?

89
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,455
Where did they come from ?

90
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:54,795
The San Francisco Chronicle, uh,
the Daily News, and the Enquirer.

91
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,506
I found them nosing around the garbage.

92
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:58,924
So you turned them into rodents ?

93
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,843
Well, I could've blown them up.

94
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,886
Uh, here's the thing.

95
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,139
If we get Phoebe to talk to this
reporter who's leading the charge--

96
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,808
luckily he works at her paper-- we can--

97
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,268
How's that gonna help ?

98
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,230
Because... if she can convince him
that we are

99
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:17,150
completely uninteresting,
then hopefully he'll just go away

100
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,194
and take all the lemming reporters with him.

101
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,863
They're more like rats.

102
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,575
And I will be the pied Piper
of Prescott Street,

103
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,451
leading them away from the manor.

104
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:29,162
Sadly, Piper, you have to turn them back.

105
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:29,955
No.

106
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,331
Piper.

107
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,959
You're no fun.

108
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,639
What are you all waitin' for ?

109
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:48,807
You're trespassing.

110
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,393
This is private property.
What are you, crazy ?

111
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,481
Where did they come from ?

112
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,442
Pest problem. I'll take care of it.

113
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,819
If you don't, I will.

114
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,906
Piper, you cannot blow up the entire media.

115
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,782
Wish me luck.

116
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,330
Well, it's getting worse.

117
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,625
Now the women at the preschool think
I'm some kind of freaking

118
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,751
Why ?

119
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,503
Because they think I'm married to a spy.

120
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:18,587
That's why.

121
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:21,423
Well, better that than to a witch.

122
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,551
Why'd you get candy corn ?
Nobody likes candy corn.

123
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,512
They were out of everything else.

124
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,472
Well, you gotta go somewhere else
and get more.

125
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,766
More ? We have twelve bags.

126
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,267
That's more than we gave out all last year.

127
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,937
Yeah, well, you know what,
last year we weren't famous, ok ?

128
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,648
I don't want to have to turn off the lights
and pretend like we're not home.

129
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,860
I want the boys to have a nice Halloween
if it's the last thing we do.

130
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,529
But the boys aren't even three.

131
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:44,613
They're not gonna remember.

132
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,532
You know what ? I will.

133
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:47,824
Come on. Don't argue with me.

134
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,201
Can't you just go get the candy ?

135
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,662
Is that really such a big deal ?
Is that a problem ?

136
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,376
Piper is freaking out.

137
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,426
Yeah.

138
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,462
Yeah. The press is rummaging
through the trash.

139
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,756
The phone is ringing off the hook.

140
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,758
She's worried about exposure,
and, frankly, so am I.

141
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,510
Hey, do you know if Dex called ?

142
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,596
Dex ? Are you listening to me ?

143
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,765
Yes. I am listening to you. I'm sorry.

144
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,810
It's just we haven't really talked
since I told him I was a witch.

145
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,313
Right. Which brings us back
to exposure, ok ?

146
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,606
And that brings us back to--

147
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,400
I don't even know if
he wants to see me again.

148
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,694
I mean, I wouldn't blame him if he didn't.

149
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,779
Ok. Yeah. You're right. Love sucks.

150
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,073
How 'bout bringing the focus
just back around a little bit ?

151
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,908
Yes. Yes. You're right.

152
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,076
You're right. I'm sorry.

153
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:35,873
So what we need to do is try to
get Seth Parra off of our backs.

154
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,041
Uh, that's not gonna happen.

155
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,168
Why ?

156
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,461
Because he is a hardcore journalist,

157
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,548
and he's determined to do anything
to get back in the big leagues.

158
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:46,758
What's his deal ?

159
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,093
Uh, he used to be at the Times,

160
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:52,598
and he did this big mafia exposé
and exposed his source in the

161
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,143
All right. Wasn't that, like,
a call girl ? A Carol -- Carol--

162
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,436
Yeah. Flowers.

163
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,187
Yeah.

164
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:02,566
She got killed because of it,
and her death has haunted him ever

165
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,278
That's horrible, but the
haunting could be good for us.

166
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,030
Look, no us, ok, Paige ?

167
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,990
I just-- I can't right now.

168
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,909
Ok, Phoebe, this affects all of us.

169
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,745
What exactly is more important than
keeping our secret right now ?

170
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,960
I'm pregnant.

171
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,006
Dex ?

172
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,800
No. Actually, some guy
that I met at the gas station.

173
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,511
Yes. Of course Dex.

174
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,137
Well, are you sure ?

175
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,723
Yeah. I took the test this morning.

176
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,267
What are you gonna do ?

177
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:38,769
I don't know.

178
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:43,524
I mean, I guess I'm gonna have
to talk to him, but...

179
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,485
I don't even know if he'll talk to me.

180
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,278
Well, the hits just keep on comin'.

181
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:52,699
And so do demons,
but instead of fighting them

182
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,410
I plan on leading them.

183
00:08:56,495 --> 00:09:00,916
How do you expect to lead demons when you
keep killing them to steal their powers.

184
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,334
You respect power, don't you ?

185
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,669
Of course. But that's not--

186
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,128
Then that's your answer.

187
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,922
It's kill or be killed in the underworld.

188
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,215
You know that.

189
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:13,887
But with the return of the charmed ones,
one must rise again to

190
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,973
You ?

191
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:25,732
Careful, Tomar, or I'll steal
your power next.

192
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,281
Now, who's next on the list ?

193
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,910
Who are you ?

194
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,917
Shh. I don't want them to hear.

195
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,085
Hear what ?

196
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,170
This.

197
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,766
Do you know where to find him ?

198
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,686
His territory's East Market.

199
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,563
He preys in alleys.

200
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,900
Don't they all ?

201
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,576
I think we should start over by--

202
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:18,744
What was that ?

203
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,644
Hi.

204
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,731
Can I come in ?

205
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,407
So how you been ?

206
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,747
Wondering how you've been. That good, huh ?

207
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,459
What do you want me to say, Phoebe ?

208
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,460
I mean, give me a break.

209
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,712
It's not every day you find out
you're married to a witch.

210
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,756
At least we got it annulled.

211
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:13,966
That's not the point.

212
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,009
Yeah, I know.

213
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,639
How can I help you with this ?

214
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:21,765
I don't know.

215
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,393
I wish I did.

216
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,187
It's just a lot, you know ?

217
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,981
I didn't even know witches existed before.

218
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,358
You can turn into other people,
you can see the future,

219
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,318
you can win the lottery whenever you want.

220
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,821
Naw, actually, we can't do that.
We're not allowed.

221
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:36,864
There are rules ?

222
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,282
Well, yeah.

223
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,910
I don't know how to process this.

224
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,161
I know.

225
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,415
Look, you wanted to tell me something ?

226
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,506
Can we go for a walk,
get some fresh air, please ?

227
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,595
So what's the deal, Phoebe ?
Is he part of this, too ?

228
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,096
Does he know what's going on ?

229
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,556
Are you following me ?

230
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,515
Damn right I am.

231
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,103
So, uh, tell me, were you two sleeping together
before this witness protection thing

232
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,606
or is this, uh, a new relationship ?

233
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:22,075
"I like you, Phoebe, a lot,
but you're a witch, so bye-bye," you know.

234
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,536
And that's just a little bit
of my bigger problem.

235
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,996
What did you tell Paige ?

236
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,832
She's got some hair-brained
scheme up her sleeve.

237
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,292
You know what ? I am a wreck.

238
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:35,255
My boobs feel enormous, and all I want
to do is eat all of this candy.

239
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,090
Have a candy corn. We got plenty.

240
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,717
Why does everything
have to be so difficult ?

241
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,594
I mean, why can't it just be easy ?

242
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,764
And I'm sorry, but what
am I supposed to tell Dex ?

243
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:47,100
"Hey, I know you don't want to
be with me 'cause I'm a witch,"

244
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,478
"but you know what ?
I'm pregnant, so tough".

245
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:50,938
What ?

246
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,568
Vermin ! Ohh!

247
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:02,199
Uh, uh... could you repeat that ?

248
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:03,992
Wait, I told you, didn't I ?

249
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,744
No, you didn't tell me.

250
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,789
I think I would remember
the small embryo part !

251
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,624
Oh, you know what, I might have told Paige.

252
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,293
You told Paige and you didn't tell me ?

253
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:14,753
Well, I'm pregnant, ok ?

254
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,630
I'm a little scatter-brained right now.

255
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,548
Forgive me.

256
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:21,218
Well, I'm sorry, it's a little too
early for you to use that excuse.

257
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,178
Are you sure ?

258
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,680
I took the test.

259
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:29,184
Well, nothing's for sure until you see
your doctor and have a blood test.

260
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:30,143
Did you do that ?

261
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,145
No, but it all times out, doesn't it ?

262
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:36,483
I just don't understand why it can't be
with a guy who accepts me for who I am.

263
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:40,195
Well, he's obviously scared
and confused about who you are.

264
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,530
I mean, can you blame him ?

265
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,032
The only thing you can do
is try to talk to him.

266
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,075
I've tried.

267
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,077
Well, so you need to try again.

268
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,080
I mean, if he's not gonna listen,
then you need to write him a letter.

269
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,583
He reads your column, doesn't he ?

270
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,459
Wait. Write him a letter in "Ask Phoebe" ?

271
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,253
Yeah ! That should get his attention.

272
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,172
Drastic times call for drastic measures,

273
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,716
and you guys need to work this out soon,

274
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,178
especially if there's a new baby
to think about.

275
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,097
Oh. Hello.

276
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:08,765
What happened to you ?

277
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:12,102
Oh, this ? It's nothing.
You should see the other guy.

278
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,937
Did you vanquish him ?

279
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,981
No, but I'm going to.

280
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,067
I just have to go get
some more potion, so...bye.

281
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,282
What happened to the potions you had?

282
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,117
Um, I just didn't have enough of them.

283
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,285
Why not ?

284
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,370
Well, I sort of left them.

285
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:32,080
Left them with the demons ?

286
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,165
You know, it's no big deal.

287
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,917
No worries. Rome wasn't built
in a day, right ?

288
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,126
Billie !

289
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,463
Tell us what happened.

290
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,383
I don't know.

291
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,844
I was completely prepared.

292
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:49,097
I researched the demon,
I mixed the potions correctly

293
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:52,684
and-- but I just froze.

294
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,811
You froze ?

295
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:56,647
What do you mean ? Why ?

296
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,065
I don't know why. It was so weird.

297
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:03,570
It was nothing that he did,
but it was like... it was like déjà vu.

298
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,447
So wait, you think you've seen him before ?

299
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:06,865
How is that possible ?

300
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,584
What's the matter ?

301
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:20,838
Oh, nothing.
Those things have always creeped me out.

302
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,049
You can fight demons,
but you're afraid of pumpkins ?

303
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,300
I'm not afraid of pumpkins.

304
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,594
Ok, well, you're obviously
afraid of something,

305
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,555
otherwise you wouldn't have frozen, right ?

306
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,598
And it's ok. I mean,
it happens to all of us.

307
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,392
You just have to figure out why.

308
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,143
You know, what triggered it.

309
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:37,271
Do you think it's some kind
of latent memory ?

310
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,647
Latent memory ?

311
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,023
Unresolved issue.

312
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,359
Look, whatever it is,
you gotta figure it out,

313
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:45,237
and until then, you're not fighting
any more demons.

314
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,738
Oh, come on, everyone has baggage.

315
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,366
Yeah, well, everybody doesn't fight demons.

316
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,995
Now there's a first-aid kit
upstairs for your hand.

317
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,795
You think we're expecting
too much from her ?

318
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,591
I don't think she's ready for any of this.

319
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,843
Could be making a big mistake.

320
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,692
Here goes nothin'.

321
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,903
"After this cruel memory is seen and said,"

322
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,238
"erase these thought
from my heart and my head".

323
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,591
Time to go kick some ass.

324
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,016
Huh. Interesting place to meet.

325
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,560
Planning on taking me out, are you ?

326
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,229
I would never go out with you.

327
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,731
Yeah. I was speaking metaphorically.

328
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,858
Ah. Well, I wasn't.

329
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,944
Ok. All right, come on.  What's going on ?

330
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,862
Why did you drag me all the way
down here ? Huh ?

331
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,531
You gonna give me an exclusive or what ?

332
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,491
No. I brought you here to warn you.

333
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,700
A warning, huh ?

334
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:17,996
Yeah. Yeah. You might want to, uh,
you know, back off on your story.

335
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,039
Oh, yeah, and why is that ?

336
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,541
That would be because we're still working

337
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:24,461
on a case for Homeland Security
which is very dangerous and ongoing.

338
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,796
Really ? Tell me about it.

339
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,341
Some things are more important
than your story,

340
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,844
some things are best left quiet,

341
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,680
and some things are actually
for the greater good.

342
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,640
Yeah. What a load of crap.

343
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:40,811
What could possibly be so important,
so dangerous,

344
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,981
to make the government wanna
recruit sisters ? Mmm.

345
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:47,693
I don't buy it. There's more of this,
and I'm gonna find out what.

346
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,695
Even if it means hurting innocent people.

347
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,989
That's not my responsibility.

348
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,575
Like Carol Flowers wasn't
your responsibility ?

349
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,788
Screw you.

350
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,499
You know, we're never gonna talk.

351
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,424
Sophie, is it too late to make
the evening edition ?

352
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,009
You want me to stop them ?

353
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,635
Yeah. I wanna swap out some of my advice.

354
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,806
Hi. Uh, yeah, can you hold "Lifestyle" ?

355
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,350
Great. Thank I'll have
new copy down in five.

356
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,102
You are a lifesaver.

357
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,229
Are you kidding ?
We're all just so happy to have you back

358
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,772
that we'd do anything for you.

359
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,400
Uh, not that I didn't like
having your cousin around.

360
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:32,654
She... she was your real cousin,
wasn't she ? Or was she under cover too ?

361
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,947
Ticktock.

362
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,450
Oh. "Pouting on Prescott" ?

363
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,035
Yeah. Don't tell anybody.

364
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,413
I'm just trying to reach out
to someone that I hurt.

365
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,332
Were you behind this, too, huh ? Were you ?

366
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,042
I don't know what you're talking about.

367
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,835
You know damn well what I'm talkin' about.

368
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,546
Dragging my ass down to p-3, warning me.

369
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:50,631
And just so you know,

370
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,717
all you and your sisters
just did was make things worse for you.

371
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:59,556
Sophie, will you get one of
my sisters on the phone, please ?

372
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:11,360
Whoa. Watch out.

373
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:12,486
Sorry, sorry. Gotta go.

374
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:13,570
Wait. Whoa. Wh-where ?

375
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:14,988
Don't I have a demon to vanquish ?

376
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,198
I don't know. Do ya ?

377
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,449
Did you get any Snickers ?

378
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,076
Uh, does Piper know about this ?

379
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,577
Yes, of course she knows about this.

380
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:24,414
Isn't that what I'm doing here, so I can fight
demons so you guys can have a life ?

381
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,916
Such as it is.

382
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,709
Wish me luck.

383
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,143
Marco...

384
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,148
you're supposed to say "polo."

385
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:52,860
Come on. I know you're here, Dogan.

386
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,403
I tracked you.

387
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,994
Cocky little witch, aren't you ?

388
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,079
Or foolish.

389
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:05,873
I prefer the former.

390
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:06,999
Kill her!

391
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:08,625
Not yet.

392
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:25,475
You seem to have a little trouble
holding on to these.

393
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,945
No, let her go.

394
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,823
She's not worth the effort.

395
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:44,077
Besides, we have a demon to wait for.

396
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:11,813
Interesting advice.

397
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:16,109
"Do whatever it takes to get
somebody you've hurt to call,"

398
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,362
"especially if he's a sculptor".

399
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,532
Obviously, you had a very
narrow target audience.

400
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,951
Well, tonight I do.

401
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,579
How'd you, uh, know I'd read it ?

402
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,332
I didn't. It was my sister's idea.

403
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:33,836
Thank her for me.

404
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:39,091
Look, I'm sorry if I've been a jerk
about all of this. It just...

405
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,425
It's ok, really.

406
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,594
I mean, it's completely understandable.

407
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,055
Sounds like you've been through this before.

408
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:52,396
Yeah. Pretty much every time I fall for a guy,
this seems to happen... unfortunately.

409
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,442
Did you fall for me ?

410
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,236
Dex, you know I did.

411
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:02,281
No, actually, I don't.
That's kind of the problem.

412
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:04,616
You said you had a, uh...

413
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:07,369
what did you call it,
a vision or something...

414
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,871
Premonition.

415
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,124
That we were gonna be married, right ?

416
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:16,879
Well, yeah, but the whole getting married
thing was because of a spell.

417
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:17,921
A spell ?

418
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:23,594
Yeah, you know-- witchcraft, magic,
abracadabra stuff. You know.

419
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:26,513
A friend of ours cast it.
I had nothing to do with it.

420
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,140
Yeah, see, and that's kind of my question.

421
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:30,684
Look, I don't pretend to understand
everything that happened here.

422
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,477
I may never--

423
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:37,024
between you pretending to be somebody else,
the premonitions, the spells.

424
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:42,613
How can you be sure
you really did fall for me ?

425
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,115
How can I ?

426
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,125
Paige !

427
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,793
Hey, honey, how you doin' ?

428
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:00,422
What's wrong ? You don't look so well.

429
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:03,175
Yeah. I'm not feeling too great.

430
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,135
Well, then why aren't you home resting ?

431
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:08,180
Um, I wanted to check something
out in the book about The Dogan,

432
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:10,307
you know, just in case I
ever go up against him again.

433
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,267
Don't want to let you guys down next time.

434
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,686
Well, as long as next time
isn't any time soon,

435
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,730
how about you leave the
demons to us for a while, ok ?

436
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:18,023
Yeah, right.

437
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:31,286
"After this cruel memory is seen and said,"

438
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,747
"erase these thoughts
from my heart and head".

439
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,582
Windows !

440
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,836
What was that ?

441
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,130
What the hell ?

442
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,424
Who-- who are you ?

443
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:28,969
What's the matter, Seth ?
Don't you recognize me ?

444
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:30,971
You killed me.

445
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:35,434
Help.

446
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:36,310
Soke !

447
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:36,852
Help.

448
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,563
Belts !

449
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:48,030
You used me.
All you cared about was getting your story !

450
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:51,241
You didn't care what would happen to me.
Look at me.

451
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:53,535
Look at me !

452
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:56,497
This is what your precious story did !

453
00:24:56,622 --> 00:25:01,335
This is what you did !
If you ever hurt anybody again,

454
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,796
I'll be back... for you !!

455
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,089
You don't fool me.

456
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,384
I have been waiting for you, Abet.

457
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:57,266
I'll see you in the wasteland.

458
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,354
But not for a while.

459
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,575
Who's next ?

460
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:15,742
Try me.

461
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:21,540
You're a persistent little witch,
I'll give you that.

462
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,005
Overcome your fears, have you ?

463
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:29,590
What fears ?

464
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:51,028
Are you all right ?

465
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:52,112
No !

466
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,492
I'm not.

467
00:26:57,743 --> 00:26:58,911
Leave me !

468
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:03,749
I've got a score to settle.

469
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:18,555
Get lost.

470
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,265
Get a life or something.

471
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:23,519
Ohh ! I thought I got rid of them.
I can't believe it.

472
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,229
Really ? What made you think that ?

473
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,565
Well, I thought I scared Seth off,
but look at his headline.

474
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:29,983
It's worse than ever.

475
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,193
I told you he was a pit bull.

476
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,278
Well, you also said that he gets scared.

477
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:37,491
Remember the whole Mafia story, Carol Flowers thing,
you said he was haunted by it ?

478
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:40,494
So I figured if I could haunt him
in real life that--

479
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:41,995
You'd scare him off the case.

480
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,499
Obviously, it didn't.
Piper's gonna freak.

481
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:48,961
Sometimes I just wonder if it wouldn't
be better to just let the truth out.

482
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:51,255
You're not serious, are you ?

483
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:54,007
Yeah. I mean why not ?
It couldn't get any worse.

484
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:55,259
Well, yeah, actually it could.

485
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,469
I mean, just think of how Dex reacted.

486
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,222
Yeah. I am.

487
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:02,224
You spoke to him ?

488
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,726
Yeah. I don't know.
It's just so complicated.

489
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,480
You know, I find this guy-- this great guy,

490
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:12,985
and then the spell and the premonitions
just mess everything up,

491
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,362
and I'm left to wonder
how I really feel about him.

492
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:19,241
It's just so not fair.

493
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:20,993
Well, how do you feel ?

494
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:23,954
Well, I like him... a lot.

495
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:25,497
But do I love him ?

496
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:27,207
Do I want to have his baby

497
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:30,794
and spend the rest of our lives
together I just-- I don't know.

498
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:32,921
And how can I know ?

499
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,925
Ehh, none of this makes sense.

500
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,261
Maybe you should retake that test.

501
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:45,225
Leo, what happened ?

502
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:47,019
Where's Piper ?

503
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:48,228
She's in the kitchen.

504
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:54,318
You know what ?
Maybe I should call in the big guns.

505
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,742
I'm sorry, what ? You got in a fight ?

506
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:02,743
Where ?

507
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:03,952
At Wyatt's preschool.

508
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:05,954
What did you do ?

509
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,290
Oh, what did I do ?
I didn't do anything, ok ?

510
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,501
I was protecting our son.
This whole thing got way out of control.

511
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:11,877
Wait. Is Wyatt all right ?

512
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:15,088
Of course he's all right. A photographer
shoved his camera in his face.

513
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,925
So, what ? You went all Sean Penn on him ?

514
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,134
Wha t ? Am I supposed to let it go ?

515
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,512
Yes! That's precisely what
you should have done.

516
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:23,972
Oh, so you can turn them into rats,
and I can't do anything.

517
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:25,807
You know what ? That's different.

518
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,142
Why because you have powers ?

519
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:31,021
Uh, yeah, partly, because I can reverse
the damage that I've done.

520
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,231
You can't.

521
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:35,025
Gotcha. So because 
have powers and I don't,

522
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,109
I'm just supposed to let it go,

523
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:38,028
maybe let you figure it out for me,

524
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:39,571
go get some more candy ?

525
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:41,198
What is wrong with you ?

526
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,116
Never mind.

527
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:44,701
Don't you walk away from me !

528
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:45,577
Watch me.

529
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:47,704
All right, I am not going anywhere.

530
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:49,122
I'm just gonna stay here and

531
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:51,834
keep bugging you until somebody
comes down here and...

532
00:29:54,822 --> 00:29:55,930
talks to me.

533
00:29:55,965 --> 00:29:57,285
Hello, Paige.

534
00:29:57,548 --> 00:29:58,423
How have you been ?

535
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,716
How have I been ?

536
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:01,426
You don't know what's going on ?

537
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,303
You didn't ask for our help before.

538
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,055
Oh ! So we're being punished for that now ?

539
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,765
No. Of course not.

540
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:09,059
But we didn't get you into this mess.
You did.

541
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,435
This mess ?

542
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:13,856
This mess happened because we almost
died fighting for the greater good.

543
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:17,234
We actually made a split-second
decision, and, hey, we chose life.

544
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:19,027
I know we've had we've had
our differences in the past,

545
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,153
but don't you think we

546
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,031
maybe deserve a bit of a break here ?

547
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:26,577
Yes, I do, but getting out of this,

548
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:29,663
turning the cameras away from you
won't be as easy as you think.

549
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:33,667
Ok, well how about calling
the cleaners down here ?

550
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,752
They can erase some memories, rewind time--

551
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:37,546
Not with this much time.

552
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,673
Besides, you already burned that bridge.

553
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:42,926
Memory dust. Just sprinkle some.

554
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:45,345
Too many people involved.
There's not enough.

555
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,140
Can you cast a spell or maybe

556
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:49,725
magnify one of ours at least ?

557
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,809
I'm afraid not.

558
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,270
Ok. Well, I am exactly open to suggestions.

559
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,607
The answer to your problems
are not magical, Paige.

560
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:58,275
They're human.

561
00:30:58,609 --> 00:30:59,902
Ok, I'm listening.

562
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:03,155
Everyone's after an amazing story,
aren't they ?

563
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,615
An extraordinary one ?

564
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:07,409
Just show them how ordinary you are.

565
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:09,661
They'll go away.

566
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,248
"Leo, can you pick up the dry cleaning".

567
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:16,001
"Leo !! Can you drop
the kids off at Dad's ?"

568
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:18,378
"Leo !! Can you fix the sink ?!"

569
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:20,839
"Leo, can you do this ? Can you do that ?"

570
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:25,010
You know, I feel like I'm
a freaking handyman again.

571
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:27,888
Well, I'm sorry, Leo,
that I work for a living, ok ?

572
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:32,601
Oh. Oh, ok. And because I do everything
else around here, I don't.

573
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,354
I don't ask you to do everything else.

574
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:37,272
No, no. You just expect it.

575
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,608
You know, every time
I walk through the door,

576
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:42,611
I never know what's next on your
frickin' list of things to do,

577
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,071
never-ending, by the way.

578
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:46,448
Well, you know what ?
Welcome to marriage, Leo.

579
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:49,827
It's a partnership. You divide and conquer.
What's your problem ?

580
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,954
Only you do the dividing,
and the conquering.

581
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:55,707
Ok, look, I did not ask you
to give up your powers,

582
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,167
if this is what that's all about.

583
00:31:57,251 --> 00:32:01,296
No. But I did not give up my powers to be told
what to do all the time, you know ?

584
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:02,339
Damned it !

585
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:05,884
Ok, welcome. Welcome to our,
uh... lovely home.

586
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:09,012
Please go on through. Go on through.
That's right.

587
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,933
So what's the catch, huh ?
We all gonna get threatened this time ?

588
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:15,769
Well, only if you steal Piper's candy.

589
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:18,355
All right, after you.

590
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:21,859
That's right.

591
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:23,569
Ooh, wait there for me.

592
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:26,613
The house was built in 1898.

593
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:28,782
We're actually the third generation
to own it.

594
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:31,285
Although not really headline worthy.

595
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:34,288
Paige, what are you doing ?

596
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:38,917
Ahh, Phoebe, lovely woman, fascinating life.

597
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:44,148
But since she has a daily column in the paper,
there's really not much left to write about, is there ?

598
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:46,216
Oop. Smile for the cameras.

599
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:52,639
Give us a second.

600
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:56,476
What's going on ?

601
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:57,561
I retook the test.

602
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:00,189
It looks like the first one was wrong.

603
00:33:00,606 --> 00:33:02,232
Aw, honey I'm sorry.

604
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:04,484
Now, you talkin' about the case, are you ?

605
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:06,528
I mean, you don't care to give us a quote ?

606
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:08,989
No. We're actually discussing
something private, but I promise,

607
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:10,574
it's not newsworthy.

608
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,035
Shall we ?

609
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:21,126
Hey, I did not ask you to be Mr. Mom.

610
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:22,669
You volunteered.

611
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:25,547
Yes, but I did not think that
it would become a fulltime job.

612
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,508
Oh ! And so that's my fault ?

613
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,426
No, it is not your fault, ok ?

614
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:30,886
It just really sucks.

615
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:31,762
Oh, it sucks ?

616
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:34,264
What would you like me to do
about the fact that your life sucks ?!

617
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:36,683
Hello.

618
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,852
And for your enjoyment,
ladies and gentlemen,

619
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:40,187
a marital spat.

620
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,648
I know, really interesting, probably belongs

621
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:45,776
in the Lifestyle section right
under the column on stinky diapers.

622
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:47,945
Paige, what are you doing ?

623
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:52,449
Well, I am just showing these fine men and women
that even though there is nothing to find,

624
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:53,909
they're destroying our lives anyway.

625
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:55,869
So...carry on.

626
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:03,377
Aah, here we have my grandma's
sewing machine that's broken,

627
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:06,839
and there we have Piper's bicycle,
flat tire...

628
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:09,216
um, a bunch of lamps--
Leo needs to fix those--

629
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:10,425
and oh--oh, yes.

630
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:11,885
A hanging chair.

631
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,054
That's cute, Paige, but it's not gonna work.

632
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:17,516
See, the government wouldn't
have faked your deaths

633
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:19,393
unless they had a damn good reason,

634
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:21,562
and none of this changes that.

635
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:24,898
Maybe you should just think of all those
great big stories you're missing out on

636
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:26,608
while you're wasting time on us.

637
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:30,154
See, we're never gonna talk,
so this is all you're gonna get.

638
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:38,453
Let's go. No story here.

639
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:50,215
Damn it.

640
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:01,685
What did you say to them ?

641
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,688
It doesn't matter because I'm pretty
sure Billie is in trouble, again.

642
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:13,197
I've come too far,
acquired too many powers to let

643
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:15,866
a little witch like you embarrass me.

644
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:17,993
It won't happen again.

645
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:31,381
We don't have much time.
He's gonna track her here sooner or later.

646
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:32,883
Hey, is the press still outside ?

647
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:34,510
I don't know.
I'm afraid to look.

648
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:37,221
Did you use, um, mandrake root
or mustard seed ?

649
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:38,555
Mandrake root.

650
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:40,974
Now, why didn't you tell us
what you were doing ?

651
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:42,434
How come you hid it from us ?

652
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,019
Because I thought I could handle it.

653
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:45,604
I didn't want you guys to give up on me.

654
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,231
Now, why you think that ?

655
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:49,441
Well, I overheard you and Piper
talking yesterday about

656
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:51,819
how you didn't think
I could handle all this,

657
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:53,695
and I just didn't want it to be true.

658
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:56,698
Why did you think erasing bad memories
could help you vanquish the demon ?

659
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:58,575
I don't know.
All I know is it didn't work.

660
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,910
Magic can't erase fears.

661
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:01,954
They're part of what makes us what we are,

662
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:04,665
and the only way to overcome
them is to actually face them.

663
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:07,000
I don't want face this one.

664
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:09,962
Face what ?

665
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:15,509
The night my sister was taken.

666
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:20,305
My mom was putting us both to bed,
and it was raining outside.

667
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:25,727
Christy, I'm telling Mom !

668
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,646
Big scaredy-cat.

669
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:53,088
That was the last me I ever saw her.

670
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:54,798
So you have faced this demon before.

671
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,384
No, I haven't. The Dogan is different.

672
00:36:57,426 --> 00:36:58,677
I know that now, but

673
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:01,847
he just reminded me of the one
that took Christy.

674
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:03,932
What did your parents do ?

675
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,809
Nothing.
I was never allowed to talk about it.

676
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,478
They just told me an evil man kidnapped her.

677
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,272
They didn't tell you it was a demon ?

678
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:12,107
They didn't know anything about demons.

679
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:14,318
They just thought I saw
a monster under the bed

680
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,486
or something like that.

681
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:17,446
They thought I made the whole thing up.

682
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,406
And now you know you didn't.

683
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:24,119
Move and she dies.

684
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:28,749
Don't worry.

685
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:31,168
Ok, what now ?

686
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:32,544
We trust her.

687
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:40,802
I should've known you were working
for the Charmed Ones.

688
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,181
It explains the hubris.

689
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:47,601
Actually, it seems I've mistaken
you for somebody else.

690
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:51,271
Really ? Who ?

691
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:33,981
Hey.

692
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,233
Trick-or-treat.

693
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:38,986
Let me guess.
You're a witch.

694
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:40,863
Always.

695
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:43,991
Can we talk ?

696
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:45,909
Ah, sure.

697
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,252
It's not gonna work out, is it ?

698
00:38:57,713 --> 00:38:59,298
I don't know.

699
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:02,342
I mean, we've just--
we've been through so much,

700
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,179
you know, so fast...

701
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:06,805
too fast.

702
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,893
Maybe we need to take things slower.

703
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:15,522
Of course, uh, considering we've
already been married and divorced,

704
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:17,566
it's not gonna be easy.

705
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:20,360
It's true.

706
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:26,575
Regardless...
I don't like where things sit.

707
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:28,911
I don't either.

708
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:38,587
I thought I was pregnant
and I didn't know how to tell you.

709
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:40,464
Are you ?

710
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:44,009
No, I'm not, but I thought I was.

711
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:46,845
And it scared the hell out of me.

712
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:49,014
Not because I didn't want to be.

713
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:51,058
I did, but I.. eh...

714
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:56,188
It's too fast.

715
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:58,315
Yeah.

716
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:04,988
What's the point of having premonitions
if they don't even work out ?

717
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:07,032
They always work out.

718
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,995
It's just sometime they don't work
out the way you thought that they would.

719
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:14,915
So when do we go from here ?

720
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:22,130
I guess... we just take it slow,

721
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,093
you know, and try to figure out
how we feel about each other

722
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:30,556
without the magic.

723
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,526
Trick-or-treat !

724
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:45,571
Wow ! Look at you guys.
Are you a pirate ?

725
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:49,783
Wow, and a dinosaur,
and a very scary ghost.

726
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:52,035
Not as scary as mine was.

727
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,540
Ok, guys, take as much as you want.

728
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,167
Oh, careful, careful, careful.

729
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:01,420
Easy now. Easy careful. Oops. Pass it back.

730
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:04,298
There you guys go. Ok, have a great night.

731
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:05,799
It's candy riot.

732
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,593
Bye. Be careful.

733
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:09,553
I think we just got robbed.

734
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:10,637
I think so.

735
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,514
Oh, my goodness.

736
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:16,101
Hey, um, if you want to go
trick-or-treating with Leo and Wyatt,

737
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:17,186
I can watch Chris.

738
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:20,689
Oh, no. That's ok. I think, uh,
Leo and I need some space.

739
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:22,566
Apparently, we're having some issues.

740
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:25,360
I hope it's nothing serious.

741
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:27,571
No. You know, I don't think so.

742
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:30,115
I think just with everything
that's been going on,

743
00:41:30,282 --> 00:41:32,659
we've taken each other
for granted a little bit,

744
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:34,953
and, you know, we'll be fine.

745
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,371
I hope so.

746
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:38,165
Yeah, well, now that, you know,

747
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:41,668
all the press is gone and things'll
calm down a little bit.

748
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:45,506
Yeah, except for the demons.

749
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:46,715
Buzz kill.

750
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,010
What ? They know we're back.
It's only a matter of time.

751
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:53,263
I know, but, you know, we've got
Billie to pick up the slack.

752
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:54,431
She can do it.

753
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:56,183
Ya think ?

754
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:58,393
Yeah. What do you mean ?

755
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,437
She handled The Dogan ok, didn't she ?

756
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:02,898
Yeah. I mean, just the whole thing about

757
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:07,402
her discovering that her sister
was kidnapped by a demon.

758
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:10,447
I don't know how soon
she's gonna get over that one.
