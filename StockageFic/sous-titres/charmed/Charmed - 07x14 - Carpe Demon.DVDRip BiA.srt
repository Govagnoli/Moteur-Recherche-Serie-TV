1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,506
Yeah, I get that, Rex, but I need you at
the club. You're supposed to be there.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,091
Valentine's Day is gonna be
a very busy night.

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,511
Can you ask her to marry you
another night?

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,722
- Get off that phone.
- You know what, I'll handle it.

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,891
Good luck. I hope she says no.

6
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,894
Take a look at this.
This is the new face of evil.

7
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,730
His name is John Normand.
He owns the phone company,

8
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,608
and he's been stealing
from us for months!

9
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,361
- Doesn't that just make you angry?
- Not really.

10
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,989
He's been stealing from us, and
he's probably gonna get away with it

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,991
due to some loophole or something.

12
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,119
I'm more worried about
the actual demons in the world,

13
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,788
the ones we almost got rid of.

14
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,123
There's nothing
we can do about them.

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,044
The demons are gonna attack
when they're gonna attack.

16
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:49,341
And when they do, we're just gonna be
right back to the same old... Wow!

17
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,885
Whoa! You're not kidding. Wow!

18
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,055
Okeydokey.

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,058
Speaking of which,

20
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,894
could you do me a favour
and watch the boys tonight?

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,105
I need Leo to help me set up at P3,

22
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,816
and apparently, my manager
is busy proposing.

23
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,986
Yeah, sure. I mean,
it's not like anyone's proposing to me

24
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,489
or like anyone's sending me flowers
or reciting me poetry.

25
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,033
So much for the little girl
I saw in my vision.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,744
Phoebe, just because
the Avatars are gone

27
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,913
doesn't mean you won't find love.

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,333
- Easy for you to say. You have Leo.
- Yeah, but do I really?

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,254
It's a matter of time before the Elders
punish him for becoming an Avatar,

30
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,424
which they drove him to anyway
with Gideon and everything.

31
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,010
They made Kyle a Whitelighter.
That's good.

32
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,137
Yeah, but it took him away from Paige.

33
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,931
They got their cosmic jollies
off that one.

34
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,851
- Where is Paige?
- At Magic School, where else? Why?

35
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,520
Just worried about her, that's all.

36
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,983
It really is another great application.

37
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,902
A muse? No, no, no, no.

38
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,863
You can't hire her
as the next literature professor.

39
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,491
She'll inspire them to write novels
instead of reading them.

40
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,369
Oh, that's a good point.
I hadn't thought of that.

41
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,539
Well, I did. And that's
why you should hire me.

42
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,667
- What? You want to be a teacher?
- Isn't it time I moved up?

43
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,213
I had a great rapport
with the last literature professor.

44
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,217
You hated that little gnome, arguing
five minutes before he was killed.

45
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,762
Well, that was our way.
Besides, if the truth were told,

46
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,472
he'd want me to have the job.

47
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,475
- I'm very well-read.
- It takes more than that, though.

48
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,520
It takes being able to really connect
with the students.

49
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,230
I can do that.

50
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,775
In fact, I've got some tricks
you don't even know about.

51
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,367
Did you astral project?

52
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:41,662
Mrs Winterbourne taught me
before she went on sabbatical.

53
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,374
Don't worry, I'll get used to it.

54
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,667
Trust me.

55
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,670
I am the best candidate for this job.

56
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,547
What the hell is?

57
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,764
That's gonna leave a mark.

58
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,225
Sorry about the table.

59
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,352
Are you okay?

60
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,438
Who are you?

61
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,192
I'm the new teacher.

62
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,419
You ride in here and nearly kill us,
and now you want to teach here?

63
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,130
If I taught parallel parking,
you'd have a point,

64
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,798
but I'm here for literature.

65
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,593
- And what do you know about literature?
- Plenty.

66
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,012
My résumé.

67
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,225
Drake.

68
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,229
Well, maybe you should have sent
this in so you didn't waste your time.

69
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,733
Oh, I never waste my time.
For life is but a walking shadow,

70
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,028
the poor player who struts and frets
his hour upon the stage

71
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,447
and then is heard no more.
It is a tale...

72
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,407
- Tale told...
- Take it, sister.

73
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:46,036
...by an idiot, full of sound and fury,

74
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,288
- signifying...
- Nothing.

75
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,624
You two are not gonna make
this easy for me.

76
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,960
What are you talking about?
No contest.

77
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,296
It's right there on the résumé.
I studied at Juilliard,

78
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,007
performed on Broadway,
and I was penning a memoir

79
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,176
that I intend to finish on my deathbed.

80
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,887
- I look forward to reading that.
- Thank you.

81
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,849
Why aren't these credits
more than a year long?

82
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,851
Simple. Before that I was a demon.

83
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,479
- What, a demon?
- Was a demon. Now human.

84
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,023
Okay, and how exactly did that happen?

85
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,943
Personally, I hate exposition,
but if... All right.

86
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,196
Fifty weeks ago I made a deal,
the Sorcerer made me human.

87
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,533
- Just like that?
- There were a few minor stipulations.

88
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,785
First of all, I get to keep my powers,

89
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:31,123
and if I use them
in any offensive manner,

90
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,543
he gets them,
and I burn for all eternity.

91
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,087
What are you waiting for?
Vanquish him!

92
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,090
Vanq... Lady! Vanquish.

93
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,093
I just want a chance to make up
for my demon days.

94
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,763
If you don't believe me,
look into my history.

95
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,224
I've got almost nothing to hide.

96
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,476
We'll see about that.

97
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:55,355
- Miss Donovan, where are you going?
- To prove that he's dangerous!

98
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,859
If that is safety, then I am dangerous.

99
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,320
Boy, is she gonna be sorry
when I get the job.

100
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,698
Not so fast,
Mr Pompadour Motorcycle Guy.

101
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,910
I don't know what to make of you.

102
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,913
Why don't we consult
the Book of Shadows? Want a ride?

103
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,709
Okay, next.

104
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,085
That one's ripped.

105
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,087
So? The crowd will be too.

106
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,924
This is taking far too long.
Where's my staple gun?

107
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,220
Since when do you staple decorations?
Don't you want everything to be perfect?

108
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,722
It's all gonna be torn down
tomorrow anyway.

109
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,974
The point is not to worry
about tomorrow.

110
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,685
The point is to stop
and enjoy Valentine's Day.

111
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,562
Well, some people can't forget.

112
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,482
Some people would rather see
the rips and the flaws

113
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,736
so that they're not totally devastated
when they're all torn down tomorrow.

114
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,822
We're not talking about decorations
anymore, are we?

115
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,909
Leo, I'm sorry, but I can't just
stand here and pretend

116
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,662
like everything is not
falling apart again.

117
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,790
We both know that the Elders
are not gonna be easy on you.

118
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:58,043
When you change the world,
you gotta expect consequences.

119
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,337
The Elders brought this on themselves.

120
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,590
It's as much their fault as it is ours,
maybe even more so.

121
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:07,386
I'm the one that chose to become
an Avatar. I betrayed them.

122
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,930
Because they drove you to it,
with Gideon,

123
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,975
what he did to Chris
and what he tried to do to Wyatt.

124
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:17,145
- I don't think they'll see it that way.
- You need to make them see it that way,

125
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,649
or else this may be the last
Valentine's Day we spend together.

126
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,988
Your leads are worthless,
bounty hunter!

127
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,992
I'm not the one who lost Drake in
the first place. That was you, Sorcerer.

128
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,661
Well, I never dreamt
I'd need to keep tabs on him.

129
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,081
By now, I thought he
would have used his powers.

130
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,958
And yet he hasn't.

131
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,588
He's stronger than I thought,
which is why you must find him

132
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,007
so I can force him
to give in to temptation.

133
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:49,970
- But we are running out of time.
- In more ways than one, Mr Rathbone.

134
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,015
Zankou is moving in
to take over the Underworld.

135
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:57,144
If I expect to stop him
and to seise the throne for myself,

136
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,189
I must have Drake's powers!

137
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,276
I'll double the bounty, but find him.

138
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,988
Sir, excuse me, sir.
We have a new lead.

139
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,449
A woman? You call that a lead?

140
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,368
We caught her in the Underworld
asking about Drake.

141
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,747
- She may know where he is.
- Ah, is that so?

142
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,293
I don't know anything! Let me go!

143
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,464
Think harder, my dear.

144
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,385
No, you cannot put me
on hold again.

145
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,639
Now when are you gonna send me
a refund for my phone bill?

146
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,517
What do you mean, never?
Look, this is...

147
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,354
You know what? Forget it.
I have call waiting anyway,

148
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,982
which you're probably
overcharging me for, right?

149
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,319
- Hello?
- Hey, Phoebe, it's Darryl.

150
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,948
Darryl, shouldn't you be out
arresting that thief John Normand?

151
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,910
- Did you read the paper today?
- We got bigger things to worry about.

152
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,163
- Sheridan's back.
- What?

153
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,541
Oh, no. Any more good news?

154
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,335
Your friend Brody
came to visit me last night

155
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,171
and told me that he brought her
out of the coma.

156
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,881
Didn't you say he died?

157
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,218
Yeah, well, I never said it stuck.
He became a Whitelighter.

158
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,554
The point is he did
some mumbo jumbo on her

159
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,848
where she doesn't remember anything.

160
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,517
- Well, does she remember us?
- I don't know yet.

161
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:22,020
He told me to tell her that they
went on some undercover mission

162
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,523
and that he died
and she wound up in a coma.

163
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,942
Just how long do you
expect her to buy that?

164
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:30,571
I don't know. If we don't trigger
her memory, we should be fine.

165
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,574
- What do you mean, trigger?
- Her memory could come back

166
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,076
if she's reminded.
You have to keep her away.

167
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,329
- Phoebe! I need you upstairs.
- Okay. Coming.

168
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:43,208
Darryl, I gotta go. You'll have
to deal with this like the rest of us.

169
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,835
Phoebe...

170
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,380
Phoebe. Do I know her?

171
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,468
I don't know. Do you?

172
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,851
See? Right there.
You have nothing to fear.

173
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:04,062
What are you talking about?
It says that you have the power

174
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,357
to fire a thermal blast that can
knock out ten demons at a time.

175
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,236
If I use them, then the Sorcerer
gets them, and that would be bad.

176
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,656
It also says that I can be vanquished
by the Power of Three.

177
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,075
Hello. See? Right there.

178
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,371
- What?
- You touched it.

179
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,790
- What?
- You touched the Book.

180
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,584
Oh, my God. So I did.

181
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,045
I guess that means I'm good.
The Book...

182
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,923
Stop it! Maybe it does,
and maybe it doesn't.

183
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,759
The Book has been tricked before.
So have we.

184
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:37,596
- Just recently, as a matter of fact.
- All right, then, that explains it.

185
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:42,267
So, what did this mistake cost you?
A colleague? A friend? A lover?

186
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:46,230
- Actually, all of the above.
- No wonder you're so indecisive.

187
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:50,275
I'm not indecisive.
You think I'm indecisive?

188
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,362
Paige, making mistakes
is what makes us human.

189
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,114
Hey, sorry.
I put the boys down for a nap.

190
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,158
Who are you?

191
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,701
- Hi.
- Hi.

192
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,497
Drake, Phoebe. Phoebe, Drake.
Yeah. He's an ex-demon.

193
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,207
What? Excuse me?

194
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:09,253
I thought you guys had lots of
experience with demons who were human.

195
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,798
- You married one, didn't you?
- And divorced. How did you know?

196
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:17,135
Gossip, around the office cauldron.

197
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,638
Anyway, the point is, girls,

198
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:23,851
you don't know what it's like to be
judged simply by the way you were born.

199
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,228
Look well at me and tell me,

200
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:29,481
with what hope this vile protuberance
can inspire my heart?

201
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,609
- He's very dramatic.
- I see that.

202
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,444
I don't know why Cyrano's here.

203
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,155
He should leave because
we have our own problems.

204
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:41,535
But, my dear Roxanne,
feel'st thou my soul, here?

205
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,289
Then again, I don't have a date
for Valentine's Day. He's kinda hot.

206
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,167
Until you figure out
how many people he's killed.

207
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,586
Wait a minute. I never killed anyone.

208
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,172
Except demons. Killed plenty of them.

209
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,465
Join the club. It sucks, doesn't it?

210
00:11:55,632 --> 00:12:00,387
In your whole demonic career,
you have not killed one innocent?

211
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:04,099
That's because since the day
I was hatched, I've been reading books,

212
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:08,645
and they taught me about feelings,
human feelings, love, sadness, death.

213
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,356
Since then I could never
harm an innocent.

214
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,276
I always found a way
around doing that.

215
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,529
- What do you think?
- I kind of believe him. You?

216
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,073
I don't know. I'm gonna ask Piper.

217
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,576
Come on, tell her
I'm the right man for the job.

218
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:27,706
- Job? What job?
- Fill her in. I'll be back.

219
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,877
So you... you like Gene Kelly movies?

220
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,004
Love 'em. Why?

221
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,137
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course. It's the least we could do.

222
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,556
Oh, please, don't apologise.

223
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,267
If anything, we've been
far too lenient with him.

224
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,354
Lenient? You tried to kill me.

225
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,273
- You left us no choice.
- Funny, I feel the same way.

226
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,776
Gentlemen, neither side
is without blame.

227
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,362
Perhaps we could put
the past behind us.

228
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,613
And we will...

229
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,742
...once he's done
the penance for his betrayal.

230
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,452
That's why I brought you here.

231
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,831
I should be able to defend myself
before you issue judgment.

232
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,500
Really? And what would you say?

233
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,627
That what I did was for my family.

234
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,672
I tried to create a better world
for them, for all of us.

235
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,299
- Too bad you failed.
- Perhaps it would be best

236
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,594
if Leo and I spoke alone,
if you don't mind.

237
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,684
It hasn't been easy
arguing on your behalf.

238
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:31,728
- Thanks for trying.
- One word of advice, Leo.

239
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,480
Stay out of magical affairs.

240
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,067
Or you just might make things
even worse for yourself.

241
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,740
Wow, let me get this straight.

242
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,576
You do musical theatre as well?

243
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,953
Oh, I'm full of surprises.

244
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,290
What's this?

245
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,916
Another surprise.

246
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,774
Happy Valentine's Day.

247
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,776
And to you.

248
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,239
Get your paws off of her!

249
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,200
So much for romance.

250
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:30,621
Piper. We were just having fun.
You know, fun.

251
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,872
With the demon?

252
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,959
Phoebe, how many times have I told you
not to play dress up with the demons.

253
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,505
- I'm sure it's harmless.
- Incidentally, I am an ex-demon.

254
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:43,842
Look, buddy, we're not gonna let a demon
or an ex-demon teach at Magic School.

255
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,428
- It's ridiculous.
- Maybe you're right.

256
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:50,974
Drake, I'm really sorry. It's just not
a real feasible thing for you to do.

257
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,851
It could cause too many problems.

258
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,312
Oh, no, you're making
a terrible mistake.

259
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,357
As an ex-demon,
I can get through to these kids,

260
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,776
keep them from going down
the path of evil.

261
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:03,111
Phoebe, talk to 'em,
make 'em see reason.

262
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,074
I can't. Look, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

263
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:10,786
but it just...
it's not really practical. I'm sorry.

264
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,412
This is all wrong.

265
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,040
The problem here isn't me.
It's you three.

266
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:18,043
You're shaken by
what's happened with the Avatars.

267
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,629
You, you just lost faith in yourself,

268
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:23,340
and you, you've been
disheartened by the fight.

269
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,260
And you, sweetheart,
you are just plain mean.

270
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,886
Watch it.

271
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,557
You're mean because
you closed down your heart.

272
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:35,561
You're petrified it's gonna get
broken again, aren't you?

273
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:39,606
You know, there's only one man I know
who can solve all of these problems.

274
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,447
Well, come on, Robin Hood.

275
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,659
You, I'm gonna hire you
just so I can fire you.

276
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,578
Do we look merry to you?

277
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,372
You should see the world
as Robin Hood would have.

278
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:58,584
He believed in himself,
also loved the thrill of the fight.

279
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,088
Despite the threat of imminent death,
he found love with his dear Maid Marian.

280
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:07,217
That's very sweet. Isn't that?

281
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,513
You should probably change us back.

282
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,140
Very well.

283
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,731
Kitchen, now, let's go.

284
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,152
You just give me one second.

285
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,280
I thought they'd never leave.

286
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,744
Vanquish him, are you sure?

287
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,121
If he doesn't leave,
we don't have a choice.

288
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,207
But his heart is in the right place.

289
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:42,044
Now, let's see those powers, demon.

290
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,964
On the other hand,
he still has his demonic powers.

291
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,717
Hi, waffle much?

292
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,846
Darkness within cannot be undone.

293
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,015
Embrace your true self.

294
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,267
Here we go again!

295
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,439
Damn it!

296
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,817
Drake. Are you okay?

297
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,819
Drake? Who's Drake?

298
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,404
I'm Robin...

299
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,199
...of Locksley.

300
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,535
Of course you are.

301
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,416
Stand and deliver!

302
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,419
Excellent.

303
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,089
John will be no match for me.

304
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,592
Robin, you missed.
And if you put a hole in my wall,

305
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,095
you'll have me to answer to,
not some prince.

306
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:34,763
My apologies, my good woman,

307
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,766
but my aim must be true
if I am to right John's wrongs.

308
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,061
Right. Just be careful.

309
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:46,984
Please tell me you found a way
to fix Robin in there.

310
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,945
- Not yet. Can't you just freeze him?
- Not freezing.

311
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:53,282
I'm sorry, you guys. Another
big mistake bringing him here.

312
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,785
No, it's just our lives. Anything
that can go wrong will go wrong.

313
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,454
Yeah, but I don't understand
why it went wrong.

314
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:03,834
Why does the Sorcerer want to turn
Drake into Robin Hood, of all things?

315
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:07,963
I think he meant to bring out Drake's
inner demon so he could use his powers.

316
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,593
But then I blasted him mid-spell,
so instead we got his inner Robin Hood.

317
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,470
Royal hound!
Sorry, my fault!

318
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:19,349
- Another mistake for the Charmed Ones.
- It was an accident.

319
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,268
Either way, we messed up.

320
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:24,646
Okay. I found a vanquishing potion
for the Sorcerer,

321
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,399
but of course,
there's no way to find him.

322
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:30,777
How is finding the Sorcerer
even gonna fix Drake anyway?

323
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,281
Actually, I think it will because,
if we vanquish the Sorcerer,

324
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,159
- then it should reverse his magic.
- Saxon dog!

325
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:40,621
Okay, well, I'll go to the Magic School,

326
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,332
and I'll ask Miss Donovan
to look through things

327
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:46,960
and see if she can find something
that helps us find the Sorcerer.

328
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,795
You could just do it yourself.

329
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,507
Yeah, well, I don't know
the archives that well.

330
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,009
And, knowing me,
I'd probably mess up.

331
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,056
- What are we gonna do with her?
- We'll fix her later.

332
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:01,308
Right now, we need to deal with him.

333
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:07,314
What is he doing with my phone bill?

334
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:10,400
Marian, these taxes are outrageous.

335
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,986
Prince John has gone too far.

336
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,365
Okay, I'm not Marian, I'm Phoebe,
remember? And give me that!

337
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:20,452
Prince John has been dead for centuries.
He's not taxing anyone anymore.

338
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:24,623
The phone company is owned by
a different John, a really swell guy.

339
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,835
The evidence of his misdeeds
is there on the parchment.

340
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,628
- You left that out?
- Who knew?

341
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,089
I think it's high time
I paid John a visit.

342
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,340
My steed!

343
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,844
Horsepower.

344
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,764
What kind of Robin Hood
rides a motorcycle?

345
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,809
What are we gonna do?
We can't let him go out there,

346
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,769
especially with Sheridan back.

347
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,522
- Sheridan's back?
- Did I forget to mention that?

348
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:49,773
- Go with him.
- What?

349
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,817
You're the Marian person.

350
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,318
Robin, wait.

351
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,365
Here we go. Oh, okay.

352
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,742
Helmets please, people.

353
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,830
Hold on, milady.

354
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:33,066
No Prince John here.
We should probably go home, huh?

355
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,944
And give up without a fight?
I think not.

356
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:40,949
Those riches belong to the people
of Sherwood Forest.

357
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,701
We must see they're returned.

358
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:46,747
We can't steal from the rich and give
to the poor. There's laws against that.

359
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:49,500
Marian, have you forgotten
what it is to do good?

360
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,337
Next in line!

361
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:55,214
Hey, that guy's cutting.

362
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,091
Hey, hey, Pocahontas. There's a line.

363
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,303
Little John. You came to join
our merry band. Excellent.

364
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,430
Who are you calling little?

365
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:07,184
- Excuse me?
- You want to fight me? Is that it?

366
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:10,270
- No, no, no, no. No, Robin.
- You've put on a bit of girth.

367
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,773
I'm the office manager.
Is there a problem?

368
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,610
- This nutjob's trying to butt in line!
- He doesn't know any better.

369
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,947
- You will tell me where Prince John is.
- Who?

370
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,156
Prince John.

371
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:24,201
We don't want to kill the peasants.
That's not what we do.

372
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:26,829
He's an accomplice
to the prince's thievery.

373
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:30,123
- What? I didn't steal anything.
- The hell you didn't.

374
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,209
I know you've been screwing us.

375
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:35,379
Now I can't afford to take
my wife out for Valentine's Day.

376
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:38,090
They cut off my phone service
for no reason.

377
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:40,634
Now they want
to charge me to re-connect it.

378
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:44,471
What about their lousy technicians?
I wasted a day waitin' on 'em.

379
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:48,392
See, you're making all our lives
miserable. Kick his ass, Robin!

380
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,144
No, just tell him
where John Normand is.

381
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,647
Headquarters, financial district.

382
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:57,526
- We'll find it. Come on!
- Just don't tell him I sent you.

383
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:02,322
Good people of Sherwood, the prince
has abused his power for far too long.

384
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,492
He lives in riches
while you live in squalor.

385
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:09,246
It is high time we take back
that which was stolen from you.

386
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:12,040
All of you who wish
to join my fight, you follow me!

387
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,667
Yeah!

388
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,883
Stand down if you know
what's good for you.

389
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:26,555
Hey! What are you doing?

390
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:30,893
Marian, you're just in time.
To the end of Prince John's tyranny!

391
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,686
You can't do this!

392
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,272
Look what the prince has done
to these people.

393
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:37,357
How can you turn a blind eye to that?

394
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,776
Or has your heart
really grown that cold?

395
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,864
Fill your hearts and fill your bellies!

396
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,075
The police are coming.
We gotta go. Let's go.

397
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:49,786
Excuse me.

398
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,303
Oh, please. Please...

399
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,765
So you can astral project.

400
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:12,684
That could come in very handy later.

401
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:18,273
Morning, sunshine.

402
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,817
What do you want with me?

403
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:24,571
I'm afraid I couldn't bring the demon
out of Drake as I'd planned.

404
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,991
- I was interrupted by the Charmed Ones.
- They'll come for you.

405
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:31,912
Which is why I need you to serve
as a distraction when the time is right.

406
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,707
Oh, why did I ever come down here?
I should have stayed in the library!

407
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:40,379
The library? Well, then
you are indeed a prize.

408
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:41,713
Why? What do you mean?

409
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,508
The witches' interference
made my spell go awry.

410
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:48,387
Drake is unstable now, and I need
to use this to my advantage.

411
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,431
So tell me...

412
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:56,144
...what do you know
about Robin Hood?

413
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,775
No, Phoebe, you can't take him
to John Normand's office.

414
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:05,445
That is a very bad idea.
You have to bring him back here.

415
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:09,074
I said you have
to bring him back here!

416
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:11,535
Phoebe. Phoebe!

417
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:13,954
Damn it!

418
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:18,375
Do I really need this today?
Or ever?

419
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,043
Relax. You can handle it.

420
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,796
This coming from the man
who refuses to help.

421
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:25,966
I told you, I'm afraid that
I'm gonna piss off the Elders,

422
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:29,386
and they can recycle me, Piper.
You don't want that, do you?

423
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:33,515
Of course not. But it's just, we were
this close to a life without Elders,

424
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:37,728
without demons, without freaking
Robin Hood running through the streets,

425
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:39,313
threatening to expose us.

426
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,690
I know, but this is the life
that we have now,

427
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:44,109
and we have to make
the best out of it, okay?

428
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:47,946
So relax, you can handle it,
just like you've done before.

429
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,699
Thank you, and don't remind me.

430
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:56,163
- Have you guys seen the news?
- No. Weren't you at Magic School?

431
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,831
Yeah! We have satellite.

432
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:05,130
He apparently threw the stolen cash
into the crowd, inciting a near riot.

433
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:07,466
Police have launched
a search for the man

434
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:10,886
who bystanders described
as a modern-day Robin Hood.

435
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,639
Still think I can handle this one?

436
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:16,433
- Just like the good old days.
- Bite your tongue.

437
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,769
Okay, you know what?
I should warn Darryl.

438
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:21,271
The cops have no idea
what they're up against.

439
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:23,941
Wait. I need you to write
a vanquishing spell.

440
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:27,319
- Why? You have the potion.
- Not for the Sorcerer, for Drake.

441
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:30,948
- For Drake? Really?
- We need to be able to stop him.

442
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:34,785
And this may be the only way.
Leo, can you warn Darryl?

443
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,328
What about the Elders?

444
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:39,706
I don't think they'll strike you down
for making a phone call.

445
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,124
Right.

446
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,586
You know what?
I found a spell at Magic School.

447
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,922
It should be able
to summon the Sorcerer.

448
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:49,258
That way we don't have
to vanquish Drake.

449
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:53,220
- You mean Miss Donovan found it?
- No. I found it.

450
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,475
Come to think of it, I haven't actually
seen Miss Donovan in a while.

451
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,270
Look, anyway, the point is,
with my spell,

452
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:04,857
we can summon the Sorcerer.
With your potion we can vanquish him.

453
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:07,276
That fixes the whole
Drake thing, yeah?

454
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:10,070
Maybe, but if that doesn't work,
we need a plan B.

455
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:12,406
We've gotta stop Drake somehow.

456
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:15,075
- Well, I guess it can't hurt.
- Exactly.

457
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:18,745
The last thing we need is another
news report like that one.

458
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:23,000
- He's a what?
- An ex-demon.

459
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:25,502
But he still has powers, so be careful.

460
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,463
You don't want the cops
to provoke him too much.

461
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,175
If Sheridan finds out,
that could be a trigger.

462
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,801
- Sorry?
- For her memory.

463
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:36,597
If she remembers she was after them,
then she'll be all over us again.

464
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,807
Oh, then, you can't let her find out.

465
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:40,267
Thanks for the tip, Leo.

466
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:47,399
Good news, lieutenant.
The captain wants us to work together.

467
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:51,403
So where are we going, partner?

468
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:57,993
Hey, what's the matter with you, moron!

469
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,788
So we're just gonna talk to the guy,
right? We're not gonna kill him.

470
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,332
No, of course not.

471
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:06,251
As long as he promises
to give back every last penny.

472
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:10,464
What do you mean, every last penny?
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.

473
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:13,800
Marian, you've come so far.

474
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,428
You must be strong enough
to finish the fight,

475
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:19,306
for those who cannot
fight for themselves.

476
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:21,600
Do not let all we've done be for naught.

477
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,770
- Darryl.
- The Sheriff of Nottingham.

478
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:26,730
It's about time he arrived.

479
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,357
Freeze!

480
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:34,321
- Sheridan.
- Marian! Marian!

481
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:36,532
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

482
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,036
Yeah, I'm fine.
But you're under arrest.

483
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,165
- Where's the other one?
- He got away.

484
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,003
Prince John!

485
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:54,007
We meet at last.

486
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,134
What the hell is this?

487
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:57,469
The end of your reign.

488
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,979
You'll never make it out of here.

489
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,731
The cops will have you
inside of two minutes.

490
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,859
You need not worry about me, sire.

491
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:15,779
What exactly do you want from me?
Did my ex-wife send you?

492
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:17,865
I'm here to rob you.

493
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,491
Of course.

494
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:23,996
Well, in that case,
we'd better get right to it,

495
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:26,707
and you can be on your merry way.

496
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:28,709
Now, who should I make this out to?

497
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:33,005
You will return all that you have stolen
to every last person in your domain.

498
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:38,135
- But I have millions of customers.
- Then I suggest you get started.

499
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,272
Hold your position, and nobody
make a move unless I say so.

500
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,691
You should really get
that wound checked.

501
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:54,568
No, thanks. I've missed enough.

502
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:57,738
Miss Halliwell was telling me
a very interesting story.

503
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,573
Wait, you don't believe me?

504
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,617
I think it's a little far-fetched.

505
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:04,369
You get kidnapped by Robin Hood,

506
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,246
forced to go on a crime spree,

507
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:09,625
only to be saved in the end by us.
That's a nice touch.

508
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,127
Let her go, Sheridan. She's a friend.

509
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:15,464
Hey, you know what?
Sheridan, I'm a good person.

510
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:21,261
I really think that I can help you out
in this situation if you'd just let me.

511
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:24,765
- Do you really think you can?
- Yeah, I do.

512
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:27,809
He and I have a connection.
He's a little messed up now,

513
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:30,479
but I really think I could
break through to him.

514
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,272
But I gotta talk to him.

515
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:36,235
That's out of the question.
It's dangerous, and it breaks procedure.

516
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:39,238
He's dangerous. You have
no idea what he's capable of.

517
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,073
Lieutenant, we're in position.

518
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,867
- We've got a clear shot.
- Hold your fire.

519
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:46,328
She's going in.

520
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:49,998
- What? Morris...
- That's an order, inspector.

521
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,544
Thank you, Darryl.

522
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:59,341
You know, there's something
oddly familiar about all this.

523
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:01,385
You should get that wound checked.

524
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:14,731
Sorcerer of darkness, demon of fright
I call you now into my sight

525
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,027
Maybe I can just try it again.

526
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:22,156
No, Paige, you've tried
three times. It's not working.

527
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:24,408
He must be protecting
himself somehow.

528
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:26,743
I could have copied it down wrong.

529
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,413
Paige, it's not your first day
as a witch.

530
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,207
It's just...
We're running out of options.

531
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:35,335
You saw the news.
I think it's time we go to plan B.

532
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:38,088
I think getting rid of him
would be a big mistake.

533
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:40,340
So would letting an innocent die.

534
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:43,635
Look, if you're not gonna trust
yourself, at least trust me

535
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:46,013
because it's certainly not my first day.

536
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,347
Paige!

537
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:51,059
Miss Donovan!
Why are you astral projecting?

538
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:54,229
Later. I don't have time.
The Sorcerer took me prisoner.

539
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:55,647
What?

540
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,150
I swear, I was just trying
to check out Drake.

541
00:30:58,317 --> 00:30:59,985
It turns out he's not so bad.

542
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:03,197
It was the Sorcerer that I
should have been worried about.

543
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:06,658
We know all about it. Don't panic.
Now that we know where you are,

544
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:10,204
we can scry for you and get you
out of there and just vanquish him.

545
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,873
Oh, thank you! Now I gotta go.

546
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:17,878
Looks like Drake just got a reprieve.

547
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,845
Well played, my dear.

548
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:29,765
I wish I could have told them
what you were planning.

549
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:31,808
If you had, you'd be dead by now.

550
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:36,563
At least now, you'll live a touch longer
than the Charmed Ones will.

551
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,484
You see, thanks to your message,
they're not focused on saving you.

552
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:44,238
Too bad my lair is protected against
summoning and scrying.

553
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:47,282
It won't take them long
to figure it out.

554
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,160
But by then I'll have Drake's powers.

555
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:51,829
How can you be so sure?

556
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:54,331
Well, you see, once a demon,
always a demon.

557
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:59,670
I just need to remind Drake of that,
by casting a spell on Prince John.

558
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,844
Come on, you cannot expect me
to write all these checks.

559
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,472
Oh, Robin, don't shoot!
It's me, your Marian.

560
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:14,726
- Milady, how did you elude the sheriff?
- Oh, me and the sheriff go way back.

561
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,728
Now, listen...

562
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:19,439
Don't you think it's time
we let the prince go?

563
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:22,734
I'm sure he's learned his lesson
by now, haven't you, John?

564
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:25,237
Oh, oh, yeah. I'm...

565
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:26,905
I'm heartbroken here, man.

566
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:30,993
I didn't realise what I was doing
to those poor people. Thank you, Robin.

567
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,079
You have really shown me
the error of my ways.

568
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:38,000
- I swear, I am going to change.
- See? That's great, that's great.

569
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,960
I know you don't want to hurt him.

570
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:42,296
What about the money?
He can't be trusted.

571
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,590
If you can't trust him, then trust me.

572
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:49,428
Look, today you reminded me
what it's like to do good,

573
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:53,056
to make a difference and to help people.
Now let me help you.

574
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:56,310
Come with me, before you do
something you'll regret.

575
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:00,981
Sorry.

576
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:10,908
Oh, I cannot believe
that you actually fell for that.

577
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,202
- But...
- I mean, really.

578
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:15,913
You think I give a rat's ass
about some poor schmo

579
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,499
who's too stupid to know
he's being suckered?

580
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:21,335
There's no way in hell
I'm giving this money back.

581
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:24,046
Oh, no, the Sorcerer.

582
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:26,924
I don't think Darryl can hold off
the cops any longer.

583
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,717
You're running out of time.

584
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:31,887
What would you like me to do?
The crystal's not dropping.

585
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:34,431
This isn't right. We're being played.

586
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:37,392
You're not gonna do any of us
any good by waffling now.

587
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,186
I'm not waffling.

588
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:43,440
Look. Fine, I admit, okay,
I've been out of it

589
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:47,528
since the whole thing
with the Avatars and with Kyle.

590
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:52,491
But I can't keep beating myself up
over the mistakes that we've made.

591
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:55,869
I have to move on.
I think we all do.

592
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:01,500
- I'm not sure it's that easy.
- Maybe not but I have to try, right?

593
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:04,753
Drake said that I have to start
trusting my instincts again.

594
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,590
Otherwise, I'm not gonna be able to
help him or Miss Donovan or anybody.

595
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:12,678
- What are your instincts telling you?
- Miss Donovan's just a distraction.

596
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:15,013
Otherwise, we
would have found her by now.

597
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,267
Say you're right. So you think
the Sorcerer is after Drake?

598
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,143
He wants his powers, doesn't he?

599
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,105
Drake's bound to use those
at some point or another.

600
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,441
You will give the money back.

601
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,902
Or what? You're gonna
shoot me with an arrow?

602
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,737
Come on!

603
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,741
I'm evil. You can do better than that.

604
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,202
Don't listen to him.
He's under a spell.

605
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,496
You gotta punish me, destroy me,

606
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:42,875
or I'll keep doing evil.
And I don't give a damn who gets hurt.

607
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:46,587
Single moms, old people, kids,
even your little maid here!

608
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:51,341
She's not my maid!

609
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,055
My God!

610
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:01,435
Help me, please.

611
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:04,396
It's okay. I got ya.

612
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:11,069
I got ya!

613
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:14,865
Hello.

614
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:21,079
Looks like your instincts were right.

615
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:25,000
We believe that John Normand is being
hurled out of that window by some...

616
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:26,877
Just wish I trusted 'em sooner.

617
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:29,254
A deal is a deal.

618
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:42,643
You, off to purgatory, my boy.

619
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,902
Well, what are you waiting for?

620
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:54,363
Come and get me.

621
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:00,369
This was the scene of chaos,

622
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:03,080
just minutes ago when the man
known as Robin Hood

623
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:06,041
detonated what appears
to have been a homemade bomb.

624
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:09,253
Fortunately, billionaire
John Normand escaped injury

625
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:12,881
with the aide of local advice
columnist Phoebe Halliwell.

626
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:16,301
Piper, we don't have a choice.
We have to go after the Sorcerer.

627
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:19,805
I realise that, but he knows we're
coming. He'll set a trap for us.

628
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:21,682
The news said Drake was missing.

629
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:25,060
- No, actually, we lost him.
- But if we vanquish the Sorcerer,

630
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:28,730
we should be able to reverse the magic
and get Drake out of purgatory.

631
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:32,067
If we can use the vanquishing spell
I wrote to get rid of Drake,

632
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:34,611
it should work on
getting rid of the Sorcerer.

633
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:37,156
- How are you sure it'll work?
- I trust my gut.

634
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:40,868
- Helped us find the Sorcerer, right?
- And it was right about Drake.

635
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:45,122
We have to save him, or everything
he's done will have been for naught.

636
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:48,292
- For naught?
- The point is is we have to save Drake.

637
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:51,253
I think Drake's caused
enough trouble for one day.

638
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,548
We'll be lucky if he
doesn't trigger Sheridan's memory.

639
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:57,384
Not to mention Prince John
and all the magic he saw.

640
00:36:57,551 --> 00:37:00,721
John won't remember.
We can worry about Sheridan tomorrow.

641
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:03,223
You worry tomorrow. I'll worry today.

642
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:08,687
Found Miss Donovan.
Probably the Sorcerer too.

643
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:12,441
See? Wasn't that a little too easy?
I'm telling you, it's a trap.

644
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:16,278
Maybe we should start
thinking more like Robin Hood.

645
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:18,780
Excuse me?

646
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:22,242
It won't be long now.

647
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,453
I've lowered the cave's protections,

648
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,956
which means the Charmed Ones
are on their way.

649
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:32,252
- To vanquish you, I'm sure.
- Oh, I'm sure they'll try.

650
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:35,881
But we're on my turf now.

651
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:40,219
And they'll be no match
for my new powers.

652
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:42,679
I'm not so sure about that.

653
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:46,725
Well, well, well,
I'll give you this much.

654
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,560
You're getting better at that.

655
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:51,104
You don't even need
to be asleep anymore.

656
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:54,066
- I'm a fast learner.
- Me too.

657
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:58,070
Well, that's wonderful, but I don't
think I have time for this right now.

658
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,906
- You should make time.
- What the hell?

659
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:04,409
Because you never know...

660
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:07,496
It's true. You never know
when your time is up.

661
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:09,623
The Charmed Ones!

662
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,875
Evil blast we cannot use

663
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:14,837
The Power of Three now lights the fuse

664
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:21,760
- Nicely done.
- What about Drake?

665
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:26,265
Ow, that's hot! That's not gonna...

666
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:28,100
Drake.

667
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,185
You saved me?

668
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:33,063
Of course. What would you expect
from Maid Marian?

669
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,065
- And your Merry Men.
- Women.

670
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:37,860
Excuse me? Do you mind?

671
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,904
That was interesting, huh?

672
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:44,199
I guess. I just can't believe
we're back in the Underworld,

673
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:46,326
vanquishing demons again.

674
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:47,661
I don't know.

675
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,914
After all, it is pretty romantic,
isn't it?

676
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:53,584
- You've gotta be kidding.
- No, not at all.

677
00:38:54,126 --> 00:38:57,254
Most of the world's greatest lovers
were brought together

678
00:38:57,421 --> 00:39:00,132
during a time of epic conflict.

679
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:03,927
Most of them were doomed,
but they did find the romance in it.

680
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:06,096
So why can't you?

681
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,692
Hey. Thought you
might want to see this.

682
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:21,570
A hero.

683
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:26,492
Now, aren't you glad
you didn't arrest her?

684
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:29,369
Oh, I don't know.
She didn't help us get the guy.

685
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,456
She didn't promise to.
She promised to help.

686
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:35,792
Yeah, but still, don't you think
it's just a little weird?

687
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,587
I mean, she goes inside,
the perp gets away,

688
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:41,507
but yet there's no trail to follow,
no leads.

689
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:44,760
I mean, it's almost as though
he just disappeared.

690
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:47,262
We'll get him.

691
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,766
Good night, Sheridan.

692
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:03,195
Oh, you look great
in all your teacher-ness.

693
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:04,988
Oh, that little old thing?

694
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:10,661
Okay, well, I've brought you your class
schedule and your student roster.

695
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:13,580
And I have assigned you a TA.

696
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:15,082
Miss Donovan.

697
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:20,170
- She's not sore for being passed over?
- She got freaked out by what happened.

698
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,381
She did want to run back to the library,

699
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:25,342
but I've talked her into
helping you out in the class.

700
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:28,554
I guess it's all for the best.
Someone's gotta take over.

701
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,265
What, are you planning
on being absent a lot?

702
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:35,018
In case it doesn't work out. We agreed
it would be temporary at first.

703
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:38,355
You may change your mind
in a couple of weeks. I may move on.

704
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:40,315
I will not change my mind, trust me.

705
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:44,611
Anybody who can get through the thick
skulls of my lovely sisters and I

706
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:46,947
can definitely get through
to those kids.

707
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:50,367
- Even though I'm a little crazy?
- Because you are a lot crazy.

708
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:54,580
No, look, Magic School's protected.
It's okay. Give it your best shot.

709
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:57,666
- Hey.
- Hey.

710
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:00,002
I just came by to see the new professor.

711
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:05,507
All right, well, I promised Piper and
Leo that I'd babysit for them tonight.

712
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:07,759
They're celebrating Valentine's Day.

713
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:10,512
- Finding a little romance?
- Thanks to you, yeah.

714
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,556
Oh, I'm not done yet.

715
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,017
Really?

716
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,936
Okay, well, great,
awkward moment for me.

717
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:21,607
I'll be going. There's a night class
in five minutes. Don't forget.

718
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:26,862
So I thought you'd like to see
tomorrow's newspaper.

719
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:31,450
Looks like Prince John is gonna
give back everything he stole.

720
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:35,287
Guess he just needed to be
reminded of his mortality.

721
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:37,456
Works every time.

722
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:41,376
Phoebe, there's something
I have to tell you.

723
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:46,632
The deal I made that made me human,
that only lasts a year.

724
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:50,093
At the end of it, I gotta die.

725
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:55,265
What? Are you kidding?

726
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:59,603
No. Uh-uh. But listen,
it was well worth the sacrifice.

727
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,022
All I want to do is pass on
what I've learned

728
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:05,317
about literature, about life
and about love.

729
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:10,072
- How long do you have?
- Two weeks.

730
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:15,160
I mean, can't we try to fix it?

731
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:16,995
You can't.

732
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:21,625
And you know what? It's all good.

733
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:25,838
See you.
