1
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:07,216
I don't know what more proof you need.
You told me yourself it sounds great.

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,093
- It does.
- So, what's the problem?

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,054
- Burning toast.
- What?

4
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:13,972
The toast, it's burning.

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,061
Now, see, there's a question.

6
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:22,981
Your Avatar friends
are promising this big, bright future.

7
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,108
Will there be burning toast?

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,361
- Piper, be serious.
- I am.

9
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,113
They say they're gonna rid
the world of evil,

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,115
bring about a better way.

11
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,201
What else are they gonna get rid of?

12
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,870
Nothing else. We had this conversation.

13
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,664
Yeah, I know, but...

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,707
They answered all your questions.

15
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,252
- Still, I...
- What more do you need to know?

16
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,296
If you'd let me finish
a damn sentence, I'd tell ya.

17
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,968
The more I think about
the whole thing, the more it worries me.

18
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,136
No, save the pitch. I've heard it.

19
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,390
I'm not saying it doesn't sound
great. Obviously it does,

20
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,017
after everything
we've been through. But...

21
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,770
- But?
- But it's a huge decision.

22
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,023
It's one thing to save the world
from evil every week.

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,902
It's another thing entirely to change
the world just because we can.

24
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,654
Isn't that a little cocky?

25
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,782
No. In this case, it's a leap of faith.

26
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,619
One that I'm willing to fight for
because I have faith in the Avatars.

27
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:21,123
Yeah, but not everyone else
has reached your level of faith yet.

28
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,752
Is that the front door?

29
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,423
Phoebe? Paige?

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,510
That's odd. Did you leave that open?

31
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,512
No, I orbed in.

32
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,723
You son of a bitch!

33
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,940
That was close.

34
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,984
Too close.

35
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,070
That's the second time
he's tried to kill you, Leo.

36
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,781
We need to do something about this.

37
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,202
Well, I'm not gonna do
anything until you unfreeze Piper.

38
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,037
I can't keep lying to her.

39
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,915
Watch out!

40
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,336
- What are they doing here?
- Saving his life.

41
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:11,673
This vial contains an ancient potion
that kills Avatars, Piper.

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,802
Which means that someone must have told
Agent Brody that Leo is one of us now.

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,763
Paige.

44
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,307
What do you want from me?
I'll kill her later.

45
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,934
Make no mistake, Piper,

46
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,104
this is a serious matter, one that
demands our immediate attention.

47
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,441
If one of us were to die,
it could weaken the collective.

48
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,069
We might not be able
to implement the change.

49
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,989
You should have thought of that
before you killed Brody's parents.

50
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,783
- Piper.
- What?

51
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,161
That's why he views them as a threat.
That's what he thinks.

52
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,163
Do you...

53
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,457
...view us as a threat, Piper?

54
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,126
Actually, I'm still working on that one.

55
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,380
We didn't kill his parents.
That's not what we're about.

56
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:55,717
She'll discover what we're about
in her own time as Phoebe already has.

57
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,971
But we are running out of time.

58
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,682
Agent Brody is not
the only problem that we face.

59
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,393
Even as we speak, the demon Zankou

60
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,021
is mobilising the Underworld
to try and stop us as well.

61
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:18,991
If you truly desire a life
beyond good and evil, Piper...

62
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,828
...we're going to need your help...

63
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,580
...which means...

64
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,582
...you'll need to decide quickly.

65
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,006
What happened, huh? What'd you do?

66
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,924
Kyle, wait, listen to me.

67
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,261
No, you don't understand!
That was the last potion!

68
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,597
You have no idea what you just did.

69
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,353
So you see why I'm having a little
problem with the faith thing, right?

70
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,855
Paige!

71
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,525
What? What's going on?

72
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:57,446
Oh, you know, nothing.
Your boyfriend tried to kill my husband.

73
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,983
I told Kyle you were an Avatar
at breakfast. He seemed okay with it.

74
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,027
You should have warned us
you were gonna tell him.

75
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:23,240
I would have if I would have
known what he was gonna do.

76
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,617
- Not that I can blame him.
- Excuse me?

77
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,662
I mean, not the whole
killing you thing, obviously.

78
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,957
But his parents
were killed by the Avatars.

79
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,209
The Avatars weren't responsible.

80
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,503
How do you know?
Were you there, Leo?

81
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,341
No, but now that I'm an Avatar,
I can tell you they wouldn't do that.

82
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,178
Kyle thinks otherwise,
and he happened to be there.

83
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,014
Paige, in all fairness,
he was only five years old.

84
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,974
Who knows what really happened?

85
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,435
Why don't you try
to convince him of that?

86
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,687
Talking about Kyle, I assume?

87
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,858
I just called him looking for you.
He gave me an earful. You okay?

88
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,153
- Yeah.
- Good thing Kyle is out of potions.

89
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,697
It still doesn't solve his problem.

90
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,033
And until somebody does...

91
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,120
...I would assume that you're not gonna
go along with the Avatars, right?

92
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,207
- What do you have up your sleeve?
- I was just thinking,

93
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,083
remember how Leo sent you back

94
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,836
to find out what really
happened to your parents?

95
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,254
Yeah.

96
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,840
Maybe we could do
the same thing for Kyle

97
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,425
and help him move on.

98
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:27,804
Okay, but what if Kyle sees
that they really did kill his parents?

99
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,099
Well, if that's the case,
then we'll kill the Avatars

100
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,477
and help him move on that way.

101
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:37,856
The sooner we help Kyle find out the
truth, the sooner we can all move on.

102
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,483
Move on to what?

103
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,903
The future the Avatars promised us.
The one I saw in my vision.

104
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,239
Okay, but Phoebe,
we all didn't see that.

105
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,785
Yes, but you could
if you and I swap powers.

106
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,329
- What?
- It would just be for a little while,

107
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,916
just long enough for you
to see the vision. It's beautiful.

108
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,255
Okay, look, if the Avatars
are exonerated,

109
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,550
and I see what Phoebe saw,
then we'll talk about it.

110
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,679
Fine, I'll talk too.

111
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:20,065
Zankou, hi, sorry to disturb you.

112
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,234
What is it?

113
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:26,238
Well, we were just wondering,
and I mean all of us, not just myself,

114
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,740
when things were gonna move along.

115
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:33,120
Seeing as how the Avatars are so close
to wiping us off the face of the Earth.

116
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,247
The Avatars are not the problem.

117
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,625
Not the problem? Well, we
unleashed you to save us from them,

118
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,004
and now they're not the problem?
I'm a little confused.

119
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,965
Would you like me to elaborate?

120
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,258
Yes, please.

121
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,515
We can't stop the Avatars.

122
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:57,644
We might be able to stop the Charmed
Ones before they join forces with them.

123
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,938
If we can do that...

124
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,442
...then the Avatars
won't have the power they need

125
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:06,695
in order to remake the world...
and eliminate us.

126
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:09,239
Destroying the Charmed Ones,

127
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,491
it always sounds easy.

128
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,661
Many have tried. No one's succeeded.

129
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,664
There's a first time for everything.

130
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,543
Besides, I never had the opportunity
to go up against them before.

131
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,421
I sense...

132
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,465
...the chance is near.

133
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,265
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
That's what could have happened.

134
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,603
It was a chance I had to take. You
kill one Avatar, it weakens them all.

135
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,397
- Kyle, you tried to kill Leo!
- I don't care.

136
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,776
I do, and if you actually cared
about me, maybe you would too.

137
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:49,363
- Now, see, don't lay that on me.
- Don't lay what on you?

138
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,823
He's my brother-in-law.
He matters to me.

139
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,660
Yeah, my parents mattered to me too!

140
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:59,122
Okay. Even if the Avatars did
kill them, Leo wasn't there.

141
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,375
How can you even
hold him responsible?

142
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,502
It was the only way I could get to 'em.

143
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,838
You would kill somebody who's innocent

144
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,842
to exact revenge on whoever killed
your parents. Gee, that makes you

145
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,261
a whole lot better than those killers.

146
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,513
Look, I know who killed my parents.

147
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,098
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

148
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,434
- You won't mind proving it?
- What are you talking about?

149
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,396
Getting you past this,
finding out who did this.

150
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,149
Are you interested?

151
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:29,862
Yeah.

152
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:34,533
Good. Then you won't mind
going on a little trip with me.

153
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:41,456
I know the power-switching spell
is in here. We've used it before.

154
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:45,335
Yeah, and if I remember correctly,
didn't it bite us in the ass?

155
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,546
I'm just saying.

156
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,467
As long as Kyle is willing, the Avatars
said they'd send him back to the past.

157
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,136
They've got the easy part.

158
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,681
They should try dealing
with a stubborn sister in the present.

159
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,017
So I'm having second thoughts, sue me.

160
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,187
It's well worth the risk
for you to see what I saw.

161
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:07,274
Imagine a future with no demons,
a future where we're all free,

162
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,526
where our kids get to grow up happy

163
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,570
and have normal lives?

164
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,781
What we've always dreamed of,
you've always dreamed of.

165
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,409
And you got all of that from one vision?

166
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,995
Actually, I did.

167
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,414
What are you smiling at?

168
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,249
Nothing.

169
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,380
Okay, we're ready.

170
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,966
Good, I'm glad. And you will be too.

171
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,052
We'll see.

172
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,763
All right, let me explain
how this is gonna work.

173
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,390
- Hold it! He's doing this?
- Yeah.

174
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,142
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah.

175
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:46,104
How do I know he and the Avatars
aren't gonna change the past?

176
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,941
We can't change the past.
Nor would we want to.

177
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,944
You'll know if it's been
messed with. It's your past.

178
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,905
And I've got the word
of an Avatar on this? No way.

179
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,533
Kyle, please, we have to do this.

180
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,495
It's the only way we're ever
gonna find out the truth, right?

181
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,918
All right. What do I do?

182
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,629
Close your eyes.

183
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,090
Concentrate on the day.

184
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,591
See it.

185
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,845
How do we get back?

186
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,013
He'll get back
when he finds the truth.

187
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,431
Of course.

188
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,951
Now what?

189
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,245
Now we work on you.

190
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,630
You okay?

191
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:58,302
Yeah. Still not used
to this time travel stuff.

192
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,598
Oh, my God.

193
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,231
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

194
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,692
Wait a minute, something's not right.

195
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,153
What? What's not right?

196
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,656
- Come on!
- Hey, buddy, watch it, huh?

197
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,867
Where are you going?

198
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,793
- December 28th, 1981.
- Isn't that the date?

199
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,422
Yeah. This isn't where it happened.
This isn't where they died.

200
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:37,674
You sure?

201
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,887
Yeah, of course I'm sure. They died in
a warehouse near JFK, at 7.52 at night.

202
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:45,474
I checked the coroner's report.
This is Columbia University.

203
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,059
This is where they taught.

204
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:51,188
- Maybe we're here for another reason.
- The Avatars want me to miss seeing it.

205
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:54,733
That's not gonna happen. We need
to get to the airport. Hey, taxi!

206
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,529
Cool, Raiders of the Lost Ark.
I always wanted to see that.

207
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:02,699
Christmas in New York,
nothing like it, right?

208
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,910
I think it's the first one I remember.

209
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,496
What'd you get for Christmas?

210
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,332
A bunch of books,
snow globe, Rubik's Cube.

211
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,960
You must have been
a smart boy to handle that.

212
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,421
I like puzzles. Hey, taxi!

213
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,802
Come on.

214
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:34,898
Mom?

215
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,317
Mommy!

216
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,152
It's okay, son. She's all right.

217
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,447
She just fainted.
You wanna get your jacket.

218
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,409
Do you know who she is?

219
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,327
Yeah.

220
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,745
That's my mom.

221
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,708
Which makes him...

222
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,001
You.

223
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,223
Found it! You ready?

224
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:12,644
What if Zankou shows up?
What are we gonna do then?

225
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:16,899
Then I blow him up. We'll still have
our powers, just in different bodies.

226
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,610
What if that doesn't work?
What if we need Paige?

227
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,613
Why are you procrastinating?
What are you afraid of?

228
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,032
Honestly, a lot of things, actually.

229
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,785
Even if this works, we're still talking
about remaking the world.

230
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,662
That makes me a little nervous.

231
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:35,000
I promise you, you will not be nervous
once you see what I saw.

232
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,335
Trust me.

233
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,422
What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine

234
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:44,968
I offer up my gift to share
Switch our powers through the air

235
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,482
Uh-oh!

236
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,037
Where's the third one?

237
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:16,124
We're not really sure. So why don't
you just come back later, okay?

238
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:20,212
Nah.

239
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,014
Why didn't you fire back?

240
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,809
Go ahead, tell him.

241
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,686
We sort of lost our powers.

242
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,738
Maybe we should try
calling for our powers.

243
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,198
We already tried that.

244
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:51,368
- Maybe we should try again.
- Piper, where are you going?

245
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:54,079
The powers went out
the window, didn't they?

246
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:57,249
You expect to find them
laying around on the front lawn?

247
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,627
Don't get smart with me, mister!
This was not my idea!

248
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,672
I was just trying
to get you to see what I saw.

249
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,010
And now I can see that we are going to
die. I don't need your powers for that!

250
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,345
Maybe you should try scrying for them.

251
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:11,722
Why would that work?

252
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,807
They still exist somewhere.

253
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,852
Somewhere? Somewhere
where, like in people?

254
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,687
Two very surprised people.

255
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:23,192
Oh, we gotta get Paige back here
before Zankou attacks again.

256
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,819
After they find out
who killed Kyle's parents.

257
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:29,656
How did he know to attack us right
when we were about to switch powers?

258
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,242
He must have sensed
you were vulnerable.

259
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,828
Now I know why
The Source locked him up.

260
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,748
You need to take the kids
to Magic School right away.

261
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,375
- Leave you alone without powers?
- You have to.

262
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:44,004
We'll call you if we need you.
But you gotta get them out of here.

263
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,551
And we need to find our powers.

264
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,269
I think I just found mine.

265
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,688
I'm going to find my powers.

266
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:08,445
One of them's found her powers already,
which means the other one will as well.

267
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,948
Does that mean we've missed our chance?

268
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,866
Not necessarily.

269
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,160
With all due respect, you said you knew

270
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:18,330
when the Charmed Ones
would be at their most vulnerable.

271
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,541
They were vulnerable. I sensed it.

272
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,669
I didn't anticipate
the Elder coming to their rescue.

273
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:28,423
Maybe we should rethink things a little,
maybe go after the Avatars instead.

274
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,467
With their powers...

275
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,386
...we wouldn't stand a chance.

276
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,721
Some of us think we would.

277
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,606
Now they don't think that.

278
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,821
If you're still going after the witches,
how do we get past the Elder?

279
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:54,783
By letting the other Elders know he's
not really one of them anymore.

280
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,128
Thank you.

281
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,963
Is my mom gonna be okay?

282
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,673
She's gonna be fine.

283
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,677
Is there anyone we can call
for you? Husband maybe?

284
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,679
There's no need. He's right here.

285
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,265
- Hey.
- Dad...

286
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,018
Dad... is that your dad?

287
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,353
Careful.

288
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,606
What's wrong?
A TA told me you're sick.

289
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,817
No, I'm fine. I had a fainting spell.

290
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,695
- Fainting spell?
- I was so startled.

291
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:34,281
He's the spitting image of my father.

292
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,326
Crazy coincidences, right?

293
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:41,330
Well, either way, thanks a lot for
helping her out. I'm Jack, Jack Brody.

294
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:43,790
This is Kevin, Kevin Matthews,

295
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,169
and I am Paige.
And we're late for a movie.

296
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,545
What are you gonna see?

297
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,340
Raiders of the Lost Ark.

298
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,509
Cool, can I go with?

299
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:56,887
No, you can't go with.
You're too little.

300
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,389
Trust me, though.

301
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,350
You gonna love it.

302
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,060
Just give me one second.

303
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,521
- You get this for Christmas?
- Yep.

304
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,649
He loves reading about
the Egyptian kings and queens.

305
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,569
- What's your favourite story, Kyle?
- The Mummy's Curse.

306
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,906
Owe me a soda.

307
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:19,576
I'm sure it's every
kid's favourite story.

308
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,912
My folks used to
read it to me all the time.

309
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,747
Well, you have good parents.

310
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,041
Yeah.

311
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,670
All right, then, Kevin,
we really should be going.

312
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,713
We should too. That was customs.

313
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,424
The manifest
for the Cairo shipment is missing.

314
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,845
They're gonna destroy
the shipment unless we identify 'em.

315
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,681
They can't just destroy them.

316
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,600
They can and will.
So sorry to have to cut this short.

317
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,688
I hope we see you again soon.

318
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,606
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

319
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,277
Okay, then bye, all.

320
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,077
What are you thinking?

321
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:05,831
I'm sorry, all right? I just thought
it would be easier than this.

322
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:09,918
You have to be careful.
You can't risk changing the past.

323
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:13,630
You yourself said that there's
a reason why I came here first.

324
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:18,385
That's not the reason. We came to see
who killed them, not to save them.

325
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:22,222
All my life I just used to think
that if I could just talk to my parents

326
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:25,392
one more time, five minutes,
even that would be enough.

327
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,687
I don't think I can just sit back
and watch my parents die.

328
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,814
You don't have a choice!

329
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,943
We can't change the past.

330
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,288
Oh, no, honey. No, don't. I...

331
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:50,292
Baby, you gotta believe me. I did
not hire a private eye to follow you!

332
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:51,502
Liar!

333
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,420
Honey, you gotta believe me!

334
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,924
I'm the liar? You're
the one having the affairs!

335
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,926
How did you know about them, huh?

336
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,011
I told you already. I don't know how.

337
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:04,139
I just... I just saw it in my head.

338
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,350
Now you can see
you're ass outta my life!

339
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:09,144
You're the one screwing around!

340
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,904
Phil? You slept with Phil too?

341
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,281
What is happening to me?

342
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,367
I think I can explain.

343
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:24,827
Who are you?

344
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,119
It doesn't matter.

345
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:30,499
But I know you've been seeing certain
things, things that you can't explain?

346
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,960
Don't tell me
you're sleeping with her too.

347
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:37,714
No, of course not.
I'm just here to help you.

348
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:42,553
Look, lady, no offence, but I
don't think you can help me, okay?

349
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,055
Oh, no, no, not the bowling trophy!

350
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,101
My trop... my...

351
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,696
Who the hell are you?

352
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:04,992
Short version, I'm a witch.
And you have my power of premonition.

353
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,785
And if you don't come with me,

354
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:09,872
you're probably gonna get killed
by a demon. Got it?

355
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:20,257
What's the matter? Don't trust me?

356
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:24,678
You said you had some information
about the Avatars. We're listening.

357
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:29,308
Actually, I said I have information
about one of the Avatars.

358
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:32,060
- A very special one.
- He doesn't know anything.

359
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:34,062
- Let's go.
- You know him actually.

360
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,190
Very well too.

361
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,900
All right, who is it?

362
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:42,362
I believe his name is... Leo.

363
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,240
Ring any Elder bells?

364
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,118
- He's not an Avatar.
- Sure, he is.

365
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:50,454
He just doesn't want you to know it.

366
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:53,749
Probably because
he's planning on betraying you.

367
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,876
Then again, I'm not one to gossip.

368
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:57,794
I'm sure if you look back at it,

369
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:00,964
it has to make a lot
of sense, doesn't it?

370
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,092
You have any proof?

371
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,012
I saw his powers.

372
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,057
More to the point, I...

373
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:12,392
...felt his powers.

374
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,145
They made yours seem... feeble.

375
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:18,941
Why are you telling us this now?
What do you hope to gain?

376
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:20,275
My life...

377
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,654
...and those of my fellow demons.

378
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,493
You see, the one thing you and I
have in common is the Avatar's threat.

379
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,454
If they come to power,

380
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,458
you will be out, and we will be gone.

381
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:39,586
On the other hand, if you can...

382
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,673
...deal with your little traitor...

383
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,260
...we might yet
be able to save ourselves.

384
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:52,182
Tick... tock.

385
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,734
Demons? What do you mean, demons?
You mean they actually exist?

386
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,779
Yes, Denise, they do,
so I need my powers...

387
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,030
Stay away from me!

388
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,159
Why does that keep happening?

389
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:13,829
It won't, if you just calm down
a little and let me help you.

390
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:17,749
Wait. You guys fight demons
here all the time, don't you?

391
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,960
Pretty much, why?

392
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,671
I thought that you threw
wild parties, you know,

393
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,840
things breaking, people screaming.

394
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:26,508
I had no idea.

395
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:29,553
Well, at least now you know
why we never invited you.

396
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,513
Found my...

397
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:37,144
See, that's that other little power
I was telling you about.

398
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,479
So small gesture here.
Nothing too hard.

399
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:42,858
Don't want to blow up the sister, okay?

400
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,902
...power. Frozen?

401
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,486
Yeah.

402
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,156
- Hi, I'm Phoebe, and you're...
- Really scared.

403
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:51,074
Yeah, really, don't startle her.

404
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:55,078
Ladies, what do you say we cut
the chitchat and just fix this?

405
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,206
You got it, Ronnie, let's do it.

406
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,374
Wait, what exactly are you gonna do?

407
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:03,712
Just a spell. You'll say it, we'll say
it, everything should be back to normal.

408
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,422
And then you can go home

409
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,509
and never tell anyone
ever, ever, ever about this, okay?

410
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,928
- Sounds good, huh?
- Gather around.

411
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,262
Hold on. Wait, wait.

412
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:16,266
What if you wanted to use powers
for something besides fighting demons?

413
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,769
Like... winning the lottery?

414
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,066
- My premonitions are bigger than that.
- What's bigger than the lottery?

415
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:28,070
How about getting back at people who
were really mean to you? Ever do that?

416
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:31,365
No, no, 'cause that's under
the category of personal gain,

417
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:33,158
and with the risk of exposure,

418
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,911
those are really bad things
in the witch world.

419
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:39,122
- Time's a-wastin'.
- No, no, no, I'm talking really mean.

420
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:42,292
Like an ex-husband who
clears out your savings account,

421
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:46,171
runs off with his secretary and
leaves you mortgaged to the hilt.

422
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:49,675
You guys could get rich and get
revenge on whoever you wanted.

423
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:51,301
No, we couldn't.

424
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,762
- I don't believe you.
- Yeah, me neither.

425
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:55,556
What do you say we get rich?

426
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,559
Okay. Only if we can blow up
my ex-husband afterwards.

427
00:25:58,725 --> 00:25:59,852
- Sure.
- No, no.

428
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:03,438
That would be personal gain
and exposure, not to mention murder!

429
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,108
Hey, you can't leave!

430
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:12,322
Oh, I think this
is gonna be a lot of fun.

431
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:37,431
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're gonna
want to be extra careful with that one.

432
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,644
This is gonna take a while.
You want to go get a drink?

433
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:44,146
No?

434
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,399
Here we go.

435
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,194
What's in these things?

436
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,612
Well...

437
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:55,991
...I honestly don't know, but...
I can tell you what I think is in them.

438
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:59,161
They thought it was some sort
of Egyptian healing balm.

439
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:00,913
I went through the journals.

440
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,958
They didn't know what they
had unearthed, what it could do.

441
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,794
They were completely innocent.

442
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,922
So why did the Avatars kill them?

443
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,965
Because they knew what it could do.

444
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,553
Are there any other vials?

445
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,056
No. They all got destroyed.

446
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:21,099
When?

447
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,434
You'll see.

448
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,646
What are you guys doing here?

449
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:28,398
Oh, actually, we're...

450
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:29,900
Can you keep a secret?

451
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:38,200
You know those imaginary friends
of yours, the ones that watch over you?

452
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:39,827
How do you know about them?

453
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,788
How do you think we know?

454
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:45,082
Because you're them?

455
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:48,043
That's right. Here.

456
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,966
Now you got your own throne,
just like King Tut.

457
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,679
Can I talk to you for a second?

458
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,724
Everything you say to him
can change your past?

459
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:06,603
I'm not saying anything to him
that he doesn't already know. Trust me.

460
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,022
You can't keep him
from going through this.

461
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:13,443
Everything that you've gone
through, your parents death,

462
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,320
has made you who you are today.

463
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,072
Don't you see that?

464
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:20,284
He has to go through it.
Otherwise, you won't.

465
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:24,037
Kyle? Where are you?

466
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,210
You better go.

467
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:31,670
Will you still be here?

468
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,338
Yeah.

469
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,258
Go on, get outta here.

470
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:40,804
Honey?

471
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:45,267
There you are.

472
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:47,019
Want to go get that soda now?

473
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:48,770
- Okay.
- Okay.

474
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,864
Piper? Phoebe?

475
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:06,747
- Where'd they go?
- Hey.

476
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:08,916
- Where did who go?
- Uh-oh!

477
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:12,794
- They froze us again.
- Apparently took off with our powers.

478
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:16,423
- Why didn't you stop them?
- It's tough to do when you're frozen.

479
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,051
You explain the risks?
Demons, personal gain?

480
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:22,596
Yeah. The demons, they were afraid of.
Personal gain, not so much.

481
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:24,139
You need to find 'em.

482
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:26,266
Yeah, thanks.

483
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:30,562
Without our powers, I don't know how
we'll convince 'em to give them back.

484
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:33,524
We'll jump off that bridge
when we get to it.

485
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,153
- The Elders?
- Yeah, I don't know what they want.

486
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,990
- You think it's about Zankou?
- Could be. Or the Avatars.

487
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:44,535
I'll be right back.

488
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:48,914
That's never happened before.

489
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,922
Lake Tahoe?

490
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,603
We have another winner!

491
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:17,359
Here you go, babe.

492
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:18,986
Keep 'em coming.

493
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:22,030
I feel bad we haven't had
a chance to blow up your ex yet.

494
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,825
- That's okay. We can do it tomorrow.
- All right.

495
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:33,584
Ten thousand dollar hard eight.

496
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,336
Yo, stick man, give me the horn.

497
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:38,213
You got it.

498
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,300
Eight the hard way!

499
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:47,639
All right, that was
your last roll, Diamond Jim.

500
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,349
What are you doing here?

501
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:51,810
- Fun is over.
- Fun's just getting started.

502
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:55,063
Unless you want Denise here
to put the whammy on you again.

503
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,816
She wouldn't dare,
not in front of these people.

504
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:01,028
- Wanna try me?
- Oh, sure, now she's fearless.

505
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,197
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

506
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,365
You try to get one more premonition,

507
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:09,536
then afterwards, if you don't want to
come with us, you can have our powers.

508
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:12,122
- Phoebe...
- I know what I'm doing.

509
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:13,499
What do you say?

510
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,793
Will it win me a bunch more money?

511
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,170
Not a cent.

512
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:20,297
But I guarantee you what you see

513
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:22,674
will offer you more than this casino.

514
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:31,266
Okay, I need you to close
your eyes and clear your head.

515
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:32,684
What are you gonna do?

516
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:36,480
I'm gonna try to get him to see what
I've been trying to get you to see.

517
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:37,856
With no powers?

518
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,274
I saw it, didn't I?

519
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:41,318
Okay, give me your hand.

520
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:44,238
I'm gonna walk you through this, okay?

521
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:47,950
Close your eyes

522
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,619
and picture an elementary school...

523
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:55,374
...outside, lots of happy kids.
Can you see it?

524
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,544
Hi, Aunt Phoebe.

525
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:01,547
Aunt Phoebe?

526
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:05,551
Yeah, that's it. Stay with it.

527
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,262
There's Wyatt
and Chris and a little girl.

528
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:13,308
What did I tell you about demons?
They don't exist anymore.

529
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:14,726
Not since the Avatars.

530
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:19,147
What's he seeing?

531
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:21,441
Believe me, I wish I knew.

532
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:28,699
Is that real?

533
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,203
It can be... if we get our powers back.

534
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:46,466
All right, Leo, for the last time,
are you or are you not an Avatar?

535
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:50,053
I'm just someone who wants peace.
Isn't that what you want too?

536
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,222
Please, Leo, the truth!

537
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:54,141
All right.

538
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:56,768
Yes, I'm an Avatar.

539
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,855
But they're not a threat.

540
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:01,440
They seek what we seek.

541
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:04,443
What, the destruction
of everything we hold dear?

542
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,112
No, a world without good and evil.

543
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,697
It's not possible.

544
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:12,117
It is if we have the courage
to change, to evolve.

545
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:15,537
Evolution takes centuries.
Millennia, even.

546
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:18,832
It cannot happen overnight.
It must be earned.

547
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:20,667
I think we've earned it.

548
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,420
We can't let you
go through with this, Leo.

549
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:26,840
I already have.

550
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:29,218
So be it.

551
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:50,572
How'd you?

552
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:52,658
You should be dead.

553
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:55,160
I would have been
if I were still an Elder.

554
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:00,040
Face it.

555
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:03,794
The fate of the world
is no longer in your hands.

556
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,311
We'll get the spell.

557
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:24,857
I wouldn't bother
with that if I were you.

558
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,652
- Leo!
- I wouldn't bother with him either.

559
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:32,322
Something tells me he's not
coming to your rescue this time.

560
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:42,124
We're gonna die!

561
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:44,877
You're gonna be fine.
Remember what I told you.

562
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,179
He's bad.

563
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:58,182
Yes. You should be able
to sense the next energy...

564
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:00,017
Get down!

565
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:02,477
That was very good.

566
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:04,313
Thank you.

567
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,281
- Nice job.
- Did I kill him?

568
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:18,952
Not quite. But we'll take
what we can get. Leo!

569
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:23,624
Leo is still alive.

570
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,710
Looks like the Avatar
is more powerful than I thought.

571
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,922
Which means we're all in trouble.

572
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,387
You guys all right?

573
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:40,557
Yeah, thanks to these two.

574
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,726
You, on the other hand...

575
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:44,686
I'll be fine.

576
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:47,689
What happened?
I thought you went to see the Elders.

577
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,943
I did. We need to talk.

578
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:07,125
It's time.

579
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,893
Demons.

580
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,693
Ruth!

581
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:36,738
No!

582
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:57,885
- We needed those potions.
- I told you we should have waited.

583
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,845
How will we protect ourselves?

584
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:02,723
We won't.

585
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,225
LOADING
DOCK

586
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,111
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

587
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:19,781
Neither did I.

588
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:23,702
I never really saw what happened.

589
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:29,791
I thought I did, but I just assumed it
was the Avatars because of the vials.

590
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,879
At least now we know it wasn't them.

591
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:37,799
It doesn't help.

592
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:39,885
Mom?

593
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:41,678
Dad?

594
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:46,016
Daddy!

595
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:52,397
Daddy? Daddy.

596
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:54,525
No, please.

597
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:16,964
Kyle, look at me.

598
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:20,259
Kyle.

599
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:26,098
You're gonna be okay.

600
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:30,143
We're gonna get
through this, all right?

601
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:33,772
Promise.

602
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:39,528
We have to go.

603
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,271
Hey, do you mind?

604
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:16,023
Sorry, just checking.

605
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,775
Oh, it's okay.
I never liked that lamp anyway.

606
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:21,862
I don't know how much good
having our powers is gonna do.

607
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:23,447
They didn't phase Zankou.

608
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:26,950
Zankou. How do they
come up with these names?

609
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:29,161
After all these years, you ask now?

610
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:33,832
At least Denise and Ronnie get
to go back to their normal lives.

611
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:36,919
- Did Leo use the memory dust on them?
- Yeah.

612
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:40,589
It's kind of a shame considering
everything they went through.

613
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:43,383
I mean, Ronnie got
to see a better future.

614
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:47,721
Yeah. Too bad you didn't get
to see the future that Ronnie saw.

615
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:49,932
I don't think I need to.

616
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:54,603
I mean, I saw how just one glimpse
changed that man forever.

617
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,898
And the fact that the Avatars
aren't killers helps a bit.

618
00:39:58,065 --> 00:40:00,692
- That's enough for me.
- Really?

619
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:04,446
Worth a shot. It's gotta be better
than cleaning up after demons.

620
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:05,739
I agree.

621
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,037
I've been thinking about it, and...

622
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:13,747
...l'm ready to try too.

623
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:17,292
Because I'm tired of all of...

624
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:20,295
...this.

625
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:21,839
How's Kyle doing?

626
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,342
He's pretty devastated, you know.

627
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:30,264
But I think eventually he'll be okay.

628
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,392
I mean, you have to be.
It's Utopia, right?
