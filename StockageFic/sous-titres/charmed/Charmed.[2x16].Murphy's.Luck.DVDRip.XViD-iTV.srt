1
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:10,085
Everything is shot on
digital now, you know.

2
00:00:10,249 --> 00:00:11,318
Yeah, I'm equipped.

3
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:12,678
Nice stuff.

4
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, I like this one.

5
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:19,478
- What lens did you use?
- Twenty-four F8.

6
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:22,322
- What shutter speed?
- One twenty-five.

7
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,720
Okay, lose the kicker.
Let the shadow play there.

8
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:34,286
- Impressive.
- So does that mean I got the job?

9
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:37,124
Based on your portfolio, yes.

10
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:41,527
Based on your résumé, no.

11
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:43,881
Took a detour from
shutterbugging, did you?

12
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:46,961
Mr. Corso, I've changed careers,
I'm not hiding that.

13
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:49,967
But with all due respect, if you like
my work that should be enough.

14
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,802
I mean you're hiring me,
not my résumé.

15
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:56,247
You want a shot?

16
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:59,845
Get me a better one
of Maggie Murphy.

17
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:02,563
She's gonna be featured
in our St. Patty's Day issue.

18
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:05,158
Something about being the
unluckiest woman in San Francisco.

19
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:06,318
And she's Irish.

20
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:08,764
Down where they do the writing,
they call that irony.

21
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,199
Address is on the back.
Up until three months ago,

22
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,078
she was like a saint, helping the
homeless, volunteering, charity.

23
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:18,964
Then, like, overnight,
everything started going bad for her.

24
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:20,158
Real bad.

25
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,682
I want what you have in here, Prue.

26
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:27,608
Artistic, soulful, poignant.

27
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:30,243
I want to see the inner Maggie
in your photograph.

28
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:32,360
And I want to see it by 5:00 today.

29
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:36,959
Or don't bother coming back.

30
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:39,961
Thank you.

31
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:06,605
What am I doing?
This isn't me, this...

32
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:09,158
Yes, it is. It's all my fault.

33
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,960
The car accident.

34
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:14,484
The fire. My brother's death.

35
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:16,998
I hurt the ones I love.

36
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:18,841
I hurt the ones I love.

37
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:20,124
I have to stop it.

38
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:23,039
Has to stop.

39
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:27,402
I don't deserve to live.

40
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:29,605
This is who I really am.

41
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:30,884
Cursed.

42
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,161
I'm cursed.

43
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:34,758
Hey, look up there!

44
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:42,958
Oh, my God, she's gonna jump!

45
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:04,727
Maggie?

46
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:08,207
Maggie, no!

47
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:10,997
Maggie.

48
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:12,798
Wait, don't.

49
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:14,687
Where did you come from?
How do you know me?

50
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:17,649
It doesn't matter. Just step away
from the ledge and take my hand.

51
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,726
Stay away from me.

52
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,207
Maggie, please, I can help you.

53
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:25,082
Nobody can help me.

54
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,563
Maggie, this isn't the answer.

55
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:30,527
All I wanted to do is help people.

56
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:33,280
Now all I do is hurt them.

57
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:38,121
Maggie!

58
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,844
Let me go. Please.

59
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:49,438
I can't hold on much longer.

60
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,961
No.

61
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,364
Bring it over here.

62
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:13,083
Wait. Wait.

63
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,007
Well, of all the luck.

64
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,437
Just stay still, ma'am.

65
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:49,603
Hey.

66
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:51,800
I thought you had inventory
at the club.

67
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:53,038
I do.

68
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:54,801
So then what are you doing here?

69
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:57,889
Trying to figure out what to tell Dan.

70
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,607
About what, honey?

71
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:00,798
Leo.

72
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,921
Oh, that. You're not actually writing
him a Dear John letter, are you?

73
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:08,759
No, of course not. He deserves
more than that, a lot more. But...

74
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:11,238
It's just hard.
I mean, I don't want to hurt him.

75
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:14,079
Dan's a great guy,
and he's been really good to me.

76
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,122
And we've never really had
any huge problems.

77
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:20,201
No, I mean, the only huge problem
is that you really love Leo,

78
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:22,286
and he loves you,

79
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,041
and he gave up immortality for you.

80
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:29,443
I know, which is obviously good for us.
But lately, he seems a bit restless.

81
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:31,128
You're thinking too much again.

82
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:35,083
Stop trying to predict the future,
all right? That's my job.

83
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:38,047
Just follow your heart, honey.
Good things will happen.

84
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,719
What would I do without you?

85
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:43,408
Oh, suffer endlessly, no doubt.

86
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,402
Thank you.
All right, I'm going to the club.

87
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:50,565
- Love you.
- I love you too.

88
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:59,242
- Miss Murphy?
- I can't go in there.

89
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,408
You don't really have a choice.

90
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,642
Am I being arrested?

91
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:07,128
No, but there's some paperwork
we have to get started.

92
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:10,238
Are there guns in there?

93
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,121
It's a police station.

94
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:18,849
They might go off.
Things like that happen around me,

95
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,284
and I don't want anybody
to get hurt.

96
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,799
I'm more concerned
about you hurting yourself.

97
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:27,888
Come on.

98
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:30,808
- Nothing's gonna happen.
- You don't understand.

99
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:34,128
Trust me.
We're only here to help you.

100
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,359
You can't help me.

101
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:38,201
Nobody can.

102
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:44,169
We're gonna find
somebody who can.

103
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:47,688
First, you have to answer a few
questions about what happened today.

104
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:49,123
I don't know what happened.

105
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:51,604
It was like a bad dream,
only it wasn't.

106
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,198
Voices in my head...

107
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:56,166
...and everything spinning.

108
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:59,443
Is there somebody you wanna call?
Family, friends?

109
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:02,567
No, no, no. Keep them away from me.
They're safer there.

110
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:04,327
I shouldn't even be here.

111
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:07,197
I shouldn't be alive, and if it
hadn't been for that angel...

112
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:12,518
- Excuse me?
- She just appeared.

113
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:14,998
Out of thin air
when I was on the rooftop.

114
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:18,959
She reached out her hand, and then
when I was falling, it was like...

115
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:22,519
Something slowed me down,
like she guided me to that awning.

116
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:24,884
- The angel?
- Yes, she saved me.

117
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,038
Help me out here.

118
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:34,884
What exactly
did this woman look like?

119
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:41,998
So how'd it go?

120
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:44,484
- What?
- The interview. Did you get the job?

121
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:46,122
Yeah, I did.

122
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:49,328
- Prue, are you okay?
- The woman that I am supposed

123
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:51,127
to photograph,
when I got to her apartment,

124
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:52,881
she was on the roof, ready to jump.

125
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:57,405
- Oh, my God. She didn't...
- Yeah, actually she did.

126
00:08:57,609 --> 00:09:01,397
Luckily, I was able to break her fall
with my powers, but just barely.

127
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:05,081
So lucky you got there in time.

128
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:06,878
Yeah, but I keep thinking

129
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:09,279
if I had been a minute later,
it would have been too late.

130
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,804
But you weren't. You were
supposed to be there in time.

131
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,608
You were supposed to save
that girl's life, I believe that.

132
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:20,120
- Hello?
- Hi, Prue.

133
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:24,242
You weren't outside 413 N. Fergis Ave
this morning, were you?

134
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:25,558
Why?

135
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,248
I got a Maggie Murphy here.

136
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:30,407
She claims that she was saved
by some angel this morning.

137
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:33,601
An angel that, by her description,
bears no resemblance to Della Reese.

138
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,925
- But does resemble me.
- Yeah, bingo.

139
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:39,246
Everybody around here thinks she's
nuts. Wish I could tell them otherwise.

140
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:41,127
Hey, what's on this roll?

141
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:42,398
Just some old photographs.

142
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:46,809
- Darryl, is Maggie all right?
- It's not for me to say.

143
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:50,399
We have to send her over to Psych
for a mandatory 72-hour stay.

144
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:52,721
I'm so sorry.

145
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:56,198
Poor woman. It's like she's
snakebit or something.

146
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:58,559
Listen, Prue,
you'd better steer clear of here

147
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:02,483
so she doesn't ID you.
I'll keep you posted, okay? Bye.

148
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:08,079
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go see Maggie.

149
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:11,161
Something tells me that I may have
stopped her, but I didn't save her.

150
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:14,366
I'll come with you. Maybe something
from my psych class could be of use.

151
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,281
Cool, thanks.

152
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:22,125
That can't be right.
How many swizzle sticks?

153
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:23,758
Who's counting?

154
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:27,362
I don't know. A lot.

155
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:29,002
You think you might
have over-ordered?

156
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:32,479
- No, they over-shipped.
- Here.

157
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:37,918
It's my fault.

158
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,848
- What?
- Nothing.

159
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:50,957
Piper, are you mad at me?

160
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:54,839
No, don't be ridiculous.
Why would I be mad at you?

161
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:57,079
I don't know, that's why I'm asking.

162
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:59,442
What is it?

163
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:01,965
It's just...

164
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:03,722
It's Dan.

165
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:08,965
Never mind, sorry I asked.

166
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,723
And he's going to be...

167
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:20,002
He's going to be very upset
when he finds out...

168
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:25,003
...you're the one that I really love.

169
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,197
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

170
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:40,960
- No, wait, we can't do this.
- But you just said that...

171
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:46,203
I know, but I really need
to talk to Dan first.

172
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:49,238
So count.

173
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:52,478
- Count.
- Count.

174
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:55,318
Count.

175
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:37,805
Brought you some coffee.

176
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,324
- Thanks.
- I'll take it from here. Thanks.

177
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,567
Okay.

178
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:49,480
I saw her, you know?

179
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:52,328
The angel, she saved me.

180
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:57,921
I believe you, Maggie. Really, I do.

181
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:00,680
- Here.
- Thanks.

182
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,844
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm okay.

183
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:07,565
I'm just gonna wipe this off.

184
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:10,407
Maybe you should
just stay away from me.

185
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:14,162
People get hurt.

186
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:29,123
All right, that's her.

187
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:31,968
Any idea what you're gonna say
to her about the whole angel thing?

188
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:34,359
I'm not really worried about that.
I'm worried about her.

189
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:37,165
I've been thinking
maybe I can write a spell.

190
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:40,008
- A spell for what?
- Help put good luck back in her life.

191
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:43,241
That's sweet, but you know you can't
keep using your powers to save her.

192
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:45,326
I know. Maybe it'll help her
turn things around,

193
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:47,241
make her see that life's worth living.

194
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:58,324
Thanks a lot.

195
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:01,328
Okay, you see?

196
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,765
All right, I'll need your help.
How do I do this?

197
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:07,721
You don't need my help.
It's your connection.

198
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,845
It just has to come from the heart.

199
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,087
All right. Here it goes.

200
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:15,641
From this moment on
Your pain is erased

201
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:17,959
Your bad luck as well

202
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:22,361
Enjoy your good luck, Maggie
You're free from this hell

203
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:47,128
Thanks.

204
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:50,088
Did I just do that? I mean, help you?

205
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:52,319
Looks like
her luck's changing already.

206
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:54,406
Yeah. Have a seat.

207
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,926
- You okay?
- Yeah.

208
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:01,608
Let's get out of here.

209
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:06,365
Not so fast.

210
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:12,524
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, just a chill.

211
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:20,240
I gotta tell you, for your first spell,
you packed quite a punch.

212
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:24,641
Well, you told me to speak
from the heart. I did.

213
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:28,722
Still, it took me a few times
before my first spell actually worked.

214
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:30,004
Really?

215
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:32,637
Well, must be my lucky day.

216
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:45,326
Phoebe? Phoebe.

217
00:15:47,969 --> 00:15:51,041
Your turn to be cursed, witch.

218
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:00,281
Piper, I'm going crazy here.

219
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:02,281
- We're almost done.
- That's not what I mean.

220
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:05,287
Look, you can't come in here
and tell me what you told me

221
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:07,121
and expect me to act
like nothing's changed.

222
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:09,399
- Everything's changed.
- I know. Believe me, I know.

223
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,605
But Dan is out of town,
and until he comes back...

224
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:13,561
When? When is he coming back?

225
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:15,687
Next Thursday.

226
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:18,483
A week? Oh, God.
Can you call him or something?

227
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:20,808
Never mind, that's not right.

228
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:26,128
It's just... You know, I've been waiting
for this, for us, for so long.

229
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,642
And I just...

230
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:29,447
I don't wanna wait any longer.

231
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:33,847
- Piper, you there?
- Prue?

232
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,519
What...? What happened?

233
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:38,327
We got in a car accident.
I wasn't looking.

234
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:39,763
- You guys okay?
- We're fine.

235
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:41,567
- Phoebe's got a concussion.
- A mild one.

236
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:44,005
Still, the doctor said that,
you know, you should...

237
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,125
The doctor? You went
to the hospital? Phoebe, you...

238
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:48,120
I'm fine, really.
I just have a little headache.

239
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:50,160
We've got some aspirin
around here somewhere.

240
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:53,088
- Phoebe, I'm so sorry.
- Prue, it's okay, it was an accident.

241
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:54,364
It wasn't your fault.

242
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:57,606
Yeah, but you know what, I should
have been looking. I always look first.

243
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:01,689
At least I didn't put you
in the hospital this time.

244
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:03,841
Your lipstick's smeared.

245
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,161
It is?

246
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,645
- Don't worry about it, I got it. I got it.
- Okay. I am such a klutz.

247
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:20,925
I can't seem to do anything
right all of a sudden.

248
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,125
Do you think that that spell
backfired on me?

249
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:26,326
- Not possible, no personal gain.
- What spell?

250
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:31,247
Hello.

251
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:34,202
Yeah, Mr. Corso, there was a
problem with the photograph.

252
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:37,401
Prue got this gig photographing
this girl named Maggie Murphy.

253
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:39,127
The unlucky Maggie Murphy?

254
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:42,326
- I'm sorry. Is there anything...?
- I saw a piece on her on TV.

255
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,406
Well, she's not unlucky anymore.

256
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:46,839
Prue cast a spell
to turn her luck around

257
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:49,204
after she saved her
from jumping off a roof.

258
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:51,760
- What?
- Yeah, pretty scary, huh?

259
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:53,766
- That's more than scary.
- I understand.

260
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:57,126
- It got to Prue too. Big time.
- Okay. Goodbye.

261
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:01,162
All right, Mr. Corso said if I don't
get that photograph of Maggie,

262
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:04,366
I can kiss my career goodbye.
Like that's what I wanna do right now.

263
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:06,525
Well, it's a good excuse
to go check up on her.

264
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:09,761
Yeah, I'm just gonna stop by
the house, pick up my things...

265
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:12,084
It's okay.

266
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:15,247
I'll drive because you didn't
get collision on the rental.

267
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:16,842
- Here, you want the keys?
- Yes.

268
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:18,562
Here.

269
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:19,718
Thank you.

270
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:25,157
What? I'll clean it up.

271
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:29,157
No, it's not that. I was just thinking
about Maggie Murphy.

272
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:31,048
What about her?

273
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:33,717
It's just that she was doing all
these good things in her life,

274
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:36,164
and then, all of a sudden,
her own life goes to hell.

275
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:38,685
- So what?
- I don't know.

276
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:43,764
What if, you know, all these accidents
in her life weren't actually accidents?

277
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:46,642
I mean, what if something
was trying to make her jump?

278
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,128
Something like...?

279
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:50,287
Like a darklighter, maybe.

280
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:56,201
It's okay, Mrs. Sidelman.

281
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,927
Let's just get you out
into the sunlight

282
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:00,478
and let you see
what's going on in the world, okay?

283
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:02,401
That's it. You're doing fine.

284
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,998
Maggie has made
a remarkable turnaround.

285
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:06,727
Severely depressed this morning,

286
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:10,768
now, suddenly, she's smiling,
laughing, helping others.

287
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:15,320
However, I'm afraid her recovery
is only temporary.

288
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,366
Why do you say that?

289
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:20,328
Once you've been on that ledge,
Miss Halliwell,

290
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,645
you can never forget it.

291
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:25,767
That deep, dark place
never goes away.

292
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:28,608
It haunts you, beckons you back.

293
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:31,847
- That's not true.
- Oh, are you a psychiatrist?

294
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:34,199
No, but I still don't think
that that's true.

295
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:36,600
Lots of people
recover from depression.

296
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,369
Not people in Maggie's
rather unique situation.

297
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:43,801
She still feels responsible for all
of the tragedies in her family's life.

298
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:45,965
That pain doesn't just...

299
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:47,801
...magically go away.

300
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,962
- May we see her?
- Of course.

301
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:13,765
- You're doing great.
- Thank you.

302
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:16,557
I'll be right back, okay?

303
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:19,329
- You'll be fine.
- Okay.

304
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:22,724
I hoped you'd come
so I could thank you.

305
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:24,681
And ask you...

306
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,123
I have so many questions.

307
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,361
Maggie, I think that you may have
the wrong idea about me.

308
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:31,638
You saved my life.

309
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:34,488
There was so much going on this
morning. It was really confusing,

310
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:37,322
- there were so many people.
- That doesn't change what you did.

311
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:39,838
Who are you?

312
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:42,485
My name is Prue.

313
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:45,357
- This is my sister Phoebe.
- Hi, Maggie.

314
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:48,965
- Two angels.
- Oh, no, I'm just a student.

315
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:51,165
Maggie, how are you feeling?
Better, I hope.

316
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:53,280
Honestly?

317
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:55,884
I feel great. I couldn't be happier.

318
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:58,967
- Even though you're here?
- I'm alive.

319
00:20:59,129 --> 00:21:01,768
And more importantly,
I feel alive again.

320
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,721
I'm able to give.
I'm able to help people.

321
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:06,964
I haven't been able
to do that for a while.

322
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:08,488
That's really sweet.

323
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:11,764
Are you a photographer?

324
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:14,842
Yeah. Sort of...

325
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:17,802
Yes, she is.
She's working for 415 Magazine.

326
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:21,518
Oh, yeah,
they're doing an article on me.

327
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:25,278
Is that why you were at my place
this morning, to take my picture?

328
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:28,009
Yeah. But believe me,
that was the last thing on my mind.

329
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:31,127
No, no, no. It's fine.
Maybe the article will help others.

330
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,564
Help them realize
not to give up either.

331
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,008
Where do you want me?

332
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:41,926
I guess here is fine.

333
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:44,842
Here you go.

334
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:48,727
I just can't get over how
everything's changed suddenly.

335
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:51,568
I mean, I know I'm stuck here
for a while,

336
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:54,448
but I feel like a 1000-pound weight's
been lifted off me.

337
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:57,278
I feel like my old self again.

338
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:00,962
Maggie, I'm taking
a psychology class in school,

339
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:03,279
and I was wondering
if I could ask you a question.

340
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,127
Sure, anything.

341
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:07,200
I was wondering why you...

342
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:10,324
How...?

343
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:13,287
- How did I get on the ledge?
- Yeah.

344
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:16,162
I really don't know, actually.

345
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,360
All I know is
I just wanted it all to stop.

346
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:19,968
You wanted what to stop?

347
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:24,766
The voice in my head that kept
telling me I was hurting people,

348
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:29,679
not helping them. That I was causing
pain and trouble wherever I went.

349
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:32,247
That it was all my fault.

350
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:39,518
It's like...

351
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:41,721
...I was...

352
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:43,198
...cursed.

353
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:45,688
Maybe you were cursed.

354
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:47,561
I'm sorry, what was...?

355
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:50,088
Prue?

356
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:53,000
I have to go get these
to the magazine right away.

357
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:56,366
- Did you just hear what she said?
- Yeah, look, can you take a cab

358
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:58,440
- and take that home for me?
- Why don't I drive you?

359
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,327
No, it's fine.

360
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:02,760
- Bye, Maggie.
- Bye.

361
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:11,639
There's a whole section in here
on darklighters somewhere.

362
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:13,481
Somebody should
really index this thing.

363
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:14,764
Are you sure about this?

364
00:23:14,969 --> 00:23:16,880
Piper, I've been a whitelighter
for over 50 years.

365
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:18,368
Okay.

366
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:20,918
It's just Prue's in trouble.

367
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:24,245
Maybe that's her.

368
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:29,441
- Hello, Prue?
- No, it's me, Dan.

369
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,169
- Dan. Hi.
- You miss me?

370
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:36,041
- No.
- Really?

371
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:39,082
I was talking to the cat.

372
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:40,678
Are you in New York?

373
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:44,478
Yeah, I'm in my hotel room.
So, what are you doing?

374
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:46,488
Just reading.

375
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:49,078
- How was your flight?
- It was fine.

376
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:53,845
Hey, listen, maybe it's
just my imagination,

377
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:56,279
but I sensed a little...

378
00:23:57,689 --> 00:23:59,008
...something going on.

379
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:01,524
Or not going on at all,
if that makes any sense.

380
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:03,603
Everything's fine.

381
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:07,239
So that feeling that you had
something important to tell me

382
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:10,282
but didn't want to ruin my trip,
that's just all in my head?

383
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:12,482
Piper?

384
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:16,804
I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm a little distracted here.

385
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:18,283
Can we talk when you get home?

386
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:20,485
Right. Hey, listen, you know what,

387
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:22,924
you don't have to worry about
picking me up at the airport.

388
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:25,842
I'll just catch a cab back to my place,
maybe we can go out to dinner.

389
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:28,358
Great.

390
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:31,079
Okay. I'll see you soon.

391
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:32,518
Okay, bye.

392
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:34,364
Bye.

393
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:41,564
I'm sorry. It's difficult.

394
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:46,207
I am going to break up with him, but I
can't do it when he's 3000 miles away.

395
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:47,688
I have to be fair to him.

396
00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:51,360
I understand that totally. I really do.

397
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:54,279
You know, I'm glad
that you're the kind of person

398
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:56,758
that would give him
that kind of respect.

399
00:24:57,689 --> 00:24:58,758
Thank you.

400
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:02,359
Now, here's what I'm
really worried about.

401
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:04,523
Read this.

402
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,406
You've got to be kidding.

403
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,924
I don't understand. I checked it
in my camera myself. It was fine.

404
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:17,798
What am I supposed to print
with the article?

405
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:20,324
What am I supposed to do, huh?

406
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:22,008
I'm sorry.

407
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:24,481
You're sorry?

408
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:27,637
I gave you a chance.
I believed in you.

409
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:28,878
And this is what I get?

410
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:31,284
- You're a fraud.
- Wait a second, look...

411
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,445
No, you look. Lady, you're fired.

412
00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:37,039
No, you're worse than fired. I will
make sure nobody hires you again.

413
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:40,997
Now, go on, get out.
Go screw up somebody else's life.

414
00:25:48,489 --> 00:25:54,041
Wait. I can handle this.
Everything's gonna be fine.

415
00:25:57,209 --> 00:26:00,087
No, it's not. He's right.

416
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:02,126
I'm a fraud.

417
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:04,564
- I only hurt people.
- No.

418
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:09,488
It's all my fault. I'm responsible.

419
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:21,448
- Hi.
- Phoebe, where's Prue?

420
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:24,760
- Probably at the magazine, why?
- There may be a darklighter after her.

421
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:26,806
- We need to find her fast.
- What?

422
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:29,563
Was the car wreck right after
Prue cast the spell on Maggie?

423
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:31,367
- Yeah, why?
- A darklighter

424
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:34,043
- must have seen her cast it.
- Why isn't this going through?

425
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:36,524
- Maggie thought that she was cursed.
- She probably was,

426
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,242
until Prue turned her luck around.

427
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:40,565
See, there's a certain
type of darklighter

428
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:42,839
that drives future whitelighters
to commit suicide.

429
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,641
- What do you mean?
- The only way to keep

430
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:47,528
a whitelighter from becoming one
is to have them take their own life.

431
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,247
To lose their souls forever.

432
00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:52,407
They curse them. They bring
their victims self-doubt,

433
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,799
bad luck, the kind
that hurts other people.

434
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:57,079
Then reinforce that by
preying on their thoughts,

435
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,240
make them think they're
responsible for all the pain

436
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,398
when they're actually not.

437
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:03,840
- That's not suicide, that's murder.
- Well, not technically.

438
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:07,962
They never actually push their victims,
they just always compel them to jump.

439
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,808
So Prue didn't save Maggie from
herself, Prue saved Maggie from him.

440
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:12,768
What is wrong with her phone?

441
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:14,806
And that's why the darklighter
is after Prue.

442
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:17,398
If he destroys Prue,
he destroys the good-luck spell

443
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,161
and leaves Maggie unprotected.

444
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,607
Well, he's not gonna get to Prue.

445
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:24,727
- I don't care what he tries.
- Phoebe, he knows her thoughts.

446
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:26,760
He can make her think
anything he wants her to.

447
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:30,126
Piper, this is Prue that we're
talking about, okay? She is so...

448
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:33,482
She wouldn't even think of...

449
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:44,289
- What?
- You guys are right.

450
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:45,518
We have to get to Prue.

451
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:56,446
The cellular subscriber you are trying
to reach is not in the calling area.

452
00:27:56,609 --> 00:28:00,158
The cellular subscriber is too
in the calling area. Damn it.

453
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:01,523
Try calling the magazine.

454
00:28:01,689 --> 00:28:03,964
I already did. They said
she left a half an hour ago.

455
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:05,642
Okay, then. Keep trying her cell.

456
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,369
Are you sure your vision
was of the past and not the future?

457
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:10,838
- Positive.
- Could you tell how old she was?

458
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:13,204
Around 20.

459
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:15,803
It was the same time
that we had that other accident.

460
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:18,042
What happened?

461
00:28:18,249 --> 00:28:21,480
Prue was driving,
and she ran a red light.

462
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:24,647
- We didn't hear the other car honk.
- Phoebe was the only one hurt.

463
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:27,801
She was in the hospital for over a
week. It scared the hell out of us.

464
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:30,762
- And Prue never forgave herself.
- It was a really rough time for her.

465
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:33,568
- For all of us, actually.
- Why?

466
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:35,168
Well, Phoebe and I
were teenagers

467
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:37,604
and Grams was
extremely overprotective.

468
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:39,122
But she was hardest on Prue.

469
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:43,323
She made Prue take care of us.
She didn't let Prue go away to school.

470
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:46,799
She wanted to go back East
to be a photojournalist.

471
00:28:46,969 --> 00:28:48,960
But Grams knew that we were
going to become witches,

472
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:51,518
and she wasn't gonna let
anything jeopardize that.

473
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:54,801
Still, you know what, I don't
care what was happening,

474
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:58,279
- Prue would never even consider...
- I know, but you saw her.

475
00:28:58,449 --> 00:29:01,521
Okay, what I saw
was Prue taking a picture,

476
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:03,486
and she was very sad,
but that doesn't mean

477
00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:05,048
that she was actually gonna jump.

478
00:29:05,249 --> 00:29:08,366
Yeah, but the darklighter will make
her think that she was going to.

479
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:12,238
He'll mess with her head and try and
take her back to that same dark place.

480
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:14,082
Then he'll say whatever he has to

481
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:16,604
and make her do something
she would never otherwise do.

482
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:20,561
Okay, so if we can't find Prue,
how do we find the darklighter?

483
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:22,646
You can't without a whitelighter.

484
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:24,722
They sense each other.

485
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:30,523
- Prue?
- Hey, Pheebs.

486
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:32,082
- Is it her?
- Yeah.

487
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:34,638
- Where are you?
- I don't really know,

488
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:40,759
but I can't start my car,
and this day just really sucks.

489
00:29:40,969 --> 00:29:43,688
None of what's happened today
has anything to do with...

490
00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:46,801
- Hello?
- Prue, can you hear me?

491
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:48,727
Barely.

492
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:53,405
Look, I lost my job, and can you guys
just please come and get me?

493
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:56,646
- Tell her about the darklighter.
- I'm trying. Prue?

494
00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:59,482
Phoebe, I can't hear you.

495
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:04,441
Hello?

496
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:06,647
Damn it.

497
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:08,838
I lost her.

498
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:25,441
Okay, what do we do?
We have to find her.

499
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:29,079
- Well, where do we start?
- We start at the magazine.

500
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:31,399
Backtrack from the magazine.
That's where she was last.

501
00:30:31,969 --> 00:30:33,448
She could be anywhere.

502
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:35,799
How about the Book of Shadows?
You could try scrying.

503
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:37,647
I don't think
we have the time for that.

504
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:40,522
Well, maybe we need a little luck.
A little good luck.

505
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:43,724
- Maggie?
- We need a map.

506
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,123
Okay, I'll meet you at the car.

507
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:47,849
- All right, I'm going with you.
- No, somebody has to stay here

508
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:49,886
- in case she comes back.
- Piper...

509
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,165
If we find her,
the darklighter will be there too.

510
00:30:52,329 --> 00:30:53,478
And if he recognizes you...

511
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:57,398
Piper, I hate this, all right. I hate
not being able to look after you guys.

512
00:30:58,129 --> 00:30:59,767
I know.

513
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:01,522
I'm sorry. I know.

514
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:10,962
What's happening to me?
What's the matter with me?

515
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,444
I gotta keep moving. Keep walking.

516
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:16,288
I've been in this dark place before.
I remember.

517
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:18,798
No one can help me. I'm all alone.

518
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:22,207
Keep walking. Yes, keep walking.

519
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:26,118
Okay, Prue, keep it together.

520
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:29,247
This isn't me. I'm a good person.

521
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:31,446
I do good things.

522
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,842
Are you okay?

523
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:53,768
Oh, God.

524
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:56,844
- Are you all right? Are you all right?
- My leg.

525
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:02,322
I almost got him killed. Just like
how I almost got Phoebe killed.

526
00:32:05,129 --> 00:32:06,847
Run. Run.

527
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:15,327
Gin. That's great, Mrs. Sidelman.

528
00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:19,278
- Maggie. Hi. Remember me?
- Of course.

529
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:21,047
We need your help finding Prue.

530
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:23,520
- Prue?
- Your angel.

531
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:26,283
She's in trouble. Big trouble.

532
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:35,518
- The kind of trouble you can relate to.
- What can I do?

533
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:38,249
We need you to point anywhere
on this map.

534
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:39,967
We need a little of your luck.

535
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:43,917
- But I don't understand how that...
- Please. It'll help, trust me.

536
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:50,081
Here.

537
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:55,442
It's close by.

538
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:57,842
Thank you.

539
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:30,640
It's okay.

540
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,118
No need to be afraid.

541
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:36,169
I know what needs to be done.

542
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:39,004
It's the best thing.

543
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:41,683
The best thing for everyone.

544
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:47,442
It's something I should have done
a long time ago.

545
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:50,964
Jump.

546
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:09,119
That's it.

547
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:13,083
That's right. That's the only way.

548
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:15,849
That's the only way
to save the ones I love.

549
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,923
I should have done it before.

550
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,968
Eight years ago.

551
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,564
But I didn't want to.

552
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:29,085
But if I had, loved ones
would still be alive today.

553
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:32,119
Like Andy.

554
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:34,240
I'm responsible for Andy.

555
00:34:36,249 --> 00:34:38,205
Andy.

556
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,644
It's all my fault.

557
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:45,647
Jump.

558
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:48,401
Jump.

559
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:02,158
There's gotta be something in here.

560
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:05,125
Damn it.

561
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:09,284
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

562
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:10,438
Think, think.

563
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,605
Give me my powers back.

564
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:23,683
I want my powers back.

565
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,881
I want my powers back!
I want them back now!

566
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:29,927
God...

567
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:34,643
I can't keep being mortal
if this is the cost.

568
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:37,568
No, I don't want to lose Piper.

569
00:35:38,529 --> 00:35:41,441
But not at the expense
of losing one of her sisters.

570
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,004
Now, this is my calling.

571
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,924
You have to let me help.

572
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:56,761
You have to give me my wings back.

573
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:14,879
- Are you sure this is right?
- This is where Maggie pointed to.

574
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:20,598
- But she's not here.
- She's gotta be here somewhere.

575
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:23,044
Oh, my God. Phoebe.

576
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,568
Prue!

577
00:36:25,689 --> 00:36:28,761
- Wait, we can drive there.
- No, there's no time. Come on.

578
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:31,961
Prue. Get away from the railing!

579
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:35,240
- Prue!
- Prue!

580
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:38,719
Prue, this isn't you.
A darklighter is making you do this!

581
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:42,484
- I'm all alone.
- Alone.

582
00:36:42,649 --> 00:36:45,004
He tried to kill Maggie,
and he's trying to kill you.

583
00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:47,803
He put a spell on you,
just like he did with Maggie.

584
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:51,484
There is no darklighter. It's only me.

585
00:36:51,649 --> 00:36:53,605
- Just me.
- I have to do this.

586
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:56,721
- Prue!
- Prue! You're stronger than he is.

587
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:58,083
Jump, damn it.

588
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:01,683
- Hurry up.
- I'm stronger.

589
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,641
End it before I hurt them again.

590
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:05,248
Prue. You have to believe us.

591
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:07,798
- He's there, Prue.
- Turn around, Prue!

592
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:12,440
- It's true.
- How did you...?

593
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:14,844
You bastard.
How dare you hurt people this way.

594
00:37:19,689 --> 00:37:20,963
It's a gift.

595
00:37:21,169 --> 00:37:23,205
You'll jump for me, sooner or later.

596
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,400
I haven't lost anyone yet.

597
00:37:27,409 --> 00:37:29,320
- You lost two today.
- Perhaps.

598
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:32,799
But remember, you can't stop me.

599
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:41,087
Leo?

600
00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:43,888
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

601
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:52,406
I gotta go. Now.

602
00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:03,243
Well, the bridge
hasn't changed much, has it?

603
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:07,766
- But you sure have.
- Well, we all have, for the better.

604
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:11,642
Prue, Phoebe
and I were wondering...

605
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:13,607
What?

606
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:16,960
Why I was on this bridge eight years
ago? Why I took this picture?

607
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:18,888
- Well, yeah.
- I don't know.

608
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:23,327
I guess I was
just in a really bad place then.

609
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:27,562
Anyway, I was out scouting for a shot,
and I found myself on that bridge.

610
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:30,681
And I just wanted to take a picture
of it to remind myself

611
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:33,084
of that particular moment
and how I was feeling.

612
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:35,928
- But you weren't gonna...?
- No.

613
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:38,520
No, I would never, ever do that.

614
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:41,757
But why didn't you develop it?
I mean, until now?

615
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:44,284
I guess I just wasn't ready
to relive that pain.

616
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,525
But now I am.

617
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:48,884
Especially since a demon
tried to take advantage of it.

618
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,964
But that was then.

619
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:03,248
And...

620
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:06,242
...this.

621
00:39:06,729 --> 00:39:09,038
This is now.

622
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:10,324
What's this?

623
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:12,997
Hi, it's me. I'm a
professional photographer. Look.

624
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:20,128
- I'll get it.
- Wait.

625
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:22,484
What if it's Dan?
What if he's back from his trip early?

626
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:24,520
Well, then I have to tell him the truth.

627
00:39:24,689 --> 00:39:28,318
Just because Leo has his wings back
doesn't change anything.

628
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:33,607
- Honey, that's awesome.
- I know.

629
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:35,566
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

630
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:41,362
Leo? You rang the bell?

631
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:45,522
Yeah, I wasn't sure how you'd feel
about me orbing in.

632
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:49,437
I'd feel okay.

633
00:39:49,649 --> 00:39:53,437
But I just wanted to let you know
that this wasn't their idea.

634
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:59,519
It was mine. And it's not something
that I wanted to do, it's just...

635
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,202
Leo.

636
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:08,161
I meant what I said,
and I've thought about this a lot.

637
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:11,401
Whitelighter or not, we can
find a way to make this work.

638
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:14,722
- Somehow, some way.
- I'm gonna hold you to that.

639
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,603
You do that.
