0
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:06,648
I don't get it. Who'd want to kill me?

1
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:09,768
We're not sure. But our sources
believe that your life is in danger.

2
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,288
- Protective...
- "Our sources"?

3
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:14,481
What is this, government surveillance?
You have people watching me?

4
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:17,157
Mr. Chang, your picture was
in the Metro section today.

5
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:19,445
Because I planted some trees.

6
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:24,242
Mr. Chang, there were four
brutal murders in the last week.

7
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,007
The only common denominator is

8
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:28,842
the victim's picture was in the Metro
section the day they died.

9
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:31,324
The mayor's in Metro today.
You guys harassing him?

10
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,317
- Mr. Chang, I am trying to help you.
- I don't have any money or enemies.

11
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,925
Why would anyone want to kill me?
This is crazy.

12
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:42,089
All right, what do we do if Darryl
can't convince him to lay low?

13
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:45,559
Well, we follow him, and if a demon
attacks, we kick some Wiccan ass.

14
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:47,964
Look who's back
and badder than ever.

15
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:49,727
It feels good to be back.

16
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:52,119
It's the best way to put this
whole Cole thing behind me.

17
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,843
Yeah, well that's quite a turnaround.

18
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:57,119
- What do you mean?
- Well, it's just that, I mean,

19
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:00,326
you know, up until last week,
you were kind of quiet

20
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:03,720
and not really interested in things
demonic. And now...

21
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:06,124
I am back. Bad guys, beware.

22
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:08,405
Too bad we don't know
who the bad guy is.

23
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:12,568
Yeah, well, at least we know
who his next victim is.

24
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:14,444
- Hey.
- Hey.

25
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:17,919
- So did you get anything out of him?
- Just a migraine. That's about it.

26
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,881
So, what, you're just gonna
let him go?

27
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:22,683
I don't have a choice.
He declined protection.

28
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,919
Phoebe, are you sure he's the guy
you saw get attacked

29
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:26,442
- in your premonition?
- Oh, yeah.

30
00:01:26,809 --> 00:01:29,528
And it happened at night too,
so we can't just let him go.

31
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,362
All right. Then we need to split up
in teams.

32
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:35,282
First one to see a demon yells
"vanquish," okay? Come on.

33
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:55,927
Innocents and alleys.
Don't they ever learn?

34
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:58,603
Yeah, I know. Come on.

35
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:09,807
What the hell?

36
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:17,320
- You again?
- Shut up. Keep your head down.

37
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,605
What happened?
Why did you let him get away?

38
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:31,245
I know that demon.

39
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:34,246
I dated that demon.

40
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:33,166
I think they're lost, Piper. Dead.

41
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,843
No. They're not. Completely.

42
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:38,125
Piper waters when she's nervous.

43
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:40,883
There's nothing to be nervous about.
Chang's in protective custody.

44
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:45,520
No, it's not him. It's the whole
"my boyfriend is a demon" thing.

45
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,960
It kind of hits a nerve with all of us.
And obviously I'm not that upset,

46
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,518
because I'm with Leo,
who is obviously not...

47
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,441
Piper also babbles
when she's nervous.

48
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:56,527
I resent that. I am expressing
a valid concern

49
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:59,487
about this continuing issue
in our lives.

50
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:01,605
What are you babbling about?

51
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:05,248
You know, if I could freeze
the two of you, I would. Often.

52
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:08,846
So here's the demon that we're looking
for. Or at least who he used to be.

53
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:11,125
- Tom Peters.
- Wait, I didn't know you dated

54
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:13,086
the captain
of the college football team.

55
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:16,247
- How suburban.
- Yeah, he was a great guy.

56
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:19,680
I remember Peters. He blew out his
knee three weeks into his rookie year.

57
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:22,568
- What, about five, six years ago?
- Leo!

58
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,118
There were rumours about gambling
debts and that whole scene.

59
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:28,446
There's also a missing person's.
It never got closed.

60
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:31,840
- He just kind of disappeared.
- More like went underground.

61
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:34,199
I wonder if his mom still lives
in town. Leo!

62
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,320
A woman on a mission?

63
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:42,000
I guess the captain of the football team
was a bigger deal than we ever knew.

64
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:49,329
Prue, are you sure we should
pursue this?

65
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:53,402
Ask Phoebe. It was her premonition.
All right, where on earth is...?

66
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:55,878
Leo, what took you so long?

67
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,967
I had... Have a situation.

68
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:05,443
You mean an "us" situation
or a "you" situation?

69
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:08,117
Don't tell me they changed their
minds about us getting married.

70
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:10,803
If that is the case, then you can
orb me up there right now...

71
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:12,408
Babbling.

72
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:15,919
It has nothing to do with them.
It has to do with me.

73
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:20,128
I sort of, kind of,
lost the wedding ring.

74
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:22,920
Got a great ring guy downtown
if you need one.

75
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:26,007
He doesn't need one. He has a ring,
Mom's ring.

76
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,718
I gave it to him so he could give it back
to me at the perfect romantic moment.

77
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,723
Wow, Leo, you lost Mom's ring.
It's a good thing you're dead already.

78
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:37,405
I had it in my pocket, Piper.
And all the orbing in and out and...

79
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:40,248
Your orbs are grass
if you do not find that ring.

80
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:43,600
All right, hi. Before blood is spilled,
can I just ask a business question?

81
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:46,399
Is it possible to turn a human
into a demon?

82
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:50,364
Well, there's rumours. Stories
about demons recruiting humans.

83
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:52,844
So "join the evil and see
the underworld"?

84
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:55,563
Kind of. Apparently the demons
go after humans in need

85
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,924
and strike your classic Faustian deal.

86
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:01,041
But then the humans are forced
into this training academy,

87
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:02,767
a program that destroys
their humanity.

88
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,203
And turns them into demons.

89
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:07,042
Right, and when the recruits graduate,
they have to kill an innocent

90
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:09,240
to seal the demonic conversion
permanently.

91
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:11,161
Yeah, it's like a gang initiation.

92
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,844
You go out and kill the first person
that you see, and you're in the gang.

93
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:17,244
Well, that explains
your four random killings.

94
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:19,365
Maybe it's graduation time
at the academy.

95
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:23,118
Well, if it is, Tom is one human
that they're not going to demonise.

96
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,765
Prue, how do you know we're
not too late?

97
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,960
If we didn't get there on time
and stop him...

98
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:30,438
He would have killed an innocent.
It would've been too late.

99
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:33,328
But we did stop him, so now
we still have time to save him.

100
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:35,878
I'm gonna go talk to Tom's mother,
see if she knows anything.

101
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,922
Maybe you guys can come up with,
like, a spell to find him or something.

102
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:51,077
Mr. Kellman, I swear, I can make
this right. I swear it.

103
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,678
I was clear, wasn't I?

104
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:56,647
I make your problems go away
and you owe me.

105
00:06:56,809 --> 00:07:00,119
Now, did you forget about the last part
of the deal?

106
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:03,880
I can pay you back, okay?
I just need more time.

107
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:06,080
More time?

108
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:12,758
You don't have any more time.

109
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:19,042
Your debt is due and payable now.

110
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:20,801
Please.

111
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,920
I'll do anything.

112
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:30,839
Oh, yes, you will.

113
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:46,678
I don't have to go over all of this
again with you too, Tom, do I?

114
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:49,605
Temporary setback.
It won't happen again.

115
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,841
You know, you're not the only one
exposed here.

116
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:55,682
You got a contract with me,
and I got a contract with The Source,

117
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,079
five full graduates by tomorrow night.

118
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:01,241
Now, all the others have made
their kills.

119
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:03,765
What's the problem?

120
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:07,160
- A witch intervened.
- What?

121
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,566
A witch?

122
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:12,725
- How the hell did that happen?
- I don't know.

123
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:16,199
But I wasn't followed. I used every
safeguard I learned in the academy.

124
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,199
Well, she must be tracking
the innocents.

125
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:22,361
We'll have to get you another one.
But we're running out of time here.

126
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,362
Just kill this one. But do it fast.
Or else there'll be hell to pay.

127
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:38,525
- Phoebe.
- I don't want to talk about it.

128
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:40,879
You have to tell them.
You can't wait any longer.

129
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,523
Well, it's not really an easy thing
to drop into conversation.

130
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,284
You know, like, "Your hair looks great.
Cole's not dead. I let him go."

131
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:49,207
Confession is good for the soul.

132
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:51,200
Yeah, well how about we skip
the confession part

133
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:54,361
and go straight to penance, okay?
I will be such a force for good,

134
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:56,161
the bad guys won't know
what hit them.

135
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:58,441
You can't pretend it didn't happen,
Phoebe.

136
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:02,280
Yeah, and I can't change the fact
that it did, Leo.

137
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:06,118
So if you will excuse me,
I have a demon to vanquish.

138
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:09,289
And you have a ring to find.

139
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,687
Scrying for witches,
a spell to find a lost love.

140
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,522
But there's nothing in here
about how to find a demon.

141
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:23,408
Oh, well, probably because they
usually find us.

142
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:26,527
- Well, there's gotta be a way.
- If there is, Prue will have to find it.

143
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:31,157
Was there anything in there,
you know, to help Leo find my ring?

144
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:34,884
We can't just give up. We have to find
this demon before he kills somebody.

145
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:37,081
Okay, well, do you got a spell?

146
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,960
Maybe.

147
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:06,284
I'm afraid to ask.

148
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:08,481
Just something that I thought

149
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,243
that I needed and then decided
that I didn't.

150
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:14,479
Okay.

151
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:18,327
It's a lost-and-found spell.

152
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:21,529
Wow, perfect timing.

153
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:25,400
Do I want to know what you were
trying to find?

154
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,483
- Cole.
- Cole?

155
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:40,601
Honey, you were trying to bring
a demon back from the dead?

156
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:43,960
No.

157
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:47,043
He's still alive.

158
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:50,407
- I never really vanquished him.
- I'm sorry...

159
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:54,608
It's over. He's not coming back,
and I don't want him to either.

160
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:59,160
Phoebe, you... You let him go?
Are you out of your mind?

161
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:01,559
He's not after us anymore.
He won't hurt us.

162
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:05,518
- No, you don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

163
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:09,967
Piper, I just... I couldn't kill him.

164
00:11:11,729 --> 00:11:14,880
Phoebe, you lied to us.

165
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:17,808
I know. I'm sorry.

166
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:21,286
So this is where this new Wonder
Woman attitude comes from?

167
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:22,962
- A guilty conscience?
- No.

168
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,768
Well, maybe. I don't know.

169
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:30,043
You have to tell Prue.

170
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:35,361
- She won't understand.
- Yeah, well, she's not the only one.

171
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:43,806
He was so fast. His coach said
he could have run track too.

172
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,403
But all Tom cares about is football.

173
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:49,965
I'm so sorry that we lost touch, but...

174
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:56,448
...what happened after he got hurt?
- He was depressed. I understood.

175
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,685
So the stories I heard about
his being in trouble?

176
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:02,121
The gambling rumours?
Don't believe a word of it.

177
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:04,240
No one ever came to me
looking for money.

178
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,400
Mr. Kellman would've told me
if there was a problem.

179
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:08,639
- Mr. Kellman?
- His business manager.

180
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:10,447
He took such good care of Tom.

181
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,164
And he was a wonderful help to me
after Tom went away.

182
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:20,919
Mrs. Peters, what do you think
happened?

183
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:25,645
I think Tom has some things
to take care of.

184
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,404
And he'll be home when he can.
I know it in my heart.

185
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:31,725
My son's a good man.

186
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:42,005
Guiding spirits, I ask your charity
Lend me your focus and clarity

187
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:46,799
Lead me to the one I cannot find
Restore that and my peace of mind

188
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:49,682
Hey, what's all this?

189
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:54,479
Oh, we're just looking for Tom, you
know, with a little spell that we created.

190
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,968
You created.

191
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:58,484
Wow, you came up with
the whole ritual that fast?

192
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:01,642
Actually, not as fast as you
would think.

193
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:07,327
Thank you. I really appreciate
you guys doing this for me.

194
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:09,003
She didn't exactly do it for you.

195
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:12,525
Okay. So, what did Tom's
mother say?

196
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:14,919
Poor lady. She talks about him
like he's been gone a week,

197
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:18,240
as opposed to six years. And
she actually thinks he's coming back.

198
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:21,327
- Based on?
- Faith, and I'd like to prove her right.

199
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:23,122
Well, we're doing everything we can.

200
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:25,559
Yeah, and you know what,
we have saved bad boys before.

201
00:13:25,729 --> 00:13:27,799
What about the priest
with the warlock brothers?

202
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:29,886
Yeah, but, Prue, he wanted
to be saved.

203
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:34,042
Can you guarantee that about Tom?
Or any other demon-human mix?

204
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:37,201
This is not about Cole, okay.
That's a whole other subject.

205
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:40,242
- One worth discussing.
- Am I missing something here?

206
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:43,521
- Yeah.
- Yes, actually. We're missing Tom.

207
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,044
And he's someone we should probably
continue talking about.

208
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:48,120
So if this spell works
and we actually find him,

209
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:50,405
what do we do?
Do we vanquish him?

210
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:52,446
Well, I'm hoping that
it won't come to that.

211
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54,685
Yeah, but what if it does, Prue?

212
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:58,763
- What was that?
- You changing the subject.

213
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:07,562
All right, since when did they start

214
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:10,289
delivering newspapers
in the afternoon?

215
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,521
Since they started taking out
all the pictures.

216
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:17,042
It's a pretty cool spell,
if I do say so myself.

217
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:20,087
Yeah, except what is it telling us?

218
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:23,157
Oh, that Claudia Gibson will discuss
the mayor's position

219
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:28,562
on Net News Live today at 2:00,
which is ten minutes ago.

220
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:32,041
- Our next innocent?
- Yes, and Tom's next victim.

221
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:33,324
- The keys.
- Thanks, come on.

222
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:34,604
Jacket.

223
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:02,401
Well, we didn't bring a vanquish,
but if we throw him into the street,

224
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,561
- that might do the trick.
- We are not gonna vanquish him.

225
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:09,603
- Prue, he almost killed that woman.
- Almost, but didn't.

226
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,927
All right, we need to get him home.

227
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:14,408
Wha...? Our home?

228
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:17,521
You're voluntarily bringing a demon
back to our home?

229
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:30,248
- Did you find anything yet?
- Not yet.

230
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:35,523
Well, while we're waiting, this would be
a good time to discuss something.

231
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:39,483
- Oh, phone. Piper will get it.
- Nope. Machine, remember?

232
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:42,406
- Leo was right.
- About what?

233
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,521
About the demonic training academy.
It's right here in the Book.

234
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:47,805
- Really?
- "A brutal training program

235
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:51,206
which destroys humanity and renders
the subject demonic."

236
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,764
All right, so if Tom
is completely demonic,

237
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:58,047
he'll have a brand on his arm
with six chevrons.

238
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,402
He's only got five.

239
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:05,446
Good. That means
he's not fully converted.

240
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,404
We better vanquish him
while we can.

241
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:10,639
You know, when Cole
was the hybrid in question,

242
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,642
- you were all about saving him.
- Excellent point.

243
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:17,525
- Yes, well, I learned from my mistake.
- And which mistake was that?

244
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:19,640
Believing that I could save a demon.

245
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:22,448
Well, like I said before,
this is different.

246
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:27,803
Tom, look at me.

247
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:30,281
Do you remember me from college?

248
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:41,959
Does that mean he remembers you
or that he doesn't?

249
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:46,246
- What is going on down there?
- Why don't you guys go and find out.

250
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:49,799
- And leave you alone with him?
- I can handle him. It's okay.

251
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,882
- Got Tom's file.
- We got Tom.

252
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,762
Rasputin, get off of the...
Get.

253
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,725
- Rasputin?
- You got a dog?

254
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:17,478
No, that's our gram's dog.
And he's been lost for...

255
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:19,202
Seven years, Phoebe.

256
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:22,606
Okay, so there's one small side effect.
We can handle that.

257
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:25,567
Why is the answering machine
not picking up?

258
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:28,479
I cast a little spell.

259
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:31,766
The less I know, the happier I am.

260
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:42,324
Hello? An old friend of Prue's.
Okay. Let me get a pencil.

261
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:50,722
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Call back again soon.

262
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:53,403
What is it? What did you find?

263
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:59,368
Lost friends, Mom's ring.
And your brown hair.

264
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:01,400
Oh, yeah.

265
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:07,760
I did not want my brown hair back.
I wanted to keep that lost.

266
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,962
You were a blond
when you answered the door.

267
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:13,319
- How did it change?
- Well, it must be

268
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:15,241
because I coloured my hair
in that sink.

269
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:19,078
So technically I lost it there,
and now I found it again.

270
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,485
I hope this doesn't affect
my virginity.

271
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:24,647
Wait, so everything is coming back
to where it was lost?

272
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:25,918
That means you lost your...

273
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,727
Okay, so it's a big side effect.

274
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:35,968
Those better be clean.
If not, it's laundry day for you, missy.

275
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:41,001
You don't scare me. I've been trained
to deal with witches.

276
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:45,246
I'd forgotten how proud you were
when we knew each other.

277
00:18:45,969 --> 00:18:48,437
I've forgotten you completely.

278
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:51,568
You don't want to tell me
what happened

279
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:53,367
because you won't admit
how badly you screwed up.

280
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:55,207
I didn't.

281
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:58,839
It's obvious. While you were still
human, you were stupid enough

282
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:02,524
- to enter into some demonic contract.
- I was never human.

283
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:06,005
You had to have been. Otherwise you
wouldn't have made it to the academy.

284
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:09,007
Yes, I know about the academy.
I know about the chevrons.

285
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:11,439
I also know that you haven't killed
your innocent yet.

286
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:13,443
I will.

287
00:19:14,449 --> 00:19:16,087
You'll have to get past me first.

288
00:19:16,729 --> 00:19:18,560
Kellman will kill us both if I don't.

289
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:21,366
Kellman?

290
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:25,602
Tom, I know who you are,
the person that you were, all right?

291
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:28,363
And I know that somewhere in there,
it still exists.

292
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:33,085
Look, Tom, this is who you are,
all right?

293
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:35,809
This is who your mother is waiting for.

294
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:39,759
Vanquish me...

295
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:42,968
...or I will kill you, witch.

296
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:47,481
Neither is going to happen, all right?
I'm going to save you from yourself,

297
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:50,209
whether you like it or not.

298
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:59,242
Okay, so I think I have an idea for...
Whoa.

299
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:03,448
Yeah, my lost-and-found spell's
a little too enthusiastic.

300
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:05,879
We're finding stuff all over the house.
It's endless.

301
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:08,517
I don't mean to sound paranoid,
but after all these years,

302
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:10,281
I think I've earned that right.

303
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:13,566
How do you know your spell won't find
demons you've already vanquished?

304
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:17,398
- Oh, you mean like Belthazor?
- Okay, one demon at a time.

305
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:20,123
- Did you get anything on Tom?
- Just his missing person's file.

306
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:23,686
All right, anything on a man
named Kellman?

307
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:27,478
- What was that?
- That would be Tom escaping.

308
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:29,168
- What?
- Yeah, I loosened his ropes.

309
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,638
I'm hoping to track him down
to the demon that turned him.

310
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:33,686
Break him, break his hold on Tom.

311
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:37,041
Anything you can get me on Kellman,
I'd appreciate, okay?

312
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:41,805
- All right, I guess we're going now.
- Shouldn't we reverse this spell first?

313
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:02,326
- All right, you ready?
- Ready for what?

314
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:04,480
To save him.

315
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:18,564
- Where did he go?
- It doesn't make any sense.

316
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:21,243
If he could vanish,
he would've done it before.

317
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:24,317
I got a bad feeling about this.

318
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:30,443
It's not just about strength.

319
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:38,040
Identify the primary weakness,
capitalise on it, zero in and crush him.

320
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:40,769
I have good news, Mr. Kellman.

321
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:44,164
- You killed the innocent.
- Better.

322
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:46,285
I can deliver you three witches.

323
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:50,485
Witches? I don't care about witches.

324
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:53,959
I care about deadlines!
Yours and mine.

325
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:58,158
You know, if I weren't running
out of time, I'd have you...

326
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:03,042
Is that humanity I'm sensing
from you?

327
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:06,127
Now, how did that come back?

328
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:09,008
That was supposed to be drummed
out of you by now.

329
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:11,558
You need a refresher course.

330
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:23,005
This is weird. So Kellman poses
as a human, and then what,

331
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:25,160
gives athletes a way out
of their problems?

332
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:26,728
Yeah, a demonic way out.

333
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,527
What about your
lost-and-found spell?

334
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:31,448
Do you think that you could rewrite it
to find Tom?

335
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:34,726
Maybe. How about:

336
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:38,725
Show me the path that I cannot find
To save Tom

337
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:42,126
And restore Prue's peace of mind

338
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:48,638
Way to go, Pheebs.

339
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:51,204
No, wait. I want him to watch.

340
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:15,007
- Oh, yeah.
- Come here.

341
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:19,048
You want your mama? Say it.
You want your mama?

342
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:24,528
Remind me again
why we are doing this.

343
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:27,328
Because your sisters have a thing
for saving bad boys.

344
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:31,960
If I die before I get married, I'm gonna
be really mad at the two of you.

345
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:41,924
Oh, God.

346
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:46,438
Okay, I'd still like to point out

347
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:49,885
that I have a really bad feeling
about this.

348
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:01,278
- What the...?
- Oh, no.

349
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,125
I'm the man.

350
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:32,327
Next!

351
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:35,243
Tom.

352
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:51,361
Okay.

353
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:55,160
- Tom.
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you nuts?

354
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:00,920
Come on, Tommy.

355
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,723
Maybe we need to go back up top
and rethink this whole thing.

356
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:06,328
You know, that would be
a great plan

357
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:08,480
if Tom weren't seconds away
from annihilation.

358
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:11,482
Okay, so we're supposed to risk
our lives to save a demon?

359
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:14,323
Of course, it's okay now that
it's your demon, right?

360
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:16,400
The thing is, isn't it silly
for the three of us

361
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:20,278
to sacrifice ourselves for one guy?
Whatever kind of guy he was?

362
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:26,967
That's what a demon is, little man!

363
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:35,567
All right, what kind of witches would
we be if we started playing the odds,

364
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:37,805
if we started picking
and choosing our innocents?

365
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:40,125
This is what we do, isn't it?

366
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:46,162
- Then let's do it.
- Okay.

367
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:48,724
- But...
- Just go. Tom!

368
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:04,560
Your little parlour tricks may work
on some of the newer boys,

369
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,641
but the rest of us will
be a little tougher.

370
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:16,687
Man, you can't do that around here.

371
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,079
I can't sense the girls anywhere,
which is never good.

372
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:21,001
Do you know where they might be?

373
00:26:21,169 --> 00:26:25,162
They were tailing their demon,
hoping he would lead them to his...

374
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:27,679
...bigger demon.
- Do they know who that is?

375
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:29,567
Prue asked me to check
on a manager named Kellman.

376
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:31,799
He paid all of Tom's bills
after he disappeared, but...

377
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:34,358
He could be a recruiter.
Do you have an address?

378
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:36,406
You think Kellman's a demon?

379
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:40,286
Well, what kind of powers
do you think we should expect?

380
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:45,323
Oh, see, okay. Now, that ain't right.

381
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:48,723
You girls are way out of your league
down here.

382
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:50,686
You have no idea.

383
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:52,880
Well, we know that you have
a deadline, Mr. Kellman.

384
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:55,199
Time to deliver your recruits?

385
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:59,598
And you think you can stop me, huh?
Think you can save him?

386
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:02,961
I kind of admire that
level of arrogance.

387
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:05,364
Thanks. We kind of like to think
of it as confidence.

388
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:07,878
Well, get over it. He's lost.

389
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:09,363
I made a deal.

390
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:11,886
I stand by it.

391
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:19,286
Now, you see that? Now that's
what I call a quick recovery.

392
00:27:19,449 --> 00:27:21,519
Knocked the humanity
right out of him.

393
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:24,562
And we got a perfect kill for him too.

394
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,560
Not if we put him on ice.

395
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:33,241
Kind of hard to make him
kill an innocent now, huh?

396
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:38,004
- Unfreeze him.
- Nope.

397
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:42,601
If anything happens to me,
he's gonna stay that way.

398
00:27:45,449 --> 00:27:48,043
- Is that true?
- Yes.

399
00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:51,080
- You're bluffing.
- Are we?

400
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,083
I'm listening.

401
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:00,361
All right. How about three witches
in exchange for Tom's soul?

402
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:03,402
- Prue.
- If we win, we get Tom back.

403
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:06,003
If we lose, you get Tom
and the three of us.

404
00:28:06,209 --> 00:28:07,927
Risk one to gain four.

405
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:11,766
You really think you can win
in the ring?

406
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:13,801
Well, we don't really have
much of a choice.

407
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:17,245
But if we do win, we don't go into
the training program, we go free.

408
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:19,088
Did your homework.

409
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:25,041
Okay, you got a deal.

410
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:28,082
You win, you go free.
But if you lose...

411
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:30,800
...you die.

412
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:34,399
I can't control what happens
in the ring, only The Source can.

413
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:35,604
Understood.

414
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:40,362
Hey. You know that bad feeling I was
talking about? It's getting stronger.

415
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:42,599
All right, you need to stay here
and keep Tom frozen.

416
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:44,680
I hate this crappy freezing power!

417
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,005
Our powers seem to have
a limited effect on these guys,

418
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:48,682
so we're gonna outmanoeuvre them.

419
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:51,881
And outsmart them and keep our
shoulders off the mat. Piece of cake.

420
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:54,364
So I guess we're as ready as
we're ever gonna be.

421
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:56,520
- Prue, there's one more thing.
- Now?

422
00:28:56,969 --> 00:29:00,564
- Now is your perfect moment?
- Piper, we might die in there.

423
00:29:00,729 --> 00:29:02,321
That doesn't mean
you should tell her now.

424
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:04,400
Okay, tell me what?

425
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:09,682
Cole is still alive.

426
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:14,447
- I never really vanquished him.
- What?

427
00:29:15,649 --> 00:29:19,005
By the way, since you're witches,

428
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:21,637
I think it's only fair
that I even the playing field.

429
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:41,049
Look at this face!
This is the face of pain!

430
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:44,042
And I'm the bringer of pain!
And I'm gonna destroy you!

431
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,967
You'll be crying for mercy!

432
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:48,729
But I don't know
the meaning of the word!

433
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:51,446
All right. People think
this is entertainment.

434
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:52,923
Prue.

435
00:29:54,129 --> 00:29:56,404
- Are we okay?
- Not by a long shot.

436
00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:59,164
Look, Phoebe, if you waited
till now to tell me about Cole

437
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:01,889
in hopes that we would die
and you wouldn't have to deal with me,

438
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:03,562
you have another thing coming.

439
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:06,645
I think that went well.

440
00:30:17,689 --> 00:30:20,328
All right, I'm going to win this fight
and save your ass.

441
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:23,162
That way I can kick it myself later.

442
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:26,767
Hi.

443
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:34,285
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

444
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:44,082
Wow!

445
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:56,882
Okay. Oh, God.

446
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,117
Oh, God!

447
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:03,438
Come on, do something, get angry!
Focus, get motivated!

448
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:05,640
Prue, listen to me.
She lied to you.

449
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:08,409
Bigtime! Bigtime lying to you!

450
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:11,961
Come on, get angry! Come on.

451
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:13,926
Or else we're in big, deep...

452
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:17,798
Phoebe, she thinks you're a weakling,
like, bigtime sucker for love.

453
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,237
Oh, God!

454
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:25,960
Piper!

455
00:31:32,449 --> 00:31:35,407
- Called your bluff.
- Piper!

456
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:02,563
Let's go see how Mom's doing,
shall we?

457
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:07,205
Slammer. Yeah, baby.

458
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:19,881
Say good night!

459
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,121
Prue!

460
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:39,126
Prue!

461
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:51,163
- Thank you!
- All right, we have to save Piper.

462
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:53,718
- How do we do that?
- By kicking ass.

463
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:11,325
All right. One. Two. Three.

464
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:27,841
- Anybody else want a piece of this?
- It looks really bad.

465
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:31,361
- I don't know if we'll make it to Leo.
- Yeah, we will. Come on.

466
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:40,881
- Leo!
- What happened?

467
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:43,688
Hurry, I think she stopped breathing.

468
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:56,167
It's working.

469
00:33:56,849 --> 00:33:58,999
Okay, not that I'm not
thrilled to see you,

470
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:00,682
but what are you doing here, Leo?

471
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:03,119
I was looking for you.
I thought I'd start with Kellman.

472
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:05,047
- He's the recruiter.
- I figured.

473
00:34:05,249 --> 00:34:06,841
The Elders think the key
to destroying him

474
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:08,647
is to turn one of his recruits
against him.

475
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:10,720
So first we have to figure out
a way to save Tom.

476
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:13,847
All right, so I'll call Morris, get him
to bring Tom's mom to the manor.

477
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:16,125
Then we just have to figure out a way
to get Tom there.

478
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:17,762
You want them in the same house?

479
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:19,567
Yeah, she's gotta be the key
to saving him.

480
00:34:19,729 --> 00:34:21,765
Otherwise, why would Kellman
want Tom to kill her?

481
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:23,641
Okay, well, maybe I can
figure out a way

482
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:25,879
to tweak
the lost-and-found spell again.

483
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:29,718
Lure him to the house.
After all, Tom's a lost soul, right?

484
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:33,359
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Yeah. Go, I'll take of Piper.

485
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:35,127
- You sure?
- Yeah.

486
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:43,242
Maybe we should
talk about this first.

487
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:45,525
We'll have to figure out
how to take out Kellman on the way.

488
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:48,078
- That's not what I mean.
- Now's not really the time, Phoebe.

489
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:50,319
Prue, what if we don't have
any other time?

490
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:53,367
Look, we may not be able
to defeat Kellman.

491
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:55,241
- We could lose.
- We won't lose.

492
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:56,637
How do you know that, Prue?

493
00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:00,205
All you want to do is save Tom,
which is all I wanted to do for Cole.

494
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:02,325
Okay, Phoebe, don't try
and turn this around on me.

495
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:04,161
I'm not the one who kept secrets
from you.

496
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,837
Prue, I didn't tell you because
I knew you wouldn't understand.

497
00:35:07,009 --> 00:35:10,001
- You hated Cole.
- No, I didn't trust him, and I was right.

498
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:12,769
- You never gave him a chance.
- He didn't deserve a chance.

499
00:35:12,969 --> 00:35:15,358
Oh, and what makes Tom
deserve a chance?

500
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:17,844
He started out good,
he didn't start out trying to kill us.

501
00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:19,727
Can we talk about this later?

502
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:32,362
Hey.

503
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:36,325
Guess what? I found Mom's ring.

504
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:59,278
Mrs. Peters? Inspector Morris,
San Francisco P.D.

505
00:36:00,049 --> 00:36:01,641
Tom?

506
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:22,805
What was that?
What are those noises?

507
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:24,727
I'm not quite sure.

508
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:29,768
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Peters.

509
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:32,363
- But I don't understand.
- You will soon. Any sign of Kellman?

510
00:36:32,529 --> 00:36:34,087
No, but there are plenty
of other signs.

511
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:38,520
Seems like some lost souls
were found.

512
00:36:38,689 --> 00:36:40,919
Yeah, we need
to reverse the spell quick.

513
00:36:41,129 --> 00:36:42,767
Where's Tom?

514
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:49,917
- Tom!
- No!

515
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:53,078
- How did you?
- Because we're not done with you yet.

516
00:36:53,529 --> 00:36:56,362
I told you it was too late
to save Tom.

517
00:36:56,569 --> 00:36:59,322
But thank you for leading us
to the victim.

518
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:02,521
Kill her, Tom.

519
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,607
All right, Tom, listen to me.
Look at your mother.

520
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,839
All right, remember what it felt like
to be human.

521
00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:16,648
Remember what it feels like
to be loved.

522
00:37:23,729 --> 00:37:26,801
Prue, we're about to have other
problems from other worlds.

523
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:29,125
Tom, help me.

524
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:32,440
Kill her, damn it!

525
00:37:57,929 --> 00:38:00,489
- What the hell is happening?
- I think there are some lost souls

526
00:38:00,649 --> 00:38:02,719
welcoming a new friend.
Get rid of them.

527
00:38:05,169 --> 00:38:11,039
I return what I didn't want to find
Let it be out of sight, out of mind

528
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:35,448
Mom.

529
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:37,924
- Mom, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, Tommy.

530
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:41,764
It's all right. Everything's all right.

531
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,878
I guess some guys
are worth saving after all.

532
00:38:55,729 --> 00:38:57,845
Isn't that beautiful?

533
00:38:58,009 --> 00:39:00,204
Yes, and it's right where it belongs.

534
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:02,803
So is Tom, by the way,
at home with his mom.

535
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,762
And I got Rasputin back
to the family he was living with.

536
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,244
So maybe the spell wasn't
such a bad thing after all.

537
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:10,087
Are you kidding?
We're gonna have to have

538
00:39:10,249 --> 00:39:12,922
huge garage sales every Saturday
for, like, the next three months

539
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:14,568
to get rid of the stuff
that came back.

540
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:16,481
Yeah, and who knows what trouble
may be caused

541
00:39:16,649 --> 00:39:18,082
if those lost souls
had stayed around.

542
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,280
Okay, okay, I will fix it.

543
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:22,804
You guys go and have a nice dinner.

544
00:39:38,129 --> 00:39:40,165
So now everything's back to normal.

545
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:43,682
- What about your hair?
- I'm tempted to keep it.

546
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:47,000
But I don't know,
I think the blond's coming back.

547
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:50,205
Is anything else?

548
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:51,968
No.

549
00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:58,082
You were right about Tom.

550
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:01,163
And I was wrong about Cole.

551
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:03,807
I'm sorry.

552
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:07,041
And you think that just takes
care of it? "I'm sorry"?

553
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:11,279
No, well, obviously
an apology doesn't fix it.

554
00:40:11,649 --> 00:40:14,925
But I'm not stupid, Prue.
I know that I made a bad choice.

555
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:17,281
A choice that betrayed us.

556
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:22,485
I didn't do it to betray you, Prue.

557
00:40:22,649 --> 00:40:23,968
I did it out of love.

558
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:30,205
Right. Love. Love that
almost got all of us killed.

559
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:36,841
You wanted to save Tom after,
I don't know, how many years?

560
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:39,842
Why can't you understand
how I felt about Cole?

561
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:45,085
Phoebe, what I don't understand
is how you could have lied to us.

562
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:50,078
Piper, me. A lie that still poses
a threat to all three of us.

563
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:57,239
Where do we go from here?

564
00:40:58,529 --> 00:41:00,201
I don't know.
