1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,035
Hey, it's so good to talk to you.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,716
I was getting worried about you. You've
been gone for far too long, Glen.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,518
Yeah, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,195
I should have called and let you know
that I was all right.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,670
Guess I ended up staying
a little longer than I thought.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,274
That's okay. You'll just have to take me
to dinner tomorrow night

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,429
to make it up to me.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,071
Dinner. I can't tomorrow night, Paige.
I got plans.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,479
I still wanna meet you, though.
I mean, I really wanna see you.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,437
Good, because...

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,350
...there's actually something
I really want to talk to you about.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,910
Really? Sounds mysterious.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,594
That's actually great,
because there's something

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,149
that I really wanna
talk to you about too.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,754
Great. Then it's a date.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,952
- So I'll see you at 11:00.
- Eleven o'clock is good,

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,237
<i>eleven o'clock is great.
The usual place, the lake?</i>

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,719
Damn it, no.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,919
Or we can meet wherever.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,709
Stop it, I said.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,148
Stop what?

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,638
Nothing. I'll just... Yeah.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,870
I'll see you tomorrow, it'll be great.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,359
I am so sick of this.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,790
Piper?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,752
What are you doing?

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,913
I'm putting the diapers back where
they belong, that is what I'm doing.

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,559
But it's 2 in the morning.

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,676
Yeah, well, apparently
our little ghosts and goblins

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,989
are not sleeping, so how can I?

31
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,029
I wish they would just attack us,
rather than move stuff around.

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,159
I told you, they're not ghosts.
They're pests.

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,517
Residual energy left over from
all the demons you vanquished here.

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,592
Besides, the Elders said
they would dissipate over time.

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,320
Yeah. Okay, well, they're not
dissipating, it's getting worse.

36
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,675
They're, like, organizing
and they're making it impossible

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,478
for me to keep the baby things
in order.

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,480
I know, but it's 2 in the morning.

39
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,668
I'm telling you, Leo,
they are trying to drive me crazy.

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,078
What was that?

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,993
What the hell is going on?

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,560
- Hi.
- Phoebe, what are you doing?

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,915
I am cleansing the house.

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,992
At 2:00 in the morning?

45
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,319
Phoebe. Phoebe.

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,559
Phoebe, hold it.

47
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,153
What, what?

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,788
You're polluting the place.
What is that crap?

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,793
<i>The strongest purification
in the Book oF Shadows.</i>

50
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,678
- You think that's gonna help?
- It better,

51
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,314
because Cole's residual evil
is taking on a life of its own.

52
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,471
And look at my hair.
I woke up, it was in a ponytail.

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,352
I did not put it in a ponytail.

54
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,999
And you think Cole
is connected to this?

55
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,913
Well, yeah. After all the time
he spent here, how could he not be?

56
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,071
This house needs some serious
feng shui-ing.

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,389
Oh, give me that.

58
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,032
I'm telling you guys, it's all harmless,

59
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,509
it's gonna go away by itself.

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,589
Phoebe!

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,989
Piper, blow it up.

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,038
- Do something!
- Electricity.

63
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,713
Poltergeists don't like electricity.

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,955
You were saying?

65
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,639
Why are you so sure
that it wasn't a poltergeist?

66
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,314
I mean, it definitely didn't like
getting zapped, that's for sure.

67
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,508
I know, but poltergeists are spirits,
this was more like a manifestation.

68
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,114
A manifestation of what?
Cole's leftover energy?

69
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,349
Well, not just Cole's,

70
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,715
but every bit of evil
that's been through here.

71
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,391
It seems to be coalescing
into some sort of being.

72
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,949
- Gee, you think?
- Look, I know. I'm sorry,

73
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,111
I underestimated it.
It's just I've never heard of it

74
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,548
getting this bad before, that's all.

75
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,676
Well, you're forgiven.
Now, how do we get rid of it?

76
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,430
- I don't know.
- Don't worry, I will find a way.

77
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,716
Where there's a yin, there's a yang.

78
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,399
Okay, I have no idea
what that means,

79
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,518
but I do know that I cannot raise
a child in this environment, people.

80
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,876
Piper, you're not due
for another couple of months.

81
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,917
Exactly, I am running out of time.

82
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,397
Good morning.
How do you like my outfit?

83
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,471
You look like
you're not gonna help clean up.

84
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,959
You have got that right.

85
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,714
I'm gonna go meet Glen. And besides,
isn't everything just gonna

86
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,155
- get messed up again anyways?
- Bite your tongue.

87
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,079
A little dressed up for Glen.
Looks more like you're going on a date.

88
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,076
- Maybe I am.
- Excuse me?

89
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,798
Did I just hear correctly?

90
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,598
You and Glen together again?

91
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,150
I hope so,
I kind of wanna talk to him about that.

92
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,555
Really? Fascinating.

93
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,110
Haven't you and Glen dated
many times before?

94
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,271
Yeah, we've kind of been hanging out
on and off

95
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,634
since high school, you know.

96
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,879
I see. So you think maybe this time
it might work out?

97
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,638
I hope so. Especially because lately,

98
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,559
I'll be out on a date, and then
I just wind up thinking about him.

99
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,312
Proof of love.

100
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,040
At least he knows you're a witch.
You don't have to hide anything.

101
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,229
That is a very good point.

102
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,960
All right, Sally, go meet Harry.
Good luck.

103
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,473
Thank you.

104
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,757
If you need me, you know I'm just
an orb away. Just holler.

105
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,598
Would now be a bad time?

106
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,872
Hey, hey. I think I've found something.

107
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,268
A witch doctor?

108
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,795
Okay, liverwort
and a pinch of dragonroot.

109
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,995
- Dragonroot.
- Okay.

110
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,275
- Got it.
- Wait,

111
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,233
- shouldn't we be talking about this?
- What is there to talk about, Leo?

112
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,237
It says right here
that they expel evil spirits.

113
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,752
Still, that doesn't mean they're good.
Witch doctors are kind of a wild card,

114
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,911
that's why the Elders don't want us
working with them.

115
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,799
Well, sometimes we don't wanna
work with the Elders, so we're even.

116
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,951
Besides, do you have a better idea?

117
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,638
- No.
- Okay, then.

118
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,354
Get the snakeskin ready,
and after I read the spell,

119
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,873
then you throw it in.

120
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,476
<i>Free us From the ties that bind
OF evil magic intertwined</i>

121
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,316
<i>We call upon the one who cures
He who to the dark inured</i>

122
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,959
Ready?

123
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,475
How may I be of service?

124
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,157
Are you a witch doctor?

125
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,632
Let me guess.
You were expecting someone

126
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,400
with a bone through the nose and
a shrunken-head necklace perhaps?

127
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,158
Yeah, actually. Yeah, yeah.

128
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,159
You know, you make this huge effort
to change with the times,

129
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,515
it's always the stereotypes
that persist.

130
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,114
Now...

131
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,628
...where is the evil?

132
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,397
Here, there...

133
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,071
...everywhere.

134
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,109
You ever vanquished a demon
in this house by any chance?

135
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,231
Oh, only about a hundred.

136
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,913
- Give or take.
- Another hundred.

137
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,950
Explains all the evil energy
I'm sensing.

138
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,991
This is going to take some time.

139
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,559
Yeah, well, can you do it?

140
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,395
Absolutely.

141
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,794
- May I?
- Go for it.

142
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,629
I'm gonna keep an eye on him.

143
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,148
All right, I'm gonna go see Glen.

144
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,514
I have to go to work.

145
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,030
Goodbye, my little baby,
and I love you so much.

146
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,553
But...

147
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,712
Well, hey. Don't worry about me.

148
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,236
I'll just clean this all up by myself.

149
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,710
Did you see what that turkey did?

150
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,751
Good morning, Phoebe.
How are you?

151
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,552
It's a full-page ad.

152
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,550
Spencer Ricks is challenging me with
this chauvinistic crap. Listen to this.

153
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,671
"Ask Phoebe says,
'Every woman needs to find

154
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,193
her own inner goddess."' Right?

155
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,557
"Spencer Ricks says, 'That's fine,
as long as she cooks and cleans."'

156
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,988
Can you believe that?

157
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,152
He's just trying to drum up publicity
by being controversial.

158
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,754
Yeah, well, that's not gonna work.

159
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,830
- Is it?
- It's working so far.

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,958
<i>The Daily readership is up
because of his advice column,</i>

161
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,310
- and we're a little down.
- Well, what are we gonna do?

162
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,596
- We can't just ignore this.
- We're not.

163
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,671
As a matter of fact,
the other editors and I

164
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,195
have decided to fight fire with fire.

165
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,511
- Lf, that is, you're open to it.
- Absolutely.

166
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,433
Whatever it takes to vanquish
the competition,

167
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,034
I'm all... You know,
defeat the competi...

168
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,031
I'm just a very competitive person,
you know.

169
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,033
Oh, I've noticed, which is why I think
you're gonna like our little plan.

170
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,633
We've arranged a photo shoot for you
today at 3:00.

171
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,472
<i>- A photo shoot?
- 415 is doing an exposé</i>

172
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,074
on local celebrities.
We want you to be a part of it.

173
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,309
L... I don't know, Elise.

174
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,313
Oh, it's all going to be very tasteful,
of course.

175
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,792
Although I want you to feel free
to show off as many of your lovely...

176
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,157
...assets
as you feel comfortable with.

177
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,634
Elise, I don't know if I can do that.
I mean, why stoop to that, you know?

178
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,195
I am an advice columnist,
I'm not some...

179
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,998
...Playmate.

180
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,757
Okay. I respect that.

181
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,077
Although you should know that
Spencer Ricks will be in the issue.

182
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,152
What time did you say
I have to be there?

183
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,671
Paige?

184
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,154
Hi.

185
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,276
- I like your hair.
- Thank you.

186
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,359
Serious hug.

187
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,670
Yeah, well, I missed you.

188
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,711
I missed you too.
You look really great.

189
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,871
Thank you. So do you.

190
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,235
How was your climb?
It was the Matterhorn, right?

191
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,469
It was awesome.

192
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,154
There was a lot more people there
than when we were there, though.

193
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,514
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

194
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,669
So, what about you?

195
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,279
You kill any demons lately?

196
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,596
Of course, but I probably
shouldn't talk about that here.

197
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,832
Right, right. Sorry. Sorry.

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,149
- So...
- So...

199
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,709
- Okay, you go first, I insist.
- Okay, okay. Well,

200
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,074
I'm getting married.

201
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,518
- What?
- I wanted you to be the first to know.

202
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,069
After my parents, of course. But...

203
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,753
You're getting married?

204
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,388
Oh, here she is, here she is.
Jessica.

205
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,235
Sorry I'm so late,
I couldn't find parking anywhere. Hi.

206
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,038
- Hi.
- You must be Paige.

207
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,236
Glen's told me so much about you.

208
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,753
It's nice to finally meet you.

209
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,273
It's great to see you.

210
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,714
So, what'd you wanna tell me?

211
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,314
I hope you got it.

212
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,356
That was a little bitty baby one.

213
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,752
Big Mama's still hiding somewhere.

214
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,631
But I'll find her.

215
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,836
Don't you worry.

216
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,589
These walls are clogged
with evil waste.

217
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,398
Worst I've ever seen.

218
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,998
You sure these are good witches
that live here?

219
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,192
The best.

220
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,277
Although one of them
is gonna go very evil on us

221
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,079
if we don't get this room cleaned up
in a hurry, believe me.

222
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,110
- Is that a fact?
- Well, not literally.

223
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,192
All I mean is that you need to
finish up here in a hurry, that's all.

224
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,794
I understand.

225
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,516
What are you doing?

226
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,509
Did you just take something?

227
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,672
You mean this lipstick?

228
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,469
Well, I'm having trouble differentiating
between the witches' magic and evil.

229
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,358
Personal items help me
separate them better.

230
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,391
That's if it's all right with you,
of course.

231
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,639
I guess.

232
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,679
You don't trust me, do you?

233
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,513
Pity.

234
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,516
Witch doctors help rid the world
of dark spirits.

235
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,638
Now, I would think that you'd think

236
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,392
that was a good thing.

237
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,993
Hey, I heard an explosion.
What's going on up there?

238
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,559
Don't worry, everything's okay.

239
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,709
I am a little worried,

240
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,996
and I need to know
if this is gonna work or not.

241
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,314
Once I capture Big Mama,
it'll all be over with.

242
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,869
Big Mama? Who's Big Mama?

243
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,958
He's getting married, that dirty rat.

244
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,553
- Who?
- Glen.

245
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,110
He's getting married to some bimbette
he met climbing the Matterhorn.

246
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,953
- At Disneyland?
- No, Switzerland.

247
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,317
Oh, but me, I'm lucky,
because I got an invitation to the...

248
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,872
...wedding.
- Hey, pick that up.

249
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,638
I mean, I was on the phone with him.

250
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,792
He had plenty of time
to tell me about this, but no,

251
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,712
he couldn't mention a single thing.

252
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,633
Lucky, lucky me,
I didn't say what I really wanted.

253
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,109
I really... I think I would have died.

254
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,237
Excuse me.

255
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,109
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Do?

256
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,469
Well, I'm gonna kill him.

257
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,474
No, I'm gonna apologize
because I'm a good girl.

258
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,837
I was a little bit rude,
especially to her.

259
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,638
Although I don't know what
he sees in her.

260
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,870
She's not his type at all.

261
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,752
She's blond.

262
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,435
Stand back.

263
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,030
Gotcha.

264
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,317
<i>Oh, guess I'm not watching
The Osbournes tonight.</i>

265
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,555
You okay?

266
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,318
Yeah.

267
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,599
My work here is complete.

268
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,752
Your house has been cleansed.

269
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,875
Doesn't look very cleansed to me.

270
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,509
- Well?
- The house has been purged.

271
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,797
Although how it became infested
in the first place is very troublesome.

272
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,709
Go on.

273
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,917
Whoever these witches are,
they're magnets for evil.

274
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,308
It's drawn to their powers.

275
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,948
- Can they withstand it?
- Doubtful.

276
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,634
They're easily distracted
by the pettiness of their lives.

277
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,837
Sooner or later,
evil will overtake them.

278
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,470
And along with it, their powers.

279
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,636
Then we must eliminate them.

280
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,393
Didn't we just do this?

281
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,233
Yeah, and I still think you should have
made Paige stay and help.

282
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,233
Well, apparently,
she has her own mess to clean up.

283
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,550
Hopefully we don't have
to do this again any time soon.

284
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,039
Are you kidding me?

285
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,231
With exploding demons
and trampling sisters,

286
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,198
this place is a disaster area always.

287
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,749
I have no idea what it's gonna be like
when the baby comes.

288
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,718
Well, I'm more concerned
with the witch doctor right now.

289
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,791
Why, because he took my lipstick?

290
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,188
And Paige's keys.

291
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,873
You don't know that he took those.

292
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,031
I mean, she loses her keys daily.

293
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,038
Maybe. All I'm saying is there's
something not right with him, that's all.

294
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,470
Well, he took care of the things
that go bump in the night,

295
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,198
so that's all I care about.

296
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,757
- What happened in here?
- We've been healed.

297
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,911
Really? Way to go, doc.

298
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,435
- I gotta go change.
- Why? Where are you going?

299
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,993
To a photo shoot.

300
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,594
To compromise my integrity.

301
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,557
I'm going to kill the competition.

302
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,517
All right, then. Whatever that means.

303
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,475
Hey, a picture's missing.

304
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,468
- What?
- Yeah. The one of you

305
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,959
and Phoebe, Paige.

306
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,989
- Went right here.
- Maybe it fell out.

307
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,639
No, it was glued in.

308
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,315
Come on, why would he want
a picture of us?

309
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,118
I don't know. I'm not a witch doctor.

310
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,555
All I'm saying is he obviously
wanted it for something.

311
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,156
Hey, who stole my toothbrush?

312
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,159
I'll go make the summoning potion.

313
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,554
I'll go check with the Elders.

314
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,108
If these witches are as powerful
as you say they are,

315
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,349
how will you kill them?

316
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,750
By attacking them...

317
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,235
...as humans.

318
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,473
Women.

319
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,670
With each likeness...

320
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,118
...I'll turn their character flaws
into obsessions.

321
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,191
Obsessions...

322
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,351
...that will consume them.

323
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,713
Destroy them.

324
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,398
Glen?

325
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,795
Excuse me.

326
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,355
You're mad.

327
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,919
No, I'm not mad, Paige.
I'm just confused.

328
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,753
What happened to you this morning?
Why were you so mean to Jess?

329
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,915
I wasn't mean necessarily.
I was just rude.

330
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,469
Fine, whatever. Why?

331
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,949
I guess I felt like you
just kind of came along

332
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,759
and dropped this
huge bombshell on me...

333
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,311
...and I was hurt.

334
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,833
Hurt? Why?

335
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,834
- Wait, you thought you and l...?
- No.

336
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,309
No. I didn't think that at all.

337
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,239
Glen?

338
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,195
The minister's waiting.

339
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,869
You okay?

340
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,354
I'm fine.

341
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,232
Jessica, I wanted to apologize
for not being very friendly earlier.

342
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,919
I really am sorry.

343
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,992
Well, thank you.
Thanks for saying that.

344
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,072
I just don't understand
what Glen's doing

345
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,435
with such a blond bimbette.

346
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,438
- What?
- And really,

347
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,437
who's the surgeon
who does those boobs?

348
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,919
Because they are fantastic.

349
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,833
I should get the number
for a friend of mine.

350
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,479
Paige, what the hell
is wrong with you?

351
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,989
Me? Well, nothing's wrong with me.

352
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,151
I'm not the one marrying
the wrong woman.

353
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,278
Oh, my God.

354
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,993
Wait, Jessica. Jessica.

355
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,550
What are you doing?

356
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,511
Next.

357
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,828
Liverwort, dragon's root...

358
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,919
How close are you
to summoning him?

359
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,232
A little bit of snakeskin
and a bad rhyme away. Why?

360
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,874
The Elders think the witch doctor
has been stealing your stuff

361
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,998
- to put a hex on you.
- A hex? For what?

362
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,149
He thinks you're evil too,

363
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,472
which is why the sooner
you summon him, the better.

364
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,789
- Piper, what are you doing?
- Cleaning up.

365
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,154
Right now?

366
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,717
You know, you can never really get
a dish sanitary enough, can you?

367
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,755
Dirty.

368
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,158
Dirty. All dirty.

369
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,197
Piper. What is the matter with you?

370
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,999
What is the matter with me?
I don't know.

371
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,911
Are those water spots?

372
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,229
Much better.

373
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,230
Okay. All right, you keep cleaning,
and I'll be back with help.

374
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,318
Last...

375
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,715
...but not least...

376
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,473
...Phoebe.

377
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,958
This is excellent. Excellent.

378
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,948
Good.

379
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,309
Excellent.

380
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,919
You're a natural at this.

381
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,911
I don't know about all that.

382
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,476
I'm not even sure why I'm doing this,
actually.

383
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,313
You're doing this to blow
Spencer Ricks out of the water, honey,

384
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,034
and we both know it.
A little more skin wouldn't hurt.

385
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,239
No.

386
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,753
I can't do that.

387
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,315
It's your career. Reload.

388
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,234
Got it.

389
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,198
Phoebe.

390
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,910
- Leo, what are you doing here?
- I gotta get you home.

391
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,308
Something's wrong with Piper.

392
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,032
Excuse me?

393
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,474
Who are you?

394
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,989
Me? I'm her brother-in-law.

395
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,072
Well, good for you,
but this is a closed set.

396
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,998
Buh. As in "buh-bye."

397
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,720
Sorry, but there's kind of
a family emergency.

398
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,791
Sorry. I should have realized.

399
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,277
No, it's okay.

400
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,555
I'll stay.

401
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,190
Okay. We're... We're shooting.

402
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,679
Get the fan going. We're shooting.

403
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,717
We're shooting and we're sh...

404
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,110
Brother-in-law person,
can you disappear?

405
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,793
Excellent.

406
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,473
Beautiful.

407
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,271
- So, what, now you're defending her?
- No, Jess.

408
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,273
It's just... All I'm trying to say is
that's not like Paige.

409
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,475
She insults me, humiliates me,
and now you're trying to explain it?

410
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,591
She was out of her head,
she didn't know what she was saying.

411
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,875
Oh, my God, don't even try.

412
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,036
She knew exactly what
she was saying to me, Glen.

413
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,236
She didn't mean it, I'm telling you.

414
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,719
I've known her forever.

415
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,233
Well, then, fine.

416
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,992
Why don't you marry her.

417
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,839
Rough day?

418
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,433
What are you doing in my car?

419
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,232
Waiting for you.

420
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,951
Careful, now,
you wouldn't wanna fall.

421
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,997
What happened? Where am I?

422
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,310
You pissed off a witch,
that's what happened.

423
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,113
What?

424
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,913
Help. Help!

425
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,199
This is gonna be fun.

426
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,158
Okay, feather, feather.
Where do we keep the feathers?

427
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,239
- Where do we keep the feathers?
- Oh, my God, you've made a mess.

428
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,675
- Where are the feathers?
- What do you want feathers for?

429
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,751
Killer potion for Spencer Ricks.

430
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,551
Second cabinet, under F.

431
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,751
I alphabetized.
It's much more orderly.

432
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,195
I see it. Perfect.

433
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,510
- Hey, what are those?
- Slipcovers,

434
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,755
to keep the furniture clean.

435
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,359
Although I've come to
the conclusion

436
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,317
that we should probably just stand
from now on.

437
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,754
Whatever.

438
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,757
Okay.

439
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,114
Piper, just so you know,
I may have to flee the country,

440
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,919
but just for a little while,
and I will call you, okay?

441
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,069
Oh, no you don't, missy,

442
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,073
there will be no fleeing the country
until you clean up after yourself.

443
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,391
No, no, no. I'm sorry. I can't.

444
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,754
I'm possessed.

445
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,991
That is not an excuse.

446
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,359
Paige?

447
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,236
Thank God you're here.
We have serious problems.

448
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,515
Like what?

449
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,752
Like, why are you wearing
a wedding dress?

450
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,515
Because I'm going to get married.

451
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,790
- Thanks to my whitelighter powers.
- Oh, no.

452
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,951
I convinced Glen
to move up the ceremony

453
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,355
before that crazy ex of his
gets in the way again.

454
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,312
Clever, huh?

455
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,072
Nose job, should have guessed.

456
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,992
Paige, you can't do this.
This isn't you.

457
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,788
It is now.

458
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,349
At least until after the honeymoon,
then maybe I'll switch back.

459
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,239
- That's my cue.
- Okay, wait, stop.

460
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,589
I can't let you do th...

461
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,110
Should have seen that coming.

462
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,109
Paige.

463
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,032
Paige.

464
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,638
Paige, Paige.

465
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,432
- Watch my train.
- Listen to me.

466
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,909
You're under a hex, the witch doctor's
done this to all of you.

467
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,553
Hey, hey.

468
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,915
You can fight a hex.
You just have to reach deep down...

469
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,991
What's your problem, Leo?
Get out of here.

470
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,118
Look, I'm sorry, Glen,
but this... This isn't what you think it is.

471
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,269
Oh, no?

472
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,318
So this isn't Paige's brother-in-law
trying to ruin my wedding?

473
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,789
- That's what it looks like to me.
- Paige.

474
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,635
Did you just call her Paige?

475
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,478
Look, Glen, you know
about this family.

476
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,437
You know what sort of wacky things
can happen.

477
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,079
Can we just go somewhere and talk?

478
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,389
- No.
- No.

479
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,233
Sweetie, I'll handle this, okay?
Go back to your position.

480
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,429
Please.

481
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,633
I'll be right there.

482
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,753
Paige...

483
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,239
...where's Jessica?

484
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,151
- Hell if I know.
- What does that mean?

485
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,913
What did you do to her? Paige,
you better not have hurt an innocent.

486
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,911
Well, she's not that innocent.

487
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,878
After all, she tried to steal Glen
away from me, didn't she?

488
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,793
Well, at least you practice
what you preach.

489
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,152
- Spencer Ricks, right?
- That's right.

490
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,032
You a fan? Got a pen?

491
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,918
No, actually, I'm your competition.

492
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,390
But instead of stooping to your level,
I decided to confront you personally.

493
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,950
That's right. Feeble Halliwell,
as I live and breathe.

494
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,957
Your billboards don't do you justice.

495
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,799
You have a nice rack. You ought to
show it off a little bit more.

496
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,952
You know, I don't mind losing readers
to a legitimate writer,

497
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,152
but some misogynistic pig
that's a fraud...

498
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,349
That hurts.

499
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,549
I'm not a fraud.

500
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,390
- I mean what I write.
- Oh, do you?

501
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,552
If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the kitchen, baby.

502
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,558
Oh, wait, that's a woman's place,
isn't it?

503
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,997
So then, you wouldn't have
anywhere to go, would you?

504
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,550
You know what, you're a turkey.
And turkeys don't write columns.

505
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,994
But they do make delicious dinners.

506
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,071
Piper?

507
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,752
Where are you?

508
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,395
What the...?

509
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,879
What?

510
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,076
Piper?

511
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,512
- Piper, what are you doing?
- Heads up.

512
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,154
I'm replacing this roof. It's filthy.
I told you this place was a wreck.

513
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,873
Piper, I need you
to help me find Paige.

514
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,510
I'm not talking to her
till she cleans up her room.

515
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,159
But it's about Glen's fiancée.

516
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,396
I think she's done something to them.
Something terrible.

517
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,516
- I need you to help me find her.
- Busy.

518
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,193
Piper, you need
to snap out of it, okay.

519
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,512
This isn't about you guys anymore,
it's about an innocent. And if she dies...

520
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,749
- A little help here.
- What are you doing with that thing?

521
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,394
Well, first I'm gonna kill it,
and then I'm gonna stuff it.

522
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,630
You are not bringing that filthy fowl
in the house.

523
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,155
Yes, I am.
Thanksgiving's early this year.

524
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,709
Do not get any blood in that kitchen.

525
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,757
Phoebe, can I talk to you a minute?

526
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,950
- What did you do that for?
- Like hell you are bringing

527
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,429
those muddy shoes in my house.

528
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,869
Like hell. Paige said "like hell."

529
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,477
Jessica.

530
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,113
This is taking far too long.

531
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,389
Please don't. Please don't.

532
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,075
- Please don't.
- It's okay, I'm here to help you.

533
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,470
I don't know what happened.
I don't know who you are.

534
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,437
There's no time
to explain everything.

535
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,033
Just know that I'm here to save you.

536
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,552
It's okay. You can trust me.

537
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,079
I promise to love you, trust you

538
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,870
and honour you with all my heart,
Jessica, forever.

539
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,788
Jessica?

540
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,150
Wait. Stop the wedding.

541
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,436
Glen?

542
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,838
- What the hell?
- They're twins.

543
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,718
And he was gonna marry
the wrong one.

544
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,388
Maybe we could just
give them a minute.

545
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,871
Sure. Right.

546
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,991
Paige?

547
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,155
But why?

548
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,955
Glen, I can explain.

549
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,475
What have I done?

550
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,070
There's no time. We need to get home
and save your sisters

551
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,196
before they destroy themselves.

552
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,000
Piper, I brought Paige,
so she can help you out.

553
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,354
Oh, that's okay.

554
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,788
I don't need any help anymore.

555
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,554
It's already done,
except for the sweeping.

556
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,749
What do you mean?

557
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,191
I think I know.

558
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,391
Piper, what did you do
with the house?

559
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,155
Well, I thought it would be better
to start from scratch.

560
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,232
But, Piper, you can't just vanquish
an entire house,

561
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,914
especially not our house.
People are gonna notice.

562
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,073
Oh, I didn't vanquish it, silly,
I cast a vanishing spell.

563
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,595
It's like a good dusting, only better.

564
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,951
But I am gonna have to do something
about these steps.

565
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,474
Okay, you gotta figure out a way
to fix it, like you fixed me.

566
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,551
- Get her out of this hex.
- But it's individual.

567
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,199
You seeing Glen
distraught over Jessica

568
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,713
is what shocked you out of the hex.

569
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,156
Okay, well, you need to figure out
a way to shock her out of it.

570
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,034
I think I know a way.

571
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,276
Piper, where's Phoebe?

572
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,639
Phoebe? How should I know?

573
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,028
Remember,
she came into the house

574
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,553
- with the turkey?
- Turkey?

575
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,433
Piper, when you made
the house disappear,

576
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,312
you also made Phoebe disappear.

577
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,879
- No, she didn't...
- Yeah.

578
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,553
No, I wouldn't...

579
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,397
Phoebe. Phoebe.

580
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,396
Oh, my God. What have I done?

581
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,471
The spell, Piper,
you need to reverse it, fast.

582
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,358
I'm not sure I can.

583
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,033
Well, then,
you better make us disappear,

584
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,878
because this one's gonna be
tough to explain.

585
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,031
You can do it Piper, come on.

586
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,916
<i>Let the object oF objection return</i>

587
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,868
<i>So that its existence
May be reaffirmed</i>

588
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,438
Nicely done.

589
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,313
Is that a wedding dress?

590
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,959
You just noticed?

591
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,991
Phoebe.

592
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,034
Don't.

593
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,392
Let me have it.

594
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,199
Let go of me,
I have to kill Spencer!

595
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,348
You named the turkey Spencer?

596
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,795
That's no turkey.
I think that's Spencer Ricks.

597
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,995
The other advice columnist?

598
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,037
Well, she said she was gonna
kill the competition.

599
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,191
- Okay, we gotta break the hex.
- Any ideas how?

600
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,952
Yeah, actually.

601
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,315
Take her to the attic and
keep her away from that turkey.

602
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,078
Yeah, take me to the turkey.

603
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,995
We're gonna pay a little house call
to that witch doctor.

604
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,832
Success?

605
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,113
It's only a matter of time
before they destroy themselves.

606
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,317
Talk about premature jubilation.

607
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,436
You gentlemen might wanna see
a doctor about that.

608
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,829
How did you get here?

609
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,798
With the powers you apparently
didn't want us to have.

610
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,155
Good powers, by the way, very good.

611
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,629
Powers we might just have
to use against you.

612
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,233
Wait, don't.

613
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,515
If you are truly good,

614
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,908
we're on the same side.

615
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,960
We felt you couldn't handle
all of the evil spirits you attract.

616
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,356
Well, we attract them
for a reason, doc.

617
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,714
So that we can get rid of them.

618
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,236
You get rid of us, you'll have more
problems than solutions, trust me.

619
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,994
See, we might be slightly off,
but we're off in a good way.

620
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,232
Now, you're gonna reverse the hex
on our other sister.

621
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,992
Or it will be your last.

622
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,390
Phoebe. Phoebe.

623
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,477
Piper.

624
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,879
Oh, dear.

625
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,996
Phoebe, is that you? Are you back?

626
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,594
Yeah. What's going on?

627
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,075
I just... I think you have some...

628
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,754
...issues, competitive issues.

629
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,593
I don't understand.

630
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,436
Oh, no.

631
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,715
Spencer Ricks?

632
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,160
- Hi.
- Hi.

633
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,239
You said you wanted to talk?

634
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,914
No, I got the message
that you wanted to.

635
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,910
Actually, I sent the message.

636
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,910
I didn't think you guys would come
if you knew I wanted to meet you.

637
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,911
Look, I'm out of here.

638
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,997
Please, just stay and hear me out.

639
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,315
Look, I know what I did was awful.

640
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,476
In my defence, I was under a spell.

641
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,234
I know magic and all this
is a lot to swallow, Jessica.

642
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,119
And I don't blame you guys
if you never trust me.

643
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,669
It's not that we don't trust you.
It's just that...

644
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,432
I don't trust her.

645
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,399
Fair enough.

646
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,993
But I will say this.

647
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,280
The spell broke because I hurt you,
and I hurt you because I hurt Jessica.

648
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,116
It's pretty obvious that you love her
and she loves you.

649
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,352
You guys were meant to be together.
I get that now. I do.

650
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,713
And I know that we're
just meant to be friends.

651
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,308
That's all right, we'll clean it up later.

652
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,516
Are you feeling okay?

653
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,238
- Very funny.
- You're kidding me.

654
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,396
That's not killing you,
just leaving a mess there?

655
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,879
No, not at all.

656
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,989
Okay, maybe a little, but not a lot.

657
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,230
Look, if there's anything I've learned
from all this,

658
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,118
is that I gotta learn
to deal with messes,

659
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,429
especially with a baby coming.

660
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,318
Because I hear they come
with a lot of messes.

661
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,232
- I've heard some things about that too.
- Yeah.

662
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,437
Well, it's good that something positive
came from the witch doctor.

663
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,353
- Hi.
- Hey, Pheebs, what's cooking?

664
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,954
Oh, if you're talking about
Spencer Ricks, not him.

665
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,236
I turned him back into the pig
that he was,

666
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,795
and unfortunately,
he won't remember any of it.

667
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,678
I'm glad to see
you're not competitive anymore.

668
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,308
Yeah, no. I don't think
I have to worry anymore

669
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,833
about him taking my readers.

670
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,831
- And why would that be?
- Well...

671
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,357
...because...

672
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,035
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

673
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,998
"Why ask Phoebe
when you can see her?"

674
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,594
Talk about journalistic ethics, right?

675
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,517
No retouching. Good times.

676
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,395
Okay, give... Give me that.

677
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,879
- No.
- No.

678
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,632
- Run, run.
- Leo.

679
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,597
Leo!
