0
00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:05,119
Okay, I think we made it.
I'm sure we made it.

1
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:07,120
- Do you think we made it?
- I don't know.

2
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:08,961
He would've attacked by now
if we hadn't.

3
00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:11,165
Who would've? Why won't you
tell me what's going on?

4
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:13,240
Because we're busy
trying to save your life.

5
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:15,917
- From who?
- Unfortunately, we're not quite sure.

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,723
That's because Phoebe did not
give us enough time to figure it out.

7
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:20,527
Well, I didn't have a lot of time.

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,607
I mean, I can't control how far in
the future my premonitions take place.

9
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:26,681
I saw the attack, we kicked butt,
what more do you want?

10
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,602
I would like to know more
about who we are up against.

11
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:32,124
Okay, Phoebe, maybe you should
check the Book of Shadows,

12
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:34,086
see if you find anything
on this demonic hit man.

13
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:36,724
- Excuse me, demonic?
- And how to vanquish him.

14
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:39,119
That would be a good thing to know.
Do not get sidetracked

15
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,438
with the Cole potion thingy.

16
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,407
The only ones we're concerned
about saving right now is ourselves.

17
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:47,524
Okay, what Cole potion?

18
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:49,680
He told her that he only killed
because some demon

19
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,044
cast a spell on him.
How naive is that?

20
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:53,278
I thought she was over him.

21
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:55,758
- Apparently not.
- What the hell are you talking about?

22
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,966
First you tell me my life's in danger.
Then you abduct me from my work.

23
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,007
Now you're talking about demons and
witches? Who the hell are you people?

24
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:03,761
Look, I know this all
sounds incredible,

25
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,760
but it doesn't make it
any less true, all right?

26
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:08,727
You're a healer, you do good. Now,
either you have saved too many lives,

27
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:11,562
or you're about to save a life
that they don't want you to save.

28
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:13,725
- They?
- Yeah, demons.

29
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:16,966
More specifically, Shax,
who is The Source's assassin.

30
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:21,205
Hold it, I get it.
This is a practical joke, right?

31
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,407
Guess you've got
a hidden camera here?

32
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:26,407
My second wife put you up to this?
Oh, it's just like her.

33
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:31,478
Okay, Dr. Griffiths, listen to me.
This is anything but...

34
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:35,402
What?

35
00:01:36,089 --> 00:01:38,364
I don't know. I just felt a chill.

36
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:41,083
- Phoebe?
- All right, all right, I'm coming.

37
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:44,683
- Phoebe!
- Phoebe!

38
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,838
- Dear God.
- No!

39
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:00,408
Prue!

40
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:10,365
- What are you?
- The end.

41
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:13,879
Evil wind that blows
That which forms below

42
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,962
No longer may you dwell
Death takes you with this spell

43
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:27,967
Oh, no.

44
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:34,677
Oh, God.

45
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:36,682
Leo?

46
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,646
Leo!

47
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:41,485
Hurry, it's bad.

48
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:58,768
What happened?

49
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,607
You guys almost died,
that's what happened.

50
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:03,687
- Yeah, well, what else is new?
- Oh, where's Shax?

51
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:07,205
Well, I tried to use
the vanquishing spell on him.

52
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:09,803
But I think it just wounded him.
He turned into the wind.

53
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:14,087
Well, maybe the spell needs more
than one witch to have its full impact.

54
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:17,446
- Okay. Come on.
- Come on. Come on where?

55
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:21,688
To go find him. So we can
finish him off while he's still hurt.

56
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:23,886
You just stay here with Griffiths,
all right?

57
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:27,758
If Shax comes back, say the spell
to fend him off. Right?

58
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:31,803
Okay, come on.

59
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:41,398
Maybe Phoebe hurt him
worse than she thought.

60
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:43,082
No, he's gotta be
around here somewhere.

61
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:45,479
He wouldn't leave without
getting what he came for.

62
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:47,685
You really think he'd attack us
in broad daylight?

63
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:51,000
Evil is usually more
insidious than that.

64
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:53,565
- Okay.
- What?

65
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:02,400
Blow this.

66
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:07,642
Okay, is he dead?

67
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:10,164
Well, we didn't really say the spell.

68
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,604
Well, maybe we don't have to.
We don't always.

69
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,168
Lucky nobody saw us.

70
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:16,604
All right, let's just get back
to Phoebe. Come on.

71
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:20,958
Back to me. Back to me.
Back to me.

72
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,440
Okay, I'm not exactly
sure what just happened.

73
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,560
But whatever it was,
you saw it here. Live.

74
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:05,517
Thank you.

75
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,203
Now you understand why
you have to keep this a secret?

76
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,842
Why you can't tell anyone about us,

77
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:12,286
about what you saw today?

78
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:16,048
If others knew, we wouldn't be able
to do what we do anymore.

79
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:19,720
We wouldn't be able to help
future innocents like we helped you.

80
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:21,487
No. No, I understand.

81
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:23,520
I mean, I don't understand
everything.

82
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:26,487
Demon. Witches. The Source.

83
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:29,206
So much for my being an atheist.

84
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:34,600
Your secret is safe with me.

85
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,724
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

86
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:41,643
You saved my life.
The least I can do is protect yours.

87
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:45,484
- Okay, I'll walk you to the door.
- Okay.

88
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:48,001
Bye.

89
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,120
How did it go?

90
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:54,326
- We dodged another bullet.
- Yeah, with him maybe.

91
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,002
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

92
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:59,559
I mean, something still bothers me
about the way we vanquished Shax.

93
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:01,202
Like, I'm not so sure we really did.

94
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:04,839
What do you mean? He screamed,
he went poof, just like they all do.

95
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:08,128
Third demon in a row, by the way,
that I vanquished with my new power,

96
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:11,406
- but who's counting?
- Right, but if that's all that we needed,

97
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:13,605
then why was there
a vanquishing spell in the book?

98
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,806
I mean, hasn't that always meant that
our individual powers weren't enough?

99
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,641
Except the book
was written by witches

100
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:20,162
with less powers
than you guys have.

101
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:23,082
- They needed the spells.
- And plus, I think if he was still alive,

102
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:26,321
he probably would've
attacked again by now.

103
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:29,767
You know, Leo, will you
just check to make sure, please?

104
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:32,489
- With the Elders?
- No problem.

105
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:36,801
If you ask me, I think
you're being paranoid.

106
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:38,960
We kicked Shax's ass. We bad.

107
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:40,921
Yes, you're probably right.

108
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:42,603
Then...

109
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:46,158
...I'm hoping you won't
need me around here for a while.

110
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,563
I want to try a new potion on Cole.

111
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:53,085
One that'll reverse the spell
that turned him bad in the first place.

112
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:54,318
- Phoebe...
- I'm not looking

113
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:57,003
for your approval, Piper.
Just your support.

114
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,325
Well, Phoebe, it's sort of hard
to give you support

115
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:01,605
when you're just setting yourself up
to get hurt again.

116
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:04,408
Cole is good inside, I know it.

117
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,167
And if dark magic did this to him,

118
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:09,878
then how come white magic
can't save him?

119
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:13,166
I can't just turn my back.
I have to try.

120
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:14,927
What do you want us to do?

121
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:19,847
I want you to use the magic-to-magic
spell to send me down there.

122
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,807
I reworded it to make it work.

123
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:26,722
Phoebe, that's awfully dangerous.

124
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:29,528
If something goes wrong, we won't
be able to contact each other.

125
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,526
I'll be safe. I'll be with Cole.

126
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,806
And he'll bring me back,
so don't worry about that.

127
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:38,367
You're banking a lot on
that little potion of yours, you know.

128
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:40,727
No, I'm not.

129
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:43,039
I'm banking on Cole.

130
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,287
Cole.

131
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:05,041
Wake up.

132
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:09,161
Phoebe.

133
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:12,879
What are you doing here?

134
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:15,119
I came to bring you back.

135
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,237
You just made a huge mistake.

136
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:31,122
- Right here.
- Hey, pipe down, everybody.

137
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,399
Quiet. Close that damn door.

138
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:38,442
Now, what we talk about in this room
stays in this room until I say otherwise.

139
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:41,961
All right? Go ahead.

140
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:46,526
Seismologists believe that this
quiet neighbourhood is actually

141
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:50,045
- sitting on top of a fault line.
- What in the hell?

142
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:52,887
Oh, my God.

143
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:57,804
Back to me. Back to me.

144
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:01,242
Has this hit the network feed yet?

145
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:04,162
No, but if we don't send it,
some idiot out there who taped it will.

146
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:05,967
We won't be able to control
the revenue stream.

147
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:08,882
Hold it. We don't even know
what the hell it is we've got here yet.

148
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:11,005
Can we just start with that, please?

149
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:13,399
- Elana?
- I don't know. I mean, you saw it.

150
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:16,037
What else could it be
other than something supernatural?

151
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:17,324
Oh, come on, give me a break.

152
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:20,521
It could've been anything, some
kind of military deal. Publicity stunt.

153
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:21,923
Right, publicity stunt.

154
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,319
- For what, NASA?
- Besides, why would they pull a stunt?

155
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:26,639
- They didn't know we were there.
- You don't know that.

156
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,561
Maybe they only pretended
not to know.

157
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,527
- For all we know, this is a hoax.
- Yeah. If it is, and we send it out

158
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:33,600
before we authenticate it,
we'll look like fools.

159
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:35,680
We can't put the genie
back in the bottle, Dave.

160
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:39,285
Two hundred thousand viewers
saw it live. What do you want to do?

161
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:48,518
Go find out who
these women are, fast.

162
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:50,959
But be careful, okay?
They may not wanna be found.

163
00:10:56,969 --> 00:11:00,279
- What did you expect to find?
- I don't know, something, though.

164
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:03,563
Well, demons don't usually
leave footprints, remember?

165
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,242
No, but sometimes
they leave a residue

166
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:07,718
when they've been vanquished,
something otherwise innocuous.

167
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:10,357
Look, I just don't understand
how we could vanquish

168
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:12,247
such a powerful demon
without a spell.

169
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:15,927
Well, frankly, I'm more worried
about Phoebe than Shax.

170
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:18,649
- We shouldn't have let her go.
- Phoebe can take care of herself,

171
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,288
Dr. Griffiths can't. Look...

172
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:23,725
Piper, I've had a bad feeling
about this, and I've had one all day.

173
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:26,642
And if there's one thing I've learned
since becoming a witch,

174
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:28,646
it is to trust those feelings.

175
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:30,401
Hi.

176
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:35,040
Come on, sweetie.

177
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:37,245
Stay away from them.

178
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:42,767
Hey.

179
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:48,762
Sit.

180
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:50,965
- Morris.
- Captain.

181
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:53,597
Looks like all those freaky rumours
about you and the Halliwells

182
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:56,237
might not have been rumours
after all.

183
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:58,081
What do you mean?

184
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:04,405
Oh, no.

185
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:11,838
No, I understand.
How long will he be in there?

186
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:14,239
Okay, just have Dr. Griffiths
call me as soon as possible.

187
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,728
All right, thanks. Bye.

188
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:18,642
Okay, well, at least Griffiths
is in surgery for now.

189
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:21,807
- No way Shax will attack him in there.
- Okay, but what do we do then?

190
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:23,766
We can't protect him indefinitely.

191
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:25,722
Well, if I'm right, we won't have to.

192
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:28,722
I mean, Shax will attack sooner
rather than later. We should go.

193
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:31,278
No, we should wait for Leo,
to see what he found out.

194
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:33,121
Especially with Phoebe gone.
I mean,

195
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,564
what if we need
the power of three?

196
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:38,202
Maybe that's Griffiths.

197
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:41,486
- Digital-video experts outside KCSF
- Hello?

198
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:43,685
- have examined the original...
- Darryl, just wait.

199
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:45,999
Slow down, okay? What?

200
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:48,643
Have you see the TV yet today?
It's all over it.

201
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,438
- What's all over it, Darryl?
- Just turn on the TV, okay?

202
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:56,761
I told the captain I would handle this,
but I can't ward him off for long.

203
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,198
Stand by.

204
00:12:58,369 --> 00:13:00,519
- Oh, my God.
- We now switch to Elana Dominguez,

205
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:03,078
- Prue? Prue?
- with another exclusive. Elana?

206
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:07,606
Here we are approaching the home
of where they allegedly live.

207
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:14,685
Prue, Piper and Phoebe Halliwell.

208
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:20,038
And you're gonna meet them live,
right here on KCSF.

209
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,646
What are we gonna do?

210
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:33,361
- Oh, look.
- Are you coming to arrest them?

211
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:34,803
Do you consider them dangerous?

212
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:36,368
- No comment.
- Is the FBI involved?

213
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,485
- I said, no comment.
- Have any idea who they are?

214
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:39,684
Hey, hey, I can help.

215
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:42,363
I know who they are. I mean,
I know what they are, they're witches.

216
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,201
Just like me, just like I am.

217
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:46,007
Yeah, Prue, I'm at the door.
Open it up.

218
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:48,803
- Would you like to make a statement?
- I said, no comment.

219
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:51,437
- Oh, Miss Halliwell. I've got...
- Back off!

220
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:54,721
Isn't that illegal? Can't you
do something about that?

221
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:57,278
Killing somebody live on TV
is pretty illegal too, you know.

222
00:13:57,449 --> 00:13:58,962
Okay, it wasn't somebody, Darryl.

223
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,838
It was a demon, and we're pretty sure
we didn't kill him anyway.

224
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:05,643
You want to try telling them that?
Look, I've called for backup,

225
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:08,881
but that's not gonna help for long.
This thing's gonna get ugly fast.

226
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,358
We shouldn't have followed
Shax into the street.

227
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:13,560
- We didn't have a choice, Piper.
- Didn't we?

228
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:15,846
Sure, we could've
let him kill our innocent.

229
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:18,000
That would've been better,
you think?

230
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:21,123
All right, you know what?

231
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:23,405
Let's not let this thing
get between us, okay?

232
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:25,400
We have enough problems
as it is, please.

233
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:27,161
More than you know.
The captain wants me

234
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:28,682
to bring you in for questioning.

235
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:32,199
Right, Darryl, and what do we
tell him? The truth?

236
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,365
What are you gonna tell them?

237
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:36,648
Captain.

238
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:40,806
You know, maybe when
Phoebe's done saving Cole,

239
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:42,721
she can come back and save us.

240
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:46,767
Hello, Leo, nice of you to orb in.
Where have you been?

241
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:49,279
Trying to figure out how to get you
out of this mess.

242
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:52,088
- It's pretty big news up there.
- Well, in case you hadn't noticed,

243
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:54,240
it's pretty big news down here too.
Any suggestions?

244
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:56,001
No. They're still working on it.

245
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:59,161
Well, then by all means,
tell them to take their time.

246
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:00,882
They're not the ones
that screwed up.

247
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:02,158
Excuse me, screwed up?

248
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:05,566
We've been busting our Wiccan butts
for three years without getting caught.

249
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:08,801
- Don't we get credit for that?
- Piper, you've been exposed.

250
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,398
If we can't fix this, it could
undermine the good you've done

251
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:13,560
and all the good that you're
still destined to do.

252
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:16,607
Well, maybe this is our destiny.
Maybe it's just not meant to be.

253
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,526
- You don't believe that.
- Don't I?

254
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:23,047
I don't. I mean, look, this whole year

255
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:25,001
has just been
a series of tests, right?

256
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:28,479
To see what we're made of.
Well, maybe this is one more test.

257
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,482
Which means we can't give up,
all right?

258
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:33,288
So while the Elders are figuring out
what we're supposed to do,

259
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:36,247
- we still have work to do, okay?
- Dr. Griffiths?

260
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:39,321
Yeah, if we don't catch him before
he gets out of surgery, Shax will.

261
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:40,888
Unless you know something
we don't?

262
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:43,638
No, you're right. Your powers
aren't enough to vanquish him.

263
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,925
You'll need the three of you
to say the spell.

264
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:48,523
Yeah, well, we only have
two of us. Don't ask,

265
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:50,879
- just orb us to the hospital, okay?
- I can't.

266
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:54,167
The Elders won't let me. They don't
wanna risk exposing whitelighters too.

267
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:56,325
- Cowards.
- Fine, we'll just save him

268
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,639
- without your guys' help. Let's go.
- Whoa, Prue. Prue.

269
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:01,846
Even if you can save your innocent,
that still doesn't save yourselves.

270
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:04,000
I know that.
But first things first, all right.

271
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:06,808
Try and buy us as much time
with your captain as you can, and you,

272
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,681
get back up there
and whitelight a fire

273
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:11,403
underneath your bosses' butts.
Let's go.

274
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:15,446
- Whether arrests have been made...
- Hey, I need to talk to you.

275
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,521
- Miss Halliwell.
- No, wait, don't leave, don't leave.

276
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,607
- Miss Halliwell.
- Hey, take me.

277
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:27,006
- Come on, please. Take me with you.
- Stay on the car.

278
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:29,837
How'd that happen?

279
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,006
Let's go, let's go.
Let's follow on them.

280
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:39,767
- You're not an easy girl to dump.
- Yeah, well, I didn't risk everything

281
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:41,885
to come down here
and not get what I came for.

282
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:46,003
Well, you can't have me,
not anymore.

283
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:49,043
I can if I reverse the spell
that took you away from me.

284
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:53,124
We've already had this conversation,
Phoebe. Even if you could reverse it,

285
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:55,757
- it doesn't change the fact that l...
- That you killed a witch.

286
00:16:56,609 --> 00:16:59,806
Yeah, I know, Cole, but you didn't do it
willingly, and that's the difference.

287
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:01,682
That's what gives you
a second chance.

288
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:03,521
That's what gives us a second chance.

289
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:08,844
I already had a second chance.

290
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,883
And I blew it. Now, this...

291
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:14,921
...is your last chance.

292
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:18,043
Do you understand?
No more games.

293
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:20,001
Go home.

294
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:21,922
You can't save me.

295
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:26,960
You wanna bet?

296
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,087
Pretty cool potion, huh?

297
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:52,804
Let's get out of here.

298
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:55,928
Where?

299
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:59,644
What do you mean, where?
Home, back to my place.

300
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:02,682
You really think
they're just gonna let me go?

301
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,680
They're not gonna
come looking for me again?

302
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:05,964
We'll fight them off.

303
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:09,638
For how long, indefinitely?

304
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:12,039
Phoebe, we tried it up there.
It doesn't work for us.

305
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:16,483
So where does that leave us?

306
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:21,401
Right where we are.

307
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:26,960
Dr. Griffiths, three-four.

308
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:28,801
- Yes. Yes.
- Dr. Griffiths. Three-four.

309
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:31,688
Yes, here he is now.

310
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:33,242
This is Dr. Griffiths.

311
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:35,798
- Hi, he's still after you, come on.
- What? Wait. Where...?

312
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:36,958
- Come on.
- Let's go.

313
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:38,847
I don't have...

314
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:41,320
- I thought you got rid of this thing.
- Yeah, well,

315
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:43,320
- we don't think that anymore.
- Where we going?

316
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,367
- Just somewhere where it's safe.
- Look, I'm not cut out for this stuff.

317
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:49,202
- Get in the car.
- I swear...

318
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:08,129
Evil wind that blows
That which forms below

319
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:11,958
No longer may you dwell
Death takes you with this spell

320
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,557
Now that was a vanquish.

321
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:22,001
- Nice going.
- That's amazing.

322
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,959
News at 11.

323
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,404
Oh, that's bad.

324
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:34,037
I believe!

325
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:44,199
- Stand back!
- Let me talk to you!

326
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:46,803
I'm one of you.

327
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:50,843
Prue! Piper! I'm one of you.

328
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:54,319
I'm the only one who understands.
I can help.

329
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,840
Hey.

330
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:00,482
Prue. Piper!

331
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:04,728
Get those idiots off the driveway,
get them back behind the tape.

332
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:08,086
All right, what I can't figure out is how
they knew that we were at the hospital.

333
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,762
I mean, they didn't follow us.

334
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:12,847
The reporter probably LoJacked
your car and followed you.

335
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:15,648
Forget it. You know, I really hope
Phoebe's doing better down there

336
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:17,447
than we are up here.

337
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:19,600
Look at all these interview
requests we're getting.

338
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:23,284
Ted Koppel, TIME magazine,
Jerry Springer.

339
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:24,643
Sports Illustrated?

340
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:27,323
Yeah, they probably want you
for the Swimsuit Edition.

341
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:29,397
I'm just kidding.

342
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:33,562
You know what, this is a nightmare.
Where is Leo?

343
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,928
Piper.

344
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:39,561
Okay. Is that who I think it is?

345
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:42,368
And then one of them said
they needed a vanquishing spell.

346
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:44,042
Dr. Griffiths?

347
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:46,240
She ran upstairs to get
some book.

348
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:49,640
I don't know,
some witch-type book, I guess.

349
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,805
Something that told them
how to kill that demon.

350
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:55,797
So much for keeping our secret.
Turn him off.

351
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,081
Those sisters were always
a little strange, if you ask me.

352
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:00,967
I know for a fact

353
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:05,805
that Prue once cast a spell to make
my boyfriend break up with me.

354
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:07,362
Evil.

355
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:10,324
Okay, Susie Johnson
from tenth grade?

356
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:11,638
They're interviewing her?

357
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:13,767
I always wondered why they broke up.

358
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:16,079
Not funny, not funny.

359
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:18,524
Leo. Leo.

360
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:20,761
Leo!

361
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,480
Leo!

362
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:29,361
All right. This thing
has to end now, okay?

363
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:31,679
The media is turning it
into a freaking circus.

364
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:33,561
Now you know why the Elders
have always been

365
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:36,368
- highly concerned about exposure.
- Okey-dokey, now we know.

366
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:40,841
- Do they have any solutions or not?
- Well, one. But it's a long shot.

367
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:43,480
You have to try
and contact Tempus.

368
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:48,520
Tempus? Temp...
Tempus, the demon?

369
00:21:48,689 --> 00:21:51,442
He's the only one on either side
who has the power to manipulate time,

370
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,440
to reset everything
before this all started.

371
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:55,884
Okay, you're definitely right.
That... That's...

372
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,244
- That qualifies as a long shot.
- We vanquished him.

373
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:00,365
No. You defeated him,
you didn't vanquish him.

374
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,400
But that's not the real problem.

375
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:04,645
The real trick is
trying to contact him.

376
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:06,606
He's an upper-level demon
who's well insulated.

377
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:09,488
And why would he wanna help us?
I mean, we can't make a move

378
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:13,278
without the whole world tuning in
to watch. We're basically powerless.

379
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:15,559
Why would he want to change that?

380
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:18,917
Cool, I made it.

381
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,683
- You, get off that...
- Who the hell are you?

382
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:25,404
I'm Alice, Alice Hicks.
I've been trying to contact you.

383
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,839
I wanna join your coven.

384
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:30,358
Are you nuts? This is our home.
Get out of here.

385
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:34,802
All units, stay back!
All units, stay back!

386
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:42,363
- You guys okay?
- Yeah, we got it, Darryl.

387
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,845
All right, this has to end now
or our lives are over.

388
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:51,607
Here she comes. Go, close-up. What
happened? What did they do to you?

389
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:54,408
- Did they think you were a demon?
- Did they think you were a joke?

390
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:58,199
- They're mean witches.
- Tell us, tell us.

391
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:00,519
Come on, tell us. How many people
were in there?

392
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:03,123
Well, okay, so how do we
contact Tempus?

393
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:05,325
Through Cole. He's an upper-level
demon, isn't he?

394
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:08,482
- Why would he help us?
- Because helping us helps Phoebe.

395
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:10,008
Are you allowed to orb down there?

396
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:13,400
Yes, but I won't be able to find her until
I'm there. I can't track her from here.

397
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:15,878
All right, well, then you'd better hurry.

398
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:19,839
- Okay, what's the matter?
- Well, once I'm down there,

399
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:22,648
you won't be able to contact me
if you get in any kind of trouble.

400
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:26,522
Honey, what more trouble
could we possibly get into?

401
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:30,238
Besides, once time resets itself,
then everything should be fine.

402
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,242
- So go, and be careful.
- Yeah, you too.

403
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:40,519
Okay, so, what do you say,
Oprah or Barbara?

404
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:46,284
Barbara makes you cry.
We go with Oprah.

405
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,167
Phoebe?

406
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:54,921
I have to get you out of here.

407
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,328
You mean, get us out of here.

408
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,123
Listen to me, this is serious.

409
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:04,725
Something's happening.
Something big, l...

410
00:24:05,249 --> 00:24:06,841
It's too dangerous for you here.

411
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:09,404
- Why? What's happening?
- I don't know,

412
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:12,601
but whatever it is, it's important
enough for The Source to have come.

413
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:14,521
What?

414
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:18,083
He's here? Now?

415
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:20,327
Which is why you have to go.

416
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:25,528
- Leo.
- Are you out of your mind?

417
00:24:25,689 --> 00:24:28,806
- What are you doing?
- Trying to save my family.

418
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:31,881
Prue and Piper have been exposed.
The whole world knows you're witches.

419
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:33,277
What?

420
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:34,882
- How?
- It doesn't matter how.

421
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:37,649
What matters is getting them out of it,
which requires your help.

422
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:39,484
Come again?

423
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:42,522
You have to get to Tempus,
you have to get him to reverse time.

424
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:46,240
Oh, you gotta be kidding.
There's no way.

425
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:49,004
Look, it's the only way there is.
But we have to move fast.

426
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:52,360
l... I couldn't summon Tempus
even if I wanted to.

427
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,599
I don't have that kind of power.

428
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:57,245
But you know somebody who does.

429
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,122
Wait, you want me

430
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:04,405
to ask The Source to help witches?

431
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:07,444
Doesn't just help witches.
The demonic world

432
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,839
has been exposed too, Cole.
Why do you think he's here?

433
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:12,285
Resetting time solves
everybody's problem.

434
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:15,521
Make it your idea. Pitch it like
you're doing it to save him, not them.

435
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:20,162
Whether that's why
you're doing it or not.

436
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,759
This is suicide.

437
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,924
I've heard the rumours.
I beg you, are they true?

438
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:07,842
- Have we been exposed?
- What business is it of yours?

439
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:11,844
I may have a solution.
Tempus' powers...

440
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:15,086
Are still weakened from when
he last turned back time.

441
00:26:15,249 --> 00:26:18,878
Doing so again will destroy him.

442
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:21,524
What other choice is there?

443
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:29,241
- Forgive me.
- For your betrayal, never.

444
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:36,527
I know of your struggles, Belthazor.
Of your witch.

445
00:26:36,689 --> 00:26:39,487
I know that's why
you've come to me.

446
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:42,117
I know everything about you.

447
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:47,682
Tempus will do as you suggest
if your witch crosses over.

448
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:50,801
If your witch joins us.

449
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:52,197
She'd never do that.

450
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,402
Not even to save
one of her sisters' lives?

451
00:26:57,009 --> 00:26:58,601
Has one of them been killed?

452
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:01,564
Wait.

453
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:12,119
I'm on the scene amongst
this frenzied crowd...

454
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:18,888
I don't know why
we're bothering to do this.

455
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:21,643
In case time doesn't reset itself.

456
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:23,128
If time doesn't reset itself,

457
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:25,928
this table against that door
is not gonna help much.

458
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:28,205
Then we better start thinking
about what would, okay?

459
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:29,722
Because if Leo doesn't succeed,

460
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:31,845
we're gonna have to figure out
what we're gonna do.

461
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:34,523
We're gonna do talk shows
and book signings and movie deals,

462
00:27:34,689 --> 00:27:36,919
and then be taken by the CIA
and dissected.

463
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,602
How can you be joking
about this, Piper?

464
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:41,886
- Who's joking?
- Well, I'm not.

465
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:45,325
All right, I'm scared.
And you should be too.

466
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:48,640
Okay, our lives, Piper,
everything that we've worked for,

467
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:52,882
could be completely destroyed with...
With one stupid mistake.

468
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:56,041
Our entire future, our entire destiny,
could be wiped out just like that.

469
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:00,761
What was that?

470
00:28:04,489 --> 00:28:06,605
Piper. Piper.

471
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,521
Piper.

472
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:13,317
I killed the wicked witch.

473
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:17,158
The wicked witch is dead.
I killed the wicked witch.

474
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:34,044
Oh, God. Oh, God. I know.
I know. You're okay.

475
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:35,841
You're okay.

476
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:38,000
Leo!

477
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:43,400
Leo!

478
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,761
Okay, we have to get you
to the hospital. Come on.

479
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:52,798
Leo!

480
00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:55,924
Leo!

481
00:28:56,129 --> 00:28:58,040
Miss Halliwell, please,
what is going on?

482
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,161
Miss Halliwell, please.

483
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:04,880
Leo!

484
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:13,439
- Look out for the guy.
- Where are you going?

485
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:15,924
- Move!
- Miss Halliwell, what is going on?

486
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:17,722
Move!

487
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:21,160
Miss Halliwell, where are you going?
Miss Halliwell, please...

488
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:24,685
Move out of my way.
I gotta get her to the hospital! Move!

489
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,323
- What happened to your...?
- Move out of my way.

490
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:36,643
Get out of the way.
What is wrong with you people?

491
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:44,563
Leo!

492
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:34,963
You're okay.

493
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:38,326
Hang in there. Where's Dr. Griffiths?
He should've been here by now.

494
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:41,686
- How did this happen?
- Some idiot in front of our house.

495
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:45,245
- What do we know?
- Pulse is 70 and weak.

496
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:46,967
I need some numbers, people.

497
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:48,718
At the count of three.

498
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:51,887
- One. Two. Three. Go.
- Suture kit standing by.

499
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:55,837
Suture kit prepared.

500
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:59,405
Small entry wound, upper right back.
Larger exit wound, abdomen.

501
00:31:01,249 --> 00:31:03,638
Lungs failing.
Stir an IV of lactated ringers.

502
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:05,242
- Two units of O, stat.
- Right away.

503
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:06,484
Leo.

504
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:08,964
- Grab 40 cc's adrenaline.
- He... He can't hear you.

505
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,008
Leo. Something
must have gone wrong.

506
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:21,200
You hang in there.
Don't you dare die on me.

507
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:23,959
Pin in the lower back.

508
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:25,761
- Prue...
- Hold it there.

509
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:27,408
...I'm cold.

510
00:31:28,649 --> 00:31:29,968
I can't... I can't...

511
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:32,637
- I can't feel my legs.
- Pulse is dropping.

512
00:31:33,969 --> 00:31:34,958
Don't go.

513
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:40,480
I love you.

514
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:45,162
Oh, God.

515
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:46,922
Full arrest. Paddles!

516
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,403
Gel.

517
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:56,082
- Clear.
- Clear.

518
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:00,522
- Recharge.
- Recharge.

519
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:03,440
- Clear.
- Clear.

520
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:16,081
- I'm sorry.
- No!

521
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:19,362
No, God.

522
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,238
Get out of here.

523
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:42,718
Go!

524
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,127
Yeah.

525
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:12,007
Maybe it shouldn't. l...

526
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:15,277
Cole.

527
00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:19,199
Where have you been?
We've been worried.

528
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:21,166
What's the matter?

529
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:23,760
He knows.

530
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:25,926
About you, about us.

531
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:29,439
So, what does that mean?

532
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:31,757
He's offering a deal.

533
00:33:32,489 --> 00:33:33,968
He'll get Tempus to reset time...

534
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:37,678
...if you stay here.

535
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:41,201
- What? Down here? He's crazy.
- Hardly.

536
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:43,439
Yeah, well, we're desperate,
but not that desperate.

537
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:48,798
Why would he think that I would
accept an offer like that?

538
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:55,958
Because it's the only way to bring
one of your sisters back to life.

539
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:58,607
What?

540
00:33:59,449 --> 00:34:01,007
It's a trick, he's lying.

541
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:04,321
No.

542
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:06,281
It's not.

543
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:20,319
Okay, stop it right there. Here.

544
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:33,441
Just keep your hands where
I can see them, and you won't get hurt.

545
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:37,964
Easy.

546
00:34:57,889 --> 00:34:59,117
They killed her, Leo.

547
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:05,488
They think we're the demons now.

548
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:11,079
How could...?
How could this be happening?

549
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:13,205
I don't understand.

550
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:16,439
I'm so sorry.

551
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:22,965
Can you make this right or not?

552
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:29,681
Go!

553
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:40,879
Don't worry, he's gonna fix it.

554
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:43,245
I promise, you're gonna be fine.

555
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:58,481
Piper.

556
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:09,328
You don't have to do this.

557
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:14,006
Yes, I do.

558
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:20,967
So...

559
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:24,799
...will resetting time
affect us down here?

560
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:27,242
No.

561
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:29,682
Good.

562
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:32,682
I only have one condition.

563
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:38,959
You must warn Prue and Piper
before the demonic hit man attacks.

564
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,087
Otherwise they're dead anyway.

565
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:49,917
Agreed.

566
00:37:13,169 --> 00:37:16,479
Once I have reset time, detain him.

567
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:20,881
And then kill his witch.

568
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:24,724
That way I won't have to worry
about Belthazor anymore.

569
00:37:25,169 --> 00:37:28,525
Or the Charmed Ones.

570
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:44,797
Steady.

571
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,846
It shall be done.

572
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:24,842
Look, I know this all sounds
incredible,

573
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:27,079
but it doesn't make it
any less true, all right?

574
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:30,087
You're a healer, you do good. Now,
either you have saved too many lives,

575
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:32,717
or you're about to save a life
that they don't want you to save.

576
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:34,117
- They?
- Yeah, demons.

577
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:36,803
More specifically, Shax,
who is The Source's assassin.

578
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:41,039
Hold it, I get it.
This is a practical joke, right?

579
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,321
Guess you've got
a hidden camera here?

580
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,248
My second wife put you up to this?
Oh, it's just like her.

581
00:38:47,729 --> 00:38:51,278
Okay, Dr. Griffiths, listen to me.
This is anything but...

582
00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:55,327
What?

583
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:58,444
I don't know. I just felt a chill.

584
00:38:58,649 --> 00:39:00,162
Phoebe?

585
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:03,326
Phoebe, you there?

586
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:07,920
Phoebe, where are you?

587
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:17,439
- Dear God.
- No!

588
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:37,118
- What are you?
- The end.
