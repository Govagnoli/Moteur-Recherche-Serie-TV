1
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,642
Pardon me.

2
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,521
Hi. Sorry, I didn't see you there.

3
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,440
Oh, no, no, please.
Never apologise for a kiss, signora.

4
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,234
Especially for one like that.

5
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,781
Ninety-five Brunello di Montalcino.

6
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,574
Great. Decant it, please.

7
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,993
Of course.

8
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,371
Oh, wow, is that embarrassing.

9
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,790
You heard what the man said.
Never apologise.

10
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,044
- I'm so happy for you.
- Yeah, I still can't believe it.

11
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,631
Really, I've wanted to buy my
granddad's winery ever since he lost it.

12
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,802
I just hope he knows that somehow.

13
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,971
Believe me, he does.

14
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,640
You talk as if you have
inside information.

15
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,934
Well, maybe I do.

16
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,981
You are special, Phoebe.

17
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,237
I love you too.

18
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,447
- I'm sorry?
- Who said that?

19
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,157
- Did you say "too"?
- No.

20
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,660
I just said "you" twice.
I said, "I love you, you."

21
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,996
Isn't that what I said? Oh, God.

22
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,082
Daniel, table three.

23
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,209
Thanks.

24
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,592
- Let me take care of this.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks. It's weird how...

25
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,926
Hi.

26
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,220
- Paige?
- I am so sorry to interrupt,

27
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,015
but Piper's kind of got
a bit of a power problem.

28
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,516
She kind of needs some more.

29
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,602
Why doesn't she just call
the power company?

30
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:45,439
Tried, and the line is busy.

31
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,192
So if you could come, like, right now,
she'd really love it.

32
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,819
Oh, please don't use that word.

33
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:54,156
Please don't use that word.
Okay, all right, so I should go.

34
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,283
- And we will, you know...
- Talk.

35
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,118
Talk, yeah.

36
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,622
- I'm so sorry. I'll get that for you.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

37
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,874
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,334
Sorry.

39
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,669
- Okay.
- Okay.

40
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,838
The stuffed shells, great choice.

41
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,174
Okay, bye, everyone.

42
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,426
Okay.

43
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,813
Okay, let's vanquish this demon.

44
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,317
Something beat us to the punch.

45
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,656
- What is it doing?
- Apparently, eating the demon.

46
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,540
Or storing it.

47
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,462
- What is it?
- I don't know,

48
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,006
and I don't wanna find out.
Let's get out of here.

49
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,061
Paige, do something.

50
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,189
Power line!

51
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,783
- You all right?
- Yeah.

52
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,785
- You okay?
- Peachy.

53
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,810
Cute.

54
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,425
I still can't believe
we vanquished its mommy.

55
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,177
Yeah, but we didn't know
it was a mommy.

56
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:48,265
- And besides, Mommy tried to kill us.
- I know. Still, look at how cute he is.

57
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,766
So adorable.

58
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,103
Oh, except when he does
that weird little thing with his tongue.

59
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,483
- I wonder why he looks so human.
- I don't know, but he won't for long.

60
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,154
Okay, Wyatt's upstairs,
so at least he's...

61
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,619
...safe.

62
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,954
Don't worry about him,
he's got his protective bubble.

63
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,917
- He'll use it if he needs it.
- It looks like he likes his new friend.

64
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,921
- That is not a friend. That's a demon.
- No, he's just a baby.

65
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,215
Excuse me, were you
at the same vanquish as me?

66
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,051
Because, it took all three of us
to stop its mother.

67
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,928
It doesn't mean he'll
turn out that way.

68
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,847
- He doesn't have a choice, it's genetic.
- No, I don't think so.

69
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,725
Okay, maybe I'm a little biased
because I am, in fact, adopted,

70
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,770
but I think there's something to
the whole nurture-versus-nature thing

71
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,939
in predicting how a kid
is gonna turn out.

72
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,775
You know, the classic
environment-versus-biology argument.

73
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,652
But this is not a child, it's a demon.

74
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,198
Okay, why don't you go over there
and see if you can sense anything evil.

75
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,494
All right.

76
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,460
Nothing, good or evil.

77
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,463
My point exactly.
Clay to be moulded.

78
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,257
Yeah, I don't know about that.

79
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,301
Still, the question remains,
what are we supposed to do with him?

80
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,180
- So did you vanquish the demon?
- Yes and no.

81
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:15,769
Well, the good news is the demon
you sent us after is, in fact, gone.

82
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:20,023
And the bad new is,
is whatever ate it, left us that.

83
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,531
- I think it likes you.
- I don't care. Vanquish it.

84
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,616
- Chris.
- I mean it. Now.

85
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:32,411
No, we are not vanquishing a baby.
What's wrong with you?

86
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,122
I'm concerned that this could be
the evil that gets to Wyatt.

87
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,041
- Don't be ridiculous.
- What? I'm being ridiculous?

88
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,043
There is a demon in the playpen.

89
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,715
I'll get it.

90
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:47,718
Hey, if it's Jason,
tell him I'm in the shower.

91
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,138
Are you avoiding him?

92
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:56,977
Kind of. I sort of told him
that I loved him last night.

93
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,730
Oh, and this is bad?

94
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,650
No, except I said, "I love you too."

95
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,863
As if he said "I love you" first,
which he didn't.

96
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,911
So wait, you told him that he loves you
before he told you that he loves you?

97
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,704
- Yeah, that's not good.
- Yeah.

98
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,916
I'll be lucky if he doesn't move
to Hong Kong permanently now.

99
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,418
I really thought I had
my empath power under control.

100
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,463
- Forget that. What are you gonna do?
- What am I supposed to do?

101
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,549
I mean, you tell a guy
that you love them, and they bolt.

102
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,593
- It's just what they do.
- About the baby.

103
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,762
I meant the baby.
We gotta do something.

104
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,978
Fast.

105
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,106
I can't hear you, Darryl. Speak up.

106
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,401
I know I've never asked before,
but I'm asking now.

107
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,946
I need help on this one.

108
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,366
- Magical.
- All right, what's going on?

109
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,910
This stupid kid,
and he's got hostages.

110
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,538
Only, I know him.
And he wouldn't hurt anybody,

111
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,790
but I'm running out of time
to talk him down.

112
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,292
SWAT's ready to move in.

113
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,461
I don't wanna lose him, Paige.

114
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,006
All right. All right.

115
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,633
I'm coming. Okay.

116
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,468
Hold your horses.

117
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,766
Where's Wyatt? Where is he?

118
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,434
Look, look. Wait, listen.

119
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,145
Where's Wyatt? There he is.

120
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:24,898
Look, look, look.

121
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,485
Where's Wyatt? Where's Wyatt?
There he is.

122
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:32,573
- All right.
- Distracting him is not the answer.

123
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:37,077
Wyatt? Bad demon.
Very bad demon.

124
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:42,291
- Hey, was that Jason?
- No, that was my raison d'etre.

125
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,251
- Pardon?
- That was Darryl.

126
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,587
I've been wondering why
the temp agency didn't call,

127
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,590
and now I know why.
I needed to be free to help him.

128
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,133
To do what?

129
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,178
Well, to save an innocent.
Why else would he have called?

130
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,554
And, more importantly,

131
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,265
why else would I have been the one
to answer the phone?

132
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,267
Because you were the closest to it?

133
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:04,730
No. Because it's my reason
for being. Call me if you need help.

134
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:09,151
- What, you're just gonna let her go?
- You're welcome to try and stop her.

135
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,111
You know, I should go talk to Jason.

136
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,197
- And her too.
- Wait, stop.

137
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,742
Where are you going? Aren't you
concerned there's a demon here?

138
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,245
Chris, this is a baby, okay? Relax.

139
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,123
And you, call me
if you need anything.

140
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,335
- Love you too.
- Don't.

141
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,545
- Sorry.
- And you're okay with this?

142
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,005
Them dumping this on your lap?

143
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:33,425
- Well, they don't seem too worried.
- Well, they should be.

144
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,222
I need to figure out what kind of
creature we're dealing with here.

145
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,410
- Hey, is he in?
- No.

146
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,246
I mean, yes, he is,
but he asked not to be disturbed.

147
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,790
Yeah, but that
can't possibly mean me.

148
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:50,127
Actually, it specifically means you.
Sorry. You guys have a fight?

149
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,589
No, but we're about to.

150
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,050
Listen, Jas...

151
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,058
- I'm sorry.
- Phoebe, what are you doing?

152
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,977
I didn't know you were in a meeting.

153
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,271
Yeah, that's why the door
was closed.

154
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:13,734
Really? Because I was told the door
was closed specifically for me.

155
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,159
- I didn't know you spoke Italian.
- Outside.

156
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,537
How come I didn't know
you speak Italian?

157
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,790
- Is that what you came here to ask?
- No.

158
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:33,170
No, of course not.
I just wanted to talk about last night.

159
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,506
Okay, fine, but can we do it later?

160
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,133
I'm in the middle of
a very important meeting right now.

161
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,969
Of course, yeah.
I'm sorry about that.

162
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,933
- So how about tonight?
- Tonight?

163
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,310
Tonight's not good.

164
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,355
I'm flying to Rome.

165
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,694
- Wait, what?
- I was meaning to tell you.

166
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,154
It just... It just came up.

167
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,990
Really? When?

168
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,576
- Right after I told you I loved you?
- Oh, come on.

169
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,912
I've heard of guys running
when they hear the L word,

170
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,373
but all the way to Italy?
That's gotta be a new record.

171
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,166
Could you keep
your voice down, please?

172
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,503
It's got nothing to do with that.

173
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,215
That's a crock. We both know
how you really feel about me.

174
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,093
The only difference is,
I'm the only one who's not afraid of it.

175
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,893
"Vicious demons with supernatural
strength and venomous claws,

176
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,104
Manticores communicate
in high-pitched cries

177
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,898
and tend to travel in packs."

178
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,526
Great. Well, I say
we get rid of the little brat

179
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,695
before the pack
comes looking for him.

180
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:43,156
Okay, fine. What do you suggest
we do with him, call social services?

181
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,158
No, I suggest you vanquish it.

182
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,786
Chris, I'm a mother.
I can't go around vanquishing babies,

183
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,496
no matter how evil they are.

184
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,166
It's not how evil he is,
it's how evil he's gonna be.

185
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,209
You gotta stop looking at him
as a little baby

186
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,837
and start looking at him
as an unstoppable killing machine.

187
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,423
- Because that's what he is.
- I realize that, but still.

188
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,926
"But still" nothing. You're supposed
to protect the innocents, right?

189
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,179
Well, think of all the future innocents
you can save

190
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,015
- by vanquishing him right now.
- Don't you think I know that?

191
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,225
I'm scared to death of what
he could do to Wyatt,

192
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,935
but I can't even separate them.

193
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,271
Piper, there's one thing you can do,
and you know it.

194
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:17,232
And you better do it fast,
before any other Manticores show up.

195
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,109
There's no known
vanquishing potion.

196
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,240
I just can't do it.

197
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:27,951
Okay.

198
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:31,371
Well, if you won't listen to me,
maybe you'll listen to Leo.

199
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,117
- Okay, move.
- Move out, move out.

200
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,428
We're in position, lieutenant.
We've got a clean shot.

201
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,014
We've got you covered. Go, go!

202
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:34,142
Darryl! Darryl, over here.

203
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,519
- Stand by.
- We copy.

204
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:37,563
It's okay, let her through.

205
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:41,692
- What took you so long?
- I would have orbed here,

206
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,069
but it could have been more magic
than you had in mind.

207
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,154
I'm not sure what you
could've done anyway.

208
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,824
He's not letting the hostages go,
and SWAT's ready to move in.

209
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,035
Well, forget that. I'm not giving up.
This is my raison d'etre.

210
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,705
- Excuse me?
- Listen, I came to help,

211
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,833
that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
So, you know, what do you need?

212
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:03,046
I don't know, if I could just
talk to the kid without getting shot.

213
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,800
I think I have the perfect spell
for this.

214
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,220
Spell? What spell?

215
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,222
Just go with me, okay?

216
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:16,393
Blessed with powers from my destiny
I bless this hero with invincibility

217
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,525
- How do you feel?
- Feels...

218
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,569
Feels good.

219
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,697
- All right. Go get him, tough guy.
- Yeah.

220
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,992
Feels good. Yeah.

221
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,829
- Hey, where's he going?
- Negotiating?

222
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:39,374
- You better stand down.
- He's walking right in there.

223
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,084
Lieutenant, what are you doing?

224
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:44,171
- I got it. Don't worry.
- Watch his back. Hold your fire.

225
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,092
Hey, turn around! Get out of here!
I swear to God, man, I'll shoot!

226
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,762
I'll shoot you, man!
I swear to God, I'll do it!

227
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,723
Put your gun down, son.
I just wanna talk.

228
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,739
That's okay. Hold your fire.

229
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,950
I'm going in.

230
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,588
Leo, I have been looking
everywhere for you.

231
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,969
- What are you doing up here?
- Communing with the others.

232
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,598
- Can anyone see us?
- Not me.

233
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,643
But you look like a lunatic,
standing up here talking to yourself.

234
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,272
- What do you want?
- It's about Piper.

235
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:47,067
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, she's fine, don't worry.

236
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,570
- It's Wyatt I'm worried about.
- What happened?

237
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,821
Well, nothing yet.

238
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:53,949
Out of curiosity, what's the Elders'
policy on vanquishing demon babies?

239
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,410
- Why?
- No reason.

240
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,954
There's just one playing with Wyatt
as we speak.

241
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:04,084
Okay, listen to me, you will not
orb down to your little friend.

242
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,003
Do you understand me?

243
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,380
No orbing.

244
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,554
I give up.

245
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,435
I have had it with men.

246
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:23,812
They are incorrigible.

247
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,981
Let me tell you,
little boys are not much better.

248
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:29,193
I mean, I could understand running
if he didn't love me back, you know?

249
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,445
Fight or flight.
It's the nature of the beast.

250
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,405
- Speaking of that...
- But he does love me.

251
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,115
I know. I felt it, you know?

252
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,910
So, what's the big deal, you know?
Why is he running?

253
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,620
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

254
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,122
you probably won't be alive
much longer to worry about it.

255
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:45,209
Thank you, yes, that makes me feel
so much better.

256
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,211
I'm just saying, if this doesn't work,

257
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:50,797
we can't vanquish the Manticores
when they come to get their little one.

258
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:54,551
- Oh, you figured out what they are?
- Yeah, and it's not good, believe me.

259
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,345
So maybe Chris is right.

260
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,890
Yeah, I know, but I can't.

261
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,142
Piper, you said it yourself,
he was born evil.

262
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,269
I know, and I still believe that, I do.

263
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:07,689
But something just doesn't
add up about him.

264
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:10,150
I mean, why isn't Wyatt
using his protective shield?

265
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,444
Why doesn't Wyatt think he's evil?

266
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:15,239
Well, we gotta keep Wyatt
away from him. That's for sure.

267
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,492
- Phoebe, wait.
- You stay away from my nephew.

268
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,703
And don't shimmer after him either,
or I'll bind your powers.

269
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,373
Phoebe, hurry, put him back down!

270
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,417
What? Okay.

271
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,254
- Why?
- That's why.

272
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:43,350
Hey! You get away from my kid.

273
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,128
I feel really bad that I wasn't there
to help you earlier.

274
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:15,257
Oh, I don't think you could've helped
even if you were there. Thanks.

275
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,801
That thing was just as powerful
as the Manticore.

276
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,428
Are you sure it wasn't a Manticore?

277
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:23,557
Yeah, I'm positive. It was more,
I don't know, like, beast-like.

278
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:25,684
What do you think it wanted
with the baby?

279
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,561
I don't know,
but I think it's really weird

280
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:30,314
that it showed up right after
the baby started crying, you know?

281
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,815
As if it could hear him.

282
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:34,401
Maybe we can get the baby to cry
and lure the beast here

283
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,195
and torture him
into coughing up Piper.

284
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,198
It's a great idea,
but we don't have a potion yet.

285
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:42,075
I can't believe I can't find Piper.

286
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:45,245
Okay, let me get started
on the potion.

287
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:49,625
Good news is, if he wanted to kill Piper
by now, he probably would have.

288
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,211
And undoubtedly, he's holding her
hostage somewhere,

289
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,254
probably magically cloaked.

290
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:58,467
I think he's gonna use her as leverage
to get that baby, just you watch.

291
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:01,512
Since when did you become an expert
on hostage situations?

292
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,222
About an hour ago.

293
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,351
Hey.

294
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:10,395
Keep it down.
Don't wake the baby, trust me.

295
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:13,148
- Where's Piper?
- That's a really good question.

296
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:15,317
- She's missing?
- Did the Manticores take her?

297
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,236
No, some other creature
that wanted the baby.

298
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,905
You should've listened to me
and vanquished him earlier.

299
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:23,200
It's good that we didn't, because
we'll need him to get Piper back.

300
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:24,952
You guys, keep your voices down.

301
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,329
I am not convinced that
that baby is inherently evil,

302
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:30,165
which means he's probably
not even responsible for any of this.

303
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:32,459
Oh, come on.
Will you please talk to her?

304
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:36,296
Not everyone is born morally neutral,
especially not demons.

305
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:38,048
They're predisposed to evil.

306
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:41,176
Predisposed, but it doesn't mean
they can't be raised to overcome it.

307
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:44,972
You can't predict whether a kid will be
good or evil based on his genetics.

308
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,516
We're not talking about kids,
we're talking about demons.

309
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,893
No, we are talking about
a demon kid,

310
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,688
who so far has played
nothing but nice with Wyatt.

311
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,481
Okay, you guys, this is all irrelevant.

312
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,943
We need the baby to find Piper,
so let's just focus on that, shall we?

313
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,154
She's right, but I think I should
take Wyatt just to be on the safe side.

314
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,198
What if the other baby wakes up?

315
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:05,951
They won't be able
to follow me where I'm going.

316
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:09,288
- Hey.
- It's gonna scream bloody murder

317
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:12,249
and call half the Manticores
in the city to come save it.

318
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,835
- Maybe the beast too.
- We have to be prepared.

319
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,713
Okay, go, just quietly.

320
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,553
Let's get started on that potion.

321
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,036
Hello? Who's there?

322
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,955
I want the child.

323
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,625
- Who are you?
- I want the child!

324
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,960
Yeah, I heard you the first time.

325
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:02,341
Look, if you're trying to scare me,

326
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:05,427
it's not gonna work,
because I've seen worse, really.

327
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:06,929
I doubt it.

328
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,139
I don't want to hurt you,

329
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,934
but I will if you don't do as I ask.

330
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,269
Who are you kidding?
You need me.

331
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:18,774
- Otherwise I'd be dead already.
- Don't mock me!

332
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,902
Okay. Easy, easy. Sorry.

333
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:26,865
You're not a Manticore, are you?

334
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:30,244
So why do you want
the kid anyway?

335
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:34,206
- That's not your concern.
- Well, it is if you want my help.

336
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm not just gonna serve him up to you
as a snack.

337
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,836
That's not why I want him.

338
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,131
How'd you get him away
from his mother anyway?

339
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:45,008
We vanquished her.

340
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,680
You have no idea what you've done.

341
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,515
We got a baby away from a demon,

342
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,851
and I'm not gonna give him up
to another one.

343
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,478
- Then you'll die!
- The hell I will.

344
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,833
- Any sign of the lieutenant?
- Negative.

345
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,044
All right, we give him five more
minutes to talk him out, then we'll...

346
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:24,173
Hold your fire, hold your fire.

347
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:30,304
Don't shoot, they're hostages!

348
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,765
This way, ma'am.

349
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:38,687
Where's the lieutenant?
I don't see the lieutenant.

350
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:41,565
Come on, outside the wall,
ma'am, please.

351
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,239
No sweat, I got it.

352
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,909
This lieutenant's on the job.
Kicking butt and taking names.

353
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,745
Yeah, that's right. That's me.
I got it. No sweat.

354
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,789
Yeah, give me five, give me five.
Give me some skin. How you doing?

355
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,292
- You looking good, Tim.
- Not as good as you, lieutenant.

356
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,377
No problem, no sweat.

357
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,463
- Nice cuff, boss.
- How'd you do it, man?

358
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,757
How did those bullets
bounce off you like that?

359
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:09,343
Because I'm a badass,
that's why, punk.

360
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,471
What the hell was that?

361
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:14,014
Shut up.

362
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:21,230
What the hell are you, man?

363
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,138
Last chance.

364
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:58,433
Help me get the child or die.

365
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:01,770
What are you doing with this?

366
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,943
What is the matter with you?
Do you have a death wish?

367
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:13,782
I've come too far. I've gone through
too much to lose him now.

368
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,826
Don't make me kill you!

369
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,537
Why don't you just do it?
What are you waiting for?

370
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,290
Get it over with.

371
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:25,669
I can do worse than kill you.

372
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:30,090
I can keep you here.
You'll never see your child again.

373
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,385
Think about it.

374
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:42,352
Well, can't think
of anything else to add.

375
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,479
It's the most powerful potion
we've ever made.

376
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,273
I agree.

377
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,026
I guess it's time to wake up the baby.

378
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:55,365
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

379
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:57,201
Oh, hey, Jason.

380
00:26:58,035 --> 00:26:59,786
I...

381
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:01,830
I didn't wanna leave like this.

382
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:03,790
I can't really talk right now.

383
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,709
- I'm kind of busy.
- Oh, really?

384
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:09,379
Come on, Phoebe. Why do you always
have to make things so difficult?

385
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,507
Oh, I make things so difficult?

386
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:14,843
And how exactly do I do that?
By being honest with my feelings?

387
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:18,055
And by making you
be honest with yours?

388
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:19,473
You know it's not that simple.

389
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,977
Okay, I really have to go now.

390
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:25,812
- Phoebe, wait...
- Have a good flight.

391
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:28,607
Toss me a vial.

392
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,867
Paige, you okay?

393
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:16,530
Phoebe, get the vial.

394
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,876
So much for our leverage.

395
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,836
You're okay.

396
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:15,881
It's all right, you're home now.

397
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:34,107
- This had better work.
- Oh, it will.

398
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,530
We just got back from talking
to the Elders. They agree.

399
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:43,408
- If we can't return the baby safely...
- We'll vanquish it.

400
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:46,995
- Talk about your moot points, people.
- What's that supposed to mean?

401
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,665
Well, do you notice
anything missing?

402
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,002
- The baby?
- What happened?

403
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:57,381
The beast took him, right after
the Manticores kicked our asses.

404
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:59,174
This is all Jason's fault.

405
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:01,760
- How's that?
- Oh, you're a guy. You wouldn't get it.

406
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:04,805
Wait, how are we supposed to
get back Piper if we don't have a baby?

407
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,683
We're gonna try to have another
get-together with the Manticores,

408
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,518
see if we can't strike
some sort of deal.

409
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:12,980
If we can join forces to kill the beast,
then they can get their baby back.

410
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:14,481
And we get our sister back.

411
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:16,650
And what if they
don't wanna join forces?

412
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:20,529
Well, then we hope we have enough of
these fancy little things to go around.

413
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:25,325
- No. No way. It's too risky.
- Well, blood is thicker than water.

414
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:36,628
Well, quit moving around so much,
you're just making this more difficult.

415
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:38,630
Just leave me alone.

416
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:40,507
Why, so you can die?

417
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:44,219
Hey, it's your choice. I'm just saying,
if we can't stop this bleeding...

418
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:47,848
- Fine, whatever, just hurry up.
- You're welcome.

419
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:52,686
- Who did this to you?
- Your sisters.

420
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:59,026
Sorry. Actually, if they used the potion
I think they did, you're lucky to be alive.

421
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:00,611
You should've been blown to pieces.

422
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:03,780
- How do you know?
- Well, because I made it.

423
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:08,410
Oh, come on, show a little spine.
What kind of demon are you?

424
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,078
I'm not a demon.

425
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,247
Then what are you?

426
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:17,252
I saw a picture of a man
in the bedroom.

427
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,880
Oh, come on.
I've been around a lot of demons,

428
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:22,049
and they don't usually
live in neighbourhoods

429
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:23,675
right out of Home & Garden.

430
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:25,719
Is that why you're helping me?

431
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:28,847
You think this is some sort of
hideous curse or something?

432
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:30,349
Yeah, basically.

433
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:35,395
Well, then go. I don't need your pity.

434
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:37,940
That's not what happened,
and that's not who I am.

435
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:40,025
Not anymore anyway.

436
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,320
Just leave us. Go.

437
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:46,490
Us? You mean, you and your son?

438
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:50,953
What happened?

439
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:56,917
Manticores mate with humans
to create hybrids

440
00:31:57,084 --> 00:32:00,420
so they can blend in,
hide in plain sight.

441
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:04,132
They kill their mates after conception,
but I got away.

442
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:07,469
Ever since, all I could think about
was saving my son

443
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:10,138
so he wouldn't have to be
raised like one of them.

444
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:14,643
The only chance I had to do that
was to turn myself into this.

445
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,228
To become powerful.

446
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,814
But how?

447
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:21,441
I just started mixing potions,

448
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,069
using whatever I could
steal from them.

449
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:26,613
I didn't know what I was doing,
but I didn't care.

450
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:30,492
All I cared about was finding a way
to fight them. To find him.

451
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:36,081
I didn't care what happened to me.
I just wanted my son.

452
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:44,339
You know they're gonna try
and take him back.

453
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:47,467
I know.

454
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:51,346
So let's get you fixed up
so we can fight them together.

455
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:12,451
Hey.

456
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:14,995
Sorry to interrupt.

457
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:18,999
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

458
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:25,422
Do you think we have
enough potion?

459
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:28,342
So who wants to go hunting with us?

460
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:38,018
This is gonna be a little cold.

461
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:45,150
The bleeding's not stopping.

462
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:48,737
You should come home with me
and we can do more there.

463
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:50,239
No, I can't.

464
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:54,701
- If you're worried about my sisters...
- It's not your sisters I'm worried about.

465
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,496
It's the Manticores.
They'll be looking for me there.

466
00:33:57,663 --> 00:34:00,040
- They'll be looking for him there.
- You don't understand,

467
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:02,709
we have somebody who can heal you
once we turn you back into...

468
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:06,630
You can't turn me back.
No one can.

469
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:08,507
Not unless I die.

470
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,719
So how are you planning
on raising your son?

471
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:16,723
I wasn't. I figured I'd find someone.

472
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,058
After.

473
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:20,352
All I cared about was saving him.

474
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:24,022
That's exactly what
I'm gonna keep on doing.

475
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:27,109
You can't run forever, you know.

476
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:29,444
Not for long. Not with that.

477
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:32,197
And who's gonna save him
when you're dead?

478
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:35,242
You have a way with words,
you know that?

479
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:37,411
I ad lib a lot.

480
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,249
Piper, duck!

481
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:46,336
What are you doing?

482
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:51,550
- Let's get her out of here.
- No, wait...

483
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:00,267
- What the hell are you doing?
- Saving your life.

484
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:03,437
No, no, no. You don't understand.
We have to go back. Hurry!

485
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:08,317
Oh, no.

486
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:37,429
Leo, we need you.

487
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:40,432
Hurry, he's dying.

488
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:43,519
- Who is he?
- The beast. Heal, heal, hurry.

489
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:45,687
- Where's the baby?
- The Manticores have him.

490
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:48,690
- Oh, so the plan worked.
- Yeah, a little too well.

491
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:51,360
- Now we have to get the baby back.
- What?

492
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:55,614
Paige, will you fill up
some potion vials, please?

493
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:57,032
- Yeah.
- Lots of them.

494
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:58,450
Hold up, are you serious?

495
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:01,203
You get rid of the demon child,
now you wanna get it back?

496
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:02,871
He's not a demon child.

497
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:07,459
- That's my son.
- How you feeling? Are you all right?

498
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:11,338
- I can't believe I'm human again.
- Aren't you glad you didn't kill me?

499
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:14,424
- Not funny. I don't think that's funny.
- Agreed.

500
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:17,553
What, are you two
on, like, the same team now?

501
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:21,098
We're gonna get your baby back.
I promise.

502
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:23,350
- Do we not have a say in this?
- No.

503
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:26,520
We don't. One thing you gotta learn
about being their whitelighter

504
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:28,981
is once they make up
their mind, that's it.

505
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,400
Besides, I'm a father first.

506
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:35,863
So we're gonna have to separate
the baby before we attack.

507
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:37,281
- You know that, right?
- Why?

508
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:39,449
Well, because the potion
vanquishes Manticores,

509
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:41,910
and your son is half Manticore.

510
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:58,051
- I see him.
- Let's just hope he sees you

511
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,929
- before they see us.
- Should I just orb the baby to us?

512
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:03,807
No, he'll probably just shimmer back,
and then we'll be in trouble.

513
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,434
This is gonna work.

514
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:07,394
Hurry, hurry.

515
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,314
Thanks.

516
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,860
Watch. Peekaboo.

517
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:18,071
You can do it.
Come on, come on, come on.

518
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:19,698
Peekaboo.

519
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:29,082
Come on, you can do it.

520
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:53,649
You're okay.

521
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:55,359
Hi.

522
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:57,319
Hi.

523
00:37:57,528 --> 00:37:59,780
Good job.

524
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:02,616
So much for nature
being more important than nurture.

525
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:43,824
Here are some clothes and a stroller.

526
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:46,118
- You sure you don't mind?
- No, not at all.

527
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:48,620
Wyatt has outgrown it all,
and I don't see myself

528
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:50,372
having more kids
any time soon,

529
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:52,541
- so enjoy.
- Thanks.

530
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:56,503
For everything. I just...

531
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,547
I wish there was something
I could do for you.

532
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:01,550
Well, you could tell us your name.

533
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:03,135
- Sorry?
- I mean, unless

534
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:06,013
you prefer being called "the beast."

535
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,390
Derek. My name's Derek.

536
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:10,851
It's nice to meet you, Derek.

537
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:13,896
What's his name?

538
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:18,066
I never gave him one, actually.
I never... I never had the chance.

539
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:19,776
Well, now you do.

540
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:22,988
Well, I guess I should be going.

541
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:25,574
That is, if I can pry him
away from Wyatt.

542
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:27,242
Yeah, good luck.

543
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:33,248
That is cute.

544
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:36,001
I'll get it.

545
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:39,379
You know, if you ever need us
to bind his powers...

546
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:43,175
No, thanks. That's really sweet,
but it's not necessary.

547
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:46,929
I mean, he's a good boy, so it's just up
to me to make sure he stays that way.

548
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:49,723
In that case, he's in good hands.

549
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:54,269
Well, take care.

550
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:56,438
You too.

551
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:08,492
What? What'd you do?

552
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:13,247
I kind of forgot to reverse the spell
I put on Darryl.

553
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,514
Paige?

554
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:59,626
- Hi.
- Hi.

555
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:02,796
What are you doing here?
I thought you were on a plane.

556
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:05,090
I cancelled the flight.

557
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:08,302
I mean, it is my plane.

558
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:12,764
- What about the winery?
- It'll be there in the morning.

559
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:18,353
I just wasn't sure
whether you would be.

560
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,230
And I didn't wanna take the risk.

561
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:22,816
- Really?
- Really.

562
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,651
You were right.

563
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,113
I was running, but not
for the reasons that you think.

564
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:30,949
I am not afraid
of how I feel about you.

565
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:32,701
It doesn't scare me one bit.

566
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,828
Then why?

567
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:40,501
It's a little unnerving to have somebody
tell you how you feel all the time

568
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,211
before you know it yourself.

569
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:44,671
I know.

570
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,633
- I'm sorry.
- You do that a lot too.

571
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,259
You're very intuitive.

572
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:51,136
It's...

573
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:54,473
It's pretty amazing, actually.
It's a real gift.

574
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,185
Yeah, well, sometimes
it can be a curse too.

575
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,895
Tell me about it.

576
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:06,527
Look, all I'm saying is that I'd like
to be able to express my own feelings

577
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:09,530
in my own time from now on.

578
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,741
If that's all right with you.

579
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:16,245
- It's perfectly okay.
- Good.

580
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:23,210
So while we're on the subject...

581
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:26,797
...how do you feel about me?

582
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:30,926
I love you too.
