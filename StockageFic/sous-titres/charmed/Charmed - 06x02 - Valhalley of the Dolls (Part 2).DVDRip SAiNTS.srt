1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,753
Previously on Charmed:

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,962
Leo's missing.

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,965
The Elders think he's been kidnapped.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,177
- Leo, I didn't know you had it in you.
- I've changed.

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,307
- That was awesome.
- Piper doesn't complain anymore.

6
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,893
- You took my feelings away?
- Pain almost destroyed you.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,729
- I wanted to help you.
- I am an empath.

8
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,148
I'm a dog walker.

9
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,777
We just need to borrow
your soul for a couple of hours.

10
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,403
This is definitely over the limit.

11
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,740
Don't freak out, because magic got us
into this and magic will get us out.

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,244
- I don't belong here.
- You have much to teach my warriors.

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,120
Attack!

14
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,206
He needs our help.

15
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,250
The only way to get close to Leo

16
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,293
is by proving to the Valkyries
you're one of them.

17
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,629
They tried to kill us
when we tried to save him.

18
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,048
You left us.

19
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,384
I promise I will explain everything
when we get home.

20
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,845
- We don't have a home.
- Her heart is breaking.

21
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,222
Come on, Piper, we gotta go.

22
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,974
Go? Go where?

23
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,351
We gotta leave her. Come on!

24
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,378
- Be careful of Darryl's body.
- Thank you.

25
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:30,007
Is he...? I mean, am I still alive?

26
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,301
- Barely.
- Barely?

27
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,720
- We gotta go back and get Piper.
- How, by force?

28
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,305
She won't come. She's withdrawn.

29
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,931
Besides, we can't go back now.

30
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,809
- But we can't just leave her there.
- They're not gonna hurt her.

31
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,269
They need her to get to us.

32
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,188
Listen, about my body...

33
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,191
Oh, I'm sorry.
You can just step right back in.

34
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,818
That's it?
I mean, even though I'm solid?

35
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,528
You're still a spirit, trust me.

36
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,989
Okay, we gotta go
and figure out what to do.

37
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,741
Thanks again.

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,037
Don't mention it.

39
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,233
Great. That's just great.

40
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,935
Jeez, it's about time.
I was starting to get worr...

41
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,480
- Where's Piper?
- You son of a bitch.

42
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,650
- Why'd you do it?
- Do what?

43
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,529
Leo, stop it!

44
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,539
Leo, enough!

45
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,541
This hostility is killing me.

46
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:53,919
What is wrong with you?
You've been playing gladiator too long?

47
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,463
You didn't tell them, did you?

48
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,675
- Tell us what?
- That he was the last one to see me.

49
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:02,469
Right afterwards, I was
mysteriously trapped in Valhalla.

50
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,555
Oh, so, what,
that makes me responsible?

51
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,015
- Is that what you're saying?
- Why would Chris do that?

52
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,893
- Why else? To get rid of me.
- That doesn't make sense.

53
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:13,105
Doesn't it? He manipulated things
so I'd become an Elder.

54
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:17,192
- Forced me out of the house.
- So you could save the world.

55
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,111
All right, Leo,
I know how upset you are.

56
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:22,322
And by "know,"
I mean I literally know.

57
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,576
But you're way off base here.
Chris has been the model whitelighter

58
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,078
since you've been gone.
He's done nothing but good.

59
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:31,039
He sent us after so many demons,
if anything, he's been too good.

60
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,083
He's the reason we were
able to save you.

61
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,629
You're welcome.

62
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,175
- Where'd you get the pendants?
- Leo.

63
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,135
All right.

64
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,846
All right, I'll let it go for now.

65
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,682
- So where's Wyatt? Can I see him?
- No, you can't.

66
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,560
He's staying with Sheila until
we figure out how to rescue Piper.

67
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,730
Which is gonna be hard,
because she doesn't wanna be saved.

68
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:59,067
If we're gonna save her, it'll have
to be as witches, not as Valkyries.

69
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,907
- Book of Shadows?
- Got it.

70
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,552
- Well?
- She's Valkyrie.

71
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:27,804
But it's not pure.

72
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,058
- Deep inside, I sense...
- Witch?

73
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,186
- Yes.
- I told you.

74
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,272
She came with the other witches.
She has to be one too.

75
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,441
But it's very faint.
I could barely read it.

76
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,444
Still, she helped them escape
with the warrior, didn't she?

77
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,238
Yes, but she didn't escape with them.

78
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,532
- Maybe they left her.
- Why would they do that?

79
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,825
Because they would have
been caught if they hadn't.

80
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,827
Either way, she can be
of value to us.

81
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,747
She wouldn't be the first witch
to convert.

82
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,000
And if she has, then we've
gained a powerful sister.

83
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,003
But if it is just a spell
and she's not truly one of us,

84
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,006
then we'll use her to lead us
to the other two.

85
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,177
After all, we can't have anybody
knowing where to find us

86
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,471
and risking what we do,
now, can we?

87
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,683
The warriors who pursued, aren't you
concerned about them being exposed?

88
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,436
They're well-trained.
They'll know how to avoid it.

89
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,064
Besides, hopefully
they'll find the witches

90
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,941
and take care of the problem for us.

91
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:22,985
What do you think about that?

92
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,574
I think that if they don't, we will.

93
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,267
I don't understand. Why don't we
just storm the place and find her.

94
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,520
- Not like we don't know where she is.
- They'd be expecting it, that's why.

95
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,731
- It would be suicide.
- We got you out, didn't we?

96
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:04,443
- But it cost us Piper.
- Okay, guys, would you knock it off?

97
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,447
I'm still reeling from Piper's emotions.
I don't need this.

98
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,074
Sorry.

99
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,286
So how's it going?

100
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:15,954
I am almost done.

101
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,207
I don't mean to burden you with
my emotions,

102
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,376
but I don't quite see how reversing
the memory spell is gonna help.

103
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,128
Piper needs to believe
she's a Valkyrie

104
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,464
because it's too painful
for her to be herself.

105
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:29,259
Way too painful, believe me.
I almost passed out back there.

106
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,803
Then believing she's a Valkyrie
is the perfect option.

107
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,181
To serve the greater good,
they're always in control.

108
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,766
They don't deal with pain or loss.

109
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,144
Well, that's why we have to make
Piper believe she's Piper again.

110
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,731
If we don't get her back mentally,
it won't matter if we get her physically.

111
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,734
Okay, but Piper wasn't exactly
back before the spell either.

112
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,819
- What do you mean?
- Well, that magical whammy

113
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,405
you performed on her
kind of backfired.

114
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:54,785
Yeah, you see, after you left,
Piper was really...

115
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:55,994
Chipper.

116
00:08:56,161 --> 00:09:00,707
Yeah, incessantly, increasingly,
annoyingly chipper.

117
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,251
What she said.

118
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,169
It was supposed
to make her feel less pain.

119
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,713
I guess with me not around
to pull it back a little bit,

120
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,757
she got happier and happier?

121
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:12,636
No, psychotically chipper.

122
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,722
Way to go.

123
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,183
- Chris.
- What?

124
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:22,479
Oh, I swear my new power
is gonna drive me crazy.

125
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,523
You'll get the handle of it.
Just be patient.

126
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:29,486
Are you sure? Because I remember
Prue almost being destroyed

127
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,113
that time that she was an empath.

128
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,657
Well, she wasn't supposed
to become one. You are.

129
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:36,451
Maybe all this with Piper has
made it happen a little sooner,

130
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,037
but you can handle it,
I know you can.

131
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,874
I just wish I knew how
to turn it on and off.

132
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,878
I feel like I'm at the mercy of
everyone else's feelings, and it sucks.

133
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,298
Bright side, maybe you can actually
find out how Jason feels about you.

134
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,758
Yeah, but what if it's not good news?

135
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,594
Then you dump him
before he dumps you.

136
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,182
I think the spell's finished.

137
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,478
Oh, great.

138
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,481
- You got a dog?
- No, I got a career.

139
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,817
Sore subject. Don't ask.

140
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,571
All right, I'm coming.

141
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,705
Oh, my God.
Darryl, what happened?

142
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,459
I think I just got attacked
by Attila the Hun.

143
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,179
Freyja, I need to speak with you.

144
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,473
In private.

145
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,850
You can speak freely.

146
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,811
The warriors who
followed the witches,

147
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,313
they've killed civilians.

148
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,857
- What?
- Innocents?

149
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,360
I don't know,
but they turned off their locators.

150
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,070
What does that mean?

151
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,947
They're trained to do that

152
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,783
when the final battle between
good and evil begins.

153
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,660
- We have to stop them.
- But how can we?

154
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,745
We have no way
of finding them in the city.

155
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:03,831
I'm from the city.

156
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,209
I can help you find them.

157
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,642
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

158
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,936
Thanks, man.
It's good to have you back.

159
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,856
- Thanks for helping me get back.
- Don't mention it.

160
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,984
Would you...?

161
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:35,487
How long after we left
did the warriors show up?

162
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,614
Not long, maybe a couple seconds.

163
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,909
They must have followed us
from Valhalla.

164
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,453
Right. That means they're
after us now.

165
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,373
Except they didn't hang out long
enough to ask me where to find you.

166
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:50,169
I was looking through swollen eyes, but
they just seemed lost and confused.

167
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,172
- So, what, they just took off?
- Thank goodness they did...

168
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,174
We should've never put you
in that situation.

169
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,842
We should've come up with
another way.

170
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,469
- Forget it. You know, it worked.
- Yeah, for you, maybe.

171
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,055
What about the next poor guy
that runs into those warriors?

172
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,141
They're trained killers.

173
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:08,061
- Yeah, but they only kill evil.
- He's not evil.

174
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,355
Chris is right.
Not everything is black and white.

175
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,108
Warriors can't always tell
the difference between good and evil.

176
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,652
- What do we do?
- Well, we need to find them, fast.

177
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,654
That shouldn't be too hard.
They'll stand out.

178
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,072
Even in San Francisco.

179
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,701
Which is why we need to move fast.
If they're exposed, so are the Valkyries.

180
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,704
Awfully forgiving, considering
everything they put you through.

181
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,081
They still have a noble purpose
to perform.

182
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,459
Keeping their secret is key
to them fulfilling it.

183
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,504
Besides, it's not the Valkyries'
fault that I ended up there.

184
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,255
Which brings us back to the warriors.

185
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,007
And let's not forget about Piper.

186
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,427
Maybe we should split up.
You should go to the police station.

187
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,304
They're gonna show up
on the radar screen.

188
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,431
You know what?
My office is paging me anyway.

189
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,351
Make sure you're first on the scene.
We might need to buy some time.

190
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,228
Okay, you got it.

191
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,231
Maybe I should go to the newspaper
and do the same.

192
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,482
Good idea. Paige.

193
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,527
I should take Oscar home
before I get fired.

194
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:57,819
You're kidding, right?

195
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,572
No. I promised the temp agency
I'd have him back in the morning,

196
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,115
and it's the morning.

197
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,409
Listen, before you say anything,

198
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,662
you've been gone,
some things have changed.

199
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,373
One of those things is that
I'm determined, now more than ever,

200
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,792
to have a life separate
from being a witch.

201
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,044
Fine, but now?

202
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,213
Yeah. I've already done
the reversal spell.

203
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,174
Can't do it without Piper,
and we don't know how to get her, so...

204
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,718
I'm just an orb away
if you need help.

205
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,596
- Paige...
- Let her go.

206
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,766
It might seem silly to you,
but it's important to her, I know.

207
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:29,893
See? It helps to be an empath.

208
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:33,146
No, it helps to be a sister.

209
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,648
And while we're on that subject,

210
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,651
we have to come up with another plan
to get Piper out of Valhalla.

211
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,113
She's right.

212
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,032
- Let's go.
- But...

213
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,041
- Come on, in here.
- Easy!

214
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,501
Who goes there?

215
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,463
What's the matter,
don't you recognize me?

216
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:02,759
Leo. But we'd heard that
the witches had broken you out.

217
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:06,013
Disinformation. Enemy's favourite
tactic. Don't fall for it again.

218
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,015
Right. Sorry.

219
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:11,476
It's just that everyone's a little on edge
since the alert's been sounded again.

220
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,521
I know. I caught the intruder.

221
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,440
Where's Freyja?
She'll want to question him.

222
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,609
She's not here.
She went after the warriors.

223
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,319
And the new Valkyrie, where is she?

224
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,030
- They took her with them.
- All right.

225
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,616
Then I'll have to question him myself.

226
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,412
Alone.

227
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,380
What are you doing?

228
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,633
Leo, what's going on?

229
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,469
I'm gonna get the truth out of you
one way or another.

230
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,015
No sisters around here
to help you this time.

231
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:53,393
No orbing, no way out.

232
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,398
Just you and me.

233
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,110
You're joking, right?

234
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,863
I mean, shouldn't we be getting back
to fill in Phoebe and Paige

235
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,866
- and find Piper?
- I already lost Piper. Pick it up.

236
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,702
You know, this isn't funny anymore.

237
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,412
And this isn't very Elder-like either.

238
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,957
Being trapped here for five weeks
and fighting for my life

239
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,959
has changed me a lot.

240
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,252
Pick it up.

241
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,088
Forget it.

242
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,513
I didn't do it.

243
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,228
You can't kill me, I'm a whitelighter.

244
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,605
No? Then why are you sweating?

245
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,025
I'm gonna find out the truth.

246
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,778
I'm gonna find out who
did this to me, I promise.

247
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,114
Right now, we're gonna catch up
with Phoebe and Paige

248
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,449
and have a little chat with the Elders.

249
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:24,318
This is the last place they were
before they turned off their locators.

250
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,986
Why did they do this?

251
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,614
This is not what we're
training them for.

252
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,658
Maybe they were confused
by all the evil in the city.

253
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:32,910
It's everywhere.

254
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:36,330
Then how will we find them
before they hurt anybody else?

255
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:40,000
- I could scry for them.
- You mean like a witch can?

256
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:42,461
What do you need?

257
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,046
Something of the warriors.

258
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:45,797
The knife.

259
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,889
Anything else?

260
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,307
Well.

261
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,728
Hell's bells,
what have we got here?

262
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,106
What, is there a X ena convention
in town or something?

263
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,484
On your knees.

264
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,194
Excuse me?

265
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,863
I got a better idea.

266
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,116
How about you get
on your knees instead.

267
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,665
- Who are you to speak to us that way?
- Kara.

268
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:23,293
You don't command us,
we command you.

269
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,049
- How dare you?
- This isn't Valhalla.

270
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,094
You don't have dominion
over men here.

271
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:36,515
Then how do you train them?
How do they take orders?

272
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,019
They don't.
They do what they want.

273
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,543
You know, I have an idea of
how we could blend in better.

274
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,171
A motorcycle, Darryl?

275
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:52,633
Are you sure?
That is just so not Piper.

276
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,011
Leo did say that she might be back.

277
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,889
All right, well, I'll call Paige,
and you keep an eye...

278
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,141
Oh, my God.

279
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,729
Let me call you back,
let me call you back. Jason!

280
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,607
- Hi! What are you doing here?
- Who, me?

281
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,776
- I own the place.
- Right.

282
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,362
And I work here, that's why I'm...

283
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,962
What was I saying?

284
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,630
Did you forget I was flying in today?

285
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:37,052
No. Of course I didn't forget that
you were flying back today.

286
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:40,013
I'm just a little scattered, that's all.

287
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,891
Is the air conditioning
not working in here or what?

288
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:46,103
It feels fine to me.

289
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,855
Phoebe, you look great.

290
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,231
Really.

291
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,233
I like your hair.

292
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,985
Thanks.

293
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,695
I like yours too.

294
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:58,574
Listen, I was gonna go home,
unpack, take a shower.

295
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,951
But I was hoping that maybe later
we could get together

296
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,286
and have some dinner.

297
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,913
You know? I know we don't have
anything planned officially,

298
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,208
but, you know,
I was thinking that we could...

299
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:16,341
- I'm gonna take that as a yes, then?
- Oh, no, no.

300
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:19,094
No, no, no. No. No, no.

301
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:22,014
No? All right.

302
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,726
I just really missed you, Phoebe. L...

303
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:28,478
Oh, I know. I can tell.

304
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,901
It's just... It's very hard.

305
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,361
I mean... I mean, hard to explain.

306
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,656
That kind of hard, you know.
Not the other kind of hard.

307
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,533
You know? Am I making any sense?

308
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,995
- Phoebe...
- No, no, no. Don't come any closer.

309
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:46,955
It'll just get harder.

310
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,710
Oh, God.

311
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:57,090
I can't. I can't. I can't.

312
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,885
Stop, stop. Piper.

313
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:22,533
No! No!

314
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:42,052
No, wait. It's me.

315
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,637
You're making a mistake.

316
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:48,892
This is not the final battle. We've come
to take you back to Valhalla.

317
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:50,894
What do you think?

318
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:54,273
I think the enemy
wears many masks.

319
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:10,205
Well, you're the agency, how could
you not know they were leaving town?

320
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:14,501
They abandoned their dog.
That is animal cruelty, okay?

321
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:18,881
No, I can't take care of the dog.
I've got... I've got responsibilities.

322
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,215
Pressing ones, too.

323
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,551
And besides, I need to make
a statement to my family.

324
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:24,595
This is not helping here.

325
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:25,929
Hello?

326
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:27,431
Hello?

327
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,728
What am I doing?

328
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,356
Okay, I've just gotta trust
the universe.

329
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,942
Things happen for a reason.

330
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,363
What is going on here?

331
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,657
Badass fight, that's what.

332
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:51,580
Who said that?

333
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:54,625
Oh, wait, you mean
you can hear me?

334
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,711
Well, hallelujah. It's about time.

335
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:00,839
Please don't tell me
you're talking to me.

336
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:04,009
Are you kidding? I've been trying to
get your attention for two days now.

337
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:07,930
- I'm in serious trouble here.
- Okay. It's okay, Paige.

338
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,890
You've dealt with
weirder things than this.

339
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,768
Maybe my powers
are just advancing.

340
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:14,394
Maybe I can understand animals now.

341
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,647
Oh, please, give me a break.

342
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,566
Until you accepted that there
might be a reason you got this job,

343
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,318
you weren't gonna be
open to helping me.

344
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,570
Help you do what?

345
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,365
Reverse an evil witch's curse.
Make me human again.

346
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:30,160
Come on, if I'm evil too, it won't work.
You know that.

347
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:33,455
What have you got to lose?

348
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:38,710
Well, that's a good point.
This day couldn't get much suckier.

349
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,089
Okay, here goes.

350
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:46,927
I call upon the Halliwells
I call our powers to undo this spell

351
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:52,182
Make right again, that we must
Reverse the curse that made this mutt

352
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:59,273
That's better. Thanks.

353
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,942
All right. Don't mention it.

354
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,570
As long as you don't hump my leg
anymore, we'll be cool.

355
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,154
Yeah, I'm sorry.

356
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:09,158
That's just what dogs do
when they like someone.

357
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,326
Oh, that's very sweet.

358
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:15,789
So why did an evil witch turn you
into man's best friend, anyway?

359
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:17,708
Well, it's kind of complicated.

360
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,877
Let's just say there
are a million reasons.

361
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:22,546
But let me help you.
All those dogs out there,

362
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:25,215
they're barking because there's
some serious magic in the air,

363
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:28,343
the kind of magic that you
might be looking for.

364
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,267
I am so sorry.

365
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,853
I didn't mean for that to happen.

366
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,522
Why not? Why are you apologizing?

367
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,275
- You were unbelievable.
- Oh, please don't say it.

368
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:44,693
Just don't.

369
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,738
- Well, it wasn't just you, you know.
- Oh, yeah.

370
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:52,534
I know. I just...
I wasn't myself, that's all.

371
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,286
I don't understand.

372
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,663
Yeah, I know you don't,
and that's okay.

373
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,041
As long as you stay
on that side of the room,

374
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,418
everything should be fine.

375
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:03,962
It's the only way that I really know
what I'm feeling.

376
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:05,714
- Phoebe.
- Please, please.

377
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:07,549
- Please, please. Don't, don't.
- Hey.

378
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:11,887
What's the matter?
You can talk to me.

379
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:16,642
We like each other, Phoebe.
You don't have to be afraid of that.

380
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:18,602
I'm not gonna hurt you.

381
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,607
- Really?
- Really.

382
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,236
Come here.

383
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,120
Oh, no. Not again.

384
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,081
- What?
- What do you mean, "what"?

385
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:40,791
Don't think I don't know.

386
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:47,422
- Hi.
- Hi.

387
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,092
- Excuse us. You got a minute?
- Yeah.

388
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:56,306
What is the matter?
Weren't you supposed to be?

389
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:59,226
But you don't have to yell at me.
I can sense how mad you are.

390
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:01,770
Okay, just because you can sense
doesn't mean I can't vent.

391
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:03,856
- Where are we going right now?
- To find Piper.

392
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,109
- You know where she is?
- Yeah, a little doggie told me.

393
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:29,965
No!

394
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,265
Come on. Get up.

395
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:32,444
Way to go, Piper.

396
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,405
What? She's good.

397
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:46,375
I'll take care of them.

398
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:49,753
Reverse the spell.
Reverse the spell.

399
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:54,424
Spell was cast, now make it pass
Remove it now, don't ask me how

400
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:02,307
Well, it serves you right.
What kind of spell was that?

401
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:06,395
Okay, Piper, I know why you
would rather be one of them.

402
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,814
It's because you don't
wanna feel pain.

403
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,650
But you have to feel the pain,
because if you can't feel the pain,

404
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:14,361
then you can't feel
the good stuff either, you know?

405
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,447
Right?

406
00:28:25,664 --> 00:28:28,292
Oh, and that was so much better.

407
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:42,639
Police, drop your weapons.

408
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:47,227
Piper.

409
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,626
Now do you believe me?

410
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:14,338
Go, get in.

411
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,642
Piper, let's go.

412
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,685
Piper, don't go.

413
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:31,438
Hurry.

414
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,024
Please.

415
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:56,046
There's gotta be a way
to get Piper out of there.

416
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:57,339
I know it.

417
00:29:57,506 --> 00:30:00,592
Well, unfortunately, the reversal spell,
as you so kindly pointed out,

418
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:03,095
didn't exactly help Piper
remember who she was.

419
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:05,055
What do the Elders think?

420
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:08,141
They think it had to be a demon
who stuck Leo in Valhalla.

421
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,436
- But they're not sure.
- Still, it's their leading theory.

422
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:13,647
Guys, this is about Piper.

423
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:17,693
Actually, the Elders believe your new
power is key to helping save Piper.

424
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:21,572
My new power? How do they figure?
All it's done is make things worse.

425
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,074
There's a reason you received it,
and they...

426
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:26,285
We believe it's to help save Piper.

427
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,662
So, what exactly did you feel
the last time from her?

428
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:31,790
Not much.

429
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:35,294
But you said you felt
something familiar, little things?

430
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:39,131
Well, I mean, obviously I felt pain.

431
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,177
And desire to help.

432
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:44,553
Okay, well, she helped Darryl.

433
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,639
That wasn't with her Valkyrie powers,
that was with her Charmed powers.

434
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,726
- The witch within must still be alive.
- That's how you'll reach her.

435
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:51,935
Yeah, but how?

436
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:54,813
I mean, just because I could feel
some glimmer of Piper's feelings

437
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,023
doesn't mean she can.

438
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,859
- She's completely cut off from them.
- Wait, wait, wait, hold it.

439
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,570
Isn't there a spell that allows
somebody to feel what you feel?

440
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,114
Which in this case would be
Piper feeling

441
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,742
what you're feeling
Piper should be feeling.

442
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:09,328
Did that make sense?

443
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:11,622
Frighteningly, it did.

444
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:16,210
What about the spell
I used on Cole last year?

445
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:18,587
The one to make him sense
whether or not you loved him?

446
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:20,797
I could reword it for Piper.

447
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:23,592
Actually, that's worth a shot.

448
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,012
You still have to get close to her
to try it, and that's not gonna be easy.

449
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,431
- Especially with Piper's powers.
- Maybe I can orb you.

450
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:33,227
No, Leo. You're the reason she's
in this emotional cocoon.

451
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:36,021
You need to stay far away from her.

452
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,272
No offence.

453
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:38,690
Well, then the question is

454
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:42,236
how do we get close enough to her
without her kicking our butts?

455
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:47,491
I could use my new power
to counteract hers.

456
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:50,577
- How do you figure?
- Our powers are emotion-based, right?

457
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:54,998
If I can channel Piper's feelings,
why can't I channel her powers?

458
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,335
And then use them against her.

459
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:16,854
What are you doing here?

460
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:19,273
We're here to take you home.

461
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:28,657
Why does she always
pick on me first?

462
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:48,760
Paige, now!

463
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:52,389
Open Piper's heart to reveal
That part which only Phoebe feels

464
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:56,393
Send it back from whence it came
But don't protect her from the pain

465
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:12,326
- No, wait.
- Did they harm you?

466
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:17,080
No, they helped me.

467
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,547
I know what you do here.

468
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:27,466
I understand its purpose.

469
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:30,928
So you can trust
that your secret is safe.

470
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,806
But I think it's time
for me to go home.

471
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,025
- Jason Dean.
- Hi.

472
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,527
Hi, Phoebe.

473
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:32,072
I was starting to get a little worried.
Did you get all my messages?

474
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:34,908
Yeah, I did. And I'm sorry
I didn't call you back, but...

475
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,869
Let me guess, something came up.

476
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:40,414
- You're a mysterious woman, Phoebe.
- Is that a bad thing?

477
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:41,832
No, it's a good thing.

478
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,959
Except for when I'm trying
to figure you out.

479
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:45,669
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

480
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:48,338
I'm having a hard time
figuring myself out these days.

481
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:51,800
I'm glad.
I mean, I'm, you know...

482
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:56,096
Not that you're having trouble.
It's just that it's not about me.

483
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:58,390
It's not about me, is it?

484
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,268
No, it's not about you.

485
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:07,441
It's just that my feelings have been
a little mixed up lately.

486
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:09,818
Well, long-distance relationships
are not easy.

487
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,071
No, they're not.

488
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:17,910
So am I gonna see you again
before I leave?

489
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:20,662
I want to, I really do.

490
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:22,873
But I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

491
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,958
I understand.

492
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:26,835
That's a lie. I don't.

493
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:31,215
It's just that my favourite
advice columnist once wrote

494
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:35,302
that it's important for guys
to be more understanding.

495
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:36,762
So how am I doing?

496
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:40,224
You're doing great. Really great.

497
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:44,311
So should I call you?

498
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,313
Yeah, you better call me.

499
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:51,026
Have a safe flight.

500
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:53,153
Thanks.

501
00:35:54,488 --> 00:35:57,324
- Bye.
- Bye.

502
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,301
Hi, Chris.

503
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:18,846
- What are you doing?
- You look amazing.

504
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:22,224
Thank you. Leave it.
I'll help you clean it up tomorrow.

505
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:24,685
It's okay, I don't mind.
It's the least I can do.

506
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:26,144
What do you mean?

507
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:28,689
Well, you know,
for fighting with Leo and...

508
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:32,067
- He attacked you. Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, I know.

509
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:34,069
Like I said, it's cool.

510
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:37,573
- Hi.
- Hey.

511
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:39,575
Guess it didn't go that well
with Jason?

512
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:42,578
Well, I went all the way down
there to talk to him,

513
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:46,373
and then I figured maybe it wasn't
such a good idea that I even see him,

514
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,917
at least not until I can
control my new power.

515
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:52,462
Well, judging by how it's been going,
it might be just a little bit.

516
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:54,506
I know, but what
am I supposed to do?

517
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:57,467
I'm gonna have to figure out
how to use it sooner or later.

518
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:00,429
And until then, I'm just gonna
stay away from horny men.

519
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,723
Good luck.

520
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,725
At least your new power
helped save Piper.

521
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:06,143
That's gotta be a good thing.

522
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:08,645
It won't help her with what
she's going through, though.

523
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:10,898
But at least
she's going through it now.

524
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:14,193
- And that is a good thing.
- Yeah, well, let's hope.

525
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:17,613
Well, I'm off to see Oscar.

526
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:21,116
Wait. Oscar the dog?

527
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:24,328
Yeah, he's having a bit
of a tough time adjusting.

528
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:26,788
I don't really want him
roaming the streets by himself,

529
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:29,583
especially since I'm the one
who rescued him.

530
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:32,920
I was having trouble with the
whole idea of that temp-agency thing.

531
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:35,964
But I'm kind of digging it now.
It's all right.

532
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:39,092
- Wait, wait, about Oscar...
- Bye.

533
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:48,101
Who is it?

534
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,353
It's me.

535
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:51,522
Come in.

536
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:57,986
Hi.

537
00:37:58,195 --> 00:37:59,321
Hi.

538
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,200
Wanna hold him?

539
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,744
Are you kidding?

540
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,006
He's gotten so big.

541
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:20,259
Yeah.

542
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:30,394
Look out. Yeah.

543
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:34,565
Look, Piper...

544
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:38,152
...I wanna say I'm sorry
for taking away your feelings.

545
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,404
Leo, you don't have to apologize.

546
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,824
I know that you were
just trying to help me. I do.

547
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:48,078
And it wasn't your fault you weren't
around to take the spell away.

548
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,413
Well, it's somebody's fault.

549
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:53,083
And I'm gonna find out whose.

550
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:57,671
The other Elders want me
to stick around until I do.

551
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,591
To make sure nobody
is targeting us again.

552
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:03,385
So you're still an Elder, then.

553
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:05,762
Yeah.

554
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:11,685
I need to ask you a favour.

555
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:13,604
Anything.

556
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,899
I need some space from you.

557
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:23,864
I mean, who knows, this might actually
turn out to be a good thing for me

558
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:25,991
in the long run.

559
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:29,703
I might be able to live
some semblance of a normal life,

560
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,539
not being married to an angel.

561
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:40,422
I get why you have to leave, Leo.

562
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:43,634
And I understand that
you can't ignore your calling.

563
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,013
But I do have to deal
with it somehow.

564
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,766
With being alone,

565
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:53,352
with being a single mother.

566
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:57,231
And I can't really do that with
you hanging around the house.

567
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:03,278
I'm sorry.

568
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:12,788
Leo, please, I need this.

569
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,095
I won't be far.

570
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:44,528
You deserve a normal life, Piper.

571
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:49,491
I really hope you find it.
