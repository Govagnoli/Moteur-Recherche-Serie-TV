1
00:00:07,729 --> 00:00:09,924
Piper, have you
seen slides anywhere?

2
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:12,000
By the TV.

3
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,607
Thank God. I thought that I had lost
them. Jack would have killed me.

4
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:17,964
- Jack?
- The boss is sending two employees

5
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:21,121
with the best presentation to New York
for a conference, all expenses paid.

6
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:23,359
And Jack and I are hoping
that he picks us.

7
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:24,882
Are you gonna sleep with him?

8
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:27,643
Piper, it is just a business trip.
That is all.

9
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,002
- Who's the present for?
- Lisa Kruger's baby shower.

10
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:36,121
- I forgot.
- I know.

11
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:39,804
So did Phoebe.
But I'm making it from all of us.

12
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:42,246
- What all is in here?
- Stuff.

13
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,877
And I just knitted her
a little baby blanket. That's all.

14
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:48,641
You knit. I didn't know that you knit.

15
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,487
Yeah. I even had some
extra yarn left over,

16
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:52,879
and I made her a little bear to match.
Kind of cute, huh?

17
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,800
Hi. He's adorable.

18
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,802
I guess this is really good
practice for you, huh?

19
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,483
- What are you talking about?
- You, Dan, little Dan.

20
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,002
Whoa, slow down.

21
00:01:04,169 --> 00:01:07,320
Dan is the one that has our
relationship on the fast track, not me.

22
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:09,719
But don't get me wrong, he's...
He's great.

23
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,960
But that doesn't mean
I'm ready to move in with him

24
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:14,802
- or anything else of that nature.
- You know, I just hate guys

25
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:17,244
that aren't afraid to commit,
they are so atypical.

26
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,320
It's not funny, Prue. It's a problem.

27
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:21,441
Piper, I don't really see
what the problem is.

28
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:23,486
I mean, you and Dan
are great together,

29
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,241
and you think that you love him, right?

30
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:28,161
I think so. It's just,

31
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:30,240
every time I feel I'm ready
to commit to him,

32
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:32,764
I flash back to our little trip
to the future

33
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:35,238
- and seeing me with Leo and the...
- Piper.

34
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:38,162
Dan is here now, in the present.
That's all that matters.

35
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,323
I know. I know.

36
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:43,445
But I'm not ready
for a baby shower either.

37
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,724
Come on, Morris, open your mind.
This can so work.

38
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:58,722
Look, Phoebe, it's not that
I don't appreciate your offer.

39
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:02,928
It's just my stock in this precinct
is not exactly blue-chip.

40
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,886
The last thing I need
is for word to get out

41
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,244
that I'm using a psychic
to solve my cases.

42
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:08,643
So no one needs to know.

43
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:10,879
You just give me the evidence,
I touch it,

44
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:14,359
and if I get a flash,
then we're in business.

45
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,047
Oh, my God.

46
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,962
I see blood...

47
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:26,167
...flesh.

48
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:28,326
You had the sausage for breakfast,
didn't you?

49
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:30,127
I hate sausage.

50
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,404
It's a little joke.

51
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:34,357
All right, people, move along,
nothing to see here.

52
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:40,764
Who would bring a baby
to a police station?

53
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:43,887
- It was abandoned. Now, look...
- Abandoned? That's awful.

54
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:45,801
That's why they call it a crime.
Now, Phoebe...

55
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:49,518
You know, they're really scaring him
waving that rattle in his face like that.

56
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:55,208
Excuse me, officers.
Mind if I try this? Thanks.

57
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:57,724
Thanks. We got it from here.

58
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:00,449
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

59
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:02,759
It's okay, Matthew.

60
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:05,563
There you go. You're okay.

61
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:08,483
See, I told you I could help you.

62
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:11,483
All babies need is love.

63
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:16,606
Hi. Oh, yeah. Big boy, huh?

64
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:29,522
Phoebe, are you okay?

65
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:03,407
So I can't figure out if the premonition
was the future or the past.

66
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,321
But if it was the past,
it would make sense

67
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:07,878
that they would abandon him
to try to save him.

68
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:10,244
You know, I'm not really good
with these things.

69
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,758
They're called babies,
and just do the rock-and-walk,

70
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,965
he loves the rock-and-walk.

71
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,002
- Are you sure it was a ghost?
- Yeah, I think I know ghosts by now.

72
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:21,404
I just can't figure out
why a mean ghost

73
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,321
would wanna hurt
that cute little baby.

74
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,367
And how did you talk Darryl
into letting you take him home?

75
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:28,520
I just told him about the premonition.

76
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:31,318
Only problem is,
he says we have 24 hours

77
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:33,844
before Social Services
starts asking questions.

78
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:35,681
So, what are we supposed to do
with him now?

79
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:38,966
Raise him in the ways of witchcraft?
Teach him how to fight ghosts?

80
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:40,721
Okay, okay.
Maybe you should take him.

81
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:43,444
Okay. Come here.

82
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,407
It's okay. It's all right.

83
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:52,804
There's a good baby.
There's a very good little baby. Okay.

84
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:57,045
- Wow, you really are a natural at this.
- Yeah.

85
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:59,564
I can't wait to have a baby
of my own someday.

86
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:03,081
I'm beginning to think Dan
fell in love with the wrong sister.

87
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:06,644
Nothing, never mind.

88
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:11,121
Hi, sweetie.
Do you like bears? Lookie.

89
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:16,201
Yeah. He doesn't like things
being waved in his face.

90
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:19,247
- Obviously.
- Well, let's do him.

91
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:23,878
All right, this better be good,
because my New York trip is at stake.

92
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:27,918
We have a baby?

93
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:29,807
Phoebe picked it up
at the police station.

94
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:35,243
Okay, I thought that you were going
to go ask Darryl about a job, not a kid.

95
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:39,761
I was. And I was trying, but then
this abandoned baby came in.

96
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:41,282
- Abandoned?
- Yes.

97
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:45,283
In a Eddie Bauer car seat
and a blanket lined in silk?

98
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:48,243
Oh, no. You guys, I think
he's finally falling asleep.

99
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,001
Okay, I don't get it.

100
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,285
If the parents could afford
such expensive stuff,

101
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,041
then how come
they couldn't keep the kid?

102
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:56,165
I don't think that's
why he was abandoned.

103
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:57,967
Oh, no.

104
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:02,920
He's like a car alarm.
The smallest vibration

105
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,728
just sets him off, and there's
nothing you can do to stop it.

106
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,880
- She's got baby issues.
- I know.

107
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:11,200
Look, okay, Phoebe had a vision
of a ghost chasing the baby.

108
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:13,724
And a man carrying the baby,
probably his father.

109
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:17,006
Darryl said I could stop by, and he'd
get a sketch artist to help me ID him.

110
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:20,048
Good, because the only way to find out
why the ghost is after the baby

111
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,801
is by finding out who he belongs to.

112
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:23,607
- I better go.
- What?

113
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:27,648
Yeah, I gotta get back to work.
Just keep me posted.

114
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:31,046
Whoa, wait, you can't
leave me here alone with him.

115
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:33,006
Piper, you're gonna be fine,
don't be afraid.

116
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,763
- Yeah, just think of it as a test run.
- I don't need a test run.

117
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:37,203
I remember when Phoebe
was a baby.

118
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:38,882
And it was hard on Mom,
and endless.

119
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:40,801
And with you dropping her
all the time...

120
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:43,164
- What?
- Oh, moving on, what's the point?

121
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,526
The point is we need things like
diapers and bottles and formula

122
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:49,647
- and a million other things.
- I'll go shopping.

123
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:52,087
And I'm gonna go see Morris.

124
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:54,763
You're gonna be fine, okay?
Just do the rock-and-walk. Okay?

125
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:57,523
You're gonna be fine. Bye.

126
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,321
All right.

127
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,480
Oh, God.

128
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,200
- Prue.
- Jack.

129
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:35,724
Hey. What are you doing here?

130
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,561
Getting my ass kicked
by a 5-year-old.

131
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:40,721
Hey, you little rug rat,
best two out of three. Come on.

132
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:45,280
- So how did you find me?
- Your assistant told me.

133
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:47,758
What she didn't tell me
is what the hell you're doing here.

134
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:51,808
Oh, just a little bit
of a family emergency.

135
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:55,325
- And you needed diapers?
- Yes, they're for my cousin.

136
00:08:55,489 --> 00:09:00,961
My baby cousin Matthew.
Just staying with us a day or so.

137
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,881
And you'd be coming
back to work when?

138
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,358
Right after I drop this stuff off.
And believe me,

139
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,724
there will be no more interruptions
after today.

140
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,402
Good. Because for a second there,

141
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:12,481
I thought maybe you'd changed
your mind about going to New York.

142
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:14,287
Okay, wait a second. Who has been

143
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:17,759
working late for the past three nights
to get our presentation done?

144
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:21,126
Yeah. Well, that's before I thought
we had a chance to win.

145
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:25,282
So when you disappeared, I figured
that maybe you had second thoughts.

146
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,599
No, I want to go to New York.

147
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:32,001
And believe me, I would much rather
be at work right now

148
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:37,527
than trying to figure out whether
to get aloe-lined or Velcro-tabbed

149
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:42,080
or elastic-leg-cuff-thingy diapers.

150
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:45,842
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about diapers, would you?

151
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:48,682
Me? No.

152
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:50,965
See, that would involve knowing
something about babies,

153
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:54,360
which I know absolutely zero about.

154
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:59,319
But what I do know something
about is the Big Apple.

155
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:03,728
Specifically, romantic restaurants,

156
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:07,121
hip clubs, secret getaways.

157
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:12,764
Okay. Presentation's today at 3,
plane leaves tomorrow at 9.

158
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:16,964
I got a kid to catch.

159
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:29,922
This is called the jiggle.

160
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:33,684
It gives the babies that nice, warm
moving-around-in-the-womb feeling.

161
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:37,159
You're absolutely amazing.
I tried everything, and nothing worked.

162
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,968
Well, it helps to come
from a big family.

163
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:43,724
Once you've mastered the jiggle,
you'll be able to do...

164
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:46,207
...the wave.

165
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:49,800
- Wanna give it a try?
- No. Let's not mess with a good thing.

166
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:58,641
You're staring.

167
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:01,918
I like seeing you this way.

168
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:08,121
You have no idea
how expensive having a baby is.

169
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:12,202
So I'll tell you: $312.46, to be exact.

170
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:13,518
No way.

171
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:17,125
Well, your timing's perfect.
Cousin Matthew needs a change.

172
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:19,041
- Okay, here.
- Okay.

173
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:21,517
All right, here we go.

174
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:23,606
- Oops-a-daisy.
- Hi.

175
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,000
That is ripe.

176
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:36,000
What does this kid live on,
wheatgrass?

177
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:38,478
- I can change him.
- No, no, we got it.

178
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:42,524
All right, I've got
hypoallergenic wipes,

179
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:46,648
diaper-rash cream
and super-absorbent diapers.

180
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,925
- What are we supposed to do with...?
- Just toss it.

181
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:52,047
- All right.
- Don't forget to clean up under his...

182
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:00,445
Okay, so maybe only one of us
should change him.

183
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:02,565
- Be my guest.
- All right.

184
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:04,766
On the count of three. Ready?

185
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:08,285
One, two, three.

186
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:13,359
Boys will be boys.

187
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:16,923
Hi.

188
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:23,038
It doesn't... It doesn't fit. Doesn't fit.

189
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,279
Probably the wrong size.

190
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:28,282
Okay, how was I supposed to know
what size to get?

191
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:31,881
- Look, I got it.
- You got it?

192
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,801
Oh, how nice.

193
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:36,843
There we go. How's that?

194
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:39,159
Wow, you're like MacGyver
with oestrogen.

195
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:40,842
Thanks, I think.

196
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:43,364
Actually, cloth diapers
are more environmentally friendly,

197
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,008
but harder to use.

198
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:48,607
There. Such a good boy.

199
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:51,798
- Yes, he is.
- All right.

200
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:54,358
If you want, I can pick up
the right size on the way home.

201
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:56,759
- Thanks, that'd be great.
- Not a problem.

202
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:01,442
See you tonight.

203
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:02,962
Hi.

204
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,522
- What?
- You know what is so weird?

205
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:08,281
What? Why are you giving him to me?

206
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:11,168
Because... Because I gotta go.

207
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:13,927
That's twice. I'm counting.

208
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:16,488
Hi.

209
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:19,917
- Yeah, I'm off for a few days.
- Heading to the lake?

210
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:23,597
I think his brows should be
a bit more arched

211
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,487
and his hair a little lighter.

212
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,077
Yeah, that's better.

213
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,282
And his nose is bigger, wider.

214
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:34,521
So we looking for a murder suspect?

215
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,645
Just do me a favour, Hernandez.
No questions.

216
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:39,369
Need to know what to do with him
when I'm done with the sketch.

217
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:42,487
I mean, what, do I put it
on the wire, put out an APB...

218
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,162
...or ship it to the psychic hotline?

219
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:48,005
Oh, wait. Wait, that's it, that's him.

220
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:49,807
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

221
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,318
All right, print us up a copy,
run it through the database,

222
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:54,127
try to get us a name.

223
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:55,961
Just do it.

224
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,926
- Gilbert Van Lewen.
- You know him?

225
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:07,240
Well, I know the name.
His family has a huge art collection,

226
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:08,842
part of which they wanted to sell

227
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:11,842
when his father mysteriously died
last summer.

228
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:16,560
Wait. I just read somewhere that his
brother died a couple of days ago too.

229
00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:20,881
So it sounds like the ghost
isn't just after baby Matthew.

230
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:23,609
Hey, you wanna meet me and Morris
down at the Van Lewen estate,

231
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:25,202
have a little chat with Gilbert?

232
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:28,839
It would help to have an active power
there just in case the ghost shows up.

233
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,762
Sure. Who wants to go
to New York anyway?

234
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:35,081
Bye.

235
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:38,327
That's for you.
And thank you very much.

236
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:40,526
Lunch is served.

237
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,798
Alexandra, for God's sakes,
keep your voice down, please.

238
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:50,846
Where's Matthew?
What did you do with him?

239
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:54,046
You have got to believe me,
I did this for his own good.

240
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:57,167
You can't just abandon our baby.
You can't just do that.

241
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,366
I had to. He would have gotten to him
tomorrow at the christening, I know it.

242
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:03,441
That's when he strikes,
at the moment of greatest joy.

243
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:07,568
Okay, Gilbert, listen to me. I know that
you've been under a lot of strain

244
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:09,321
because of what happened
to your brother.

245
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:11,525
But this whole ghost thing
has got to stop.

246
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:15,967
Don't you understand? It's crazy.
There's no such thing as a...

247
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:17,958
It's him.

248
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:19,926
Gilbert, you've gotta
get out of here now.

249
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:22,000
Too late, Martha.

250
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,883
- He's next.
- No, not again.

251
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:30,565
I have suffered enough.
Please spare my last son.

252
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:34,688
If he brings the baby back, perhaps.

253
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:36,757
Never.

254
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:49,719
You're stuck here, Martha.
I won't let you leave...

255
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:55,802
...until you have watched me kill
every last male in your family.

256
00:16:07,729 --> 00:16:09,082
Hey, what's going on?

257
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:11,558
Apparently Gilbert Van Lewen
fell over the banister.

258
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:14,402
The medical examiner is gonna
list the cause of death as accidental.

259
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:16,878
Sure have been a lot of accidents
around here lately.

260
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:19,517
- Yeah, well, welcome to Homicide.
- Poor Matthew.

261
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:21,725
We don't know for sure
that Gilbert was his father.

262
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:24,039
- Well, we have to find out for sure.
- Well, hold it.

263
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:25,767
Number one, this isn't my crime scene.

264
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:27,920
Number two, you ain't cops,
remember?

265
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:29,761
Darryl, we cannot just walk
away from this.

266
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:32,568
We have to find out whether
this is Matthew's home or not.

267
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:41,161
- They're with me.
- Let me guess, your psychic friends?

268
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:43,445
Let me guess.
You wanna be a meter maid.

269
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:46,321
- Who called it in?
- The victim's mother,

270
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,559
Martha Van Lewen.
She's around the corner.

271
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:52,805
I'll do all the talking
to Mrs Van Lewen. Are we clear?

272
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:54,641
Perfectly.

273
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:57,207
Easy. Coming through.

274
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,005
Mrs Van Lewen,
I'm Inspector Morris.

275
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:05,121
- I'm terribly sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

276
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:07,849
I have a couple of questions for you
and your daughter-in-law.

277
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:12,084
Well, Alexandra's off resting, she's...

278
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:14,809
...in a great deal of pain,
as you can imagine.

279
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:18,405
- Of course. She's with her baby then?
- No.

280
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,879
My grandson's staying
at his aunt's in Sonoma.

281
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:26,008
I'm sorry, inspector, I really
don't feel like talking anymore.

282
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,882
I understand. Again, my condolences.

283
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:48,964
Yeah, no question about it.

284
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,845
They must love him dearly.

285
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:54,921
Can't imagine how painful
it must have been to let him go.

286
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:58,400
We probably shouldn't mention
where the baby is,

287
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:00,799
in case Casper's still around.

288
00:18:00,969 --> 00:18:02,561
What are you doing in here?

289
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:04,646
Oh, hi.

290
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:07,198
Sorry. Alexandra?

291
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:09,158
Who are you?

292
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:12,845
I'm Phoebe, and this is my sister Prue.
And we are...

293
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,887
Grief counsellors
with the police department.

294
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:20,559
I don't need any counselling.
I just need to be alone.

295
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:24,241
- We understand.
- More than you know.

296
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:30,479
- We can help you, Alexandra.
- Oh, yeah?

297
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:33,766
- Can you bring back my husband?
- No.

298
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,798
But maybe somebody else.

299
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:43,204
Please leave. Just go.

300
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:51,521
Okay, isn't it anybody else's turn yet?
I'm dying here.

301
00:18:51,689 --> 00:18:54,408
Just a bit longer, Piper. I had no idea
there was so much information

302
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:56,161
about the Van Lewens on the Internet.

303
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:58,968
Yeah, and Jack pushed
the presentation, which means

304
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:00,801
I've got until morning to salvage it.

305
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:04,046
I don't understand why you didn't come
out and tell them we had Matthew.

306
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,882
Because we couldn't risk the ghost
following us home and finding him.

307
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:09,244
We have to figure out
how to vanquish the ghost.

308
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:12,446
Yeah, in less than 12 hours, before
Darryl comes and takes him away.

309
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,442
Well, the thing about ghosts is they
always haunt for a specific reason.

310
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:16,928
And it's always personal.

311
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,886
So I know the Van Lewens
know this ghost.

312
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:21,321
- And I am going to find him.
- No.

313
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:24,401
I'm gonna find him.
Okay, time's up. He's all yours.

314
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:31,247
Come here. Okay. I know.
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

315
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:33,400
Why isn't he stopping?
He's not stopping.

316
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:36,288
- Maybe it's a hungry cry.
- But you just fed him.

317
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,122
Maybe it's a sleepy cry.

318
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:40,598
If it was a sleepy cry,
wouldn't he just fall asleep?

319
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:44,082
Maybe it's a burpy cry.
Do you have gas?

320
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:50,208
Something tells me it's going to be
a very long night.

321
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:00,126
I thought that babies slept a lot.

322
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:03,964
Yeah, obviously one of those lies they
tell you so you'll wanna get pregnant.

323
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:06,768
- So much for being the natural.
- Hey, everyone has their limits.

324
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:09,887
- Anything in Dr. Spock?
- Nothing that we haven't already tried.

325
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:12,438
- How's the search going?
- Not so good.

326
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:15,328
The Van Lewens are seriously loaded.

327
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:18,526
There could be hundreds of dead
people holding a grudge against them.

328
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:22,398
Well, why don't you just focus on
the time of Martha's husband's death.

329
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:24,844
- I mean, that was the first...
- What did you do?

330
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:26,647
- I didn't do anything.
- Well, do something.

331
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:29,568
Okay, okay, okay.

332
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:33,520
Here we go. I'm sorry. I know.

333
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:37,438
It's okay. It's okay.

334
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:40,967
Okay.

335
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:49,919
Doesn't that fall under
the personal-gain category?

336
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:53,121
Oh, who cares?
We're desperate, and it's working.

337
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:56,768
He likes it, that is so sweet.

338
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:01,717
Oh, no, not again.

339
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:14,403
Here, this might be something.
The Van Lewen family chauffer,

340
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:18,881
Elias Lundy, disappeared suddenly
just before Martha's husband died.

341
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:23,486
Well, disappeared doesn't mean dead.
Maybe it just means he took off.

342
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,004
Well, if he did, he took off
without anything he owned,

343
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:28,683
including his savings account
and his car.

344
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:32,239
That's definitely something that we
should ask Martha Van Lewen about.

345
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:33,603
Yeah, if she'll talk to us.

346
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:36,363
Well, if she ever wants to get
her grandson back safe, she will.

347
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,885
Okay, forget Dr. Spock.
This is the only book we need.

348
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,767
The Book of Shadows?
I don't think so.

349
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:45,126
Well, Mom wrote spells in it, right?
And with three girls, there has to be

350
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:48,918
something in here about,
you know, how to do...

351
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:51,002
Oh, here it is.

352
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:57,488
- "Sometimes a baby just has to cry."
- Thanks, Mom.

353
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,925
I don't understand why this is so hard.
We're women, it should be in our DNA.

354
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:08,799
I can't keep doing this all night.

355
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:38,928
- What?
- Just wondering

356
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:40,647
if you're too good to be true.

357
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:44,245
Maybe someday you'll find out
through personal experience.

358
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:50,239
- I have to go to work.
- Hi, silly.

359
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:56,840
- Thanks, really.
- It was my pleasure.

360
00:22:57,769 --> 00:22:59,919
He really is beautiful.

361
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:02,445
Just like his cousin.

362
00:23:04,689 --> 00:23:05,883
Bye.

363
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:08,647
Silly.

364
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:18,922
Oh, what time is it?
Quarter till 8. I'm late.

365
00:23:19,089 --> 00:23:21,728
I've gotta go to Martha Van Lewen.
Piper, will you come with me?

366
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:23,845
Yeah. Right behind you.

367
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:33,368
- Oh, I think we forgot something.
- What are we gonna do with him?

368
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:40,448
Hey. You ready to wow Caldwell?

369
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:43,922
Well, actually...

370
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:50,163
You get that through Office Supplies?

371
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,638
Okay, I had to bring him.
There was nowhere else to put him.

372
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:55,243
And I think we should talk to Caldwell
about a day-care centre.

373
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:57,639
I mean, I'm not the only one
with a child around here.

374
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:02,201
Prue, unless you have a really big
surprise for me, you don't have a kid.

375
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:03,927
I know that.

376
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:06,524
But I'm going to one day.

377
00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:11,005
Hey, it's okay.

378
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:17,240
He only likes this finger, and it took me
all night to figure that out.

379
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:20,003
But you should see me at diapering.
I'm really good at it.

380
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:23,047
Yeah, okay, you know, this mothering
instinct is really something.

381
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:24,961
But me, I've got my own inner child,

382
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:27,006
and right now he's thinking
about New York.

383
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:28,443
Right.

384
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:32,043
Jack, I didn't really finish
the presentation.

385
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,369
You know, I figured you were
probably still in a family crisis,

386
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:37,997
especially after
the tenth unanswered call,

387
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:40,729
so I hope you don't mind,
but I took the liberty

388
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:43,767
of finishing the presentation myself.

389
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:45,282
Anything to get you to New York.

390
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:50,881
- You're the best.
- He certainly is.

391
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:54,086
And since I need my best
and brightest in New York,

392
00:24:54,249 --> 00:24:56,888
I'm taking you
out of the running, Halliwell.

393
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:00,758
Mr Caldwell, you know, I finished
the presentation based on her file.

394
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:02,328
I mean, she had a family emergency.

395
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:04,002
She has a lot of those, doesn't she.

396
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:08,239
We'll show your presentation
to the client at noon, Sheridan.

397
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,006
- Yes?
- We need to talk to you.

398
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:36,959
- Are you with the police?
- No, not really.

399
00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:39,643
- But we are here to help.
- I don't understand.

400
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:43,245
Does the name Elias Lundy
mean anything to you?

401
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:47,404
Martha, the funeral home called,
and they wanted to know if...

402
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:49,806
What are you doing here?

403
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,965
I'm here because we really
need to talk to you.

404
00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:57,326
- And I think you know what about.
- Who are you people?

405
00:25:57,649 --> 00:25:59,526
What do you want?

406
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:08,317
Please tell me he's okay.

407
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:11,483
Please come with us, someplace safe,
where we can talk about this.

408
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:14,442
Oh, no.

409
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:23,885
- Where is the child?
- No, please don't tell him.

410
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:28,566
He didn't freeze.
Why didn't he freeze?

411
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:31,323
What are you? Witches?

412
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,481
- I've frozen ghosts before, haven't I?
- Okay, Piper, now is not the time.

413
00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:36,605
Just unfreeze them
so we can get them out of here.

414
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,682
Down.

415
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:42,841
Let's go.

416
00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:57,198
Bring me the child, or she's dead.

417
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:04,567
Looks like I'm not
the only one stuck here.

418
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:16,639
You know, you'd be more comfortable
at our place with your baby.

419
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:19,719
It's too much of a risk.

420
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:25,247
As much as I am dying to see him
and to hold him...

421
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:29,082
...I just can't.
- I don't think the ghost can follow you.

422
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:31,809
Or us. I mean, he couldn't chase us
out of the house.

423
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:33,687
I don't think he could leave the house.

424
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:37,125
But you're not positive. I mean,
you don't know that for sure, do you?

425
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:42,128
I've seen what he can do.
I watched him kill my husband.

426
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:45,602
- I won't watch him hurt my son.
- It's okay.

427
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:48,044
Everything's gonna be okay.

428
00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:51,765
Now, what did you husband tell you
about Elias Lundy?

429
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:55,879
He was their chauffeur.

430
00:27:56,249 --> 00:27:58,717
But he was obsessed with Martha.

431
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:02,564
Even carved his and Martha's initials
on the largest oak on the ground.

432
00:28:02,729 --> 00:28:03,957
I've seen it.

433
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:07,486
But one day, apparently
his obsession got out of hand,

434
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:10,209
and Lundy attacked Martha.

435
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:15,559
My father-in-law lured him out to that
same tree and shot him in the back.

436
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:18,004
Buried him on the grounds.
Covered it up.

437
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:21,527
Well, that would explain
why he suddenly disappeared.

438
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:23,725
A week later, my father-in-law
mysteriously died.

439
00:28:23,889 --> 00:28:26,005
At the house too.

440
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:31,523
And then Gilbert's brother
and his uncle, and then...

441
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:35,568
They all just look like accidents,
you know, bad luck.

442
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:38,038
Martha knew, but she just
couldn't convince anybody.

443
00:28:38,209 --> 00:28:40,040
I don't understand
why you stayed in that house.

444
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:42,245
Why didn't Gilbert get you
out of there?

445
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:47,722
Until Gilbert's brother died,
he didn't believe the story either.

446
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:51,718
Martha tried to sell the house once,
but I guess Lundy wouldn't let her.

447
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:55,446
He wants her to suffer
for what her husband did to him.

448
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,804
And he's not gonna quit
until he gets Matthew too.

449
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:00,480
Yeah, well,

450
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:03,369
we won't quit until we get him.

451
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:07,484
Now, do you have any idea where on
the grounds Lundy's body is buried?

452
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:11,958
Supposedly by that tree.
Under the initials.

453
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:17,281
Whoa, Prue.

454
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:20,327
Hey, don't touch that dial. I just
came back from Caldwell's office.

455
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:23,526
I told him I couldn't have finished the
presentation without the work you did,

456
00:29:23,689 --> 00:29:27,238
and I couldn't do the job to his level
of quality without my beautiful partner.

457
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:31,800
Plane leaves in two hours.
Sorry, squirt, I only got two.

458
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:34,962
- Kids under 2 fly free.
- Afraid you were gonna say that.

459
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:39,041
You know what? Whatever.
I'm game.

460
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:41,404
Jack, that's sweet.

461
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:44,686
Thank you so much for sticking up
for me, but I can't. I gotta get home.

462
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:48,120
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, me too.

463
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:51,481
- Hey, you two make a nice couple.
- Thanks.

464
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:59,678
Prue's on her way back.

465
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:01,601
That stuff could melt your nostrils.

466
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:04,124
Yeah, like all the diaper changing
didn't melt them already.

467
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,725
Okay, some mandrake root...

468
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,040
You know, I could have sworn that
I'd be good at this whole baby thing.

469
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:13,724
I mean, I love kids. I'm giving,
I'm a good person...

470
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:16,323
Phoebe, I don't think Matthew
was rejecting you personally.

471
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:19,526
- At least, no more than the rest of us.
- Then why do I feel like a failure?

472
00:30:19,689 --> 00:30:21,327
Every time I get close
to the little guy,

473
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:23,127
he either opens his mouth
or his bowels.

474
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,678
I mean, call me kooky,
but that feels like rejection to me.

475
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:29,319
It takes a lot of time to figure out
how to take care of babies properly.

476
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:33,641
- It's a lot of work.
- A lot more than I thought, actually.

477
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:35,919
We should be grateful
we have a little time off.

478
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:37,283
Absolutely.

479
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:40,400
I miss him.

480
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:43,562
It is a little quiet around here.
Okay, let's just focus.

481
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:45,402
Okay, do you wanna get
the shovels?

482
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:48,364
Shovels? I thought we were
vanquishing Lundy with a potion.

483
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:50,918
- What do we need shovels for?
- Because the only way it works

484
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:54,525
is if you spread it over his bones,
which happen to be buried.

485
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:57,118
- We have to dig him up?
- I'm afraid so.

486
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:00,000
Is that it? Or is there
some other disgusting detail

487
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:02,285
- you're just waiting to spring on me?
- No.

488
00:31:02,449 --> 00:31:05,725
The only other way to vanquish him
is to destroy the object of the curse,

489
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:08,357
which is Martha.
And we're supposed to save Martha.

490
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:10,520
So get the shovels.

491
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,566
Hi, Matthew, how's the little man?
What are you doing?

492
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:16,447
The baby's home. Hi, baby.

493
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:18,804
Hey, I'm home too.

494
00:31:18,969 --> 00:31:21,324
- Okay, guys, are we ready?
- Yes, we're ready.

495
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:23,605
I really think someone should
stay here with Matthew.

496
00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:26,203
I'll stay.

497
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:29,122
Looks like we finally
all fell for the same guy.

498
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:33,047
Hi, baby. What you doing?

499
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:38,880
Time's up, ladies.
Social Services called,

500
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:41,802
- they wanna know where the baby is.
- Tell them he's with us.

501
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:44,244
Three witches and a baby.
I don't think that's gonna fly.

502
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:46,843
But you can't take him now.
We're this close to vanquishing...

503
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:49,125
I don't wanna hear
another ghost story.

504
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:51,007
In the real world,
that baby was abandoned.

505
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:54,400
Which means if I don't account
for him, I could lose my shield.

506
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:58,608
Not if you can offer
a plausible explanation, right?

507
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:02,120
I mean, what if he was kidnapped
and then abandoned?

508
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:04,242
You would be a hero.

509
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:06,559
You would be the one
reuniting him with his mom.

510
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:11,527
Look, just...

511
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:13,402
...hold off for a few hours, okay?

512
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:16,481
If we're not back,
then do what you have to do.

513
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:20,324
And here, take this, he really likes it.

514
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:23,128
And don't wave things in his face,
because he does not like that.

515
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:24,881
He likes the jiggle.
Do you know the jiggle?

516
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:26,727
Of course I know the jiggle.
I'm a father.

517
00:32:26,889 --> 00:32:28,117
Okay, and if he starts to cry,

518
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:30,519
just hold him really close,
because it comforts him.

519
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,846
Okay. Bye.

520
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:36,598
Prue, you're not gonna wear that,
are you?

521
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:39,727
Didn't think so.
We'll meet you in the car, all right?

522
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:52,006
You can't keep hiding from me,
Martha. I'll always find you.

523
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,764
You can punish me all you like,
Elias, it doesn't matter.

524
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:02,001
I don't know where Matthew is,
and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

525
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:12,647
- Did she say where the oak tree was?
- I assume around back.

526
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:15,960
Okay, you two go dig him up, and I'll
protect Martha for as long as I can.

527
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:17,767
All right.

528
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:32,121
Prue. Over here.

529
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:43,520
This has gotta be it.

530
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:46,085
Okay, hold this.

531
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:49,800
Pheebs, I think I have
a much quicker way of doing that.

532
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:53,442
Oh, yeah, you do, don't you? Okay.

533
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:55,648
- All right.
- All right.

534
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,640
Are you ready?

535
00:34:08,209 --> 00:34:10,086
Hello, Elias.

536
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:19,888
There are many things
worse than death, Martha.

537
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:22,162
You taught me that.

538
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:27,839
I can keep doing this forever.

539
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,687
I don't think so.

540
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:36,724
Bring me the child, and I'll spare you.

541
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,959
Actually, I think it's a little late for that.

542
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:50,241
My bones. My grave.

543
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:57,443
All right, here it goes.

544
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:10,728
You can't vanquish me
without my bones, can you?

545
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:13,207
- Busted.
- Run.

546
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:32,327
- Piper, where are you?
- Upstairs.

547
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:37,839
- Have you seen Lundy?
- What do you mean?

548
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:39,920
Didn't you vanquish him?

549
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:43,288
No. And it doesn't look like
we'll ever be able to.

550
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,407
He's hidden his bones someplace
that we'll never be able to find them.

551
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:49,167
Then you have to get
out of here now.

552
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:50,842
No, we're not leaving you.

553
00:35:51,009 --> 00:35:54,240
You haven't got a choice
if there's no other way to stop him.

554
00:35:57,409 --> 00:35:59,320
- It's not an option.
- Agreed.

555
00:35:59,649 --> 00:36:01,162
What?

556
00:36:02,249 --> 00:36:04,205
What is it?
I think I have a right to know.

557
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:09,687
It's just that there is one other way
to vanquish a ghost.

558
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:13,364
And that's to destroy
the object of its wrath.

559
00:36:13,689 --> 00:36:15,645
Meaning me?

560
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,121
Are you saying that if I die,
he dies too?

561
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:25,043
No, our job is to protect the innocent,
and that would be you.

562
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:27,565
No, it isn't.

563
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:33,639
It wasn't my husband who shot Elias
in the back, it was me. I did it.

564
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:39,165
He wanted me for himself. He said
he was gonna kill my husband.

565
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:42,241
Yet I did, didn't I?

566
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:47,044
How could you, Martha? I loved you.

567
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:50,079
Well, I didn't love you.

568
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:56,279
- They can't protect you forever.
- You're absolutely right.

569
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:59,523
But I can protect Matthew.

570
00:37:01,169 --> 00:37:02,682
Martha, no!

571
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:05,328
No!

572
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:21,040
Martha.

573
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:24,447
- What have you done?
- Killed us both.

574
00:37:26,129 --> 00:37:28,245
Go to hell, Elias.

575
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:50,439
- What do we do?
- Don't do anything.

576
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:52,162
This is where I belong.

577
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:55,487
This is the only way
to save my grandchild.

578
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,958
Thank you for protecting him.

579
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,962
Here they are.

580
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:53,967
Here, we wanted you to have this.

581
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:56,563
But we couldn't get all the throw-up
off of it.

582
00:38:57,129 --> 00:39:01,441
That's okay. You're all so sweet.
How can I thank you?

583
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:03,679
Oh, just let us babysit
every once in a while.

584
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:06,400
Just take good care of him.

585
00:39:07,209 --> 00:39:09,086
Bye, honey.

586
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:10,682
I know.

587
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:13,682
Bye, baby. Hey. Where did he go?

588
00:39:14,169 --> 00:39:16,478
- Bye.
- Thank you.

589
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:18,801
You're welcome.

590
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:33,724
Okay, so how many kids do you think
I'm gonna have someday?

591
00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:36,449
- I'd say five.
- More. At least six.

592
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:38,962
What makes you say that?

593
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:40,960
Oh, please, Pheebs,
you were born to be a mom.

594
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:45,321
- No doubt about it.
- Yeah? You think? Oh, I hope so.

595
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:47,241
I miss that little guy already.

596
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:50,128
Although being a surrogate mom
for the last 24 hours has taught me

597
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:52,883
I have a long way to go
before I'm ready for it full time.

598
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:57,042
- I gotta get my life together first.
- Yeah, and find a guy, maybe.

599
00:39:57,209 --> 00:39:59,279
That would probably help, huh?

600
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:03,160
Unlike Piper's guy,
who is, like, Mr. Mom.

601
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,440
Dan was really great
with Matthew, wasn't he?

602
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:08,407
- More like a godsend.
- I think that's what scares me.

603
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:11,003
He's, like, flawless.
He's great at everything.

604
00:40:11,169 --> 00:40:13,967
He's great-looking, he's fun,
he's great with babies...

605
00:40:14,129 --> 00:40:16,802
- But?
- But...

606
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:18,800
...I don't know.
He's just a little too perfect.

607
00:40:18,969 --> 00:40:20,607
I feel a little imperfect around him.

608
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:23,329
Well, maybe that's why you
were uncomfortable with Matthew.

609
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:26,606
Maybe because of Dan, you were
resisting your own maternal instincts.

610
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:29,329
- Where did that come from?
- Cosmo, where else?

611
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:34,205
Look over there. There's Jack.

612
00:40:35,129 --> 00:40:36,323
- Jack?
- Yeah, Jack.

613
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:38,127
Jack who?

614
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:43,926
Hey. Why aren't you in New York?

615
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:46,159
I didn't wanna go without my partner.

616
00:40:46,329 --> 00:40:48,081
I don't want you to think
this gesture of mine

617
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:50,080
is in any way a sign
of evolving maturity,

618
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:52,763
in case having your cousin Matthew
around gave you any ideas.

619
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,719
You know, the only idea
that I have is that one day,

620
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:59,926
maybe sooner, maybe later,
I'm gonna make a great mom.

621
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:03,797
And you know, hopefully,
I'll find the right guy.

622
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:07,801
Well, then I think you should know
that being as I'm still a kid myself,

623
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,880
I don't think I'd be doing anyone
any favours

624
00:41:10,049 --> 00:41:12,358
by pretending to be the right guy.

625
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:16,159
Well, I didn't say I was looking
for the right guy tonight.

626
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:19,765
- You'll do. Let's go. Dance?
- Sure.
