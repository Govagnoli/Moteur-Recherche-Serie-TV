1
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,733
Help! Somebody, help! Please?

2
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,569
All right, all right, relax, I'm back.

3
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,030
What is this?

4
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,157
How's his rash, need ointment?

5
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:36,537
I don't know. I'm procrastinating.
It's not my favourite thing to check.

6
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,081
You don't have a problem
checking Wyatt's.

7
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:43,001
That's 'cause I don't flash forward
to Wyatt being 22 like I do Chris.

8
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,963
Oh... yeah!

9
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,674
Exactly. Stinky diaper!

10
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,053
Hey, hey,
are you using magic?

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,889
Yeah, wait till you see
how I put the ointment on.

12
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,726
Hi! Personal gain. Do you wanna
lose your powers like Phoebe did?

13
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,604
- What if a demon attacks?
- It'd liven things up.

14
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,942
- Excuse me?
- I'm just kidding... sort of.

15
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,320
I love being a stay-at-home auntie.
I really, really do.

16
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,738
I just...

17
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,991
I'm going crazy.
I have to get out.

18
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,785
It wouldn't hurt you
to get out a little bit too.

19
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,204
You've been
cooped up in here ever since...

20
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,876
You know,
it's okay to talk about it, Piper.

21
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,503
It won't hurt you.
It could even help.

22
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,921
Talk about what?

23
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,176
Gideon's gone, Chris and Wyatt
are safe. It all worked out.

24
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,845
Oh, coffee, coffee, coffee.

25
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,848
I cannot believe
how late for work I am again.

26
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,141
'Morning to you too.

27
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:43,187
If you could be dressed for the wedding,
when I come back, I'll honk,

28
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,731
and you guys can come
meet me outside, okay?

29
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,316
Wait, what?!

30
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,568
Wait! What wedding?

31
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,153
- Wedding?
- Christy's.

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,365
- Piper, don't tell me you forgot.
- Christy's wedding, that's today?

33
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,452
Well, I can't go. The kids...

34
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,872
Actually, the kids were invited too.
So you can go.

35
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,082
I think it would be good for them.

36
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,962
- I think it'd be good for all of us.
- No, I can't go. The baby...

37
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,841
Needs to be exposed to a germ or two,
get out of the house, you know,

38
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,594
- build up his immune system.
- He's too young.

39
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,847
- He's two months old.
- I know how old he is, thank you.

40
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:23,519
Look, you can't protect them
from the big, bad world forever.

41
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,813
They are going to have
to leave the house at some point.

42
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,566
By the way, how's Leo doing?

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,946
Well, considering who betrayed him,
he's doing as well as can be expected.

44
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,413
I know you're here, Barbas.

45
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,834
You can't keep running from me!

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,546
You're afraid that vanquishing me
won't ease your pain...

47
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:54,091
...because it wasn't a demon,
it was an Elder.

48
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:57,636
Your very mentor
who tried to kill your son.

49
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:01,515
You helped him.
That's why I'm gonna kill you too.

50
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,643
Barbas!

51
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,206
Zola?

52
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,588
- Leo. Good, I've been calling for you.
- What do you mean, where's Barbas?

53
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,340
- Who?
- He's covering up for me.

54
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,552
Oh, you know he is.
You tracked me here.

55
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,222
- What's the matter? You all right?
- One of your greatest fears.

56
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,934
The good guys, the bad guys,
they're all the same now.

57
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:50,606
Hey, that makes him just like Gideon.

58
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,066
Leo, what are you doing?

59
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,820
- Where's Barbas?
- I don't know!

60
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,740
- Tell me!
- I don't know. For God sakes, stop!

61
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,334
Damn. So close!

62
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,783
Hey, have you seen Piper?

63
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,829
- Up in Wyatt's room.
- I'm sorry, sweetie, were you sleeping?

64
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,332
Why start now?

65
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,753
No, I was actually just trying to
take a little break from nanny duties.

66
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,506
You're a doll
to help out like you've been.

67
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,093
I wish I could help you,
but I can't. I have to work.

68
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,137
Tell me what it's like,

69
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,557
out there in the world where
men don't poop or spit on you.

70
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,435
You really do need to get out.

71
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,439
You know, maybe we can
just swap jobs for the day.

72
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,691
- You know, I'll... I'll pay you.
- Yeah?

73
00:05:58,609 --> 00:05:59,943
Don't tempt me.

74
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,530
What, you're miserable too?

75
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,200
No, I wouldn't say miserable.
I don't know,

76
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,495
I can't put my finger on it.
I'm, like, in this rut or something.

77
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,123
You know?
I just feel really disconnected.

78
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,833
Yeah, I agree.

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,295
You agree?
What do you know about my ruts?

80
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,256
Well, I know you
gave some great advice to

81
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,800
Lost in Los Altos
about finding new love.

82
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:28,055
But you gave the same advice
to Dumped in Daly last year.

83
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,307
What? Shut up, I did not!

84
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,392
Are you kidding?

85
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,855
Oh, my God, I did.

86
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:43,612
Maybe I should stop giving
advice to people on finding love

87
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,323
until I can figure out
how to find it myself.

88
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,660
- You'll find it. You foresaw it.
- That was one big tease.

89
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,912
- That's what's messing me up.
- No.

90
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,248
I think what's
messing you up is Gideon.

91
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,625
It's the thing that's
messing us all up.

92
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,419
He didn't just betray Leo.
He betrayed all of us.

93
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,714
And those wounds don't heal easily.

94
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,262
Forgive the intrusion.

95
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,849
- I thought it best I come to you first.
- We're not interested.

96
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,435
I think you'll be interested in this.
Leo just tried to kill me.

97
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,690
I didn't want other Elders to find out.
They'd think he was after us all.

98
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,066
Can hardly blame him.

99
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,570
Lack of faith's understandable
given what Gideon's done.

100
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,989
But one bad Elder
doesn't make us all bad.

101
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,449
- We are on the same side here.
- Are we?

102
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,536
Leo didn't really want to kill me,
I know that.

103
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,289
If he had, there'd
have been no redeeming him.

104
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,126
- He would've had to have been recycled.
- Recycled like plastic?

105
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,672
No, I mean sent back, reborn.
To start the cycle of life over again.

106
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,843
We don't wanna punish him
for killing Gideon,

107
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,555
but we can't abide his harming
innocents in the name of revenge.

108
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,224
If you don't stop him,
we'll have to.

109
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,644
- From what?
- His obsession with vanquishing Barbas.

110
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,440
It's blinding him to reason,
driving him over the edge.

111
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:05,944
And if he succeeds,
it won't make his sons any safer

112
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,655
or the betrayal any less painful.

113
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,240
It won't heal his heart.

114
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,285
Time is of the essence too.

115
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,995
Not just for his sake.

116
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,040
There's a powerful threat
looming on the horizon,

117
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,626
unlike any we've ever sensed before.

118
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,921
And for that, we'll need
everybody back into the fold,

119
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,964
and soon.

120
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,601
Barbas?

121
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,565
I know you're here.

122
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,442
Show yourself.

123
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,320
Don't let Barbas get away.

124
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,741
Save your son.

125
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:58,413
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Who are you talking to?

126
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,292
Nobody.
How'd you know I was here?

127
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,878
I didn't. Wyatt did.

128
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,589
Must be that orbing thing
you guys share.

129
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,925
He looked up and said, "Da-da."

130
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,343
Really?

131
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:15,848
He misses you. We all do.

132
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,933
I miss him too. I...

133
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,395
Is there anything else on Barbas
besides the main entry?

134
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,689
No. Would you
like to hold your child?

135
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,819
I can't.

136
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,864
Well, you need to, Leo.

137
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,325
Chris didn't die. He's alive.

138
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:37,995
You need to move on.

139
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,874
Not until Barbas is gone
and they're both safe.

140
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,258
Is this absolutely necessary?

141
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:56,013
The wound is deep.
It very easily could've been fatal.

142
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:01,351
I wouldn't recommend going up
against an Elder again, if I were you.

143
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,354
The problem is that
he's the one after me,

144
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,107
and I haven't figured out
how to shake him.

145
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:12,613
In that case, then,
this might all be for naught.

146
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,908
Thank you very much
for your vote of confidence.

147
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,952
Actually, I don't
even know what it is

148
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,998
that I did to offend him,
except for that rug rat incident.

149
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,168
And that all came out okay
in the end, more or less.

150
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,171
And it wasn't even me
that was after them.

151
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,423
But it should be now.

152
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,926
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What was that?

153
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,304
- What was what?
- You didn't see that?

154
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,264
See what?

155
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,351
Go after the baby.

156
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,437
That!

157
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,106
What?

158
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:52,486
He'll be blinded by rage, vulnerable.

159
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,198
You trying to tell me
you didn't hear that?

160
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,370
Maybe we should
look at that wound again.

161
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,914
Oh, for God's sake.

162
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,545
Was a rotten healer, anyway.

163
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,882
Who are you?

164
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,176
Friend or foe?

165
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,888
Neither, but if you want
to stop the Elder,

166
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,849
go after the baby!

167
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,941
Cool.

168
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:34,444
Very, very cool.

169
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,415
- Phoebe, there you are.
- Elise, hi.

170
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:49,042
I'm so sorry I'm late.
It won't happen again.

171
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,419
Of course it will.

172
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:53,672
But if you keep getting
responses like these, who cares?

173
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,925
Look at these e-mails,
all from this morning's column.

174
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,596
- About this morning's column...
- It was brilliant, Phoebe.

175
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,682
I mean it, you make us
look classy when your advice is

176
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,602
- provocative, insightful...
- Plagiarised?

177
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,063
- Don't worry, I stole from myself.
- I don't understand.

178
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,232
Yeah, I don't understand either.

179
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,819
It turns out I gave the exact
same advice to someone last year.

180
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,238
I didn't realise it
until it was too late.

181
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:22,367
So? Big deal.
Columnists recycle stuff all the time.

182
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,621
Yeah, but I don't.
At least, I never used to.

183
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,581
And I just...

184
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:31,752
I don't think I should write anymore
until I figure out why this happened.

185
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,880
- Don't be ridiculous!
- No, I'm not being ridiculous.

186
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:38,300
I'm being honest.
I can't give people recycled advice.

187
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,470
It's... it's just not right.
It's not ethical.

188
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:44,765
- Phoebe, you can't just quit.
- I don't wanna quit.

189
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,935
Elise, I love my job, you know.

190
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,521
I just don't think
that I can do it right now.

191
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,441
Okay. All right.

192
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,151
Take a sabbatical.

193
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,530
Rest, recharge your batteries.
Couple of months enough?

194
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,865
- Can I do that?
- Of course. I'm the boss.

195
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,493
What happens to my column?
Do you pull it?

196
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,079
And watch sales drop?
Are you kidding?

197
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:11,041
No. I'll hire someone
to ghost-write it for you.

198
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,418
Your readers'll
never know you're gone.

199
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:14,670
Wait, what?

200
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:18,090
Phoebe? Sorry, it's your sister.
She says it's important.

201
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:21,343
Go ahead, I'll handle this.
Don't worry about anything.

202
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,011
Rest up!

203
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,352
Hello?

204
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,064
Hey, I think I have
figured out how to save Leo.

205
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:37,109
If we can keep him
from going after Barbas,

206
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,236
then we can go after him ourselves.

207
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:40,988
- Wait, what?
- It's perfect.

208
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,199
All we do is guilt Leo
into taking Piper to the wedding.

209
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,119
- She doesn't wanna go.
- That's why I'll volunteer

210
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:51,081
to take the kids. That way, Piper
won't have any excuse not to go.

211
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:55,085
While you're at the wedding, I'll be
at the Book trying to find Barbas.

212
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:58,088
If we find him, how are we
gonna vanquish him without

213
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:01,091
- my powers and Piper's?
- You can still cast spells.

214
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,719
- Paige.
- I'm telling you, this could work.

215
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,304
Not only could it save Leo,

216
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,807
it can get him and Piper
back together, at a wedding no less.

217
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,393
Think about it,
it could reignite sparks.

218
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,478
You know, do it for the children.

219
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,148
- Hell, do it for me.
- I don't know about this.

220
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,859
Do you want to
get out of that rut or don't you?

221
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:23,864
We have come together
on this glorious day

222
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,783
to wed Christy and Jeevan,

223
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,580
who are here to build a foundation
of their marriage upon the earth,

224
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:36,210
in the presence of a sacred fire
and among their family and friends.

225
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,758
We are so late.
Has the ceremony started?

226
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,259
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, no.

227
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,512
- Okay.
- I told you to go ahead and go.

228
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:50,098
I don't understand why you
couldn't leave the baby with Paige.

229
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,559
When you're a mother,
you'll understand.

230
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,312
That's assuming
I'm gonna have any eggs left.

231
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,606
- How do you do this thing?
- Here.

232
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,528
It's so nice to have
a man around the house.

233
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,531
Yeah, except I think
I should still be after Barbas.

234
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:09,409
Yeah, not until you can distinguish
between a demon and an Elder.

235
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,786
You're stuck with us.

236
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,747
- Paige? Hi...
- What are you doing?

237
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,999
- Give me that!
- What do you mean?

238
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,794
- I'm checking on Wyatt.
- You just checked.

239
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,171
Have you thought
about seeing a shrink?

240
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:22,923
Yeah, we did that.

241
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:28,846
Look, I know you haven't been out
of the house in a very, very long time,

242
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:32,099
but this is Christy's wedding,
so please try to have fun.

243
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,642
This a wedding or an orgy?

244
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,729
It's a Hindu ceremony. It's supposed
to be very, very, very romantic.

245
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,566
See, I knew this'd happen.

246
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,485
This is over-stimulation.
We gotta get outta here.

247
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,070
Hey, excuse me.

248
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,030
- Wait!
- No, no, no. No, no.

249
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,366
You guys go. I'll take care of Chris.

250
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,785
Okay? You guys go in
and have a good time.

251
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,163
Have fun.
Remember what that is, fun?

252
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:55,831
Come on.

253
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,084
Diaper bag.

254
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,460
Thank you.

255
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:18,896
You're okay.

256
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,939
You're okay, Chris. You're okay.

257
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,026
Chris, huh? Interesting name.

258
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:28,071
Same as the guy who died in your house
a couple of months ago, isn't it?

259
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:31,742
- Are you following me?
- Yes, I am.

260
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:34,870
I would've approached sooner,
but Lieutenant Morris

261
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,623
thought you might need
time to mourn your loss.

262
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,626
He's protective of you.
Seems to know you real well,

263
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,378
which is why I asked him
to be my partner on this.

264
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,547
You know,
you and your sisters

265
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,258
don't seem to be
getting out much lately.

266
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:52,429
Why is that, I wonder?
You're not hiding from me, are you?

267
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,598
- We've got nothing to hide.
- Good.

268
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:58,685
Then you'll have no objections
coming downtown to answer questions.

269
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:03,023
- You've just been served.
- Questions about what?

270
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,776
About what really happened to...

271
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,487
...the other Chris.

272
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:13,575
How he mysteriously broke out of jail,
how he doesn't appear in any database,

273
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:17,246
how come you didn't have a funeral,
what happened to his body.

274
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,998
You know, just stuff like that.

275
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,876
Four o'clock. Don't be late.

276
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,758
You know, I can almost
understand you not helping us.

277
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:30,968
But to help her?

278
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:36,765
It's not like that, I swear.
I don't wanna be in the middle of this.

279
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,101
But she knows I know something.

280
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,645
She knows we got history.

281
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:45,023
You think if she exposes us,
she's not gonna bust you too?

282
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,360
Coming, Lieutenant?

283
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:51,280
You're gonna have
to choose a side, Darryl.

284
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,990
It's just the way it works.

285
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,927
And now, as the circle is the symbol

286
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,681
of the earth
and the sun and the universe,

287
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:21,226
I call the goddess and god
that created all things

288
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:26,607
to bless this sacred union
and to consecrate upon them that...

289
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,026
- Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- Yeah.

290
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,987
...the motivating force
behind the divine...

291
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:36,158
- I don't think anybody else can.
- The power of divine desire, forever.

292
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,368
The power of love.

293
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,585
You okay?

294
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:49,963
I don't know.
I feel a little woozy.

295
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,512
Piper!

296
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:14,947
Hey, is the wedding over already?

297
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,787
Oh, my God!

298
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,330
Let's get outta here.

299
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,712
I don't understand.
How could this have happened?

300
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,006
Beats the hell out of me.

301
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,560
Isn't she beautiful?

302
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:57,489
- I can't believe what I am seeing.
- Tell me about it.

303
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,450
When was the last time
you saw Piper grab Leo's ass?

304
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:04,454
That's not what I'm talking about.
We need to do something, quickly!

305
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,582
Hello?

306
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:08,542
Phoebe, it's for you.

307
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:12,296
Okay, Book of Shadows,
Hindu spirits.

308
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,843
- Hello.
- Is this a bad time?

309
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:22,055
Actually, Elise, yeah.
I'm kind of up to my elbows in stuff.

310
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,349
I just wanted
to give you the good news.

311
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:28,103
The ghost-writer I was hoping
to hire's in town and wants to do it!

312
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,980
- Isn't that terrific?
- What?

313
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:33,108
Better yet, Leslie can start
with tomorrow's column.

314
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,318
Who's Leslie?

315
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:38,113
- Don't you think I should have a say?
- How soon could you get here?

316
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,824
'Cause I'd like you to meet
as soon as possible.

317
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,951
Yeah, no, now's not a good time.

318
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,996
Okay, then how about in an hour?
We'll see you then.

319
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:48,957
She can hardly wait to meet you.

320
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,876
Well, likewise.

321
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:55,172
She hung up on me!
I cannot believe she hung up on me.

322
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:04,056
Okay, I'll just
leave you two to go at it.

323
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,773
Bright side?

324
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,276
We know that Piper and Leo
still have the hots for each other.

325
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:19,738
Be careful with that whole
"hots" thing. It's contagious.

326
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,323
Don't stand too close.

327
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,827
It comes courtesy of Shakti,
the Hindu goddess of creation,

328
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,454
and Shiva, her lover,
the god of destruction.

329
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:31,124
Yeah, but why did this happen
to Piper and Leo? Any ideas?

330
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,544
Why does anything
happen to any of us?

331
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,295
Good point.

332
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,465
"Shakti and Shiva
are invoked at weddings.

333
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,843
They're considered
the ultimate lovers."

334
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,928
It's meant to be symbolic.

335
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,597
Unless there are
magical lovers to hijack?

336
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:47,474
Read on.

337
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:51,979
"Shakti, also the ultimate mother,
and Shiva together created all things.

338
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:55,899
If they consummate their love again,
all things'll be obliterated,

339
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:58,610
and the Universe will be reborn."

340
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,946
Talk about your big bang theory.

341
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:06,910
All right, stop it!

342
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,705
You two, stop it right now!
Stop it, stop it!

343
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:11,832
You go over there,
you over here.

344
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:15,961
- And keep your hands to yourself!
- But you're interrupting us.

345
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:19,381
- And saving life as we know it.
- What are you talking about?

346
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:22,593
Look at your outfit.
That something you normally wear?

347
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,886
- No.
- Exactly.

348
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:27,222
This is not the first time
we've been hijacked by gods,

349
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,017
- so you have to fight it.
- I don't wanna fight it.

350
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:32,186
I haven't felt this potent in years.

351
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:37,441
Over-sharing. Any idea
how to redirect his potency?

352
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:39,818
Yeah, we should
send him after Barbas.

353
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,446
- Barbas?
- What about the risk to the Elders?

354
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:46,116
The risk to the universe is greater.
I made a vanquishing potion.

355
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,327
- I'll get it.
- I won't need it.

356
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:52,289
- I'll be back.
- I'll be waiting.

357
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:58,420
- Wow, is that hot or what?
- Or what?

358
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:02,424
I'm gonna go to Magic School and
try to find a spell to dispossess them.

359
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,801
Take the babies.
They'll be safer there.

360
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,429
No! The baby stays with me.

361
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,932
- Okay.
- Where are you going?

362
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:14,394
I have to go to, you know... work.

363
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:26,698
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen, gentlemen! Please!

364
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:30,452
One at a time, if you please.

365
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,496
I'm failing to see the problem.

366
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:35,249
You asked for help,
said we'd share the spoils.

367
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,335
Then you tell us you're
going after the Charmed Ones.

368
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:41,046
Do you take us for fools?
That's suicide!

369
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:43,966
No, we're not going after
the Charmed Ones per se,

370
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,843
just their little baby.

371
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,095
Baby?

372
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:52,975
Okay, it's obvious that you have
failed to grasp the bigger picture here.

373
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:56,228
So I will explain it for you again.

374
00:23:56,395 --> 00:24:00,399
For the umpteenth time.

375
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,609
Okay.

376
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,319
In going after the child,

377
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:08,866
we are in effect pouring salt into the
still festering wounds of the father,

378
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,702
who happens to be an Elder.

379
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:14,955
- The Charmed Ones' Elder.
- So?

380
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:16,665
So...

381
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:19,585
...his parental instinct kicks in.

382
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:23,005
His vengeful little heart
fills with rage,

383
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:26,967
and with just this tiniest
little nudge from me,

384
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:31,180
he makes a mistake,
a fatal mistake.

385
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,599
Leaving the witches unprotected by him.

386
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:37,853
Exactly. And leaving you
with the best chances

387
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,690
at knocking them off
anybody's had in years.

388
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:46,987
Almost sounds too good
to be true, doesn't it?

389
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:51,325
What about that creature you told
us about? How does he fit into all this?

390
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:53,869
See, that's a very good question.

391
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:56,079
One I don't have the answer to.

392
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:59,875
But he did cloak this lair
so Leo couldn't track me.

393
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:05,380
That makes him a friend,
a very powerful friend.

394
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,194
What's going on?

395
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,363
Oh, hi, Paige.

396
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,657
We're packing up,
closing the school.

397
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:35,786
- What? Since when?
- Since Gideon died.

398
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,872
Look, love him or hate him,
he started this school.

399
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,708
Without him,
there's no one left to fight for it.

400
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,086
I'll fight for it.

401
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:47,673
Against the Elders?
You don't stand a chance.

402
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:53,220
Gideon was the only one that could
convince them he could keep it safe from

403
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:57,474
- demons discovering us, or mortals.
- What about the next generation?

404
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:00,477
Where are they gonna learn
what needs to be learned?

405
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:02,020
I don't know.

406
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:07,901
- Is the nursery still open?
- Yeah, another week or so.

407
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:10,487
Stop packing books.
I'm gonna need 'em.

408
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:13,574
Come on, baby.

409
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:15,951
Elise!

410
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,453
Good, you're here.
Come and meet your new...

411
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,998
So we're clear.
If I don't like this person,

412
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:23,417
- we can find someone else?
- Absolutely.

413
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,086
It's your column.
You gotta be happy with him.

414
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:29,339
Him? Wha...? I'm sorry, him?

415
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,467
I... I better call you back.

416
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:36,597
Hi. I hope it's okay.
I just wanted to get started.

417
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,892
- Leslie?
- Surprise.

418
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:41,476
Expecting a girl?

419
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,270
- Well...
- So were my folks.

420
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:45,898
That's how I got the name.
You can call me Les.

421
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,568
Now, before you say no,
just hear me out.

422
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:53,113
He had his own advice column
in Philly, and it was totally hip,

423
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,201
- very hot, a perfect match for yours.
- Hot, huh? Wow.

424
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,621
Not again.

425
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,165
He's relocating to LA
in a couple of months,

426
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,959
which works out for
how long you wanna be away.

427
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:10,088
That's great Elise, but...
he's a... a man.

428
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:14,718
- Is that a problem?
- Well, most of my readers are women.

429
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:17,638
And you don't think a man
can give advice to women.

430
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,224
No, actually, not as well
as a woman can, no.

431
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,226
Well, what about Dr Phil?

432
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:25,020
Dr Phil is a doctor, right? Dr Phil.

433
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:27,898
So a man can give advice
to a woman if he's a doctor?

434
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:31,401
- That's not what I meant.
- That's what it sounded like.

435
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:34,821
- Are you feeling all right?
- Me? Yeah!

436
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,866
Yes, I'm feeling all right,
I'm great. You kidding?

437
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:41,370
- 'Cause you don't look like you do.
- You're a doctor now too?

438
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:43,872
Actually, I am... of psychology.

439
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,542
I wrote my doctorate
on women's intuition.

440
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:50,045
- I aced it.
- I bet you did.

441
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:54,216
Phoebe!

442
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:10,440
I guess that means I got the job.

443
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,572
Okay.

444
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:50,397
No!

445
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:04,995
Oh, no, it's okay, peanut.
You're okay.

446
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,015
A doctor.

447
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:28,977
Doctor, my ass! I'd like to
actually see proof that he's a doctor!

448
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:31,647
- What are you muttering about?
- Elise!

449
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,899
She hired a man.
Can you believe that?

450
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:37,277
- I don't know what she was thinking.
- Hired a man for what?

451
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,238
My job, that's what.

452
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,698
It might be
the worst idea I've ever had.

453
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:44,284
- Don't know what I was thinking.
- You quit?

454
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,453
No, I'm just taking a sabbatical.

455
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,706
I was taking a sabbatical.
I'm clearly not any more.

456
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:53,085
Well, don't look at me like that.
You said I was in a rut.

457
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:56,213
You'll never guess
what happened while we were gone.

458
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,465
I mean, it's just the most ridiculous...

459
00:29:58,632 --> 00:30:01,635
Have you even ever heard
of a male advice columnist?

460
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,805
- I mean, I haven't.
- Try to guess. You won't be able to.

461
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:08,267
I don't care what the Book says
about the divine horniness

462
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,395
only being rubbed off
if you're attracted to someone

463
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:14,022
because there's no way
I'm attracted to him!

464
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:17,276
God. I hope he's not
the one from my vision.

465
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:21,029
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- Barbas tried to kidnap baby Chris.

466
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:22,906
Paige, that is not funny.

467
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:26,493
I'm not trying to be funny. It's true.

468
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,245
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!

469
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:32,040
Piper's putting him to sleep.
He's okay. He didn't get hurt.

470
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:35,711
Thank goodness.
Leo's gonna go ballistic.

471
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:41,258
Yes, and that is precisely why Piper
does not want us to tell him anything.

472
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:46,597
- Tell me what?
- How much she wants you.

473
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:49,391
Piper, she desperately wants you.

474
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:52,728
- Not supposed to tell him that.
- You know me with secrets.

475
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:55,105
I can't keep 'em.
How'd it go with Barbas?

476
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:57,816
- Couldn't track him.
- You couldn't track him,

477
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:00,110
not even with
those powers inside you?

478
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:04,323
I know, strange, isn't it?
So where's Piper? Upstairs?

479
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,422
- What happened?
- You're not gonna like it.

480
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:27,137
You're not even gonna give 'em
a chance to cooperate?

481
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:30,140
- Is that it?
- They had the chance. They didn't show.

482
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:33,352
- We got a warrant.
- Doesn't give us the right to bust in.

483
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,978
I want it to be a surprise.

484
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:40,817
Got something you want to say?

485
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,244
I'm gonna find out who this Chris
really was and what they're hiding.

486
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,831
Now either you're with me...
or you're against me.

487
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:00,170
This is why Piper
didn't want us to tell you.

488
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:03,549
I'm gonna kill him.
Rip the world apart until I find Barbas.

489
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,551
That's what we're worried about.

490
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,303
- Calm down till we know the facts.
- What facts?

491
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,515
- He went after one of my sons, again.
- He didn't get him.

492
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:12,766
It doesn't matter.

493
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,477
Police, freeze! Hands in the air!

494
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:21,608
What the hell is wrong with you?

495
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:24,194
Are you out of your mind?

496
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:29,074
Yeah, I think he is.

497
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,743
I just got the baby to sleep...

498
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:35,455
What happened?

499
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,292
Where's Leo?

500
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:58,979
- Leo.
- Barbas. Where is he?

501
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:01,148
- Barbas?
- How many times do you

502
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:06,653
have to go through all this before you
realise they're all working together?

503
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,822
Leo, don't do this.
You know better.

504
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:12,659
He's after your boy, I'm after your boy,
they're all after your boy.

505
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:16,246
- That's why it's your greatest fear.
- Where is he, damn it!

506
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:20,542
- Listen to me, Leo! Don't do this!
- Kill him. Kill them all!

507
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:35,974
My, my, my, my, my.

508
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:40,312
What have we gone and done now?

509
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:51,532
Thanks.

510
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:53,200
Did you find Leo?

511
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:56,328
- Where's Chris?
- He's with Wyatt in the nursery.

512
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:02,960
- What happened?
- You find a spell to fix us?

513
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,419
- Yeah, but...
- Cast it.

514
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:17,266
We call upon the mortal ways
and Gods who guide but may not stay

515
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:22,020
We seek those of divinity
to separate from and set them free

516
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,073
Are you all right?

517
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:35,909
Piper?

518
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:38,495
Go get Phoebe
and then go get Barbas.

519
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:40,747
We still don't know how to find him.

520
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,168
I wounded him. You should
be able to scry with his blood.

521
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:58,307
I killed another Elder.

522
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:00,809
It's not your fault.
You were tricked.

523
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:02,603
Was I?

524
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,316
What have I become?

525
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:13,322
It's okay. It's okay.

526
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:15,824
Nobody else has to know.

527
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:22,915
Just try to follow the light.

528
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:28,170
I still don't think
this was a good idea.

529
00:35:28,337 --> 00:35:31,173
What did you want us to do,
send her to purgatory?

530
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,259
We had to play it safe.
She's too suspicious already.

531
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:37,262
Okay, but what if she
remembers what really happened?

532
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:39,223
Look to your right.

533
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:42,434
Focus.

534
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:45,479
Get the C-collar and board.

535
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:52,820
Do you remember what
you were doing here, Inspector?

536
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,740
We came to search for something.

537
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:59,243
Do you remember
what happened to you?

538
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:03,747
She slipped. We're doing a lot of
redecorating, and she slipped and fell.

539
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:07,042
Well, do you remember?

540
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:08,502
I...

541
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:11,713
No.

542
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,510
Just take a deep breath.

543
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:17,761
Good.

544
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:21,598
- She remembers the search warrant.
- So? What is she gonna find?

545
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,559
What's going on?

546
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:26,186
Nothing. We have
everything under control.

547
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,939
- What's up?
- We've got some work to do.

548
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:35,028
Hey, why don't you
come on down, show yourself.

549
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:40,826
All I want to do is thank you.
It was such a very good plan.

550
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:44,788
I mean, it worked perfectly.

551
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:47,416
So...

552
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:51,336
How about we
go after the witches now?

553
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:52,963
Works for us.

554
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,799
Well, well, well, well, well,
what do you know?

555
00:36:55,966 --> 00:37:00,596
It really is true.
Just ask and ye shall receive.

556
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:04,474
Of course, this lair
was supposed to be cloaked.

557
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:08,187
Yeah, you should probably ask
your invisible friend about that.

558
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:10,731
Yeah, well, maybe I will.

559
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:15,027
Come to vanquish me, I see.

560
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:17,571
What, again?

561
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:19,615
I have one little question first.

562
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:22,117
Why the baby?
What does that even get you?

563
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:24,870
Oh, the baby, that...
that just gets me to you

564
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:28,874
without the bodyguard.
By the way, how is old Leo anyway?

565
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:31,752
Suffering nicely, I hope.

566
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:38,050
I think we should
check your fears first.

567
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:39,801
How charming.

568
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:44,890
Your greatest fear is that
your nephews won't be safe...

569
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:47,684
...from me. How touching.

570
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:51,188
Of course, such a great fear
paralyses you.

571
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:54,107
I can't believe you forgot about that.

572
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:56,276
Oh, we didn't forget.

573
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,656
We knew our greatest desire
would overcome our greatest fear.

574
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:04,076
And our greatest desire
is to protect our nephews from you.

575
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:08,831
You know I'll be back.

576
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:11,416
Fear always come back!

577
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:16,755
You set me up!

578
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,761
I never get tired of seeing that.

579
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:25,889
I wonder who he was talking to?

580
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:29,059
I don't know,
and I don't wanna know.

581
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,335
Making yourself comfortable, I see.

582
00:38:57,254 --> 00:38:58,922
Sorry.

583
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:03,343
You know, you really don't have to
come in here bright and early any more.

584
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,722
Otherwise,
it's not really a sabbatical.

585
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,515
Yeah, I know.

586
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:13,228
Actually, I'm gonna tell you the truth.

587
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:19,026
After I met you, I wasn't so sure
I wanted to take the time off.

588
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:21,528
Made quite an impression
on you, did I?

589
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,405
No, not really.

590
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:27,201
You kiss all the new employees
their first day on the job, do you?

591
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,494
Yeah, well...

592
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,953
That was...

593
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,998
...you know,
not what you think it was.

594
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:34,625
- Really?
- Yeah.

595
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,877
And what do you think
I think it was?

596
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:39,046
I don't know
what you think it was,

597
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,965
but whatever you think it was,
it actually wasn't.

598
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:47,638
Anyway, I thought I would wait until
this morning and read what you wrote

599
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:50,641
and see if I was still
comfortable with my decision.

600
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:53,227
- And?
- And I liked it.

601
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:56,605
There was some good advice,
considering you're a guy.

602
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:58,815
Well, thanks... I think.

603
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:02,194
Of course, I wouldn't wanna
sully your good name.

604
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:04,112
You'd better not.

605
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:07,616
Good luck.

606
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:10,577
Hey, for whatever it's worth...

607
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:13,789
...you're a pretty damn good kisser.

608
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:17,042
Even though
it didn't mean anything.

609
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:27,177
I'm so tired.
I didn't sleep at all last night.

610
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:29,680
And it's not even because of Barbas.

611
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:31,598
Pray tell.

612
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:35,686
It's the whole Magic School thing.
It's got me really depressed.

613
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:39,147
I don't know why the Elders
are just shutting it down.

614
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:43,318
Well, they can do whatever they want.
That's why they're them.

615
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:46,155
Yeah, well, it's not fair.

616
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:48,782
Well, who's gonna stop them?

617
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,367
I am.

618
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,996
- What?
- Yeah.

619
00:40:54,163 --> 00:40:57,374
Magic's the best thing
that has ever happened to me, right?

620
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,835
I mean, other than you guys.
No offence.

621
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:04,173
But you guys did happen to me at
the same time that magic happened to me.

622
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:06,216
- So if you count it...
- Rambling.

623
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:07,593
Right.

624
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:10,804
Aside from Gideon,
the school is a great thing, right?

625
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:14,558
I think I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna
get back to my magical roots.

626
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:17,102
I think that's a good idea.

627
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:19,146
Any idea how you're gonna do it?

628
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:22,649
Not a clue.

629
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:25,777
Oh, my goodness...

630
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,864
Are you going outside?
With them?

631
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:31,116
Yes, I am.

632
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:34,161
May I go, or do you want to
tease me some more about it?

633
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:37,498
I'd like to tease you more,
but I'll wait till you get back.

634
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:38,957
What changed?

635
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:41,752
Well, sharing a body
with the ultimate mother...

636
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:44,129
- I got a few tips.
- Like what?

637
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:46,715
Like I can't protect them
from everything.

638
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:49,426
Or I'll probably end up
making them neurotic.

639
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:51,803
We don't need
more of those around here.

640
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:56,475
No, so we're just gonna have to
go out and brave the big, bad world.

641
00:41:57,392 --> 00:41:59,478
What about Leo? Is he gonna join?

642
00:41:59,645 --> 00:42:01,688
No, he's still...

643
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,941
...dealing with some stuff.

644
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:17,621
Barbas was right.

645
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:22,918
Killing him doesn't kill
the pain of betrayal.

646
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:27,381
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?

647
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:29,466
What do we want?

648
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:31,385
We want you!
