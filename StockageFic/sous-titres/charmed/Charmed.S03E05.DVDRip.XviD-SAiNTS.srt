0
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,709
Abbey, maybe you should
get Sean another drink.

1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,316
Okay, but that's over the club limit.

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,630
Yeah, it's okay.
I'll get him a cab home.

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,957
- Prue still hasn't called?
- Nope.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,513
Look at that poor guy.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,233
You think she stood him up?

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,710
Not deliberately. I just think that since
we've been back from Pilgrim times

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,871
she's been on a demon bender.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,157
You think? You mean because
that's all she ever talks about?

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,437
Yeah. Well, how are we going to
explain this to him?

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,357
Abbey, you better
make that a double.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,599
I'm going to call Prue.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,398
Well, speaking of a big chill,

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,993
is Leo keeping you warm?

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,789
Nope.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,032
Honey, are you still afraid
that they're watching you?

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,752
Well, what am I supposed to think?

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,914
The last two times they orbed him
out was right in the middle of it.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,232
- So, what does he say?
- He swears they're not watching.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,834
But he's a guy, he'll say anything.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,070
The point is that
I think they're watching,

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,630
and when I think, I can't... I can't...
I can't concentrate.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,718
Well, at least you have the option
to concentrate.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,597
If Cole and I continue
this flirting tango thing,

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,069
I'm gonna have to start
concentrating on myself.

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,559
- Hello.
- Prue.

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,512
Hey, where are you?

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,875
Hey, on my way home from work.
You will never guess

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,871
what I found on the Internet.
Remember Micah?

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,873
The 17th-century hottie?
That's hard to forget.

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,759
Okay, enough about the past,
tell her about the present.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,869
I traced his ancestors and found an
entire history of the village we visited.

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,548
I figure it might give us a clue

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,915
to the identity of the demon
the Triad sent to kill us.

34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,435
Prue, honey, aren't you
forgetting something?

35
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,279
My photo shoot's not till tomorrow.

36
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,158
No, I mean something else.

37
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,993
Like your date?

38
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,670
Oh, oh, Sean, oh.

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,832
All right, just give him a drink.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,798
If we give him any more, we'll have
to send him to an AA meeting.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,754
- How long has he been there?
- About an hour and 327 peanuts.

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,678
All right, so, what do I do?

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,035
Remorse is good,
and attendance is better.

44
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,952
Piper, I'm halfway across town.

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,078
Besides, I gotta go home
and look up all this demon stuff.

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,879
- Well, can't it wait?
- What, you think the Triad will?

47
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,076
We have to get them
before they get us.

48
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,879
Just tell him I got hung up at work
and that I'll make it up to him.

49
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,439
Alrighty then.

50
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,354
- Is she okay?
- I guess.

51
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,357
Sean, hi. There's been a slight glitch.

52
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,273
Sometimes my sister gets hung up
at work and she sort of has

53
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,271
- a one-track mind.
- It's not a problem.

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,750
I understand.
Tell her just to give me a call.

55
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,358
Not a problem. He took that well.

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,748
He's had three drinks.

57
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,356
So when does one-track spill over
into total obsession?

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,637
When you start forgetting
about guys like Sean.

59
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,468
Here, sweetie.

60
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,153
Are you feeling any better?

61
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,550
Yeah, I think I was more stunned
than hurt, you know.

62
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,039
It just happened so fast.

63
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,474
It's eerie knowing that somebody

64
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,073
went through every room
in the house

65
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,277
smashing mirrors,
touching who knows what.

66
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,833
Fondling who knows what.

67
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,792
It's just so creepy.

68
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,678
At least nothing
seems to be missing.

69
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,239
How do you know
it wasn't a demon?

70
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,238
Demons don't usually fondle.

71
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,392
And besides, the only demon that we
know who used mirrors was Kali

72
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,039
and we vanquished her sorry ass.

73
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,270
Yeah, by smashing
her reflection in a mirror.

74
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,476
I mean, I know that she's
supposed to be dead,

75
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,755
but so were the Grimlocks.

76
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,354
- Please don't remind me about them.
- Did you find anything?

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,034
Just a bunch of fingerprints.
They don't match your samples.

78
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,430
I'll run it through the computer,
see if any names pop up.

79
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,359
They won't. I mean, hello, guys.

80
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,034
Book of Shadows 101, mirrors.

81
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,191
The portals through which
evil enters.

82
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,588
But there are fingerprints

83
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,830
and demons don't even
usually have fingers.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,753
On the human side of things, I need
you to put together a grudge list

85
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,150
of any enemies that you have,
past or present.

86
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,588
Already done.

87
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,320
Let's see, Abraxas, Barbas, Yama.

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,311
What did you do,
date the United Nations?

89
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,631
It's the demons, warlocks
and various evil forces

90
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,313
that we've faced
in the last two years.

91
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,993
That's not exactly what I meant.

92
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,636
Okay, I'm gonna go hit
the Book of Shadows

93
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,553
and see if I can find anything
about mirrors.

94
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,078
Prue's been a little fixated lately.

95
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,992
Do you think it was
a human bad guy?

96
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,273
Any other house, yeah.
Around here, you never know.

97
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,033
Piper. Phoebe.

98
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,715
What? What is it?

99
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,314
That door was unlocked.

100
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,708
So?

101
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,474
Ever since a demon tried to steal
the Book of Shadows

102
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,995
a couple weeks ago,
I've been locking it.

103
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,230
You lock this door,
but you don't lock the front door.

104
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,879
I lock the front door.

105
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,871
- Me too. Mostly.
- I don't, why bother?

106
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,871
Because you're three young women.

107
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,793
In fact, your whole attitude
about security baffles me.

108
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,872
You have no alarm system,
no dead bolts, no dog.

109
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,349
Darryl, we're three witches.
I think we can handle it.

110
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,793
It wasn't jimmied.

111
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,952
So, what, you think we're dealing
with a lock-picking demon, Prue?

112
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,918
It doesn't look like anything
is missing from up here either.

113
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,231
I just think it's ludicrous to rule out
that a human could have done this.

114
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,712
Yes, well, I think it's ludicrous to think
that the Triad has nothing to do with it.

115
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,749
Darryl, why don't you go
check on those fingerprints.

116
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,990
We need to have
a little conference here.

117
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,596
- Okay. Good night.
- Night.

118
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,073
Leo.

119
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,196
Prue, maybe a little
perspective here for a second.

120
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,192
Leo.

121
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,312
What? What is it?
What is the problem?

122
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,472
I need to know everything
that you know about the Triad.

123
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,198
You what?

124
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,952
- Hi.
- Hi.

125
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,039
Okay, well, this really can't wait.

126
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,509
The Triad sent somebody
back in time

127
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,398
and nearly wiped out our entire line.

128
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,238
I'm willing to bet it's the same demon

129
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,992
we found up here
a couple weeks ago.

130
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,549
If you don't wanna take that
seriously, that's your business.

131
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,597
Me, I'm on a mission.

132
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,152
We really need to get her laid, huh?

133
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,673
Hi.

134
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,435
I think I'm gonna go see
what Prue is up to.

135
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,192
So?

136
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,838
We grow impatient, Belthazor.

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,434
We did not expect it to take this long.

138
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,831
You had two years by their time,
without success. I've had a month.

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,878
A month with two years'
worth of information.

140
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,112
Information collected by
the blood of demons before you.

141
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,350
The young one, Phoebe,
is almost within my grasp.

142
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,398
That's not why we summoned you.
We're assigning another.

143
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,678
You're replacing me?

144
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,709
We had a bargain. I get the
Charmed Ones, you give me back...

145
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,111
The bargain is in your best interests,
not ours.

146
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,916
Don't look at it as replacement,
Belthazor. Look at it as assistance.

147
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,478
However, if either of you should
be caught, the same maxims apply.

148
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,552
We can't risk either of you
leading the Charmed Ones to us.

149
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,393
- May I know who you're sending?
- Sent, you mean.

150
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,148
Troxa has already started.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,468
- Leo?
- Piper.

152
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,155
- We can't.
- Yes, we can.

153
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,629
No, I can't.

154
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,189
I feel like I'm being watched.

155
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,797
- Piper, we have to get past this.
- Yeah.

156
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,832
Okay. How about you tell them
to look the other way?

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,115
They're not looking.

158
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,350
How many times do we
have to have this conversation?

159
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,875
Well, how do you know?
How can you be sure?

160
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,758
Because I told you,
that's not what they do.

161
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,993
Okay, then how do you explain
the last two times? Count them, two.

162
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,079
Sheer coincidence, I'm telling you.
Now, come on, Piper.

163
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,595
We need to get past this.

164
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,832
Yeah, and I need to feel
like it's just you and me,

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,309
and not the whole universe watching.

166
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,671
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

167
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,196
I guess I better go find Prue
some answers.

168
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,428
Yeah.

169
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,837
Cole, what are you doing here?

170
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,117
- Are you all right? I just heard.
- Heard what?

171
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,388
About what happened, the break-in.

172
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,710
You guys okay?

173
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,513
You came all the way over here
for me? I mean, for we?

174
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,514
- For us?
- Did you get a look at who it was?

175
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,438
No.

176
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,676
I'm gonna make a call,
get a patrol car to watch the place.

177
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,070
That's all right. Actually,
I think that we can handle it.

178
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,711
No, you can't. You have no idea what
kind of evil you're dealing with here.

179
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,668
Yes, well, we were actually just
discussing that, weren't we, Prue?

180
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,400
Do you want anything, Cole? Do you
want some coffee or something?

181
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,757
Phoebe, that's not really a good idea.
We have something very important

182
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,070
that we have to discuss.

183
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,551
That's all right. I really should
get going anyway.

184
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,508
It's late. l... Call me anytime.

185
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,353
Yeah, I will. Thanks.

186
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,352
Okay, this better be good.

187
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,670
Yeah, well, I was up in the attic,
and when I woke up,

188
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,479
there was a pillow hovering above
my face about to smother me.

189
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,196
- A pillow?
- Hovering.

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,276
Well, that must be the infamous
pillow-smothering demon.

191
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,550
- Maybe it was a nightmare.
- It wasn't a nightmare

192
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,349
and it certainly wasn't a joke.
There is a demon after me or us.

193
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,033
I know it.

194
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,918
Okay.

195
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,913
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

196
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,430
What do you think the Triad
will say when I tell them

197
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,079
you saved the witches?

198
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,073
That I didn't want you
to get them first.

199
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,111
You had your chances, Belthazor.
Don't screw up mine again.

200
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,556
I strike tomorrow night.
You better not be there.

201
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,598
You don't scare me, Troxa.
You never did.

202
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,991
And you don't know
how to defeat me, Belthazor.

203
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,673
You never could.

204
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,873
After all...

205
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,510
...you can't fight
what you can't see.

206
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,198
Give me a hit of that. Actually, no,
just pour it down my throat.

207
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,396
- You didn't sleep either?
- Not a wink.

208
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,113
Thank God for makeup.

209
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,635
Hey, maybe we should
get an alarm system.

210
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,360
Hey, Pheebs, did you borrow
Gram's necklace again?

211
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,154
- No.
- Are you sure?

212
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,197
Yeah, I'm positive, why?

213
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,271
What about my good-luck blouse,
have you seen it?

214
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,238
The fuchsia paisley one?

215
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,630
- Is there anything else missing?
- Not that I know of.

216
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,074
Prue, this is important.

217
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,151
Maybe the guy that broke
into the house took them.

218
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,470
Yeah, or maybe it was a demon

219
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,712
who took them for some weird
ritualistic ceremony.

220
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,395
Now, would that be the
pillow-smothering demon,

221
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,518
or the lock-picking demon?

222
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,713
They called me away on something
else, Piper, it was a total coincidence.

223
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,077
They don't know much about the Triad.
They don't even know what it really is.

224
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,196
Six thousand years of conflict,
and that's it?

225
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,237
These guys are
serious underachievers.

226
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,389
They do know, though,

227
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,710
the Triad is at the highest level
of the other side.

228
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,952
- Okay, that's a biggie.
- That's why we need to get to them

229
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,190
before they get to us.

230
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,113
- What is this?
- A way to always be prepared.

231
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,555
These are very big contraceptives,
Prue.

232
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,153
They are sneakers, all right?

233
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,878
We're always wearing inappropriate
footwear when demons attack.

234
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,112
Now we will be prepared.
Keep them with you at all times.

235
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,555
I'm gonna be so fast in these.

236
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,473
- Hi.
- Hi.

237
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,029
We're making progress. The same
set of fingerprints were found

238
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,031
- on all the broken mirrors.
- Whose are they?

239
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,236
Unfortunately, the FBI computer
came up with a blank.

240
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,470
This means the perp
had no criminal record.

241
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,870
So, what does that mean,
it's some weird, crazy person?

242
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,271
I can't say. I don't have enough to
go on. I mean, we got broken mirrors,

243
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,795
- and nothing's missing.
- Actually, there is stuff missing.

244
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,713
Our grandmother's necklace
and Prue's favourite shirt.

245
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,518
It's funny that's the only thing
he took.

246
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,353
You know, there's another
possibility. Could be a stalker.

247
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,239
- A stalker?
- Who would want to stalk us?

248
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,994
Could be anybody. I need you to
get a human grudge list together.

249
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,948
Old classmates, people you work
with or for, old boyfriends.

250
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,793
- Hey, what about Sean?
- A guy that I stood up once?

251
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,394
- I don't think so.
- The smallest things

252
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,028
- could set these guys off.
- All right, if it's a stalker,

253
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,553
it's a demonic stalker.

254
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,435
In any case, I'm going to
check out this Sean guy.

255
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,591
I need that grudge list ASAP.

256
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,911
Stalkers will do anything to obtain
the object of their desire.

257
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,073
- You could be in real danger, Prue.
- Thanks.

258
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,912
Bye.

259
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,198
You need to listen to him, Prue.

260
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,432
Why? No one listens to me.
Here, I gotta go.

261
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,114
If the demon doesn't kill me,
my editor will.

262
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,719
- Excuse me, your mail, Mr. Jones.
- Great, thank you very much.

263
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,348
- The Lewis family, all right?
- Yeah, I will.

264
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,999
Hey.

265
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,759
I did some research, Troxa.

266
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,109
I found your Achilles' heel.
Cold is very revealing for you.

267
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,838
All the worse because

268
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,833
since you can't feel,
you don't even know when it's cold.

269
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,148
First them, then you.

270
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,110
Just do what you normally do
on your TV show, okay?

271
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,350
Just pretend that I'm the audience.

272
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,556
Okay, right, Jillaroo.

273
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,592
Now, the Australian black snake
won't just run out of the bush

274
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,151
and strike at you for no good reason.
They strike as a defence mechanism.

275
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,278
That's the only way they can protect
themselves. Now, you may wonder

276
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,477
how we entice this little beaut
out of the wild to join us today.

277
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,719
Over here. The only humane way
to capture a snake

278
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,791
is to use a snake trap.

279
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,599
You lure them in
with a ripping snake snack.

280
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,593
Like a tiny Mickey Mouse or a
froggie.

281
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,150
What did you say the cage
was used for again?

282
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,596
Trapping snakes, or any other
varmints you might wanna get rid of.

283
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,072
- Really?
- Yeah.

284
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,837
Go on, beaut.

285
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,312
- Hey, Abbey. Abbey, hi.
- Hi.

286
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,596
- Have you seen Cole?
- Who?

287
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,833
Tall, dark, good-Iooking
district attorney. Okay, no good.

288
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,837
How about an easy one.
Where's Piper?

289
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,072
- She's in back in the office.
- Okay, thanks.

290
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,474
I should have knocked. I'm sorry.

291
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,279
It's okay. I can't do it anyway.

292
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,074
I am so sorry to hear that.

293
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,399
- I guess I'd better go.
- Yeah.

294
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,550
I'm so tired of living
under this scrutiny.

295
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,629
I told you I didn't see anything.

296
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,995
- Not you, them.
- I know.

297
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,799
I thought doing it somewhere else
would take the pressure off.

298
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,396
I'm bummed for you, Piper.
I really am, but I gotta tell you

299
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,516
Leo is looking fine.

300
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,195
- I thought you didn't see anything.
- Nothing good.

301
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,079
Okay, here is my stalker list.

302
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,390
It's mostly guys that I knew
when I was in New York.

303
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,954
You were busy in New York.

304
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,114
Yeah. So now that we have mine
and yours, all we need is...

305
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,951
- You look different.
- Relaxed.

306
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,350
- What happened?
- I'm just not as worried about

307
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,829
demons as much anymore.
Have you guys seen Sean around?

308
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,275
No, I haven't.

309
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,431
But how do you know
he's not your stalker?

310
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,431
- Don't be ridiculous.
- What happened to

311
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,717
- "There's a demon on my ass" Prue?
- Well, I set a trap.

312
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,519
A trap?

313
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,319
We are going to catch this demon
and instead of vanquishing him

314
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,994
like we normally do,
we'll make him talk about the Triad.

315
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,755
So is this like a bear trap
with big claws?

316
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,709
I cast a spell over
a series of siderite crystals,

317
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,758
sort of creating a power grid,
with the Book of Shadows as the bait.

318
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,672
And how does that work?

319
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,876
Well, the minute the demon steps
into the grid,

320
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,600
this glows and he's zapped.

321
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,638
So whatever it is, is electrocuted.

322
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,633
- Well, yeah, whatever demon.
- And what about

323
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,076
human or feline?
You're gonna fry Kit.

324
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,470
Well, Kit can't get in because
I locked the attic door.

325
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,790
So, Prue, you've booby-trapped
our house.

326
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,757
And again, what if it's human?

327
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,319
It's not.

328
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,629
All right, if you guys will excuse me,
I have a life to try and go live.

329
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,157
- This is not good.
- No, and if she keeps this up,

330
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,470
we're gonna have to do
a demon intervention.

331
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,394
- Hi.
- Hey.

332
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,997
Thanks for coming. Abbey, whatever
Sean wants to drink, can you just...?

333
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,594
No, thanks. I've had more
than my share of free drinks.

334
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,997
All right. Well, I guess I deserve that.

335
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,159
Look, Sean...

336
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,074
...there's so much going on in my life
that I can't really explain, but...

337
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,596
...if you're interested,
I'd like to make it up to you.

338
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,320
I'm definitely interested...

339
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,438
...but I just ask that you be honest
with me. The one thing I can't handle

340
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,830
is games. Drives me crazy.

341
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,471
- Psycho, freaky crazy?
- What?

342
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,872
Never mind.

343
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,278
Phoebe.

344
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,877
Anybody home?

345
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,874
- What the hell is that?
- Oh, it worked.

346
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,032
- What worked?
- All right, it worked. It worked.

347
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,430
We caught our demon.
So let's go.

348
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,632
We don't know what kind of demon
this is, so we have to go in attacking.

349
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,030
Piper, you freeze him,
and I will tie him up.

350
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,191
Speaking of freezing,
it's freezing in here.

351
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,874
That's because every window
in the house is open.

352
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,871
- What kind of demon would do that?
- Who cares?

353
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,871
- Everybody got their sneakers on?
- Yeah, yeah.

354
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,598
All right.

355
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,873
- Cole?
- What?

356
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,314
Wait. It could be dangerous.

357
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,311
For God sakes, Prue,
he looks really hurt.

358
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,471
Phoebe, it's a trap for demons,
you do the math.

359
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,712
What are you doing here?

360
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,598
Came by to see how you were doing.

361
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,398
Are you okay?

362
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,154
So how did you get in
and what are you doing up here?

363
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,469
Front door was unlocked. Then when
I saw the windows were open...

364
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,154
You thought that someone
broke into the house again.

365
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,311
Is the third degree over now?

366
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,112
What happened?

367
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,752
What's that?

368
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,313
- It's a trap.
- A what?

369
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,919
Cole, I am so sorry.
Please forgive us.

370
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,230
- I'll take that under advisement.
- Prue just panicked.

371
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,675
- She wasn't thinking straight.
- The hell I wasn't!

372
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,798
Do you know that your trap is the
equivalent of having a loaded shotgun

373
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,315
with a tripwire behind
your front door? That's illegal.

374
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,552
I'm an ADA, an officer of the court.
I could have you arrested.

375
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,472
Somebody turned on
the air conditioning.

376
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,756
Why would they do that?

377
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,111
I'm out of here.

378
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,872
Cole. Cole. I am so sorry.

379
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,554
It's just, we've all been under
so much pressure lately.

380
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,759
I'm just glad it wasn't you
who did this to me.

381
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,995
How could you? How far are you
gonna let this obsession go, Prue?

382
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,037
- Phoebe, listen.
- No, I'm not gonna listen.

383
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,397
You didn't nearly catch a demon,
you nearly killed a district attorney.

384
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,357
My district attorney.

385
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,028
How do you know we didn't
catch a demon?

386
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,839
I mean, think about it, Phoebe.
He is always around

387
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,116
when something is going on.
I mean, look at tonight.

388
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,555
You're right. He's a plant.

389
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,154
Trying to get close to me
so he can kill us.

390
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,509
Now is everyone a demon, Prue?
You are crazy right now.

391
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,673
Prue? You have a lovely package
from Sean, and it looks like flowers.

392
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,274
Pretty nice for a guy
you've blown off twice.

393
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,955
That's disgusting. Look out. Look out.

394
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,114
There's your demon, Prue.
I'm gonna call Morris.

395
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,911
Piper, that doesn't really
make any sense.

396
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,550
I mean, I cannot believe I hurt
that guy that badly.

397
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,030
Darryl said it only takes
a small thing to set them off.

398
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,033
Maybe Phoebe's right, maybe
you're just not seeing the reality.

399
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,033
Piper, my instincts are almost
always right, I have to trust them.

400
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,636
You have to trust them,
and I'm not saying that you shouldn't.

401
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,109
But, Prue, there are other evils
in the world.

402
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,840
And some of them are even human.

403
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,912
- I warned you, Belthazor.
- Hold it. Troxa, cool your jets.

404
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,991
I came to apologize.

405
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,435
Apologize, for what?

406
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,158
Pissing you off, for one thing.

407
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,552
I don't want to be always looking over
my shoulder, waiting for you to strike

408
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,236
for the rest of eternity. You want
the Charmed Ones, they're all yours.

409
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,677
I don't trust you.

410
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,677
Fine, don't.

411
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,479
Just don't blame your failure
on me to the Triad.

412
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,677
By the way, the key to getting them
is in the Book of Shadows.

413
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,717
It's up in the attic.

414
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,831
- Be careful.
- You know what? I don't care.

415
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,197
I'm just so mad at Prue. I mean, it's
one thing to be obsessive, you know,

416
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,396
but it's another thing
to hurt innocent people.

417
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,994
Okay, but she is trying
to look out for us.

418
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,151
There is a Triad demon on the loose.

419
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,073
I understand that, Piper,
but it is not Cole.

420
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,791
Oh, honey, that's sweet, but not
tonight. We all have headaches.

421
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,629
Okay.

422
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,598
But feel free to help us
close some windows.

423
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,996
Tell me everything that you know
about the Triad.

424
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,153
Who they are, what their plans are.
Answer me.

425
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,231
You'll get nothing from me, witch.

426
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,238
I am Troxa.

427
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,756
But I'm not the only agent
the Triad has sent after you.

428
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,231
There is another.

429
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,471
His name is Belthazor!

430
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,958
All right, what the hell happened?

431
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,680
- The Triad.
- Wait, they know where we live now?

432
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,435
No, they'd know where he is, or was.
All that matters is he's gone.

433
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,637
You were right, Prue.
I owe you a big apology.

434
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,756
I'm sorry I doubted you,
but I was worried...

435
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,593
It's all right, let's just...
Let's look him up.

436
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,031
"Troxa, an invisible demon

437
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,749
whose weakness is that his
ectoplasmic biochemistry

438
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,639
is sensitive to cold.
May become partially visible."

439
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,997
Wait a second. So if someone
hadn't turned on the AC,

440
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,196
opened all the windows
and made it freezing in here,

441
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,148
- I never would have seen him. Leo?
- I don't know anything about it at all.

442
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,511
Does that mean we have
another guardian angel?

443
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,353
I hope. What I've heard about
Belthazor, we'll need a lot of help.

444
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,351
- What do you mean?
- Well, he's infamous.

445
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,239
He's a demonic soldier of fortune.

446
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,834
He's one of the most evil,
vile creatures there is.

447
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,189
Wait, that's the demon we saw
try to take the Book of Shadows

448
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,476
- a couple of weeks ago.
- So Troxa's right.

449
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,232
There's somebody else
out there to get us.

450
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,032
Well, at least now we know
who he is.

451
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,510
But we're safe for now. So I'm
gonna take this rare opportunity

452
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,716
to get a good night's sleep.

453
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,119
Well, I'll go see what I can find out
about Belthazor. Enjoy your candy.

454
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,111
- Thank you.
- Sure.

455
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,317
Are you gonna be able
to get some rest now?

456
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,879
No, I am way too wired,

457
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,918
and also my photo assignment
is due tomorrow.

458
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,915
- Cole.
- Right.

459
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,557
Well, you know,
I had to fill in something.

460
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,909
Do you think maybe tomorrow you
could call Cole and apologize to him?

461
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,438
Yeah.

462
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,393
I've gotta meet Marvelous 3
this afternoon.

463
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,552
So I need to get some stuff ready.
Can I drop you off?

464
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,151
- Hello? Anybody home?
- Yeah. I was just thinking,

465
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,790
there are still so many loose ends.
I mean the broken mirrors, the AC,

466
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,713
the open windows, the dead flowers,
the stuff that's missing.

467
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,832
Are you obsessing now?
It's over. We were wrong.

468
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,675
I know, but those aren't demonic
things, they're things that a stalker

469
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,558
might do, like what Morris said.

470
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,950
Well, we told him about Sean,
he'll figure it out.

471
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,997
Yeah. Sean.

472
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,592
Where's our copy of the grudge list
that we made for Morris?

473
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,832
- I left it at the club. Why?
- I just... I want to look it over again.

474
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,389
Okay. Well, let's go.
Is Prue still sleeping?

475
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,790
Her bed is made
and her car is not here.

476
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,912
Well, maybe she took her
pictures to 415.

477
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,550
It's really early. I mean,
is 415 even open yet?

478
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,039
I'm gonna call her.

479
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,711
- Hello?
- It's me. I'm just checking in.

480
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,916
- Where are you?
- I'm in my car.

481
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,190
Hello. Prue, I can barely hear you.

482
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,352
Yeah, I'm fine. Okay, I'll see
you later, honey. Bye.

483
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,191
- She sounds fine.
- Okay.

484
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,350
Okay, let's go.

485
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,397
Bye-bye.

486
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,873
It's just you and me now, Prue.
Your sisters are gone.

487
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,713
- What do you want?
- Oh, Prue.

488
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,872
Isn't it obvious what I want? Huh?

489
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,479
I want to be you.
What? No witty comeback?

490
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,996
No confident "I'm the queen
of the world" retort?

491
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,476
- Abbey.
- No, you're wrong.

492
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,915
Abbey's gone forever.
She's a loser and you're a winner.

493
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,953
And now, I'm gonna be
a winner too.

494
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,190
As soon as I take care of you.

495
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,591
Did you like the dead roses
I sent you?

496
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,435
Did you even know I was the one
who broke into your house?

497
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:12,118
I have to be you. Oh, I love wearing
your clothes. Your things.

498
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,240
Makes me wanna be you even more.

499
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,914
Beautiful, successful.

500
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,398
Loved by men.

501
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,911
I have just as much trouble
with men as anyone.

502
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,355
What, you mean Sean? Oh, please.

503
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,909
He's not good enough for us.

504
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,310
No. No. I can do better...

505
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,393
...without you around.

506
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,594
Now I just have one last question.

507
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,070
Last night, when I was here,
when I was running away from you,

508
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,435
how the hell did you throw me
through that door, huh?

509
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,073
Like this.

510
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,399
- P3.
- Piper? Hey. Hey, where's Prue?

511
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,154
I can't reach her anywhere.
At the manor, on the cell.

512
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,596
That's weird. We just talked to her
on her cell. Why? What's going on?

513
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,637
I got a match off those fingerprints.

514
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,950
- Sean?
- No, no, not Sean.

515
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,839
Abbey, your bartender.
The one off of your list.

516
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,913
What? Abbey? Why would Abbey
want to hurt Prue?

517
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,355
- Abbey's hurt Prue?
- Hold on.

518
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,714
Wait.

519
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,714
Okay, and that's the kind of
perfume Prue wears,

520
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,917
and the cosmetics that she uses.

521
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,438
"October 27, 8:01, Prue leaves
the house, gets into car.

522
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,512
I love the way she walks,
so confident and controlled.

523
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,196
Enters dry-cleaner's smiling, the sun
catches her hair, so beautiful."

524
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,351
Pages and pictures.

525
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,994
- What?
- Abbey killing Prue at the manor.

526
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,674
Hey, over here.

527
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,399
Hey, freak, I'm over here now.

528
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,074
Come out here!

529
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,868
You okay? We're here.

530
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,679
Everything's gonna be okay.

531
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,513
Everything will be great,
as soon as I fire her.

532
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,709
Okay.

533
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,639
Nice.

534
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,268
- Feel better now?
- Yeah, I'm getting there.

535
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,908
All right. Shake it off.

536
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,712
Thanks. Rachel,
can I ask you a question?

537
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,794
- Yeah.
- Are you happy?

538
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,030
- Extremely.
- Boyfriend? Any career goals?

539
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,958
Engaged. I'm only doing this
until I get my masters in education.

540
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,872
Then I'm gonna be a teacher.

541
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,430
- That is just so excellent.
- Thank you.

542
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,192
Thanks.

543
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,469
You know, you can never be too
careful with demons or mortals.

544
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,552
So rumour has it Leo is installing
an alarm system in the house?

545
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,950
Yeah, I know. We're gonna
have to lock the doors

546
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,476
and do all that responsible stuff that
women should do in the big city.

547
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,428
I agree. And we're gonna have
to watch out for Belthazor.

548
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,756
Yes, I agree.

549
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,839
But first, I think you should
kind of watch out for him.

550
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,470
- You don't like him, do you?
- No, I don't...

551
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,834
...really know him. Do you?

552
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,677
No, not as well as I'd like to.

553
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,319
Actually, I think I'm gonna go see
what I can do about that.

554
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,030
Be careful.

555
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,473
Hey.

556
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,477
Why do I get the feeling you're
a high-maintenance kind of gal?

557
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,596
I don't know, maybe because I am.

558
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,912
Dance?

559
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,871
So. Still friends?

560
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,870
I hope we're more than that.

561
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,072
Do you?

562
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,319
Prove it.

563
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,868
You are amazing
when you concentrate.

564
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,634
And stop worrying about them?

565
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,354
I hope you enjoyed the show.
