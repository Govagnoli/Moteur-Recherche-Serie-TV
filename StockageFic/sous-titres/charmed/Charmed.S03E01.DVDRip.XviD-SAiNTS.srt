0
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,473
Oh, God.

1
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,194
Phoebe, I didn't realize
you were home. Are you okay?

2
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,920
- I'm sorry. Are you all right?
- Yes. I'm fine!

3
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,075
- Feeling a little jumpy, are we?
- Well...

4
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,753
Yeah, especially now that we know

5
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,990
the Evil Triad is behind
all those attacks.

6
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,237
Yeah. I don't need a recap.
But what I do need is some heat.

7
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,119
Is it freezing in here?
Did you forget to pay the gas bill?

8
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,632
I thought that you were
supposed to pay the gas bill.

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,513
I was gonna take care of the club,
and you'd take care of the house.

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,631
Remember? When school
started back up for me.

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,712
Oh, right.
I'll call the gas company first thing.

12
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,632
I will be so glad
when Piper gets back.

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,989
What if she doesn't?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,479
That's my fax.

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,868
Doesn't what?

16
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,640
Well, what if she
doesn't come back?

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,559
I mean, what if when her and Leo
orbed out, it was for good?

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,797
- Phoebe, that is ridiculous.
- No, Prue, it's not ridiculous.

19
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,838
Think about it. We have not
heard from her in a month.

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,678
- That's not like her.
- All right, look.

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,832
Piper is not just going to ditch us,
okay? We're her sisters.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,070
And neither is Leo.
He's our whitelighter too.

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,958
Then why hasn't she contacted us?

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,997
She has to know that
we're worried about her.

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,559
She also has to know she's left us

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,358
one sister short
of the power of three.

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,910
So while she's up romping around
in the clouds with Leo,

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,992
we've got our Wiccan butts
flapping around in the wind here.

29
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,754
I mean, we are very lucky, Prue,
that we haven't been attacked yet.

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,990
No, it has absolutely nothing
to do with luck.

31
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,435
The Triad's up to something,
we just don't know what yet.

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,871
That's exactly my point. Piper knows
this. So where the hell is she?

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,559
That's why I've been
studying the book.

34
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,115
Prue, studying the book
is not gonna do it.

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,475
We're screwed without Piper,
and you know this.

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,434
- Why aren't you worried?
- I am worried.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,239
I'm scared that you're right,
that we're never gonna see her again.

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,391
And not because she doesn't
wanna come back,

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,677
but because they won't let her because
she broke one too many rules.

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,477
- Who's calling us at 2 in the morning?
- Probably Darryl.

41
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,191
- Hello?
- Did you get the fax I sent?

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,635
Yeah, I was just about to check it.
Hold on.

43
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,559
- What's going on?
- Darryl's tracking a murder suspect

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,392
who he thinks is in league
with a demon.

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,279
- Based on what?
- Based on the fact that the killer

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,795
carves a demonic symbol
into its victim's forehead,

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,234
an inverted triangle.

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,914
That and the fact that he magically
seems to be evading arrest.

49
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,354
Looks like a rune to me.

50
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,476
Yeah, I saw it in here somewhere.

51
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,951
Darryl, is he still
at the Pier Street rave?

52
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,991
Yeah, but I think he's on the move.

53
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,431
I don't think he's spotted me yet.

54
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,232
He's headed out the back.

55
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,070
- There.
- "An opening by which demons

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,590
known as 'the Guardians'
steal an innocent soul."

57
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,994
- Stay away from him, Darryl.
- And let him kill somebody else?

58
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,876
- I don't think so.
- No, listen to me.

59
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,311
These Guardians protect their mortal
killers in exchange for victims' souls.

60
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,351
You cannot stop him.

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,235
Listen, Prue,
I can take care of myself.

62
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,233
I gotta call you back.
I'm not sure where this guy is.

63
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,034
Darryl?

64
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,277
Darryl?

65
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,117
All right, we're only
three minutes away.

66
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,510
- What do we do once we get there?
- Save Darryl's life.

67
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,035
I mean about the Guardian.
We don't know how to vanquish it.

68
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,113
The book says we kill it just like
you would a vampire, with a stake.

69
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,037
Oh, okay.
Piper, where are you?

70
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,151
Please don't hurt me!

71
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,838
Darryl...

72
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,109
Prue!

73
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,639
He's alive.

74
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,192
I think I found the Guardian.

75
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,713
Okay. Get rid of it.

76
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,920
Wait, didn't the book say
they were just like vampires?

77
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,316
- I might've misread that part.
- I'm sorry?

78
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,638
Okay. The rune. Aim for the rune!

79
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,836
Okay, if Piper ever comes back,
I am going to kill her.

80
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,633
Poor girl.

81
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,598
- Do you feel dizzy at all? Nauseous?
- No.

82
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,597
Trouble focusing? Headache?

83
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,394
I'm telling you, I'm fine.
The only thing wounded is my pride.

84
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,398
- Is he fine?
- Yeah, thanks to you guys.

85
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,873
What do you mean, thanks to us?

86
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,640
Well, you fought off the attacker,
didn't you?

87
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,835
Isn't that what happened?

88
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,672
Yeah, you know, it wasn't really
that big of a deal.

89
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,314
Well, you saved his life.
I think that's a pretty big deal.

90
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,431
You're a lucky man, inspector.

91
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,830
- Take care.
- Thanks.

92
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,395
Okay, can we go now?

93
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,670
No. You have to give
witness statements.

94
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,713
- Darryl...
- Prue, you're witnesses to a crime.

95
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,478
In this case, the only witnesses.

96
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,671
No, Darryl, we can't be witnesses.

97
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,398
We used our powers
to stop the killer.

98
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,120
- What are we supposed to say?
- And he saw us use them too.

99
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,236
Nobody will believe anything
that sleazeball says.

100
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,152
All you have to do
is get your story straight.

101
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,032
You mean get our lies straight.

102
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,470
Phoebe, listen to me.

103
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,438
Without your testimony,
Emilio walks.

104
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,753
What is he smiling at anyway?

105
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,037
It's not like he has his Guardian
demon to protect him any more.

106
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,909
And, unfortunately, our guardian
angel is nowhere to be found.

107
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,231
We could sure use
some cosmic help right now.

108
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,119
What are we supposed to do? We've
never been in this situation before.

109
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,675
You better decide fast.
Here comes the ADA.

110
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,752
Ladies, my name's Cole Turner.

111
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,230
I'm the assistant district attorney
assigned to this case.

112
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,396
I was wondering if either of you
saw what happened?

113
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,518
I did.

114
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,999
We're in good shape except for...

115
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,509
What'd you call the murder weapon?
An "athame"?

116
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,030
Athame. It's a ceremonial knife
used by...

117
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,919
...Iots of different crazy people.

118
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,595
And you're sure you didn't see
who took it?

119
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,397
No. We were there to check up
on Darryl and...

120
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,632
Probably just some lunatic
from the rave. Will it hurt the case?

121
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,593
The PD will try to focus on it,
but this is just an arraignment.

122
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,433
Unless there's something
I don't know about...

123
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,838
...we should have more than enough
for the judge to hold him over for trial.

124
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,280
Don't worry. I'm good at what I do.

125
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,239
All rise.

126
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,192
Court is now in session.

127
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,836
Honourable Judge William Hamilton
now presiding. Please be seated.

128
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,628
I'm nervous.

129
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,519
Oh, you know, witches and trials.
It's that whole Salem thing.

130
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,393
No, I mean about lying.
It just doesn't feel right, Prue.

131
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,830
Would it feel more right
to just let him go?

132
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,233
Case number B-684400.

133
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,039
The State of California
v. Emilio Smith.

134
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,111
One count of murder
in the first degree.

135
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,679
One count attempted murder.

136
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,077
Assistant district attorney
Cole Turner for the State.

137
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,151
Public defender Alan Sloan
for the defence.

138
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,039
How does the defendant plead?

139
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,511
- Not guilty, Your Honour.
- So noted.

140
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,670
Mr. Turner, I've read your brief.
Have anything to add?

141
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,394
No, Your Honour.
The State stands by the arrest report

142
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,993
and the eyewitness testimonies.

143
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,749
- Mr. Sloan?
- Well, it seems to me, Your Honour,

144
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,356
you can't very well hold for a murder
trial without a murder weapon.

145
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,473
The State has already stipulated that
the alleged weapon was outstanding.

146
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,915
- We have two eyewitnesses who...
- Saw what, exactly?

147
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,838
My client bent over the inspector?

148
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,235
That's how they justify their attack?

149
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,432
How did they know he didn't just
happen across the scene

150
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,158
and was trying
to revive the inspector?

151
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,912
Oh, please!

152
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,078
- Order!
- Sorry.

153
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,919
And why, if they were able to
so easily subdue him,

154
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,719
don't they know exactly what
happened to the alleged weapon?

155
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,558
I mean, what, did it just...

156
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,438
...magically disappear?
- Objection.

157
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,629
Oh, God, he knows.

158
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,513
- The witnesses aren't on trial here.
- Why?

159
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,075
- Isn't perjury illegal?
- Objection, Your Honour!

160
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,588
Mr. Turner,

161
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,079
unless you have something else

162
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,071
or can produce
the alleged murder weapon,

163
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,958
I'm inclined to agree with Mr. Sloan.

164
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,271
- You're what?
- Do you or don't you have

165
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,032
any additional evidence?

166
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,834
Aside from the fact that he's the prime
suspect in three other murders,

167
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,037
that no less than five people saw him
leave the rave just before the attacks,

168
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,156
and that everything,
other than the missing weapon,

169
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,356
makes this, in any other courtroom,
a slam-dunk?

170
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,110
The charges are dropped.
The defendant is released.

171
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,791
I don't believe this.

172
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,513
Clerk, next case.

173
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,352
Yeah, you keep smiling, punk.
I'm not giving up until I see you fry.

174
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,954
Come on, Turner.
This isn't gonna solve anything.

175
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,673
Let's go.

176
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,597
I'm so sorry. I wish that
there was more that we could do.

177
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,036
If there's something
you're not telling me, anything...

178
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,312
If you're afraid of him,
we can protect you. I can refile.

179
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,230
We have to go. Sorry.

180
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,915
- We shouldn't have lied.
- Phoebe.

181
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,156
We shouldn't have.
We should've told the truth.

182
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,437
We should've done whatever we had
to do to keep that jerk from walking.

183
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,995
Like what? Say what really
happened to that knife?

184
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,435
- Tell the court that we're witches?
- Why not, Prue?

185
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,795
Isn't it more important
to keep a killer off the streets

186
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,109
than to protect our secret?

187
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,510
The judge would've thought
we were nuts, and you know it.

188
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,836
Not if you proved it to him
and showed him your power.

189
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,594
That wouldn't have put Emilio away.
That would've put us away.

190
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,955
Then we'd never have the chance
of catching him again.

191
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,675
And would that be before or after
he kills somebody else?

192
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,317
I'm sorry. You know, I'm just...
I'm really frustrated about all this.

193
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,472
What about that public defender?

194
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,108
I mean, if Emilio really did
tell that PD about us,

195
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,998
then why didn't he spill
the magic beans?

196
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,519
Same reason as us, credibility.

197
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,194
What I'm curious about is,
is he mortal or is he demon?

198
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,915
All I know is Cole is an angel.

199
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,116
He was awesome
in that courtroom yesterday.

200
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,719
See something you like, sis?

201
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,631
Maybe. Or maybe it's just

202
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,598
nice to run into someone
that's not a college boy.

203
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,236
- More years, less hormones.
- Yeah, not a bad butt either.

204
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,550
We've been through this, Leo.
I don't care what they are.

205
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,472
It's not right and it's not fair.

206
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,877
- I know that, but it's their rules.
- Screw their rules. They're wrong.

207
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,359
- Piper?
- Just a second.

208
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,313
Leo, you better do something about
this, because this isn't acceptable.

209
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,511
Piper, come on.

210
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,309
I'm gonna go to the club.
Do not tell him.

211
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,673
Hi, welcome home!

212
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,400
Okay, what was that all about?
I didn't even get to bitch at her.

213
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,629
Yeah. Neither did I.

214
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,438
- we have to talk about it.

215
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,318
- Leo, she left.
- Yeah, so now I get to bitch at you.

216
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,948
Listen, the next time
you take my sister someplace,

217
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,429
please call and let us know
that you got there safely, okay?

218
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,676
I don't care if it's up there...

219
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,078
Leo...

220
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,753
Can you do me a favour
and go find out

221
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,194
everything you can on Guardians?

222
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,430
They are demons.
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

223
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,758
- Excuse me, but I have issues.
- Yes, I know. So do I,

224
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,115
but Leo looked
pretty beaten up already.

225
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,353
Yeah, you're right, which is why
I'm now gonna go kick Piper's ass.

226
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,159
Okay, we have had
this conversation.

227
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,390
You are not allowed to use
your active power on me

228
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,676
until I have an active power
to use on you, remember?

229
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,154
I know. I'm sorry, all right?

230
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,471
But if anybody's gonna talk to Piper,
it should be me. Cooler heads and all.

231
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,438
Besides, shouldn't you be at class?

232
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,599
- Piper?
- This is really weird.

233
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,872
My supplies are, like, gone. There's
no booze, there's no mineral water,

234
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,196
and we're even out of pretzels.

235
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,676
Plus, the books are all messed up.
How did this happen in one lousy day?

236
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,916
One day? You're kidding, right?

237
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,638
Piper, you have been gone
for one month.

238
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,277
- What are you talking about?
- Here.

239
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,152
- Check the date.
- October?

240
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,993
It's October?
How is this possible?

241
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,875
I guess time moves
a little bit differently up there.

242
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,833
Yeah, well, it doesn't keep your head
from being bitten off down here.

243
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,560
- Are you talking about demons?
- Oh, no.

244
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,029
Something so much worse
than demons.

245
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,509
Sisters. Especially Phoebe.

246
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,870
- We thought you had abandoned us.
- That's ridiculous.

247
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,553
I would never abandon you guys.

248
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,154
If I had known I was gone this long,
I would've called or orbed

249
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,276
or somehow let you know
I was okay.

250
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,198
Okay, so why didn't Leo?

251
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,868
Leo was battling demons of his own.

252
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,634
Wait a minute, what's today?
There's a band. The...

253
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,916
The Barenaked Ladies
is playing here tomorrow.

254
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,231
- Did anybody bother to call them?
- I don't really think that Phoebe knew.

255
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,998
You know what? Piper.

256
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,715
Can we just talk about
what happened up there first?

257
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,913
Sure. Unfortunately, the longer I'm
back, the fuzzier it all seems to get.

258
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,230
I think they do that on purpose.
They're big on mystery.

259
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,879
Okay, do you remember anything?

260
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,312
Just feelings, mostly.

261
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,471
Good ones, peaceful and whole,

262
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,551
and then it all went to crap
when they said

263
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,075
Leo and I had to
stop seeing each other or else.

264
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,631
Or else what?

265
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,072
Or else they'd reassign him,
and we'd never see each other again.

266
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,834
Just because it didn't work out
with Mom and her whitelighter,

267
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,718
I don't understand
why I'm being punished.

268
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,271
I'm sure that you guys will figure out
a way around this.

269
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,634
Come here.

270
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,279
Leo would never let you go
without a fight. You know that.

271
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,876
But what if
he doesn't have a choice?

272
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,517
- Cole.
- Hi. How's it going?

273
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,236
Wow, is this embarrassing.

274
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,119
- I'm...
- It's okay. I'm okay.

275
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,959
Nice calf.

276
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,431
Thanks.

277
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,036
- Can I have it back?
- Sure. Sure.

278
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,719
Okay.

279
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,235
- How did you find me?
- Told you I was good at what I do.

280
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,235
Although you probably wouldn't
think so after my performance in court.

281
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,399
No, I thought you were amazing.

282
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,910
It's just you were up against...

283
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,792
...an unfair judge.

284
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,757
"Free Willy," he's got that reputation.

285
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,559
Still, I know I didn't put on
my best case.

286
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,632
That's why I'm here, to see
if you can help me do a better job.

287
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,428
- How?
- I don't know.

288
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,874
You tell me.

289
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,191
Look...

290
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,915
...Phoebe, I may not be
the greatest prosecutor,

291
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,548
but I've got good instincts.
I can sense things about people,

292
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,280
things they may not even
want me to know.

293
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,112
And what do you sense about me?

294
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,595
That you're struggling with the truth.

295
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,476
You're a good person who wants
to do the right thing,

296
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,198
but for whatever reason, can't.

297
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,192
How am I doing so far?

298
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,079
Hung jury.

299
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,468
Mistrial.

300
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,038
If you think of anything...

301
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,633
...please call me.

302
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,028
Home number's on the back.

303
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,953
Bye.

304
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,958
Oh, no.

305
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,197
I have got to get a cell phone.

306
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,271
Prue, I had a premonition

307
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,908
of Emilio carving that rune
into Cole's forehead.

308
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,554
- Did you see where it happens?
- No, just some parking lot.

309
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,672
Who's Cole?
What did you do to your hair?

310
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,189
- I'm sorry, do I know you?
- Phoebe, now is not the time.

311
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,549
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

312
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,597
Now that I think about it,
it does seem weird.

313
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,228
- We vanquished the Guardian.
- Well, maybe he got another one.

314
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,753
What's a Guardian, you ask?

315
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,793
Well, if you'd been around at all,
then you'd probably know, huh?

316
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,110
All right, we'll fill you in
on the phone.

317
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,629
Leo's checking on them,
so you should get together with him

318
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,155
- and find out everything.
- And no orbing.

319
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,678
I need another Guardian.

320
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,509
What you need is to be more careful.
I won't protect you again.

321
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,836
I won't get caught again.

322
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,230
I can take care of the witches, judge.

323
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,197
No, you can't. You're a mortal.

324
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,790
But you can take care
of the prosecutor.

325
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,834
I don't want him
to find out about you...

326
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,710
...or me, understand?

327
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,229
I wish I could help, Turner,
but I've told you everything.

328
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,709
Call me Cole. After all,
we're on the same side, aren't we?

329
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,195
As often as cops
and DAs are, I guess.

330
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,272
Look, inspector, I'm just trying
to do my job, okay?

331
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,274
I let a murderer go free today,
and that doesn't sit well with me.

332
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,475
Me neither.

333
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,039
Then help me
do something about it.

334
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,191
Help me find out what it is
that I'm missing here.

335
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,072
What you're missing is a suspect.

336
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,716
And if you let me do my job,
maybe I can help you find him again.

337
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,872
Now, if you'll excuse me.

338
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,073
Why did you call
the Halliwells last night?

339
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,996
- What?
- While you were on stakeout

340
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,835
at 2:17 a.m.,
according to the phone company.

341
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,113
- You checked up on me?
- Standard procedure, inspector.

342
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,954
Gee, and here I thought
we were on the same side.

343
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,240
I called because
the sisters own a club.

344
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,039
I thought they'd be interested
in checking out the rave.

345
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,349
That was very nice of you.

346
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,269
- I'm a nice guy.
- Yeah.

347
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,873
- Turner.
- It's Phoebe Halliwell.

348
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,712
- Speak of the devil.
- Should I take a message?

349
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,148
No, please put her through.

350
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,796
- Phoebe?
- Cole, I've been trying to reach you.

351
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,150
Sorry, I was in a meeting
with Inspector Morris.

352
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,912
- You wanna say hello?
- No.

353
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,311
- He's at the police station.
- Ten, 15 minutes at least.

354
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,631
Listen, Cole, I need to talk to you.
It's really, really important.

355
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,990
- Say again? I didn't catch that.
- Cole?

356
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,431
Just stay where you are,
and I'll meet you there, okay?

357
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,511
We've got a bad line.
I'm running late for court.

358
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,557
I'll call you from my car.

359
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,113
Cole?

360
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,274
Damn it.

361
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,077
An active power.

362
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,999
Not that active. Prue!

363
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,828
Hey, catch!

364
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,434
Cole? Cole?

365
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,758
Phoebe?

366
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,559
What are you doing here?
What happened?

367
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,109
I think I'm gonna
plead the Fifth on that one.

368
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,069
I look at you,
and I think how lucky I am.

369
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,959
I mean, I can't stop looking at you.

370
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,917
You're my dream come true.

371
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,832
You're my raison d'etre.

372
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,715
Every time I see you,
I love you even more.

373
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,270
You're so beautiful.

374
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,671
You're so special.

375
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,189
I can't imagine my life without you.

376
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,230
- Piper.
- Leo?

377
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,992
- Who are you talking to?
- Me?

378
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,151
Nobody. Just myself, you know.

379
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,916
Yourself? You were telling yourself
how much you loved you?

380
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,476
No, of course not. I mean, it's...

381
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,437
It's not like that at all.

382
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,756
Let's go downstairs, and I'll explain.

383
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,150
Actually, no, we don't have time.

384
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,556
Did you find out anything
about the Guardians?

385
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,188
- No, I forgot.
- You forgot?

386
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,237
What's the matter?
Why are you acting so weird?

387
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,955
- Can we go downstairs, please?
- No. Why?

388
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,388
Okay, fine.

389
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,795
Here's good.

390
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,396
I've been thinking a lot, actually,
about our situation.

391
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,910
- Leo...
- Just... Now, let me finish.

392
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,036
I think I've come up with a solution.

393
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,479
A way for us to be together
no matter what they say.

394
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,832
Okay.

395
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,953
Will you marry me?

396
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,269
- Piper!
- This is so not happening.

397
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,876
Listen to me, Piper. I told you,
I thought this whole thing through.

398
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,430
Is that why you asked me
to marry you in a toilet?

399
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,999
I tried to get you downstairs.

400
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,879
Well, I'm downstairs now,
and I still don't believe you're serious.

401
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,832
I am serious, Piper. Dead serious.

402
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,589
Right. Dead is exactly what
we're gonna be if they ever find out.

403
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,479
Piper, would you?

404
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,756
Would you just stop running away
from me for one minute

405
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,194
and let me explain?

406
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,516
If we got married...

407
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,518
Look, will you just
hear me out, please?

408
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,754
If we got married,
it would be a holy union.

409
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,039
Something I don't even think
my bosses could break apart.

410
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,235
- I don't understand.
- It's really hard to explain.

411
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,039
I don't really understand
how it all works myself.

412
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,795
But I know that there are
different levels up there. A hierarchy.

413
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,232
What I'm trying to say is that I think
a holy union goes above their heads.

414
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,195
It'd be like running an end run
to my boss' bosses.

415
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,873
An end run?

416
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,753
Yeah, the only catch is that
we'd have to get married in secret.

417
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,633
I think the only way they could hurt us
is if they found out before.

418
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,956
So we just have to keep it quiet.

419
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,599
- Elope?
- Right.

420
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,995
- So that they don't find out.
- Exactly.

421
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,038
You hate the idea.

422
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,072
Well...

423
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,834
...it's not exactly Cinderella, is it?

424
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,232
Look, how do we know
they don't know already?

425
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,436
How do we know
they're not listening right now?

426
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,471
They're not, believe me.
They don't do that.

427
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,036
So then why does it
have to be a secret?

428
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,515
Because if they ever did find out...

429
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,631
Leo...

430
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,597
...this isn't supposed to be this way.

431
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,357
Marriage shouldn't be a solution
to a problem or a Band-Aid.

432
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,873
It's supposed to be about love

433
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,270
and about two people
who love each other so much

434
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,476
they wanna spend
the rest of their lives together.

435
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,079
That's what I want.

436
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,357
But that's not where
this is coming from.

437
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,274
It's a fix-it, I guess,
but it's not about us or love,

438
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,829
or whether or not
we're even ready to be married.

439
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,873
I came up with this whole idea
because we love each other.

440
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,318
It's all about our love.

441
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,598
You know, we're meant
to be together, Piper. You know that.

442
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,558
You went to the future, and you saw
that we were married in it.

443
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,234
That means that somehow
they didn't stop us.

444
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,431
Somehow, we found a way
to be together,

445
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,511
and I think this is the way.

446
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,271
I don't know.

447
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,197
Leo...

448
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,513
...I love you and I know
I don't ever wanna be without you...

449
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,077
...but this just doesn't feel right.

450
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,272
I mean, getting married in secret...

451
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,713
It doesn't feel
like a holy union to me.

452
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,393
I'm sorry.

453
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,318
Piper? Leo?

454
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,519
Hey, Leo, good. Did you find out
anything about the Guardian?

455
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,994
Not yet.

456
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,918
Not yet?
What do you mean, not yet?

457
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,629
Piper?

458
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,875
I'll go see what I can find out.

459
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,717
- You get anything out of him?
- Nope. He's not talking.

460
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,150
Yeah? Seems to be an epidemic.

461
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,432
Don't do anything stupid, Turner.

462
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,073
You don't wanna
compromise your case.

463
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,514
What case?

464
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,238
He's already
gotten away with murder.

465
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,233
You really think they're gonna nail him
for hitting me over the head?

466
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,713
How's it going?

467
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,953
I'm gonna make you a deal, Emilio.

468
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,156
One that, if you're smart,
you'll jump at.

469
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,633
Obviously, whoever's protecting you

470
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,438
isn't gonna keep doing it
much longer.

471
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,309
Especially since you keep
screwing up and getting caught.

472
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,955
So you might wanna pay attention.

473
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,748
I want you to get a message to...

474
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,478
...your friend.

475
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,079
Tell him I know he sent you after me,
and because of that...

476
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,669
...I'm gonna personally
bring him down.

477
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,911
You don't scare me.

478
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,874
No?

479
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,389
Turner!

480
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,915
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

481
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,917
What the hell are you doing?
Let him go!

482
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,757
See you in court.

483
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,793
Hey!

484
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,676
- Do you wanna be alone?
- No.

485
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,956
But it looks like I'm gonna be.

486
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,716
Leo asked me to marry him.

487
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,950
- That's great.
- Yeah, except that I can't do it.

488
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,752
What do you mean, you can't do it,
Piper? You love him.

489
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,309
Of course I do,
with all my heart. But...

490
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,631
Why does it gotta be so complicated?
Why can't I just be a normal person

491
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,119
in love with a normal guy?

492
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,556
Does Leo think that getting married
is the only way around them?

493
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,109
Yeah. But he's not even sure
it's gonna work.

494
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,799
Yeah, but it might work.

495
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,754
Piper, you and Leo
are destined to be together.

496
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,112
You guys have the kind of love
that girls dream about.

497
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,872
I know I dream about it.
How about you?

498
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,911
All the time.

499
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,078
And I understand the risks,
but if you don't go for it,

500
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,798
isn't it an even bigger risk?

501
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,031
That was fast.

502
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,798
- A little too fast.
- Sorry.

503
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,394
They were very interested when
I told them about the Guardians.

504
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,233
Apparently, Guardians help
mortal criminals spread evil.

505
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,158
Yeah, we already know that.
Skip ahead.

506
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,078
Well, they think that
you've stumbled across

507
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,231
some evil conspiracy
in that courtroom,

508
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,153
one where an upper-level demon
somehow assigns Guardians

509
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,673
to the criminals who are set free.

510
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,997
Well, that makes sense.
It explains why Emilio has two.

511
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,549
Yeah, the question is,
who's the demon?

512
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,235
Didn't you say the public defender
seemed suspicious?

513
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,830
Yeah, but he's not exactly in the best
position to be setting criminals free.

514
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,468
- Yeah, but Free Willy is.
- Who?

515
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,035
The judge. I mean,
that would explain why

516
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,430
he's got the highest release rate
of anyone on the bench.

517
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,113
Still, you can't go
vanquishing a judge

518
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,793
without knowing for sure
he's demonic.

519
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,599
Well, we better come up with a plan
because Emilio gets arraigned

520
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,752
in night court in, oh, an hour.

521
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,757
I've got an idea.

522
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,399
Can't we just come up with
a spell or something?

523
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,552
- No, a spell could backfire on us.
- So could this.

524
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,280
No, the worst that could happen
is that it just doesn't work.

525
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,271
But we have to flush
the demon out somehow.

526
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,637
And since you can selectively freeze
things, why not just the innocents?

527
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,270
- Because I've never done it before.
- Well, I've never levitated before.

528
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,998
- You never what?
- Look, Piper,

529
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,675
just focus all of your energy
on freezing the innocents, okay?

530
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,872
Okay. So why'd you
do that to your hair?

531
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,510
Because I wanted to
change my luck. Scoot!

532
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,838
How many times is the prosecution
gonna keep harassing my client?

533
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,912
As far as I'm concerned, this is
turning into nothing but a witch-hunt.

534
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,311
If it may please the court, could I have
a minute to confer with the witnesses?

535
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,752
It's late, Mr. Turner.
Either you have a case or you don't.

536
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,148
Very well.
Why would the defendant attack me

537
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,311
if he was innocent
of the prior charges?

538
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,193
- There's no proof he's responsible.
- Now, Piper.

539
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,032
What was he doing
in the police parking lot?

540
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,593
Why did myself and
two eyewitnesses...?

541
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,955
The same two eyewitnesses
that were here before.

542
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,354
- Piper.
- All right!

543
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,879
And what were they doing there?

544
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,118
How is it that they just happened to
magically be at every crime scene?

545
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,515
- Try again.
- I'm trying.

546
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,039
Objection, Your...!

547
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,398
- It worked.
- Overruled.

548
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,393
- It's the judge.
- I move for this case to be dismissed.

549
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,874
And the PD.

550
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,433
It's everybody.

551
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,038
Kill them.

552
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,153
What do we do?

553
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,435
We run.

554
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,918
Okay, does anybody have
any brilliant ideas?

555
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,829
- Can you just freeze them?
- No. Once they're immune to it,

556
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,831
they stay that way.
It's called immunity.

557
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,314
Great.

558
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,354
- This was all your idea, you know.
- Okay, well, so sue me.

559
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,915
Stand back!

560
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,553
Any mass vanquishing spells?

561
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,314
- You're the one studying the book.
- Why are you picking on me?

562
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,311
Because I'm scared,
and we're outnumbered.

563
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,431
We can't stay in this room
for the rest of our lives.

564
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,912
The best defence
is a good offence.

565
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,149
- Are you ready?
- No.

566
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,673
- Yeah, you're ready. On three.
- No.

567
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,637
One, two... Don't hold my hand.

568
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,836
One, two, three.

569
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,471
- Hey, nicely done.
- You too.

570
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,870
Wait a minute. If they're demons,
where are their powers?

571
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,479
Come to me!

572
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,912
Guardians. They're not demons.

573
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,911
They're just protected by them.
Come on.

574
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,553
- What the hell?
- Thanks. I'll take it from here.

575
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,350
- Okay, how did that happen?
- Good question, but we're not alone.

576
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,431
We better get back
before Cole unfreezes.

577
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,397
How are we gonna
explain all this to him?

578
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,469
I am so sorry.

579
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,071
Cole? Cole?

580
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,633
Are you okay?

581
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,439
Yeah. I think so.

582
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,832
What happened?

583
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,873
Aren't you getting tired
of asking me that?

584
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,430
Well, Emilio went nuts,
and he tried to escape.

585
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,273
And then all the courtroom people
tried to help him.

586
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,232
Yeah, thank God for Darryl.

587
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,192
Yep, saved the day.

588
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,828
- What?
- Something good happened.

589
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,991
Can't you just accept that?

590
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,431
It's not in my nature.

591
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,117
You've been gone for two days, and
you get the Barenaked Ladies? How?

592
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,390
Oh, actually, I just made
a couple phone calls.

593
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,034
And I can't even get Barry Manilow
on the phone.

594
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,638
- I'm sorry I screwed up your club.
- Don't. I owe you guys an apology.

595
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,638
- And thanks for covering my butt.
- Not a problem.

596
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,394
I didn't even really notice
that you were gone, actually.

597
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,477
Liar.

598
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,676
Yeah, I've been doing
a lot of that lately.

599
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,632
Unfortunately, especially to Cole.

600
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,195
But hopefully I won't have to
lie to him any more.

601
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,198
Yeah, well, something tells me he's
not going anywhere anytime soon.

602
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,437
- No complaints here.
- One over here.

603
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,073
Hottie that he is,

604
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,550
he is an assistant DA, which makes
him somewhat of a threat to us.

605
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,149
Yeah, but at least
he's one of the good guys.

606
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,590
Speaking of the good guys...

607
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,078
- So have you had a change of heart?
- Actually, no.

608
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,669
- Hi.
- Hi.

609
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,271
- Piper, maybe it was a mistake...
- Wait, Leo. Me first.

610
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,911
I've been thinking a lot about
our situation and you asking me,

611
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,915
and I didn't wanna just dismiss it
without thinking it through.

612
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,798
Last night in the courtroom,
I was actually scared.

613
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,830
For a minute there,
I thought I wasn't gonna make it,

614
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,797
that that was it.

615
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,079
And that's when I realized...

616
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,074
...that I don't wanna die without
ever having been married to you.

617
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,992
The answer is yes, Leo.
I'd love to marry you.

618
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,309
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

619
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,357
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
