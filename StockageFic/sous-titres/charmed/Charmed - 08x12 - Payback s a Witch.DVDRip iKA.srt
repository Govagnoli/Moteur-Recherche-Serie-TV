1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,588
Oh, no, sweetie.
No, no, no, that's not funny.

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:07,508
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,637
Buddy... Wyatt,
you know better than that.

4
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,434
No, sweetie.

5
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,353
What do you want,
a time-out on your birthday?

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,146
Come on, baby.

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,736
Sweetie, come on.
I know you're upset, all right?

8
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,405
But everything's
gonna be okay, all right?

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,408
Everything's gonna be just fine.
Mommy's here.

10
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,994
Okay, come here.

11
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,206
Listen, why don't you go play
with your toys, okay, in the other room

12
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,750
while Mommy cleans this up, okay?

13
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,461
See you later.

14
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,008
It isn't easy, is it?

15
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,678
Sorry, I should have knocked
before I orbed.

16
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,973
What is it?
Do you know something about Leo?

17
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,350
No more than you do,
I'm sorry to say.

18
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,103
But the deal you made with
the Angel of Destiny will be honoured.

19
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,106
I assure you, Leo
will be returned to you if...

20
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,942
If and when we defeat
whoever the hell it is.

21
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,696
- Any ideas?
- If I knew, I'd tell you, Piper.

22
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,114
But for whatever reason,

23
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,157
you're supposed to find it out
on your own.

24
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,201
Yeah, well, I'm sick and tired
of all these reasons

25
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,619
that don't really make any sense.

26
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,205
I mean, I barely understand it,
let alone Wyatt,

27
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,959
whose father is here one day,
and then just disappears the next day.

28
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,170
I mean, the kid's a wreck.
What am I supposed to do?

29
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,547
Everything you are doing, Piper.

30
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,716
Living your lives,
celebrating his birthday,

31
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,342
never giving up hope.

32
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,054
You know, he's a good kid.
He's just acting out.

33
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,983
He's a good boy.

34
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,183
Once again,
who does this symbol belong to?

35
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,268
I told you, I don't know.

36
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,853
I'm a possessor demon, not...

37
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,523
Here's the thing, Rohtul,

38
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,775
I'm gonna find this demon
and I'm gonna find my sister.

39
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,360
The question is,
do you wanna help me

40
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,571
or do you wanna die stupid
like all the others?

41
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,366
Even if I knew,
I wouldn't tell you, witch.

42
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,078
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

43
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,623
What are you doing? Knock it off.
Are you kidding me?

44
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,042
There's a 3-year-old's party
about to start downstairs.

45
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,544
Well, I was just trying to squeeze
one more demon in before...

46
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,796
No, there will be no more squeezing.
Are you kidding me?

47
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,715
I got enough stuff to do
without worrying about

48
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,217
who you're torturing in the attic.

49
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,219
It's not a big deal,
he's just a possessor demon.

50
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,222
"Just a possessor demon. " Did you
think maybe he'd like to possess

51
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,058
some of our guests downstairs
maybe? Did you think about that?

52
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,393
- He won't be alive that long.
- That is not the point.

53
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,062
The point is now is not the time.

54
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,897
I need this party to go very well.

55
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,482
And I need to find my sister.

56
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,404
Oh, great. Now look what you did.

57
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,783
- No.
- What are you doing?

58
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,826
- I have to find him.
- Not until after the party.

59
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,329
Piper, I can't wait till after the party.
He knows something.

60
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,498
Would you listen to yourself?
We've been through this.

61
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,625
You can't let your obsession
for revenge drive you...

62
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,502
I'm not obsessed with revenge.

63
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,255
Good, then you can understand
why it can wait.

64
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,090
No, it can't.

65
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:08,725
Oh, incoming!

66
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,940
- Maybe I should just cancel this thing.
- What, the party?

67
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,110
Well, the gods are against me,
or at least the balloons are.

68
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,446
Oh, honey, I know you're stressed.

69
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,448
Piper, you can't be serious.

70
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,659
Can't I? I mean, a few things
have changed around here

71
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,077
since I planned the party.

72
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,413
Like, you know,
his father is now gone...

73
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,582
I know, but that's
even more reason to have it.

74
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,458
You know, give Wyatt
a sense of normalcy.

75
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,336
I know, I know,
and that's what the Elder said, but...

76
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,505
I'm just starting to think
that I'm forcing it on him,

77
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,799
trying to pretend
like everything's just peachy.

78
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,343
Well, he misses his dad,
it's completely understandable.

79
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,596
I know, I know, but I think
there's something else too,

80
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,056
something big, and I just wish
I could talk to him

81
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:52,060
before, you know,
he turns the party guests into toads.

82
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,813
Well, maybe he'll talk
to Aunt Phoebe?

83
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,275
- Okay, but you know, he is 3.
- Well, it's worth a shot, though, isn't it?

84
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,652
Okay, you do this and I'll do that.

85
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,282
What should we do now, Rohtul?

86
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,578
We can't just sit here and do nothing
while she picks us off one at a time.

87
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,830
What would you have us do, attack?

88
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:15,834
She's working with the Charmed Ones.
That would be suicide.

89
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,128
The Charmed Ones
have nothing to do with this.

90
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,131
She acts alone.
This is all about her sister.

91
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:25,052
A sister who was abducted
by very powerful demons,

92
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,137
demons who don't wish
to be revealed.

93
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,181
You know where her sister
was taken?

94
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,684
No, but I know who did the taking.

95
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,270
And believe me, you don't wanna
go up against them

96
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,855
any more than you do
the Charmed Ones.

97
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,607
That doesn't solve our problem.

98
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,692
Billie must die.

99
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,529
The only question is how we do it.

100
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,907
- And who will risk it.
- I will risk it.

101
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,535
I owe her.

102
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,705
Follow her. Find her weakness.

103
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,713
Thank you, ma'am.

104
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,970
And he starts working
for Anderson Aviation on Monday.

105
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,889
He'll be training pilots.
It's a great job, yeah.

106
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,641
More than enough
to make those payments.

107
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,560
Yes, Nick flew helicopters
in the war.

108
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:18,897
Right, and this was before he went
to prison, correct?

109
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,942
That's correct, sir.

110
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,611
But it was only for a year,
and it wasn't for anything really bad.

111
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,948
Nick's just trying to get some money
to help his son move out of a bad area.

112
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,492
That's what the money's for,
and I'm here to vouch for him.

113
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,578
And I'm here to vouch for him
as well.

114
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,914
- I'm sorry, who are you again?
- Well, I am a friend of his,

115
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,584
and somebody who believes
in second chances,

116
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,503
especially for those
who've served our country.

117
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,173
Well, I couldn't agree more.

118
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,009
Let me just run a credit check
and I'll be right back.

119
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,094
Excuse me.

120
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,513
That's good.

121
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,182
Nobody is gonna loan money
to an ex-con.

122
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,225
Nick, you've paid your dues, okay?

123
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,227
Slate's clean,
that's what parole is about.

124
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,397
Listen, Henry, I appreciate
everything you've done for me.

125
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,773
Come on, you did it.

126
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,610
Paige.

127
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,779
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

128
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,199
Sorry. I know you're really busy,
but I need to talk to you.

129
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,784
So excuse us for just one second.
Come here.

130
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,210
Hey, little buddy, are you excited
about your big party today?

131
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,587
Yeah? It's gonna be fun.

132
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:27,090
You're gonna have presents
and see all your friends.

133
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,971
And I bet you're pretty sad
that your daddy can't make it.

134
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:38,018
You wanna know a little secret?
We're all sad.

135
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:42,731
I'm sad, and your mommy's sad,
Auntie Paige is sad.

136
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,070
And I'm sad too.

137
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:51,573
But no one understands me.
Do you?

138
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,415
Put this over here.

139
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:09,299
<i>Little boy's bear
Show me how you care</i>

140
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:13,095
<i>Tell me how you'd feel
If you were real</i>

141
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,431
I'm so sad.

142
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,851
I wanna cry all the time.

143
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,687
Oh, no.

144
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:23,480
Why are you sad, bear?

145
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:26,525
You wanna tell her or should I?

146
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,032
Oh, my God!

147
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,373
How did you do that?

148
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,593
Hello, hi. Oh, thank you.

149
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,720
- Hi, Piper.
- Hi.

150
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,056
Phoebe!

151
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,395
Look, Billie, I'm gonna stay here
and I'm gonna help Henry's friend.

152
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,105
And besides,
I'm not gonna go up

153
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,357
against Piper,
not today on Wyatt's birthday.

154
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,859
Come on,
the demon's gonna get away.

155
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,569
You said he wouldn't talk.

156
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,656
- But...
- Look, please just relax, okay?

157
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:24,750
Mr. Edwards, I'm very sorry,
but our bank policy is very strict.

158
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,835
You know what?
I mean, this is a bunch of bull.

159
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,420
Why don't you
come out and say it?

160
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,255
- Nick...
- No, I'm tired of this crap.

161
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,591
You know what? I've been dumped on
ever since I got back,

162
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,761
just like I've been dumped on
since I got out of prison. Screw you.

163
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,138
- Nick, please...
- No!

164
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,435
- I'm sorry I let you down.
- Nick, you didn't...

165
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,272
Isn't there something you can do?

166
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,941
Maybe make an exception
just this once?

167
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,317
Hey, I'm not the criminal. He is.

168
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,070
He is not a criminal,
he's a veteran, jerk.

169
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,822
- Henry, let's just calm down, come on.
- What's the matter with you?

170
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,533
- Henry.
- I can't believe this happened.

171
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,159
He's gonna crack, I know it.
I know Nick.

172
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,369
There are other banks.

173
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,204
No, it's gonna be
the same thing everywhere.

174
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,623
It always happens this way.
The guy can't catch a break.

175
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,792
We'll make it work, okay?
We'll figure it out.

176
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,627
- It's not fair.
- Paige, look out!

177
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,973
Now, about that loan.

178
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,107
All right, excuse me.

179
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,485
Wow, so where's the birthday boy?

180
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,697
Oh, that's a good question.
Phoebe!

181
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:40,075
Sorry, sorry, here's the birthday boy.

182
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,706
Happy birthday!

183
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,002
Hi.

184
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,672
- Where've you been?
- Oh, you know,

185
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,384
just upstairs,
chatting and playing with some toys.

186
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,429
Wow, this just seems
to be a huge success.

187
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:01,889
Maybe we should wrap it up, huh?

188
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,099
What are you talking about?
The party just started.

189
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,186
Wait a minute, what happened?
What's wrong?

190
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,480
That.

191
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,734
Hey, what's that?

192
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,530
Okay, okay, all right.

193
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,033
Wow, are these characters
great or what?

194
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,202
You could hire them for any party.

195
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,746
You go back on your word.
You break your promise.

196
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,456
It ain't my fault, it's your fault.

197
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,791
Okay, easy. Relax, relax.

198
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,960
You have guests to entertain.

199
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,462
All right, troops.

200
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,924
We got some recon to do.

201
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,675
Follow me.

202
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:45,224
You! You are in big trouble!

203
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,696
In the front door.

204
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,206
<i>SWAT's on its way.</i>

205
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,124
All right, let's go.
Everybody move over here.

206
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,002
Let's go, move where I can see you!
Do it now!

207
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,421
You too, let's go. Come on.
Bring your purses.

208
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,340
- You don't wanna do this, man.
- You're right.

209
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,717
I don't wanna do this,
but what other choice do I have?

210
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:24,137
Empty your pockets and purses. Put it
on the floor where I can see it. Do it!

211
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,098
Just wanna make sure
nobody's carrying.

212
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:29,560
Listen, you do what I say,
when I say it, nobody gets hurt.

213
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,894
Got that?

214
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:35,983
Okay. You, over here.

215
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,901
What are you doing?
What do you want with him?

216
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,696
Listen, don't be a hero right now,
okay? Just do what I say.

217
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,239
You're making this worse than it is.

218
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:45,325
I owe you everything, Henry, I mean it.
You've been great to me, all right?

219
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,244
But don't mess with me right now.
Come here!

220
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:51,331
- Get over here!
- Please just do what he says.

221
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,958
- Okay.
- Let's go!

222
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,003
Get a bag, fill it with a lot of cash,
then bring it back to me, you got it?

223
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,297
- Yes.
- Do it!

224
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,549
I'm gonna get that loan
one way or another.

225
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:04,845
I cannot believe this is happening.

226
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,848
Yeah, well, it wouldn't be happening
to you if you weren't so obsessed.

227
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,391
Do you want me to call for his guns?

228
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:13,478
No. No, you can't use magic,
there are cameras everywhere.

229
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,939
We can't risk exposure.

230
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,400
I've never seen him like this.

231
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,027
It's like he just snapped.

232
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:23,071
Oh, really? Is that what he did?

233
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,073
Look, Henry,
can't you just maybe talk to him?

234
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,534
You know, he trusts you.

235
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,953
The only one he would listen to
right now is his son.

236
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,331
If we could only find someone
who could bring his son here,

237
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,458
or this is gonna get ugly.

238
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:42,090
Hello?
I have to go to the bathroom.

239
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,426
- Hold it.
- I can't.

240
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,638
Hey, is there any windows
in the bathroom?

241
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,431
What? No.

242
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,642
Go. Don't do anything stupid, though,
all right?

243
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,644
- No tricks, just the bathroom.
- Go!

244
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,071
Stay where you are, everybody else!
Do it, fast!

245
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:12,037
Okay, Bear Infantry,

246
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,831
we're gonna head east
past the punch bowl,

247
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,416
and stop at the balloons, copy that?

248
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,711
Tie your shoes.
You're better than that.

249
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:23,382
Okay, keep your heads down,
keep your mouths shut,

250
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:25,425
keep your hands out
of your neighbour's pockets.

251
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,846
Okay, you ready? Follow me.

252
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,227
Gotcha!

253
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:38,647
- Take cover, take cover!
- Go get them!

254
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,152
Oh, that's some good stuff.

255
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,823
Look, you know, bright side is
they're having a good time.

256
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,409
This is not a good time.
This is chaos.

257
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:52,744
Yeah, but you gotta admit,
the Army guy is kind of cute.

258
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,414
Forget it, Phoebe,
he's not anatomically correct.

259
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:58,458
You need to go upstairs
and reverse the spell.

260
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,294
I did not cast a spell.

261
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,755
Okay, well, maybe I cast
just a little, little spell,

262
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,924
but this... This is all your son.

263
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,676
So he's the only one
that can reverse this.

264
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,511
Well, he got the idea
from you, didn't he?

265
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,889
Okay, look,
I said I was sorry, all right?

266
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,349
I was just playing
with the dolls with him,

267
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:18,061
to try to make him open up
about his emotions, that's all.

268
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,772
That's all?
Does this look like that's all?

269
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:26,320
- You're late.
- 911, upstairs, now.

270
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,907
Now what?

271
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,120
Hostages, are you kidding?

272
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:36,955
Do I look like I'm kidding?

273
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,082
Wait, so how did you get out?

274
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,584
I said I had to go to the bathroom

275
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:43,462
which means I have to hurry, hurry,
hurry to get back, okay?

276
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:46,089
Nick has a son.
Okay, his last name's Edwards.

277
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:49,134
If you can find him and bring him down
to the bank, that would be fantastic.

278
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,344
Wait, how?

279
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,095
Call Henry's office,
say that you know me,

280
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,972
say that you know Henry
and he says it's okay.

281
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,642
Also, call Agent Murphy,
have him call Homeland Security

282
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,478
and tell SWAT down there
to not get trigger-happy, okay?

283
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,271
We don't want Nick to get killed.

284
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,441
Tell Wyatt I said happy birthday.

285
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,321
I'm so glad Leo's not here
to see this.

286
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,077
Hey!

287
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,162
Stay put. Are you finished?

288
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,509
Jeez, can't a girl have
some privacy?

289
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:32,344
Let's go. Go.

290
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,388
What's taking so long?
Let's go, fill it up.

291
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:35,722
Do it now, come on.

292
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,144
Fill it up. Put it in there.

293
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,772
Okay, I think we need
to buy some time.

294
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:47,234
Do you think you can make a potion
with some of that stuff down there?

295
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,653
Thought you didn't wanna
risk us using magic.

296
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,905
Well, I don't, but I also don't want
anyone to get hurt.

297
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,032
I mean, maybe
it won't look like magic

298
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,201
if they're not
magical ingredients, right?

299
00:17:56,368 --> 00:18:00,205
Just see what you can do, okay?
Be careful.

300
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,128
<i>You in the bank, this is the police.</i>

301
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,839
<i>Pick up the phone,
we wanna talk to you.</i>

302
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:27,316
- Come on, pick up.
- All right, that's enough.

303
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,902
Put it down. Get back over there.

304
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,996
- I'm listening.
- My name is Lieutenant Sanchez.

305
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,290
- Who am I speaking with?
- You're speaking with somebody

306
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,335
who wants a helicopter out front
in 20 minutes with clear airspace.

307
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,587
A helicopter? I'm afraid
I can't authorise the release...

308
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,756
<i>You sure as hell better authorise it.</i>

309
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,549
Or what happens next
is on you, pal.

310
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,801
And don't try stalling, okay?
I know the game.

311
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,803
- All right, let's just be calm
- Excuse me, sir.

312
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,640
- And talk about this first, all right?
- It's important.

313
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,725
I'm sorry, hold the line. What?

314
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,268
It's Homeland Security, sir.

315
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,312
They said to interrupt.

316
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,442
This is Lieutenant Sanchez.

317
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,738
You want me to what?

318
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,534
But that's against
every negotiating procedure we've...

319
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,455
Very well.

320
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:28,919
All right, you got your chopper.

321
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,046
<i>Twenty minutes.</i>

322
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,262
Twenty minutes
and I'm out of here.

323
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,726
That doesn't make any sense.

324
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,311
They never give in that quickly.

325
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,022
Maybe they're hoping someone
will talk him down.

326
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,165
<i>But the licence plate of the car
that rammed into the bank</i>

327
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:11,545
<i>has been traced to Nick Edwards
of Ingleside, a decorated ex-Marine...</i>

328
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,463
Well, now we owe
Agent Murphy again.

329
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,841
At least they bought some time.

330
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,177
I'm really worried
about Paige and Billie.

331
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,845
Do you think
we should call the Elders?

332
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:22,264
No, it's not a magical problem,
there's nothing they can do.

333
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:24,433
There's really nothing
we can do either.

334
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,269
- Should we ask everyone to leave?
- No, Wyatt will be crushed.

335
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:29,730
This is the most fun he's had
in a long time.

336
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:33,025
Thanks to his new, huge,
big action heroes.

337
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,276
Yeah.

338
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,740
So how well do you know Leo?

339
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:42,951
- When's the last time you seen him?
- Answer his question.

340
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:47,372
No, no, no, we don't point weapons
at the guests, come on!

341
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:50,167
Wow, do these guys know
how to put on a show or what?

342
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:55,464
Get down! Get down!
Take cover! Take cover!

343
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,842
Okay, okay, it's just a balloon.

344
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:04,014
All right, folks, as you were.

345
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:06,308
Okay, I'll go. You stay with Wyatt,

346
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:09,561
and make sure he turns Pinocchio
back into wood.

347
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,401
Don't you worry, little buddy.

348
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,445
We ain't gonna give up
until we find him.

349
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,405
You can count on it.

350
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,583
Maybe you should go talk to him.

351
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,253
- What do you want me to say?
- Well, you know him best.

352
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,839
Yeah, worked so well before.

353
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,924
Come on, Henry.

354
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:48,433
Nick.

355
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,477
Don't even start, man, okay?
It's no use.

356
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,604
Good, good.
That's what you'll tell your son, right?

357
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:54,815
You leave him out of this.

358
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:59,111
He's already in. The things you do
affect your son, Nick, bigtime.

359
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:00,571
Is this what you want for him?

360
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,241
- What I want?
- Yeah, for him. For your son.

361
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,160
What I want
is not to have been treated

362
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,495
like a freaking pariah
ever since I got back.

363
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:10,497
You gotta expect that
when you do time.

364
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,416
I'm not talking about
when I got out of prison.

365
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,126
I'm talking about
when I got out of Iraq.

366
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,920
I risked my life over there,
and for what, huh?

367
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,089
To be treated like crap
ever since I got back?

368
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,093
It's not right.

369
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:25,304
It's not, you're right.
It's not right, Nick.

370
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,182
But neither is this.
Getting even, it's not the answer.

371
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,350
Revenge makes you do things
that you're gonna regret.

372
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,269
You're hurt. I mean, you're angry.

373
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:35,731
I don't blame you. I would be too.
Nobody here blames you.

374
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:37,524
They'll take that into account.

375
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:41,528
But you gotta stop right now,
for your son.

376
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:46,116
Put that gun down.
It's not too late. Give me the gun.

377
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,703
Come on.

378
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,708
No!

379
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,262
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

380
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,061
What are you doing? He had him.

381
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,066
Who the hell are you?
Who are you?!

382
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,568
- I'm a cop.
- A cop? You're a cop?!

383
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:25,113
Nick, stop, please. Nick.

384
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:28,534
Get up, get up!

385
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,246
Get against the wall.
Get against the wall!

386
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,081
Sit down!

387
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:36,500
- Stay calm!
- Henry.

388
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:37,918
Everybody stay calm.

389
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,419
Stay calm!

390
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,755
All right, this is not good.

391
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:43,757
Henry?

392
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,384
Henry? Henry?

393
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,514
Oh, God. No, stay down.

394
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,182
Stay down, okay? Don't move.

395
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:54,434
Don't move, you're gonna be okay.

396
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,395
Okay.

397
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:06,238
Well?

398
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:08,740
The witch has problems
of her own at the moment.

399
00:24:09,158 --> 00:24:11,577
- Explain.
- She's being held hostage,

400
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,913
along with one of the Charmed Ones,
in a bank.

401
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,083
Shots were fired.
A mortal was wounded.

402
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,585
Why don't they use their powers?

403
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,963
Because they can't
and neither can we.

404
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,258
It's one of the few things
both sides agreed upon eons ago.

405
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:29,428
Neither can leave a magical trail
for mortals to follow.

406
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:32,681
- The secret must be kept.
- So we just wait?

407
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:36,518
No, we take advantage
of their situation.

408
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:41,273
If I time it just right, I just might be able
to force their magical hand.

409
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,276
Make them choose
between exposing their secret

410
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:47,237
and saving an innocent,
something they're honour-bound to do.

411
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,740
- But he just said exposing ourselves...
- We won't be!

412
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:51,617
They will be.

413
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,203
Revenge has many faces,

414
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,955
something that little witch
is about to learn.

415
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:01,001
Go back.
Let me know when it's time.

416
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,550
Come on.

417
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,970
Pick up the phone, damn it.

418
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:17,309
Get EMT ready in case I get
that wounded hostage out.

419
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:18,519
We need the EMTs over here.

420
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,479
SWAT 2, SWAT 2,
your position, over.

421
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:23,857
<i>Copy that, command.
But we don't have a clear shot, over.</i>

422
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:25,651
Are you up and running yet?

423
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:28,654
Yeah, we tapped into
the bank's surveillance cameras.

424
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:37,162
If that hostage dies,
I'm done negotiating.

425
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,998
Sir, we found...

426
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,627
Hi, how's it going?

427
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:45,879
This is Nick Edward's son, Justin.

428
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,173
I think he can help.

429
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,763
Can I do anything for you?

430
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:57,015
Yeah, you can get me out of here.

431
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:00,310
You're gonna be okay, Henry.

432
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:02,855
You just have to hang on, okay?
I know you can do that.

433
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,857
Paige, you gotta talk to him, okay?

434
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,860
He doesn't know what he's doing.

435
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,194
You can help him.

436
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:15,200
How is he?

437
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:18,537
He needs to see a doctor.

438
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:20,455
That's how he is.

439
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,709
Okay. Okay, well,

440
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:25,878
as soon as
the helicopter gets here.

441
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:27,796
He might not make it that long.

442
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,882
Hey, I didn't shoot him.

443
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,676
You're right, you're the one
who should've been shot.

444
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,222
I'm sorry, I'm just worried about him.

445
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,183
I know you are too,
because like you said,

446
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,393
he's been there for you
every step of the way, right?

447
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,853
Don't you think I know that?

448
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,106
I do think you know that,
which is why I know deep down

449
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:50,235
you wanna do the right thing
and let them take him to a hospital.

450
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,863
- They'll crucify me.
- They won't.

451
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,407
I promise you they won't because
we'll tell them what happened.

452
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:57,993
We'll tell them
that you did not do this.

453
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:01,705
<i>Pick up the phone, Nick.</i>

454
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,416
<i>It's your son.</i>

455
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:13,550
Justin?

456
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:15,469
Hey, buddy.

457
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,180
How you doing?

458
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:21,975
- Hey.
- I think you're getting to him.

459
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,269
Yeah, well, not soon enough.

460
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,647
Henry's in pretty bad shape.

461
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:29,608
Well, you know what?
He's a tough guy, he'll be okay.

462
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:32,945
I don't know. If it comes right
down to it, I'm gonna orb him out.

463
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,488
I thought
you didn't wanna use magic.

464
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:37,282
Well, I don't,
but I don't want him dying either.

465
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,035
How's it coming?

466
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:42,204
I don't even know
if this is gonna work.

467
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:45,833
Okay, concentrate, because it has to.

468
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,215
Okay.

469
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:58,095
Well, let's not scare the guests
any more than we already have, okay?

470
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:03,892
What are you guys
looking for, anyway?

471
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:05,936
Great White Father.

472
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,479
- Leo?
- Stand down.

473
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:09,940
He's not here.

474
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,733
Maybe we should check
the basement.

475
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:16,572
Hey, no. Back up, all of you.

476
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,240
How do you know
we have a basement?

477
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:20,784
Don't know. Just do.

478
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,495
- And who told you to look for Leo?
- No one, ma'am.

479
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:26,331
He's missing,
and it's our job to find him.

480
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:29,835
- Now, if you'll excuse us.
- No, go back.

481
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:32,838
- Why is it your job?
- Because it's our fault he's gone.

482
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:35,591
Your fault?
How would it be your fault?

483
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:39,178
It is also Great White Father's fault.
He broke his promise.

484
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:42,389
Okay, now, that's the second time
you mentioned the promise.

485
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:43,974
What promise are we talking about?

486
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:47,311
The promise that he would
always be there, ma'am.

487
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,062
That he would never leave.

488
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:52,024
Unless he left on account
of something we done.

489
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:54,526
We?

490
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:02,784
Oh, my God.

491
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:06,038
You're not Wyatt's toys.

492
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:08,790
You're Wyatt.

493
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:13,378
<i>We're bringing the chopper in now,
ETA, five minutes.</i>

494
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:16,882
Across the street, yeah.

495
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:18,800
Yeah.

496
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:21,094
I love you too.

497
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,102
You know...

498
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:32,898
...I never wanted to hurt anybody,
especially not Henry.

499
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:36,652
I just got so tired
of never catching a break, you know?

500
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:41,907
It's still not too late, you know?
You can turn this around.

501
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:45,577
Yeah. Maybe.

502
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:07,766
Not so fast.

503
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:10,561
I still have a score to settle.

504
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:23,115
What's going on?

505
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:24,908
Keep it down.
We don't want them to hear.

506
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:26,368
I don't mind.

507
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:28,453
As a matter of fact,
I want them to know.

508
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,040
I want the whole world to know
exactly who you are.

509
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:35,043
That's why I chose
to possess this poor soul.

510
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,253
Possess?

511
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,257
What, you don't recognise me
if you're not torturing me, witch?

512
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:45,012
- Rohtul?
- In the flesh.

513
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:46,930
Literally, as it turns out.

514
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,725
And you're not gonna be able
to stop me without using your powers.

515
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:53,228
Something you'll have to do if you
wanna save your little friend over there

516
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:54,980
before it's too late.

517
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:57,649
- Why are you doing this?
- Why don't you ask her?

518
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,485
Did you really think
that your vindictive rampage

519
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,488
through the underworld
would go unpunished?

520
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:05,073
That we would just let it
keep happening?

521
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,366
Paige.

522
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:11,830
Go, go ahead.

523
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:14,374
I have all the time in the world.

524
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,335
What's happening?

525
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:19,421
Try not to talk, okay?
Just save your strength.

526
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:21,548
He was gonna give up but I saw...

527
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:24,843
- Just stay calm.
- I don't understand.

528
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,180
All you need to know is that
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

529
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,974
I promise you. You need to trust me.

530
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:35,812
Paige.

531
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:37,856
I just can't believe
this is all my fault, Paige.

532
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,274
I swear, I didn't know.

533
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:41,652
Unfortunately, you're not the only one
who wants revenge.

534
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:43,320
Why, what are you talking about?

535
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:45,697
I think we should give him
exactly what he came for.

536
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:48,075
- But he came for me.
- I know.

537
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:51,328
Look, I just need you to go and finish
that potion as soon as you can.

538
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:55,791
<i>We need a...</i>

539
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,192
Keep them back!

540
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:33,745
Wait a minute, what do you mean
you're not ready to leave?

541
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,039
We had a deal.
I held up my end of the bargain.

542
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:39,376
Yeah, well, I've changed my mind.

543
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:42,045
How about you give me
a little more time to think it through.

544
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:44,214
Yeah, I have plenty of time.

545
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:46,758
I'll just wait around
another 20 minutes, it doesn't matter.

546
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:49,845
I have all the time in the world.
Thank you.

547
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:56,185
Just try to relax.

548
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:03,734
I don't get it. This guy's schizo.

549
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:06,278
It's like he's a completely
different person all of a sudden.

550
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:08,322
SWAT 2, SWAT 2, come in, over.

551
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:10,365
<i>SWAT 2, over.</i>

552
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:36,517
Bye, thank you for coming.

553
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:37,935
- Bye.
- Bye.

554
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,979
- Bye, sweet girl. Take care.
- Thank you so much.

555
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:43,649
This was the best birthday party
Emma has ever been to.

556
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,150
Those characters were amazing.

557
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:48,487
Yeah, well, you can
thank Wyatt for them.

558
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:51,323
- Phoebe.
- Piper, where have you been?

559
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,075
I can't believe
you missed half the party.

560
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:54,827
Yeah, I know,
but what are you gonna do?

561
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:57,454
- Okay, bye-bye. Bye, sweetie.
- Thank you so much.

562
00:33:57,621 --> 00:34:00,666
- Take care.
- Okay, thanks for coming.

563
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,835
- Did you get rid of them?
- Well, not exactly.

564
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,295
You're gonna have to have
a conversation before that happens.

565
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:07,548
Well, that's gonna have to wait
because I think things

566
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,175
took a turn for the worse at the bank,
demonically worse.

567
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,344
- What? How do you know?
- Well, it's just a hunch,

568
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:15,138
but I think Billie's possessor demon
just stole the show.

569
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:19,309
And if I read Paige's signal correctly,
she's gonna need our help to stop him.

570
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:21,770
All right, let's try it again.

571
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:25,315
- He beat me again.
- You win.

572
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,860
- Easy on the knee, kid.
- Is he safe with them?

573
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:29,820
- I'm pretty good.
- More than you know.

574
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:33,991
He beat both of y'all.
He beat both of y'all.

575
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:37,452
All right, round two.
Let's go, come on.

576
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:39,621
Come on, Henry.

577
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:41,582
Okay, Henry.

578
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,292
I just need you to hang on, okay?

579
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,127
Just a little longer.

580
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:49,298
Do you really want him to die?

581
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,926
More than you wanna save
your precious secret?

582
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:55,512
Leave me alone.

583
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,182
Obviously, you care for him
quite a bit.

584
00:34:58,348 --> 00:34:59,725
Go ahead and orb him out of here.

585
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,311
You can do it. I know you want to.

586
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:05,189
- Shut up.
- You can't let him die, Paige.

587
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:08,650
You'll never be able
to forgive yourself if you do.

588
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:21,038
What?

589
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:31,882
Am I dead?

590
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:37,012
No. You're alive.

591
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:39,556
That's not possible.

592
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:41,225
That's not possible!

593
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:44,269
This is not happening.
This is not happening!

594
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:51,693
I'll kill him. I swear I'll kill him.

595
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:54,238
You better stop me or he dies.

596
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:57,032
One.

597
00:35:58,033 --> 00:35:59,743
- Two.
- Now.

598
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,672
What did you do?

599
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,715
What did you do?!

600
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:19,721
Fine, I'll take her.
That's all I ever wanted anyway.

601
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:21,723
Let's go.

602
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:31,191
It's okay.
She knows what she's doing.

603
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:36,822
Anybody tries anything, she's dead.
You understand?!

604
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:39,366
SWAT 2,
do you have a clear shot? Over.

605
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:41,493
<i>- Negative, command, stand by.
- Let's go, let's go.</i>

606
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:45,164
I die, she dies. Open the door.

607
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,748
I can kill her. Get in.

608
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:48,876
I can still shoot her!

609
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:01,138
<i>I've got a shot.
Permission to shoot, over.</i>

610
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:02,514
Negative. Hold your fire.

611
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:17,821
Damn it!

612
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:25,954
Listen, you really... You don't have
to take me out on a gurney.

613
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:28,665
You were shot on the stomach,
Mr. Mitchell, we're taking you in.

614
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,584
I know this sounds crazy.

615
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:32,878
- I feel fine.
- Yeah, well, you're a lucky man.

616
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:34,880
That bullet somehow missed
every major organ.

617
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:37,341
- It's unbelievable.
- Yeah.

618
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:39,843
Par for the course lately.

619
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,386
Any word on Billie?

620
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:44,723
No. Apparently, the helicopter landed
in Harding Park,

621
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,685
- but there's no sign of Billie or Nick.
- You don't seem very worried.

622
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:52,397
Well, you don't know Billie like I do.
She's a pretty sawy girl.

623
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:53,774
She'll be all right.

624
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:56,235
I hope.

625
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:59,154
Well, okay.

626
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:02,032
- I guess I should be going now.
- Wait, where are you gonna go?

627
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:06,036
I was gonna call Piper
and tell her that we're okay.

628
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:07,996
Good.

629
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:10,707
Hey, you were all
I could think about.

630
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,212
Okay.

631
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:17,214
Well, I'll see you soon, Henry.

632
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:31,812
<i>- Hey, it's me.
- We're almost done with the potion.</i>

633
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:34,773
That's great. Okay,
they should be there any second.

634
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,608
<i>Are you sure
it's the possessor demon?</i>

635
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:38,277
That's what we're making
the potion for.

636
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,697
Positive. Okay, I'm out of here.

637
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:44,116
Be there as soon as I can.

638
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:51,915
So much for being under
the protection of the Charmed Ones.

639
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:54,585
But I thought you said
you were going to try to expose them.

640
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:58,755
Still, this is the one I wanted.

641
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:01,341
This is the one we all wanted.

642
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:06,138
Looks like you're never gonna find
your sister after all.

643
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:10,601
After you.

644
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:14,396
Energy balls!

645
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,775
Surprise.

646
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:39,129
How? But you can't orb.

647
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:41,798
No, but Paige can.

648
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:47,679
She switched identities
during the smoke bomb.

649
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:50,641
- With the real Billie.
- Talking about me?

650
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:53,352
- This one?
- Sure.

651
00:39:57,523 --> 00:39:59,024
So where were we?

652
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:09,701
Yes, where were we?

653
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,037
What is it gonna take
to get through to you?

654
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:13,705
All right, I know.
Believe me, I get it.

655
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:17,125
You don't have to tell me anymore.
I just wanna find my sister so badly.

656
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:20,170
I know and I wanna get
my husband back very badly.

657
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,923
But that doesn't mean I run around
half-cocked all the time to do it.

658
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,217
It's not gonna do your sister
any good if you get killed

659
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:27,719
- while trying to find her.
- I know. I know that now.

660
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,055
I'm not gonna let vengeance
drive me to try and find her.

661
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:32,432
Now it's about bringing her home
safely, and that's it.

662
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:35,561
What do we do with him?

663
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:39,398
Well, I guess I'll orb he and Billie
to the park.

664
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:42,109
Maybe you can stumble
out of there calling for help?

665
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:43,318
Well, what's he gonna do?

666
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:45,112
He's probably gonna have
to go back to prison

667
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:48,115
unless Henry can find somebody
to help him out.

668
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:49,950
Hey, you know, speaking of Henry,

669
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:52,619
how did he make
such a miraculous recovery?

670
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:55,747
Well, I don't really think
we have to discuss that now.

671
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:58,083
What happened?

672
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,420
Well, I think that Paige healed him.

673
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:03,547
- By yourself?
- It's not a big deal.

674
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:06,466
Well, it makes sense.
You are half-whitelighter.

675
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,219
Still, something pretty extreme
must have happened

676
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:11,388
between the two of you,
what were you feeling?

677
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:13,432
Love, maybe?

678
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:16,268
Don't make me sorry
that I saved you.

679
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:31,617
I want you to know that your daddy
is a very, very brave man.

680
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:33,619
And he always has been.

681
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:38,582
And what he's doing now
is very brave too.

682
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:43,295
And I just need you to know...
It's very important.

683
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:46,131
That this isn't your fault.

684
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:48,634
It's not anybody's fault.

685
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,763
It just is. And I know
it's hard to understand.

686
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,808
But I'm gonna do
everything in my power

687
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:58,977
to get your daddy back, okay?

688
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:04,566
I'm gonna do everything I can
to bring your daddy back.

689
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:22,918
That's a good job, buddy.
Come here.

690
00:42:23,085 --> 00:42:25,671
Oy, my goodness.

691
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:30,133
You're such a big boy.

692
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:32,511
Don't worry.
