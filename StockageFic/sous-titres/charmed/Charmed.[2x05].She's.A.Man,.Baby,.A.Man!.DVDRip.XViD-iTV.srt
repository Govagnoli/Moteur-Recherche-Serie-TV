1
00:00:05,369 --> 00:00:07,883
Thank you, everybody, for being here.
Have a great evening,

2
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,961
- and drive safe.
- Oh, I cannot believe this heat wave.

3
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:14,280
It's 2 a.m. How can it be so hot
when there's no sun?

4
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,280
Tell me about it.
The Cranberries are playing

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,280
an animal-rights benefit here
on Saturday,

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,519
and it's gonna be
a million degrees in here.

7
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:25,844
Phoebe, you keep making
like you're on Red Shoe Diaries,

8
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:28,239
and I'm gonna have to bust out
a can of man repellent.

9
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:30,639
- I can't help it.
- All right, people,

10
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:33,881
move along. Nothing to see here.
Go on.

11
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:37,282
Goodness.
Am I gonna have to hose you down?

12
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:41,647
It's not my fault.
I am in a highly excited state right now.

13
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,879
Not that I'd mind
being hosed down with water.

14
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:46,404
I feel like I'm on fire.
Feel my forehead.

15
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:49,601
- Phoebe, you're burning up.
- I know, tell me about it.

16
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:52,602
Something's happening to me, Piper,
something really freaky.

17
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:55,488
Sweetie, I think
you need to call a doctor.

18
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,688
But I don't feel sick. I just... I feel...

19
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:04,327
I feel hot, aroused.

20
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,967
I've been having this dream, Piper.

21
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:13,923
This sex dream.

22
00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:17,525
It's not like I haven't dreamt about sex
before, because I have, you know.

23
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:19,759
But this is... This is different.

24
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:26,038
This feels real swank penthouse
love den, candles, satin sheets...

25
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,608
Okey-dokey, I get the point.

26
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:33,082
But every night it's with a different
man telling me that I'm irresistible.

27
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:34,967
And then we...

28
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,839
Well, let's just say
we could win the gold medal

29
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,398
- in the Hugh Hefner Olympics.
- And this is a bad thing?

30
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:45,448
No, it's a good thing.
It's a very good thing until I kill them.

31
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,361
That's how your dream ends?
You kill the guy?

32
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:52,557
Each and every night, Piper.
I told you, something is wrong with me.

33
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:56,085
There is nothing wrong with you.
It's a dream, a metaphor

34
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,280
for extreme sexual frustration.

35
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:00,840
Trust me, I should know.

36
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:04,599
- Oh, good, we're decoding men.
- Prue, what are you doing here?

37
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:07,681
I'll tell you what I'm not doing.
I am not lighting candles,

38
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:10,807
I'm not getting a back rub, and I'm
not running a hot bubble bath for two.

39
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:12,721
Things didn't go well with Alan?

40
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,800
Well, see, that's the thing,
I'm not really sure.

41
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,482
I mean, third date, a hot night,

42
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:20,358
romantic dinner, and he drops me off
with barely even a kiss good night.

43
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:21,518
I'm a little confused.

44
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:24,362
Well, that's not necessarily
an official rejection.

45
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:27,566
I mean, when they say, "I'll call you,"
that's the kiss of death.

46
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:29,361
- Maybe he just got nervous.
- Yeah,

47
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:31,167
or maybe he's just not interested.

48
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:34,639
I mean, I gave out all the signals
for him to move forward,

49
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:37,243
and he ran away. Men don't just
run away when you give them

50
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,047
all the signals, right?
So, what gives?

51
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,007
Okay, that's enough talk
about men for me.

52
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:44,603
I need to go home
and take a long cold shower

53
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,600
and have a good night's sleep, I hope.

54
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,518
Sweet dreams. Don't kill anyone.

55
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,602
Don't ask.

56
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,959
I can't believe we're doing this.

57
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:10,884
You've gotta be the most beautiful
woman I've ever laid eyes on.

58
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,639
Either I'm dreaming,
or I'm falling in love.

59
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,803
Oh, man, I am definitely
falling in love.

60
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:29,681
Where have you been my entire life?

61
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:32,562
You are irresistible.

62
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,044
- Alan, hi.
- Hi. Man, it's hot, huh?

63
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:30,838
- Bad day for the a.c. To be on the fritz.
- Yeah, bad day. Listen, Alan...

64
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:33,284
Hey, Davis, can you hold the elevator,
please? Thanks.

65
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,041
Sorry, I'm late for a meeting.

66
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,645
Okay, Alan, just out of curiosity,
did something happen

67
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:41,562
on our date last night
to upset you or something?

68
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:45,001
Upset? No, no, not at all.

69
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:48,206
Actually, I had a great time.
We should do it again.

70
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,161
I'll call you.

71
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:55,328
The kiss of death.

72
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,128
Speaking of deadly kisses,
I need to speak to you, Prue.

73
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:02,447
- Yeah, sure, Darryl.
- Everything okay?

74
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:05,607
You know, you're a guy, maybe you
can explain this to me.

75
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:08,329
Why is it that one moment guys
are sending out all of the signals,

76
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:10,798
and then the next they
just turn them off like a switch?

77
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:12,687
What do you men want anyway?

78
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,768
Well, it's nice to see that while
romance may be dead, chivalry isn't.

79
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:21,724
So, what's up, Morris?

80
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:24,397
Four men have been killed

81
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:27,447
over the last four nights
ever since this heat wave started.

82
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,766
I think the murders
are gonna continue,

83
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:32,762
- but I don't have any suspects.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

84
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:37,282
Look, you and I have got this game
we play, right?

85
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,088
You know that I know you got a secret.

86
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:43,042
You also know
I don't wanna know what it is.

87
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,522
But if in any way
it can help stop this...

88
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:50,208
Oh, my God.

89
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,441
What happened to them?

90
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,685
Severe cerebral trauma.

91
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,727
Although the medical examiner
can't figure out exactly how.

92
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:02,641
He also can't figure out
how each of the men

93
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:04,765
were drained
of all their testosterone.

94
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,599
Not something you find every day.

95
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:09,805
We need help on this one, Prue.

96
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:12,244
The kind of help
I think only you can provide.

97
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:16,325
Do the victims have
anything else in common?

98
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:19,128
They were each members of
a dating service called Fine Romance.

99
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:20,768
I've already got the place staked out,

100
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:22,920
but they've got too many clients
for me to watch

101
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:25,398
and too many potential suspects
for me to track.

102
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:27,719
If the pattern continues,
somebody's gonna die tonight.

103
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:32,162
- I know it, and I can't stop it.
- I'll see what I can do.

104
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:36,608
I don't want you to get hurt.
Find out what you can, slip it to me.

105
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,884
The brass is watching me on this one.

106
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:44,207
This can't turn out to be
another unexplained case.

107
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:56,805
I'm telling you, Piper,
last night's dream was no dream.

108
00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:01,008
Or a premonition, even.
It was real. I felt it.

109
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:06,038
I was... I was so turned on,
and then...

110
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:11,319
- And then I killed him.
- Phoebe, you didn't kill anyone.

111
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:14,720
I could feel his body shake
uncontrollably beneath mine.

112
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,117
Now you're making me sick.

113
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,325
How do you think I feel? I'm living it.

114
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:21,162
- I could still taste his blood.
- Okay.

115
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,198
- Is anybody home?
- In here.

116
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:27,921
It's not lunch yet.
What are you doing home?

117
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:29,681
Morris came to visit.

118
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,608
- Pheebs, are you okay?
- I'm so hot.

119
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:37,839
100.5 degrees hot.

120
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:39,886
But she won't go see a doctor.

121
00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:43,361
- What did Morris want?
- Help.

122
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:49,082
Oh, my God.

123
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:54,960
It's the guys. All of them.

124
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:56,482
Phoebe, you were dreaming.

125
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:00,767
Of each and every one of the victims?
I don't think so.

126
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:03,124
I could see them
through my own eyes,

127
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:07,919
- feel every touch, smell every smell.
- How long have you had this feeling?

128
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:12,038
- The last four nights.
- Since the murders began.

129
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:14,519
Coincidence? I think not.

130
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,247
Well, maybe your powers are growing.

131
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:18,639
Maybe you can get premonitions
in your sleep now.

132
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,004
Or maybe you're just psychically linked
to the demon

133
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:24,479
- on its wavelength or something.
- Or maybe I'm the killer.

134
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:28,722
Come on, you guys,
it's not like there's no precedent.

135
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:31,198
I mean, Piper turned
into a werewolf once, remember?

136
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:32,882
- A wendigo.
- Whatever.

137
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:34,880
Look, if you are
psychically connected,

138
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:36,721
then maybe you can
go to the dating service,

139
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:38,402
touch some of the tapes
of the suspects,

140
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:40,127
see if you can get a psychic flash.

141
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,008
It's worth a shot. Then I'll stay here
and see if I can find anything

142
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:45,729
- in the Book of Shadows.
- I'm sorry, wait a minute.

143
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,767
I tell you that maybe
I'm some kind of man-killing demon,

144
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,920
and you want me
to go to bachelor central?

145
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:52,442
Phoebe, we have to do something.

146
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:54,964
Otherwise, someone else
is going to die tonight.

147
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:12,009
Oh, look at the racks
on those babes, huh?

148
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:14,325
Just do your job, Smith, okay?

149
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:18,642
I am doing my job, Morris. I'm taking
pictures of potential suspects.

150
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:21,961
If you ask me, those two suspects
got a lot of potential.

151
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:29,079
Hi, welcome to Fine Romance.
I'm Darla. How can I help you?

152
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:31,240
My sister Prue would like to sign up.

153
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:32,478
- I would?
- Yes, you would,

154
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:34,241
- while I look around.
- Right.

155
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:38,197
Well, Prue, today is your lucky day,
because we are running a special.

156
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:41,406
One year unlimited access
to our Internet and video library

157
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:44,447
with a money-back guarantee
for only $3,500.

158
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:48,278
Thirty-five-hundred bucks?
Okay, I could buy a man for that.

159
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,644
Oh, I can always tell
the frustrated ones.

160
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:53,727
You've been having man trouble lately,
haven't you?

161
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:05,522
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.

162
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:10,640
It's not a problem.
It's not a problem at all.

163
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:16,321
- Do you work here?
- Oh, no. Actually, I just...

164
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:18,321
- I just signed up.
- Really?

165
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:20,997
- Yeah.
- I mean, it's just that

166
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:22,397
you don't seem like the type

167
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:24,685
- that needs help finding a date.
- Ditto.

168
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:31,238
- Oh, I'm Owen. Owen Grant.
- Phoebe.

169
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:43,808
I have to go, okay?
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

170
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,800
- But, Phoebe...
- Sorry.

171
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:51,127
Congratulations, Prue, your days
of having trouble with men are over.

172
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:53,803
- See you at tonight's mixer?
- Okay.

173
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,728
You know, for your information,
I do not have man troubles.

174
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:58,766
Okay, financial ones now, yes,

175
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:02,239
- but definitely not any man troubles.
- We're out of here.

176
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:04,047
- It's all right.
- I don't, honest.

177
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:06,598
- Tell her.
- She doesn't.

178
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,687
Piper?

179
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:20,483
You're back.

180
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:23,447
- Did you find anything in the book?
- The book?

181
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:26,559
Or were you too busy
looking at something else?

182
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:29,960
I was looking.
You should see what I found.

183
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:32,764
Oh, I see what you found all right.

184
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:36,369
Great tan, nice body.

185
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,802
"When a witch renounces
all human emotion

186
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,569
and makes a pact with darkness
to protect herself from heartbreak,

187
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,527
she becomes a succubus,
a sexual predator."

188
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:47,759
Let me see that.

189
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:51,718
"She seeks out powerful men who
become helpless against her magic,

190
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:55,484
then feeds on their testosterone
with her razor-sharp tongue."

191
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:58,966
So this monster is an evil,
sexually-charged witch?

192
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:00,687
Yeah, but it's not you, Phoebe,

193
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:02,919
because you didn't make a pact
with darkness, right?

194
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:05,649
And as far as we know,
you don't have a razor-sharp tongue.

195
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:10,359
Here's a spell to attract the succubus
and destroy it with fire.

196
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:13,362
A flaming death for yours truly?
I don't think so.

197
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:15,360
Well, we have to catch this thing,
right?

198
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,566
So, what if I cast a spell to attract it,
and if it turns out to be you

199
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:21,243
who's attracted to me,
then Piper will freeze the room,

200
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,127
and we'll go from there.
Fair enough?

201
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:38,646
"By the forces of heaven and hell
Draw to us this woman fell

202
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:42,878
Rend from her foul desire
That she may perish as a moth to fire"

203
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:54,325
- See? I knew it wasn't you.
- I didn't burn. I'm okay.

204
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:55,962
I'm not.

205
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,087
- Oh, my God.
- God.

206
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:06,120
I don't believe it.

207
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,967
We have a new problem.

208
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:24,564
- Prue, please come out.
- Not until you reverse this spell.

209
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:27,163
Come on,
it's been over an hour already.

210
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:30,320
Do you think she's touching herself?

211
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:32,764
The book doesn't say
anything about a reversal.

212
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:36,205
Maybe you're supposed to stay a man
until you attract the succubus.

213
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:38,087
- Well, I'm not going anywhere.
- See?

214
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:42,919
You don't really have a choice.

215
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,523
I'm thinking we need to get you
to the dating service,

216
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:48,442
since that's where the succubus
picks her victims.

217
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:51,282
That is actually a really good idea.
She could...

218
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:53,519
He can sign up
like the rest of the guys.

219
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:55,685
Hey, I'm not signing up for anything.

220
00:14:56,409 --> 00:15:00,084
Lives are at stake, Prue.
Innocent men are going to die.

221
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:04,242
We're your sisters, Prue,
you don't have to be embarrassed.

222
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:05,808
We're not gonna laugh.

223
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:10,438
How can I save anyone?

224
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:14,644
Okay, I look ridiculous.

225
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:18,481
I am wearing clothes
from the ex-boyfriends' pile,

226
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:21,209
I have hair in strange places,

227
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:25,521
and I have a penis. This is not funny!

228
00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:30,039
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.

229
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:35,077
Prue, you don't actually
have to date anyone.

230
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:38,241
All you have to do is make yourself
seen and available.

231
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:40,604
You know, Prue,
the sooner you trap the succubus,

232
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:42,646
the sooner you'll become
a woman again.

233
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:46,925
That's easier said than done.

234
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:52,398
Okay, confidence.
The walk, the talk, the handshake,

235
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:54,241
it's all about confidence.

236
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:57,242
- Sports. Men like sports.
- And sincerity, that's key.

237
00:15:57,409 --> 00:15:59,604
But what really makes a man
is the clothes he wears,

238
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:01,361
the car he drives
and the money he earns,

239
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,679
- according to Cosmo.
- You're supposed to be helping.

240
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:05,521
Okay, let's work on your walk.

241
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:09,244
All you have to do is visualize a man
that you admire and then emulate him.

242
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,637
You know, the walk will follow.

243
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:12,606
A man that I admire.
All right, I got that.

244
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:14,760
Okay.

245
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:21,927
The man you admire
is Richard Simmons?

246
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:29,845
Okay, I will get Morris' files,
try to put together a list of attributes

247
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:32,204
the succubus is attracted to.
You two get the door.

248
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,400
- What?
- Well, think of it as a practice run

249
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:35,797
for the dating service.

250
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:39,120
Oh, oh, I know. Tom Hanks.

251
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,200
Everybody loves Tom Hanks.
Think of him.

252
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:43,280
- Tom Hanks.
- Everybody loves him.

253
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,646
Okay.

254
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,083
- Dan.
- Hi.

255
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:52,809
I didn't mean to interrupt,
but my freezer broke down,

256
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:56,564
and I wanted to see if I can get
some ice from you guys.

257
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:00,924
Oh, Dan, this is... This is...
This is Manny.

258
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:04,843
Manny Hanks. He's my friend.

259
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:07,569
Well, it's nice to meet you, Manny.

260
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:10,289
- Piper, come in here quick.
- Okay, coming.

261
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:12,724
- I'll be right back with that ice.
- Oh, wait, no.

262
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:14,482
He's a good man.

263
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,881
Have we met before?
You look familiar.

264
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:24,278
So have you known the sisters long?

265
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:28,200
I'm the brother that they never had.

266
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:32,959
- What happened?
- I just...

267
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:36,724
I had another one of those hot flashes,
the succubus vision.

268
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,279
Piper, I think I really am psychically
connected to that thing.

269
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:43,327
I see what she sees,
feel what she feels.

270
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:45,848
I felt excited.

271
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:49,043
Excited happy or excited aroused?

272
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:52,087
Piper, she's in heat, okay?
And so am I.

273
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:54,319
Well, that explains
why you're burning up.

274
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,798
Your libido must be connected
to the succubus.

275
00:17:56,969 --> 00:17:59,164
Yeah, well, it's like
I have no control over it.

276
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:05,807
It just happened again.

277
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:09,088
I saw egg sacs.

278
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:11,768
Oh, my God.

279
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,886
I think she's pregnant
or ready to hatch.

280
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,961
You mean there's gonna be
a whole brood of them killing men?

281
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:21,088
Unless we stop her,
I think that's exactly her plan.

282
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:24,402
So Piper isn't seeing anyone.

283
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:29,637
- No, not really.
- Then Piper is seeing someone.

284
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:33,519
No. Not really.

285
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:38,047
Look, I would just hate
to see her with a guy who,

286
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,683
oh, let's say on the third date,
just runs away.

287
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:45,320
- Don't you just hate men like that?
- I don't know any men like that.

288
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:50,362
How about those Niners?

289
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:55,202
- Okay, here's your ice.
- Oh, thanks.

290
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:57,246
Oh, you're welcome. Okay, bye-bye.

291
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:00,682
Take care.
Tell Jenny we said hi, okay?

292
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,805
- Okay.
- All right. Good.

293
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:08,047
- So?
- Oh, we're in big trouble. Huge.

294
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:14,759
You know, I think that it's the smaller
things that I look for in a relationship.

295
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:15,918
You know, like

296
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:21,443
listening to your partner,
kindness, respect.

297
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:24,119
And as far as I'm concerned,
there's nothing

298
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:28,043
sexier, nothing hotter
than someone who respects him...

299
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:30,321
Herself.

300
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:35,567
Because you know if she respects
herself then she respects others.

301
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:40,606
Can I just say that you are really
in touch with your feminine side.

302
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,401
You have no idea.

303
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:48,958
His name is Owen.
He signed up earlier today.

304
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:52,880
- Dr Owen Grant?
- Doctor?

305
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:54,408
Yeah, I guess that's him.

306
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,527
Do you have any way I can get
in touch with him? It's really important.

307
00:19:57,689 --> 00:20:00,487
Well, you could join for $3,500
and view his tape.

308
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:14,398
- I do not believe it.
- What?

309
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:18,642
Looks like neighbour Dan
signed up too. Interested?

310
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:26,683
Let's go.

311
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:34,400
Boy, a guy could do some serious
damage in there, you know?

312
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:37,328
Just drop all the pretence
and go a little caveman.

313
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:40,161
You're really something,
you know that, Smith?

314
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:42,923
I know it.
That's what the ladies tell me.

315
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:44,638
Man.

316
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,686
- It's boiling.
- Yeah, it is.

317
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:51,525
- Think I'll do a little investigating inside.
- No, you're not going anywhere.

318
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:54,761
Come on, it's a mixer, right?
I wanna go inside and mix it up.

319
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:59,206
Do you think the succubus
already got to Owen?

320
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:00,563
I mean, what if we're too late?

321
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:02,162
You would have
had a psychic flash

322
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,240
if we were,
and since you haven't, we're not.

323
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:05,922
Oh, there he is.

324
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:10,208
Hey, you know,
maybe I should take him back

325
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,519
to the manor to keep him safe.

326
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:15,164
You and him at the manor, alone?

327
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:18,321
- I'm just gonna talk with him.
- Well, you can just talk with him here.

328
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:21,401
I'm gonna go back to the video area
and check up on Prue.

329
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,880
Don't forget Dan's tape.

330
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:30,560
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

331
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:33,881
- Hi.
- Hi.

332
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:38,206
So, what you're saying is, my video will
now be available to all of your clients.

333
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:39,688
So, what with Internet access,

334
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:41,646
I should be able to meet women
as soon as when?

335
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,245
Mr Hanks, something tells me that you
could be dating as soon as tomorrow.

336
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:47,843
This is one great tape.

337
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:53,086
I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this.

338
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:56,127
Oh, come on.
Your sister paid for this, Mr Gordon.

339
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:58,723
- You can do it.
- No, this just isn't me.

340
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:01,449
Give it a try.
Just speak from your heart.

341
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:04,601
- What do you look for in a woman?
- What do I look for?

342
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,048
I don't know, I'm old-fashioned,
I guess. I...

343
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:12,600
I look for the girl next door.

344
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:16,883
Someone with a good heart,
good personality and looks to match.

345
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:20,678
The kind of girl that, when I leave
for work in the morning,

346
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:27,917
I wait just a little bit,
until she leaves for work too,

347
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:35,319
just to catch a glimpse
of that long dark hair and great smile,

348
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:40,719
hoping that maybe one day
she'll notice that I'm watching,

349
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:43,604
and she'll smile back at me.

350
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:52,567
Do you...?

351
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:55,728
Do you wanna get out of here
and take a walk or something?

352
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:02,966
- I would love to really, but I can't.
- You can't? Why not?

353
00:23:03,129 --> 00:23:04,767
Oh, it's hard...

354
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:10,080
...I mean, to explain, you know?
Is it really hot in here?

355
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:13,047
You know what? I'm gonna get you
something to drink. I'll be right back.

356
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:15,564
Okay. All right.

357
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:26,321
Oh, no. She's here.

358
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:29,882
- Piper!
- Hey, what's going on? Are you okay?

359
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,483
Yeah, we need to get out of here
fast, okay? Follow me.

360
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:36,884
If you could just stand here for a
minute and just stay in my sight, okay?

361
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,118
- Okay.
- Okay.

362
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:42,086
- She's here. I felt her.
- What? Where is she?

363
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:44,046
I don't know, but she's in the room
somewhere.

364
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:46,803
- She could be after Owen.
- Well, then get him out of here.

365
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:48,482
- Fast!
- Okay.

366
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:50,082
Where you going there, honey?

367
00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:51,238
Excuse me.

368
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:54,606
No, no, no, I'd like to have a little talk
with you, huh? In private.

369
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:02,561
What the hell's the matter
with you, Smith? Let her go!

370
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:06,761
Manny, it's Owen. Take him out fast.

371
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:14,046
What are you doing? Your powers.

372
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:16,564
Hey, hey, that's enough, all right?
You're under arrest!

373
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:20,487
That's it. You're under arrest, pal.

374
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:23,402
Cuff the other one, Smith.

375
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:30,527
This is...
This is bad. This is really bad.

376
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:35,806
It's getting worse.

377
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:38,881
The succubus isn't attracted
to Owen anymore.

378
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:42,764
- She's attracted to Prue.
- Perfect.

379
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:54,637
You want me to release him?
Your friend punched a cop.

380
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:57,721
Four men have died in the last
four nights, but none so far tonight.

381
00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:00,608
- Why do you think that is?
- Because of Manny, that's why.

382
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:04,125
And if he stays in jail,
another innocent man might get killed.

383
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:07,083
I suppose you want me
to release this...

384
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:10,287
- This Dr Owen Grant too, huh?
- No.

385
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:12,280
Actually, he's still a potential victim.

386
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:15,168
As long as he's here, he's safe.
You can't let him out.

387
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:23,163
This is going to bite me in the ass.
I know it is.

388
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:33,321
You know, I'm surprised
we men ever get anything done.

389
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:35,923
You know, all I seem
to think about is sex.

390
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:38,802
It's like it's non-stop,
very debilitating.

391
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:42,282
Tell me about it.
Hey, did you fix the air conditioning?

392
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:44,485
Yeah, I just had to clean the filter.

393
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:47,209
Airflow clog must've thrown
the breaker.

394
00:25:48,489 --> 00:25:52,448
Guess who that was.
Alan from Buckland's.

395
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:53,962
Alan? Wait, he actually called?

396
00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:55,881
Yeah, and he wants
to go out with you again.

397
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:59,240
- So much for our rejection theory.
- Well, what did you tell him?

398
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:02,401
I went out on a limb and told him
you were feeling a bit hormonal.

399
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:07,685
102.5 degrees.
Probably normal for a succubus.

400
00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:11,086
But not so good for you.
I really think you should call a doctor.

401
00:26:11,249 --> 00:26:12,762
Piper, there's nothing that he can do.

402
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:16,399
It's the connection with the succubus.
It's getting stronger.

403
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:18,958
Probably because she missed
her nightly feeding.

404
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:22,678
She didn't get Owen or Prue.
She needs to kill, I can feel it.

405
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:26,080
- Okay, what are we gonna do?
- All right, I got a plan.

406
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:28,001
The dating service called.
Turns out my video

407
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,241
broke some kind of house record.
Twenty hits this morning.

408
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:34,287
One of them might be the succubus,
so I lined up dates with all of them.

409
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:35,643
- What?
- Yep,

410
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:37,208
at your club tonight starting at 6.

411
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:40,088
No, no, not tonight. The Cranberries
are coming in for a sound check

412
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:42,809
before the benefit tomorrow.
I can't risk scaring them away.

413
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:46,086
Oh, that's no problem. I'll just nail
the succubus before they get there.

414
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:47,807
Oh, you're gonna nail her, are you?

415
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:50,688
Okay, so this whole man thing,
this sort of short-circuits

416
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:54,046
the old maybe-l-should-consult-
my-sisters wiring now, doesn't it?

417
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,279
Just step right in and take over.

418
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,679
Didn't start happening
until she sucker-punched Owen.

419
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:02,603
- Well, you had a problem, I fixed it.
- Oh, you bet your butt you did.

420
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:05,806
- You nearly broke his jaw.
- I saved his life.

421
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:08,847
Look, you're the one who told me
I had to practice being a man, right?

422
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:12,121
So I acted on instinct. And to tell you
the truth, the moment that I hit him,

423
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:14,757
I felt powerful and strong,
like somehow that made me a man.

424
00:27:15,449 --> 00:27:18,646
You wanna know how to be
a real man? Look at Dan.

425
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:21,528
Honest, kind, good heart.

426
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:25,079
The type of guy who would risk being
late to work just to make you smile.

427
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:26,648
Not some bully who walks around

428
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:29,448
thinking one punch
is gonna change anything.

429
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:34,644
She learned all that
just from looking out a window?

430
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:44,088
Oh, yeah, nice body, great tan.

431
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:47,401
Awesome truck.

432
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,241
You know, I think you really are
becoming a man.

433
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:59,448
Oh, man. Look at that. Look at that.

434
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:01,725
I can hardly even see out of that,
and you let him walk.

435
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,800
Why don't you try looking
at the club for a while.

436
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:06,563
The sooner we catch the perp,
the sooner I can have you reassigned.

437
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:13,567
I just hope that the succubus
gets here fast, because I am dying.

438
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:15,806
Okay, focus on the plan.

439
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:20,278
Manny lures the succubus
into the alley, and then I freeze her...

440
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,919
And then he uses
his testosterone-charged powers

441
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:27,525
to fend her off
until she bursts into flames. I got it.

442
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:36,277
Did Manny just check out
that girl's butt?

443
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:39,407
Oh, God, this is starting to get weird.

444
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:42,362
It's starting to get weird?
Where you been?

445
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:47,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

446
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:56,645
- You don't recognize me, do you?
- No. Sorry, should I?

447
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:02,677
I work at Buckland's
with Prue Halliwell.

448
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:08,008
- Manny. Manny Hanks.
- Alan Stanton. Nice to meet you.

449
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:12,687
- So you know Prue, huh?
- Yeah, we go way back.

450
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:16,560
Yeah, well, Prue and I
actually dated a few times.

451
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:19,607
When it comes
to dating women these days,

452
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:21,600
I just can't figure out what they want.

453
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:25,041
It's a real confusing time to be a man.

454
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:28,965
- You mean, like in what way?
- Like every way.

455
00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:31,723
I mean, even opening doors
or pulling out chairs.

456
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:33,481
Some women expect it,
other women hate it.

457
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:36,322
You never know which camp
they're in until it's too late.

458
00:29:36,489 --> 00:29:38,002
Well, which camp
do you think Prue's in?

459
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:40,000
Prue?

460
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:43,923
The good one, the one that likes it.
She's cool.

461
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:48,885
I had no idea. I mean...

462
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:51,605
You know, I bet she had no idea.
Have you told her?

463
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:56,284
Are you kidding? Probably scare
her away if I haven't already.

464
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:59,086
Where's Prue? I lost her. Him.

465
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:00,841
She's over there talking to A...

466
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:03,404
What?

467
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:08,321
The succubus. She's here.
I'm seeing what she's seeing.

468
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:10,360
- What? Where is she?
- She's here somewhere.

469
00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:14,437
She just spotted Prue.

470
00:30:16,969 --> 00:30:20,006
Wait. Isn't that the woman
from the dating service?

471
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:21,921
The one that videotaped Prue?

472
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:24,525
You know Prue,
she's on the rebound.

473
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,157
And I respect her too much
to force the issue.

474
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:29,919
I didn't wanna move too fast.

475
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:33,399
Although I think about it now, maybe
I went too slow and got her mad at me.

476
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:36,763
Same damn confusing rules,
you know what I mean?

477
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:38,322
Yeah, I'm beginning to.

478
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:43,963
- Yeah?
- Prue, she's here.

479
00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:45,198
Get to the alley quick.

480
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:47,803
It's Jan from the dating service,
the one in the red dress.

481
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:51,086
Right, on my way.
Sorry, Alan, gotta go.

482
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:57,560
Hi. Hi. Jan, right?
From Fine Romance?

483
00:30:57,769 --> 00:30:59,202
Yes. Have we met?

484
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:08,443
It's not you.

485
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:16,688
Hello, Manny.

486
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:23,682
- What's happening to me?
- You're falling in love.

487
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:27,086
You want me. You need me.

488
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:31,163
Tell me I'm irresistible. Tell me.

489
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:33,363
You're irresistible.

490
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:43,321
What happened?
Why didn't you use your power?

491
00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:45,241
I was trying to use it,
and it wouldn't work.

492
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:47,479
- And then I felt like I was...
- Impotent?

493
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:49,640
You know, a little advice
about men, Phoebe.

494
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:52,528
When we fail at something, generally
we don't like to hear the word...

495
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:53,838
- Impotent?
- Yeah...

496
00:31:55,969 --> 00:31:57,482
Oh, no!

497
00:31:58,489 --> 00:31:59,968
Freeze right there!

498
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:05,005
Stop, or I'll shoot! Stop!

499
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:22,163
She's dead, but I don't know
what the hell that was.

500
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:24,923
- You guys okay?
- I think so.

501
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:26,886
Looks like you got your collar.

502
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:30,480
Okay, how come I'm still a man?

503
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:38,880
Toxicology won't be back for a week,

504
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:41,324
but the preliminary blood panel
did show something odd.

505
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:44,287
This woman's endocrine system
showed high levels of testosterone.

506
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:45,723
Testosterone?

507
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:48,479
How...? How's that even possible?

508
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:50,287
I won't know for certain
until the autopsy,

509
00:32:50,449 --> 00:32:51,802
but if it turns out to be accurate,

510
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:54,199
you've definitely got the killer
you've been looking for.

511
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:56,519
I tell you, there's something
really weird about this.

512
00:32:56,729 --> 00:32:58,685
It's a real shame. She's a babe.

513
00:33:27,849 --> 00:33:32,206
I don't understand. It says,
to attract and destroy the succubus,

514
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:35,719
she will come to us
and burst into flames.

515
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:38,005
Yeah, well, it came all right,

516
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,400
but it certainly didn't burst.
And worse, I'm still a man.

517
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:44,960
What I don't understand is,
why wasn't I able to use my power?

518
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:46,403
I don't know.

519
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:54,088
You know, men are just as afraid
of being rejected as women are.

520
00:33:54,729 --> 00:33:57,243
Trust me. I mean, that's probably
why Dan hasn't asked you out.

521
00:33:57,409 --> 00:33:59,047
He's afraid you'll say no.

522
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:01,279
Like you'd know.

523
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:03,480
- Do you?
- I'm a guy, aren't I?

524
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:09,401
You guys, the succubus,
she's still alive. I felt her kill again.

525
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:11,958
- Oh, no.
- Why wasn't I able to destroy her?

526
00:34:12,209 --> 00:34:15,042
- We can still finish this.
- How?

527
00:34:15,249 --> 00:34:17,365
I mean, she knocked me out, guys.
I mean,

528
00:34:17,529 --> 00:34:20,566
really, it was like I was in a trance.
I was weak in the knees.

529
00:34:20,729 --> 00:34:23,084
And for a moment,
I felt her need not to be rejected

530
00:34:23,249 --> 00:34:24,841
as though it would devastate her.

531
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:27,524
Great, we're dealing
with a sensitive man-killing demon.

532
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:30,398
Yeah, well, we gotta be missing
something. You keep looking.

533
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,366
I gotta go take a leak.

534
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,565
All right, don't forget
to put the seat back down.

535
00:34:34,729 --> 00:34:36,765
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

536
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:40,439
- Anything there?
- No, nothing at all.

537
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:45,278
Phoebe?

538
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:49,208
She's here.

539
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,680
The succubus, she's in the house.

540
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:54,563
Prue!

541
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:57,838
Prue! Where'd she go?

542
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:06,364
I watched your tape
over and over again.

543
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:09,447
The things you said, I...

544
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:12,923
You can't resist me.

545
00:35:16,169 --> 00:35:18,603
We have to find Prue, Phoebe,
or she's dead.

546
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:21,840
I'm connected again.

547
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:25,158
- I'm seeing Prue. She's alive.
- Okay, where is she?

548
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:29,083
The same place the other victims
were, but I don't know where that is.

549
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:32,958
God, I'm gonna watch her kill Prue,
and there's nothing I can do about it.

550
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:34,722
Wait, listen to me. I have an idea.

551
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:37,528
If you are connected to the succubus,
then the succubus

552
00:35:37,689 --> 00:35:39,964
- is connected to you, right?
- What are you talking about?

553
00:35:40,129 --> 00:35:42,006
You have to reverse
the psychic connection.

554
00:35:42,169 --> 00:35:44,842
You have to use your power
to project back to the succubus

555
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,842
to help Prue resist her.
What's the succubus saying?

556
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:52,601
- Tell me you want me.
- I want you.

557
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:55,125
- She wants Prue to want her.
- Okay.

558
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:58,042
Talk through the succubus,
tell Prue that she doesn't want her,

559
00:35:58,209 --> 00:36:00,165
she'll never want her. Tell her.

560
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,883
- Tell me you need me.
- I need you.

561
00:36:03,489 --> 00:36:06,162
Talk to Prue like she's
right in front of you, Phoebe.

562
00:36:06,569 --> 00:36:08,560
Tell her that she's not a man,
she's a woman.

563
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:10,038
Tell me

564
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,598
- You're not a man. You're a woman.
- That you're a woman.

565
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:14,527
- I'm a woman.
- What?

566
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:17,243
You can resist, Prue.
Only a man is...

567
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,808
- powerless against me?

568
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:22,757
I can resist you.
In fact, I'm rejecting you.

569
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:26,399
What? You can't resist me!
I'm irresistible!

570
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:28,287
Not to me, you're not, you bitch.

571
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:56,966
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

572
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:01,049
- And so is Prue.
- What about the succubus?

573
00:37:01,209 --> 00:37:02,278
She's dead.

574
00:37:12,729 --> 00:37:16,722
Oh, well, well, and I thought
the heat wave was over.

575
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:20,040
- Yeah, Prue, you look hot.
- I'm just grateful to be back in heels.

576
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:23,406
Well, let me see. Oh, yeah,
you definitely have that walk down.

577
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,281
Well, we'll see
if Alan agrees with that.

578
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:27,719
Oh, Alan. I thought
you thought he wasn't interested.

579
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:30,244
Yeah, I was wrong.
Just a little gender confusion.

580
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:33,719
Looks like you learned a few things
about being a woman by being a man.

581
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:36,323
Actually, I did.
I mean, we're different,

582
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:39,049
which I'm glad about that,
but we're also similar in many ways.

583
00:37:39,249 --> 00:37:41,717
You know,
we all feel the same emotions.

584
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:44,160
It's just that if we don't
communicate honestly,

585
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,207
then we read between the lines
and tend to get everything screwed up.

586
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:51,760
And sometimes it's just up to us
to open the door first, take a chance.

587
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,960
Oh, you finally called him, huh?

588
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:56,439
I got some good advice
from the brother I never had.

589
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,645
- Excuse me.
- You're welcome.

590
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:01,929
- So, what about you, Pheebs?
- Me?

591
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:08,568
I actually have an appointment
with a doctor I've been dying to see.

592
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:12,599
- I'm still running a little bit hot.
- I see that. He winked at you.

593
00:38:12,769 --> 00:38:15,442
Folks, it's a real pleasure
for me to introduce,

594
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:18,362
in a one-night-only benefit
for the Animal Rights Fund,

595
00:38:18,569 --> 00:38:19,843
The Cranberries!

596
00:38:55,089 --> 00:38:56,283
Glad you could make it.

597
00:38:56,449 --> 00:38:58,440
Are you kidding?
I'm just glad you called.

598
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:02,241
Truth is, I've been wanting
to call you for some time now.

599
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:04,644
Really? I never would've guessed.

600
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:07,365
- You wanna dance?
- Sure.

601
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:23,998
- Alan, hey, good to see you.
- I'm glad you called back, Prue.

602
00:39:24,169 --> 00:39:26,729
I have to admit
that I didn't think you would.

603
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:29,881
Well, I wasn't going to at first,
but then I...

604
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,481
I met this really nice guy,
and he encouraged me to go ahead.

605
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:36,442
Yeah, well, who is he?
I wanna thank him.

606
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:40,285
Oh, I'll thank him. Cranberries.

607
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:42,041
Let's go.
