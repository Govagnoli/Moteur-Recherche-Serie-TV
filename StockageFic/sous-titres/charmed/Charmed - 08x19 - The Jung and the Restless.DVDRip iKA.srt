1
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,131
Piper, it's not that simple.

2
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,176
What do you mean it's not that simple?
They vanquished the un-vanquishable.

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,221
Yeah, that just makes them
powerful, though, not bad.

4
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,430
Don't be so naive.

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,308
Christy was raised by the Triad
who wanted us dead, remember?

6
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,978
I understand that, but that doesn't
mean Billie and Christy want us dead.

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,398
They're the Ultimate Power.
They were chosen to take us out.

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,608
Don't you see that?

9
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,194
No, actually I don't.

10
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,446
Look, I mean, yeah, it's a possibility.

11
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,949
- But we're not there yet.
- Aren't we?

12
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,119
Okay, witch, whitelighter, wife.

13
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,289
I give up. How do I juggle all this?

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,003
- What are we arguing about?
- The Ultimate Power, what else?

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,298
Her name is Billie, and I think
we should help her, not hurt her.

16
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,134
Okay, what if she tries
to hurt us first? Then what?

17
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,054
Back to your corners.

18
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,056
Here's the deal.
This is difficult for us, right?

19
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,976
So we should probably try
to be nice to each other.

20
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,312
Especially hard on me.
Gee, she used to be my charge.

21
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,982
So you're saying, what?
That you side with Phoebe?

22
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,859
No, I didn't say that at all.

23
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,485
I'm saying it's messing
with our lives.

24
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,613
I mean, you with P3 and the boys,
you with work and Cupid.

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,282
Michael.

26
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,243
And me, lucky little me,

27
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,329
I am stuck with another
future whitelighter.

28
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,540
Which means I don't even get to see
my new husband.

29
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,208
Well, at least you have a husband.

30
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,169
I'm still trying to get mine back.

31
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,962
And I'm still trying to find a husband,

32
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,131
but that doesn't mean that we can't...

33
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:32,551
- What?
- Oh, dear, she's in trouble.

34
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:33,760
Is this ever gonna end?

35
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,641
I'm gonna go try and make a potion.

36
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,059
To do what?

37
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,477
What do you think?

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,355
Okay, but I just don't think
I'm ready for this right now.

39
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,524
Better get ready.

40
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,202
Holy crap!

41
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,996
Duck! Arrow!

42
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,541
Paige, I don't understand.
Where did you come from?

43
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,543
See for yourself.

44
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,466
Hey, Colin, did you come visit
your daddy today at work?

45
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,719
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's great.

46
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,014
Hello, little missy.

47
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,058
I like your hair like that. I wear
my hair like that, too, sometimes.

48
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,646
Oh, oh, this is nice.

49
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,107
Oh, they're so cute, aren't they?

50
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,942
Of course you'll never have
one of your own

51
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,652
unless you follow through with a date.

52
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,155
What are you doing back here?

53
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,157
I'm just trying to figure you out,

54
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,992
which I thought I already had.

55
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,123
Okay, get up. Get up! Get up!

56
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,667
Hey, hey, hey! Okay.

57
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,128
If you don't start taking this
more seriously,

58
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,797
you're gonna be sitting here alone
again next year for career day.

59
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,467
You know what, I don't want to deal
with this right now, okay?

60
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,886
No, no, it's not okay.
Not by a long shot.

61
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,931
You know, I worked my tail off to find
you a perfectly good match in Michael.

62
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,140
And what do I get for it?

63
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,851
- You go out with him once.
- So?

64
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,687
So I've got a reputation to protect.
I've never missed.

65
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,023
Well, there's a first time for everything.

66
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,400
No, no, no. Not when it
comes to finding love.

67
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,652
Not when it comes to me.

68
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,529
You are so cocky, you know that?

69
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,322
You're damn right I am.

70
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,199
I know you, Phoebe, inside and out.

71
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,201
I have researched
every nook and cranny.

72
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,537
Okay, that makes me feel violated.

73
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,041
I know what you're looking for
in a man, believe me.

74
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,252
I am an expert in you.

75
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,630
Which is exactly why I know there's
absolutely nothing wrong with Michael.

76
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,924
Okay, so I'm just supposed
to marry the guy?

77
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,219
No, of course not.
I didn't say he was the one.

78
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,887
- The point is...
- You know what,

79
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,431
I don't care what your point is
right now, okay?

80
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,851
I'm dealing with a lot.

81
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,061
And I'm trying to balance
everything out.

82
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,230
Phoebe, love is paramount.

83
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,899
Not now. Okay, please, not now.

84
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,780
You know, maybe you should
try reaching out to Billie, talk to her.

85
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,327
How do you know?

86
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,705
I told you.

87
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:30,956
I know you.

88
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,800
What are you doing?

89
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,844
Just trying to figure
this whole stupid thing out.

90
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,013
- You know, if this really is destined.
- It is.

91
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,599
Well, then it should be written
somewhere, don't you think?

92
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,184
Everything else is.

93
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,311
Billie, why do you keep fighting this?

94
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,857
Because... Because I don't like it.
Okay? It sucks.

95
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,818
I just, I feel like I walked out
on my family.

96
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,280
I know, but they're not your family,
Billie. They never were.

97
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,449
They used you.

98
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,284
I just don't believe that.

99
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,786
It's because you don't want
to believe that.

100
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,788
And I don't blame you.

101
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:16,460
I mean, after you trusted them and you
befriended them, you were betrayed.

102
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,670
I just feel like this is a huge
misunderstanding.

103
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,506
If we could just talk to them, maybe...

104
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,342
We tried talking to them, but they
don't care about us or you.

105
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,052
They only care about themselves.

106
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,637
That's all they've
ever cared about.

107
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,639
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

108
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,808
What did they want to do to you
when they first met you?

109
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,562
They wanted to train you,
to teach you the craft.

110
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,813
Yes, and they did.

111
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,399
Yeah, but not for you.
It was for them.

112
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,485
So they could kick back and do
whatever they wanted,

113
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,780
and you could go out there
and risk your life and do their job.

114
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:48,200
I mean, they're supposed to be
the Charmed Ones, Billie, not you.

115
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:51,370
They're good people Christy.
They've helped hundreds of innocents.

116
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,996
Not lately, they haven't.

117
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,876
Lately, they've been doing everything
for themselves, for their personal gain.

118
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,503
And it's not right.

119
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,673
I mean, they faked their deaths,
they've bartered with destiny,

120
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,844
they've remade the world
with avatars, all for themselves.

121
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,388
I mean, does that sound like
the greater good to you?

122
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:12,599
You know, you talk about them
like they're evil or something.

123
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,561
Billie, it's not about good or evil.
It's about power.

124
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,231
And absolute power
corrupts absolutely.

125
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:22,067
I mean, they feel like they don't
have to live by the rules anymore.

126
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,861
That they can do whatever they want,

127
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,863
and no one's gonna be there
to stop them.

128
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,781
Yeah, and what am I supposed to do?

129
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,491
- Stop them?
- No.

130
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,619
No, we're supposed to stop them.
It's our destiny.

131
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,873
I'm just not ready to do that. I can't.

132
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,292
Well, you have to get ready.
We both do.

133
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,087
If we don't stop them, nobody will.

134
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,630
It's up to us.

135
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,766
What's wrong?

136
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,604
Nothing. I just... I need to clear my
head, get out of here for a while, so...

137
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,230
I'll be back.

138
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,576
Overpowered by the powerless.

139
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,286
What happened?

140
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,164
She was saved
by her whitelighter, Salek.

141
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,374
Then you should've shot
both of them.

142
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,126
She wasn't just a whitelighter, Salek.

143
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,794
She was a Charmed One.

144
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,256
- How do you know?
- You've taught us well.

145
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,760
Not well enough, apparently.

146
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,138
Where is she now, the charge?

147
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:34,681
I don't know.

148
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,934
The witch cloaked her with her magic.

149
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,769
- Should I move on to another charge?
- No.

150
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:42,397
I want this one.
To lure the Charmed One.

151
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,945
There is no better prize.

152
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,698
- But I'm not sure how to tr...
- You won't have to. I'll do it myself.

153
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,285
I've waited my whole life
for an opportunity like this.

154
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,954
But I must be patient.

155
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,164
I must wait for just the right opening.

156
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,501
But, in success, the underworld
will bow to you.

157
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:03,794
The demons won't stand there...

158
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,672
I don't give a damn
what the demons think!

159
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,759
Let them cling to their prophecies
of Ultimate Powers,

160
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,845
their rumours of final battles.

161
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,306
I only care about one battle.

162
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,979
Okay, stay put.
I will be right back, okay?

163
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,480
Wait, where are you going?

164
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,107
I have to go check on my sister.

165
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,400
Well, you just did that.

166
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,151
See, actually, no.
It's my other sister.

167
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,903
Look, I know you're freaked out
right now,

168
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,739
but I've got so many things going on,
so if you could wait here a sec...

169
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,032
Wait a minute.
What about me?

170
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,827
I still don't understand anything
that's going on here. I mean, okay,

171
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,496
- witches and blacklighters?
- Oh, no, no, darklighters.

172
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,747
But what does it mean?

173
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,166
What does it have to do with me?

174
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,710
You see, I told you, you are
a future whitelighter.

175
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,004
I'll explain more about that later,
too, okay?

176
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,672
Are you sure you got the right person?

177
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,092
Positive. Otherwise the darklighters
wouldn't be trying to stop you

178
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,510
from becoming a whitelighter.

179
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:59,183
- Darklighters?
- No, crazy sister.

180
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,851
Okay, here's the deal:

181
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,478
You're safe, so stay put,
have a seat on the couch.

182
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:04,897
I'll be back as soon as I can.

183
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,366
Hey there, what did that mannequin
ever do to you?

184
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,576
Cute.

185
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,578
Poor thing.

186
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,916
- What are you doing?
- Making a power-of-three potion.

187
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,584
Oh, for what?

188
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,044
Oh, Piper.

189
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:31,131
Look, sooner or later you two are
gonna realise that it's us or them,

190
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,091
and I for one would like to be ready.

191
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,386
Look, you can't just vanquish
Billie and Christy.

192
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,972
For one thing, you know,
it's illegal.

193
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,390
Is that the best you got?

194
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,060
Well, I think that's a pretty valid point.

195
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,647
Look, we know you
wanna get Leo back.

196
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,983
You know what? I'm tired of everybody
using that against me,

197
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,277
like it diminishes my credibility
or something.

198
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,487
Because it doesn't.

199
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,448
Well, you must admit, it's probably
clouding your judgement a little bit.

200
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,909
That sounds more like something
Phoebe would say.

201
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,078
- Yeah, she just did.
- What do you mean, she just did?

202
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,747
- When did she say that exactly?
- On the phone, a few minutes ago.

203
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,791
Oh, I see.

204
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,294
She's taking your calls
but she's not taking my calls.

205
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,089
- Where is she?
- She's at home.

206
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,719
- Where are you going?
- To find out what her problem is.

207
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:20,973
Sisters.

208
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,143
Hey, sweetie, I'm really glad you came.
Come in.

209
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:26,812
Are we alone?

210
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,647
Yeah, of course we are.

211
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:32,609
So how are you doing?
You okay?

212
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,695
What do you wanna talk about?

213
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:39,449
I would imagine the same thing
that you wanna talk about.

214
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,118
I mean, that's why
you're here, right?

215
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,161
Well, I'm a little confused
right now, that's all.

216
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,789
Well, what are you confused about?

217
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,374
Why you all used me.

218
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,626
Is that Christy talking?

219
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,547
- Don't blame this on her.
- I'm not blaming anything on her.

220
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,341
I'm just trying to understand, okay?

221
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,011
Look, Billie, we're not
the bad guys here.

222
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,304
Well, she thinks you are.

223
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,930
Okay, well, she's wrong.

224
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:05,142
She thinks you're using your powers
for yourselves, not the greater good.

225
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,977
And sooner or later...

226
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,480
Sooner or later, what?

227
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:12,357
You'll have to be stopped.

228
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,319
Is that what you think too?

229
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,988
I don't know, okay?
That's why I'm here.

230
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,700
You said we were alone.

231
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,660
Hello, we were alone.

232
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,287
What are you doing here?

233
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,206
Wondering what she's doing here.

234
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,500
We're just having a little chat.

235
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,835
Good, great. I'm listening.

236
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,338
Stay away from my sister.

237
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,089
Okay, how did you get in?

238
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,884
The same way we're leaving.
Let's go.

239
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,178
Okay, can't we just all
talk about this, please?

240
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,513
There's nothing to talk about.

241
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,847
- All right, then.
- Don't. Piper!

242
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,020
- No, Piper!
- Do you need any more proof?

243
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,444
Do you?

244
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,625
Here's something to help you relax.

245
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,961
Doubt it.

246
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,295
You got anything stronger?

247
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,548
It's a little early for that,
don't you think?

248
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,800
It's 5:00 somewhere.

249
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:25,806
Okay, I take it you whitelighters
aren't one for a drink, huh?

250
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,767
Well, if you had a life like mine...

251
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,357
Mikelle, look, I know
your history, okay?

252
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,943
I know you've had a tough time.

253
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,946
The thing is, though, you don't believe
in yourself.

254
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:43,115
You keep telling yourself
you're going to be nothing,

255
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,992
you will in fact be nothing.

256
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,453
Clearly, the reason
I was sent to help you,

257
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:51,456
was to help you see that you're
meant for something special.

258
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:54,835
You're sweet.

259
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,756
I just think it's gonna take a lot more
than some nice words and a cup of tea

260
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:03,427
to make me believe that I'm meant
for something in my life.

261
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,973
- I should probably go.
- No.

262
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,058
You can't go. Can't leave, sorry.

263
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,644
You obviously have other things
to worry about.

264
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,772
You can't, because we haven't found
the darklighter who's after you, okay?

265
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,107
It is too dangerous out there.

266
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,443
You haven't even started
looking for him yet.

267
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,322
Piper, why didn't you just freeze them?

268
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,407
Because it wouldn't have worked.

269
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,492
Okay, so it's better to just start a war?

270
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,828
Oh, stop.
It was one lousy potion.

271
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,789
I just meant to scare them.
I wasn't gonna take them out with that.

272
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,291
"Take them out"?

273
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,418
Why don't you say what
you really mean?

274
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,086
Kill them.

275
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,880
Girls, be nice.

276
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,758
- I'm out of here.
- No, just stay, okay?

277
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,469
Please. Stay. Have some tea.

278
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,472
What were you even doing there?

279
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,641
Why were you hiding it from me?

280
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,142
Look, I'm only in the way here.

281
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:53,727
No, you're not, please stay.

282
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,312
Hey, a little help here, please?

283
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,193
There. I froze somebody.
Happy?

284
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,195
All right, you two.
This is ridiculous.

285
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:06,073
We're not gonna solve anything
by fighting with each other.

286
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,325
Since when did you become
the big sister?

287
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,160
Since you stopped acting like one.

288
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,497
And you, what's this whole sneaking
around behind our backs thing?

289
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,333
It's not what we need right now.
It's not making our lives any easier.

290
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,462
You know what, I'm really glad I went,
because I actually learned something.

291
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,506
Like what?
That they would like to kill us?

292
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:26,677
No, that, just in their twisted reality,
they think that we're the bad guys.

293
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,680
It's not a twisted reality.
It's a Triad reality.

294
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:33,016
They brainwash Christy, just like
Christy's gonna brainwash Billie.

295
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,309
Well, not necessarily.

296
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,769
And, look, you know,
they're right.

297
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,604
We're not all about
the greater good anymore.

298
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,273
No one can expect us to be.

299
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,899
We've been doing this
for eight years,

300
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:44,194
and we've done a lot of
really great good in my opinion.

301
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,614
Hello?

302
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,742
What do you mean,
the band's not coming?

303
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,369
I have a signed contract.

304
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,037
I don't?

305
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,207
Well, that's too bad. You're gonna
have to figure that one out,

306
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,626
because, you know,
I got stuff going on.

307
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,004
How the hell did that happen?

308
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:05,174
We're spreading ourselves too thin.
I can't even find a stupid darklighter.

309
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,593
I'm sure she doesn't think he's stupid.

310
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,220
- Thank you for the guilt.
- Okay, regardless of what you think,

311
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,556
the cold, hard fact is,
the power of three is needed

312
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:15,767
to stop Billie and Christy,
whether you like it or not.

313
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:20,397
Well, I'm sorry, I just still don't like it.

314
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,236
What about you?

315
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,988
I don't know yet.

316
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,948
But I have a charge to save.

317
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,083
They threw a potion at us, Billie.

318
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,252
At both of us.

319
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,088
She didn't mean to.
She just wants Leo back.

320
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,090
So that means she has to kill us?

321
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,259
That wouldn't have killed us,
you know that.

322
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,012
Billie, this is insane. I cannot believe
you're defending them.

323
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,097
I'm not, or I am...

324
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:58,310
I don't know. Look, maybe they're just
as confused about all this as we are.

325
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:01,188
- I'm not confused.
- Well, I am.

326
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,816
I'm sorry, but I am.
This isn't easy for me.

327
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:09,363
- I care about them a lot, you know.
- I know.

328
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,408
I just wish I knew more,
so I could know what to do.

329
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,661
I can show you.

330
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:18,872
The same way the Triad showed me.

331
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,542
I was meant to be taken, Billie,
to be shown the way,

332
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,837
just like you were meant to find me,
so I could show you.

333
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,005
- The way?
- Our path.

334
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:30,175
It's the one we're meant to share
together for the greater good.

335
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,469
But before you can do
what you have to do,

336
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,972
first you have to see that their core,

337
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,932
their inner truths,

338
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,059
are not for the greater good.

339
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,854
That they don't deserve
to keep their powers.

340
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,815
They lost the way.

341
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,817
Are you ready to see that?

342
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,047
Hey.

343
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,841
What, bad time?

344
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,634
No, I just walked in the door.

345
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:16,180
Yeah, I know.
I've been hovering in the ether.

346
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,223
So did you talk to Billie? How did it go?

347
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,519
Yeah, I talked to her right up until
the point where Piper tried to kill her.

348
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,147
What?
What are you talking about?

349
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:28,358
I don't wanna go through it again,
but it didn't go well.

350
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:32,237
And I don't wanna bore you
with all this family drama.

351
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,780
Well, I'm here. Bore me.

352
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,324
But it has nothing to do with love.

353
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,577
Yeah, it does.
Family love. It's your sisters, right?

354
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,829
Come on, try me.

355
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:45,792
Okay, if I ask you a question,

356
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,462
you have to promise me that you're
gonna be really honest.

357
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,130
Yeah, absolutely.

358
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:54,801
Do you think I'm selfish?

359
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,887
- Selfish?
- Yeah, selfish.

360
00:18:57,054 --> 00:19:00,057
I mean, do you think it's wrong
for me to want a life

361
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:04,686
after being charmed? You know,
with work and friends and...

362
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,146
Love?

363
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:09,066
Yeah. And love too.

364
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,693
I mean, is it wrong for me
to want those things?

365
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,071
No, I mean, not as far as
I'm concerned.

366
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,532
And obviously not as far as
the Elders are concerned either.

367
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,992
Otherwise they wouldn't have
sent me down here to you.

368
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,329
I may be talking out of turn,
because I don't know for sure,

369
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,665
but I would think,
with everything you've done,

370
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:28,252
for as long as you've done it,
you deserve to have a life.

371
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,795
All of you do.
You've earned it.

372
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,881
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

373
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:37,344
I just don't think Billie and Christy
see it that way.

374
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:38,679
That doesn't matter.

375
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:45,978
It's Billie.

376
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,563
What do I do?

377
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,356
Whatever your heart tells you to.

378
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,528
Hello.

379
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,451
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

380
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,205
I need to know if Billie and Christy
are the ones

381
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,207
we're going to have to fight
to get Leo back.

382
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,084
Boy, you get right to the point,
don't you?

383
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,794
Please.

384
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,172
I don't know, Piper.
I'm sorry.

385
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,215
Only the Angel of Destiny knows.

386
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,967
How is that possible?

387
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,887
If this is the great threat everybody's
so worried about,

388
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,722
how can you not know who it is?

389
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,307
What do you guys do up there all day?

390
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:28,145
- We think that it might be, yes.
- Perfect.

391
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:31,064
Especially after the involvement
of the Triad.

392
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,859
You have to understand that this plan
was put into motion

393
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,486
years before you even knew
that you were witches.

394
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,448
But why?

395
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:42,868
Perhaps they anticipated that no one
would ever be able to defeat you.

396
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:45,245
So rather than looking for
more demons,

397
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,207
they recruited powerful witches,
just like you.

398
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,875
And perhaps even more importantly...

399
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,127
...powerful sisters.

400
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:55,172
Would you like to explain that
to Phoebe?

401
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:57,382
Because I don't think she's
gonna believe me.

402
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,801
It won't make it any easier
for her to know.

403
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,847
Billie is a friend.

404
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:08,185
A person. That's what makes it
all the more insidious.

405
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,898
So how do we defeat them?

406
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,235
I wish I knew.

407
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,827
Hey, guess who just called.

408
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,539
Did she say what she wanted?

409
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,707
Just that she wanted to speak to us.

410
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,292
This could very well be a trap.

411
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,544
Did she call Phoebe?

412
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,753
Yeah, she did.

413
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,172
Well, at the risk of your wrath,

414
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:40,133
I'm gonna tell you that
this could be a very bad idea.

415
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,136
I know, but please, let's just
listen to what Billie has to say.

416
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,471
I just spoke with an Elder,

417
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,391
and she confirmed those two could be
very big trouble for us.

418
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,893
- What?
- She wasn't 100 percent sure,

419
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,896
but it is a possibility,
which means, sooner or later...

420
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:59,236
Considering you wanna kill us,
maybe you should use the front door.

421
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,905
I don't wanna kill you, Piper.
I just wanna find out the truth.

422
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,491
- Well, how do we help you find that?
- Like this:

423
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:13,375
You promise not to hurt them, right?

424
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:16,086
Not until you see what
you need to see.

425
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,976
They're barely breathing.

426
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:34,813
The potion put them into a deep sleep,
so all they do is dream.

427
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,524
And since dreams provide insight,

428
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,235
you'll be able to see
what they truly care about.

429
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,612
How?

430
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,572
Paige?

431
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:44,781
Who are you?

432
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:47,284
I'm Mikelle. I'm her charge.

433
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,123
- Oh, my God.
- Wait. No, no, no. It's okay.

434
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,167
- Just let her go.
- But what if she's in trouble?

435
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,628
She's not our concern.
They are.

436
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:03,467
Looks like your whitelighter
left you uncloaked. Big mistake.

437
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,844
No, no, no.

438
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,554
Please, what do you want?

439
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:11,934
I want your screams
to draw her directly to me.

440
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,481
Everything in dream world
has a meaning.

441
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:20,817
All the people, the places,
the emotions,

442
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,737
they're all manifestations of
who they truly are,

443
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,155
together as well as separately.

444
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:28,325
- Will they know they're dreaming?
- Yes.

445
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,995
They'll probably think they were sent
there, so you'll have to be careful.

446
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:35,082
You just have to play a role,

447
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,668
and make them believe that
you're part of their dreams.

448
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:39,753
Well, how am I gonna find
their inner truths?

449
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,631
Well, they'll have to find their
inner truths in order to wake up.

450
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,132
All you have to do is follow them.

451
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:48,929
Just think of a sister,
and... you're there.

452
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,556
That's dream world.

453
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,641
This will get you in and out.

454
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:56,186
- Are you ready?
- I hope you're wrong.

455
00:23:56,687 --> 00:24:01,233
Billie, if I am wrong, we'll leave them
alone just like I promised.

456
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,027
- But if I'm not...
- I know, I know.

457
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,052
Anything?

458
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,264
No, everything seems normal, sort of.

459
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,057
Yeah, well, Mikelle is gone.

460
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,934
And so is Billie.

461
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,978
She obviously did something to us.

462
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,772
- Yeah, but what?
- I don't know, but this is weird.

463
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,566
And that's never good.

464
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,569
I told you it was a trap.

465
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:48,780
Okay, well, we need to figure out
what she did to us, and fast.

466
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,494
Oh, why don't we just ask her?

467
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:55,662
Oh, hey, guys, what's up?

468
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,289
I'm late for class. Bye.

469
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:59,249
No, you don't.

470
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,174
Jesse, over here, I was...

471
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:09,635
- I do too.
- Very well, thank you.

472
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:13,889
- In here.
- We have till next Tuesday.

473
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:16,225
I'm still waiting for the fax.

474
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:20,270
This article's too long.
You've gotta cut it down.

475
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:23,815
Wait, can't we just take some space
from "Ask Phoebe"?

476
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,109
Well, Mom, what do you think?

477
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,278
Wait, did you just say "Mom"? What?

478
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:31,740
So just answer one letter today,
will it kill you?

479
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:33,909
- Hold on, wait a minute.
- We're running out of time.

480
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:37,079
You know, you can't keep
putting us on hold.

481
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,457
Baby, come here.

482
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,418
- "Baby"?
- Honey, come on.

483
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:55,472
What the hell is going on?

484
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,976
Piper? Phoebe? Henry?

485
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,228
Henry's not here.

486
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:02,604
Who the?

487
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,648
But then you're not looking
for him anyway.

488
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,984
What do you mean?
I'm not?

489
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:08,986
Follow me.

490
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:17,953
Hold on, wait.

491
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,165
What about me?

492
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,167
Mikelle, what are you doing here?

493
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,627
I need your help.

494
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:31,842
Okay, stay here and wait for me.
I'll be right back.

495
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,349
I want my money back!

496
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:42,060
Where's the band?
This is a rip-off.

497
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,439
Excuse you.

498
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:48,442
You gonna tell them you forgot
to sign the contract?

499
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:49,818
What?

500
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,406
You can't keep neglecting everything
for Leo, you know.

501
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:55,657
Hey, wait...

502
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,289
You!

503
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:08,003
All right, I want answers now.

504
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:15,552
- I'm listening.
- What's your problem?

505
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:19,264
My problem? My problem is, I wanna
know what you did to us and why.

506
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,058
I didn't do anything.
You did it.

507
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:23,227
I did it?
What does that mean?

508
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,645
You tell me. It's your dream.

509
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:27,564
My dream?
What are you talking about?

510
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,067
I asked you a question.

511
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,361
What are you gonna do,
blow me up again like last time?

512
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:35,197
- Last time?
- Every damn dream lately,

513
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:38,617
that's all you ever do. It's like I'm
responsible for Leo or something.

514
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,911
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

515
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:43,163
Look, I'm not the bad guy here, okay?

516
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,749
As much as you want to demonize me,
I am not the problem.

517
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,085
Okay, fine. Then what is?

518
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:49,336
How do I know?

519
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,964
Look, you know the truth,
you know what you're all about.

520
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,507
Find it.

521
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,553
Phoebe.

522
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:19,616
We...

523
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:21,160
We shouldn't be doing this.

524
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:22,369
We have to hurry.

525
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:24,746
What do you mean?
Why do you keep saying that?

526
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:28,125
You want a family, don't you? Kids?

527
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:32,671
Well, yeah, but doesn't it go against
all the Cupid rules?

528
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:35,465
There are no rules in a dream.

529
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:38,010
A dream?

530
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:39,887
Is that what this is?

531
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:42,681
This can be whatever you want it to be.

532
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:45,934
Wait a minute.

533
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:49,938
You and me in a dream...

534
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:52,900
Oh, boy.

535
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:57,487
Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

536
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:01,450
- Let's get this organized.
- What's the deadline on that?

537
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:09,208
What the hell...?

538
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,212
Come, seek.

539
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,674
Seek what exactly?

540
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,301
Your inner truth.

541
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:22,346
What you keep searching for,
and what keeps eluding you.

542
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:24,932
Please tell me I'm not dreaming
about myself.

543
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,517
Why can't I dream about
somebody cool,

544
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:28,018
like, I don't know,
Quentin Tarantino?

545
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:29,937
Not until you find you.

546
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,022
The search for self is a noble one.

547
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:33,774
And if you don't find it,

548
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:38,654
you'll be lost, imbalanced,
and ultimately, spread too thin.

549
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,906
Yeah, well, tell me something
I don't know.

550
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,699
You don't know me.

551
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:45,536
But you want to, more than anything.

552
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,047
Paige.

553
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,094
Mikelle.

554
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:09,393
Piper?

555
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,894
Paige?

556
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:14,022
Oh, Piper, thank God I found you.

557
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:15,566
Wait, this is you, right?

558
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,401
Not some weird, wacky manifestation?

559
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:19,486
Wacky? Maybe.

560
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:20,988
You think we're dreaming too?

561
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:22,739
What else could it be?

562
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:26,535
What I don't get is,
why would Billie do this to us?

563
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:28,078
I mean, what does she
get out of it?

564
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:30,372
I don't know, but we have to
figure out a way to wake up.

565
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,916
Otherwise, we're in deep trouble.

566
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:36,170
Oh, so now you're worried about
Billie and Christy.

567
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:40,883
Well, yeah, I mean, I may be an
optimist, but I'm not stupid, you know.

568
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:44,094
- Have you seen Paige?
- No, you?

569
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,305
Well, they don't wanna kill us.

570
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:48,807
If they did, we'd be dead,
not dreaming.

571
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:50,934
What were you dreaming about?

572
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:55,105
Neglect. Apparently I put everything
in my life on hold for Leo.

573
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:56,773
Sounds about right.

574
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:58,442
What were you dreaming about?

575
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:02,779
Oh, you know, I'd rather not
get into it, really.

576
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:10,954
Oh, okay, I was dreaming about
me and Coop, and...

577
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:14,124
You know, we were doing stuff.

578
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:18,086
Hang on a second.
So you were having sex dreams

579
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,214
while I'm sitting here,
wracked with guilt?

580
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,384
I'm sure he was just representing what
I really wanted, you know. I mean...

581
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:26,762
I don't want him, obviously, you know,

582
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:29,806
because, even if I did, I couldn't...
I couldn't have him,

583
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:32,309
because of all the rules.

584
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,105
Okay, so you're the big psychology
major. How do we get out of this?

585
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:38,315
What do we do now?

586
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:40,150
I think we go deeper.

587
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:42,903
I think we have to follow our dreams
wherever they lead us,

588
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,739
and hope that we wake up.

589
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,491
Hopefully.

590
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:49,952
Okay, so how do we do that?

591
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,913
I don't know. Let's start by interpreting
where we've already been,

592
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,958
and try to figure out where
our dreams are gonna take us.

593
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:10,639
Paige.

594
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:13,350
You, get me out of here now.

595
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:16,019
I don't know what you're talking about.

596
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:19,565
Look, I don't have time
for this crap, okay?

597
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:22,609
You wanna stop us?
You think we're selfish? Whatever.

598
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:26,071
But if you don't get me out of here
right now, my charge is going to die.

599
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:27,656
Is that what you want?

600
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:46,216
Welcome back.

601
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:51,346
What's this?

602
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:52,890
I didn't have a choice.

603
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,809
Piper? Phoebe?

604
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,311
They can't wake up. Not yet.

605
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:59,438
But don't worry.
They'll be fine, I promise.

606
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:01,106
They better be.

607
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:07,237
I gotta get back.

608
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:13,744
- Paige.
- Oh, my God. Mikelle.

609
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:30,511
Well, hopefully you'll die faster
than it took you to get here.

610
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:40,729
I don't understand.
Why isn't it working?

611
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:41,939
I don't know.

612
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,273
Maybe we're thinking
too hard.

613
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,068
Maybe we just need to let go
and see what happens.

614
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:48,111
I can't. I'm too worried.
I'm worried about Paige.

615
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,530
I mean, why haven't
we seen her?

616
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:51,448
- Maybe she got out.
- Or maybe not.

617
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:53,492
Well, there's nothing we can do
until we get back,

618
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:55,410
so our only choice is
to follow our dreams.

619
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,746
All right, all right, all right.

620
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,209
Okay, what did Billie say to you
at the club?

621
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:04,169
She said something about,

622
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:07,339
I kept blowing her up, and, you know,
right about now

623
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:09,258
that seems like a pretty fabulous idea.

624
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:10,884
Blowing her up, why?

625
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,846
Because I think she's
responsible for Leo,

626
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:17,766
which, if she's talking about getting
him back, then she would be correct.

627
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:21,061
Okay, maybe you need to stop
focusing on Billie and focus on Leo.

628
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:22,980
I mean, that's what
the bartender said too.

629
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,900
And what about you and your lover?

630
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,735
I don't think it relates to him.

631
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:30,571
I mean, not directly anyway.

632
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,531
I think it more has to do with...

633
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:34,324
Mommy, Mommy!

634
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:35,951
Did you hear that?

635
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:37,995
What, your tall, exotic lover?

636
00:34:38,162 --> 00:34:39,204
No.

637
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:40,706
Mommy, hurry!

638
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:42,833
You didn't hear that?

639
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,502
Okay, you wait here.

640
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:47,754
Keep thinking about Leo.

641
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,261
I'm sorry, Mommy.

642
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:56,221
Okay.

643
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:58,098
Just go with it.

644
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:02,686
What happened, little sweet girl?

645
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:06,106
I wanted some cookies but I fell.

646
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:07,733
Oh, well, that's okay.

647
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,067
Mommy's here now.

648
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:11,028
Okay.

649
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:13,030
You almost didn't make it.

650
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:14,364
You almost missed me.

651
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:16,450
What do you mean?

652
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:21,038
You gotta hurry.
Or it's gonna be too late to have me.

653
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:24,750
Don't you want me, Mommy?

654
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:28,045
Yes, of course I do.

655
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:30,797
More than anything in this world.

656
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,606
You're it.

657
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,816
Go on.

658
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,026
I said no...

659
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:53,362
- Tag.
- I'm it again.

660
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:55,239
You're it.

661
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:58,116
All right, you're it.

662
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:01,829
Tag, you're it.

663
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:05,707
Can't catch me.

664
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,502
Music to the ear, huh?

665
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,839
A house full of grandkids.

666
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:14,424
It's what we always dreamed of,
isn't it...

667
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,218
...Piper?

668
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:18,929
Leo?

669
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:29,064
Save me.

670
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:30,858
Whatever it takes.

671
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:37,489
Piper?

672
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:43,537
Help.

673
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:50,294
We're back.

674
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,004
Yeah, but where's Paige?

675
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,714
You don't think Billie...

676
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:57,843
No, she didn't do this to hurt us,
but she did it for some reason.

677
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,136
So is she off the hook?

678
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:03,307
Hardly, but that's tomorrow's problem.
Now we gotta find Paige.

679
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:09,646
Well?

680
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:12,566
It's not wrong for them
to want what they want.

681
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:15,110
It is when they've got
the kind of powers they do.

682
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:17,654
And when they use those powers
to get what they want

683
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,323
at the expense of all else.

684
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:25,078
Somebody's gotta stop them, Billie,
before it's too late.

685
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,499
I know.

686
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,673
No need to waste good arrows.

687
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,179
You're a strong one, aren't you?

688
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:43,889
But it'll be over soon.

689
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:49,853
You're too late.

690
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:55,943
Oh, my God. Paige. Paige.
Hang in there.

691
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,779
- What do we do?
- We need a whitelighter.

692
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,869
Maybe that's why I'm here.

693
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:37,234
Mikelle?

694
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:38,610
Paige.

695
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:40,362
You were right.

696
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:43,574
I was meant for something special.

697
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:45,701
And I think I just did it.

698
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:26,742
Hey, how you doing?
You okay?

699
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:29,286
Yeah, I guess I'm okay. Considering.

700
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,079
Considering what?

701
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:33,540
Considering that I was supposed
to save my charge,

702
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:35,792
and instead she wound up saving me.

703
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:39,713
Maybe Billie's right.
Maybe we are selfish.

704
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,757
No, wanting a life
doesn't make us selfish.

705
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:43,175
It makes us normal.

706
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:45,928
Yeah, well, we're not normal.
We're "the Charmed Ones. "

707
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:48,639
Nobody said we had to be that
for the rest of our lives.

708
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:50,265
It's not written in stone.

709
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:54,478
Yeah, and if wanting children
and enlightenment and Leo back

710
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:57,105
makes us selfish, then I'm guilty.

711
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:59,316
I'd say we've done enough.

712
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,151
And that doesn't make us evil.

713
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:05,113
Well, I think it does from Billie
and Christy's warped point of view.

714
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,908
So, what are we gonna do?

715
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:11,995
We're gonna stop them.

716
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:16,250
Before they stop us.
