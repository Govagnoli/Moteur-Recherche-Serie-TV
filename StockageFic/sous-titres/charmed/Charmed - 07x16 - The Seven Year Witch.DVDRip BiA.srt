1
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,349
Weren't we here before? Doesn't
that mattress look strangely familiar?

2
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,727
That's probably because
we saw one like it in the last alley

3
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,562
and the 150 before that.

4
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,106
They all start to look
the same after a while.

5
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,568
Now where is this paragon of good
we're supposed to protect?

6
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,738
Hey, slow down.
We gotta be careful.

7
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,574
I just need to get home
before Leo is sentenced.

8
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,161
When the Elders hand down
their punishment, you're gonna know.

9
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,247
Well, this waiting business sucks!

10
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:42,417
Leo was an Avatar for less time than
it's taking them to make up their minds.

11
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,796
It's gonna be okay.
You're not gonna lose Leo again.

12
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,466
The Elders still need him.
They're not gonna do anything rash.

13
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,927
Besides, it's Phoebe
we should be worrying about.

14
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,054
Her man's disappearing tonight.

15
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,099
Her what? She didn't tell me
she had a thing for Drake.

16
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,268
Well, she didn't tell me either,

17
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,646
but he's cute, he's funny, he's smart
and he's destined to leave.

18
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,982
That sounds like her type to a T.

19
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,652
How many times does a girl have
to get hurt before she just wakes up!

20
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,405
So you think she's...

21
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,823
...the innocent.

22
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,910
No I don't think she's the innocent.
I think she definitely has a part...

23
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,162
Behind you, the innocent.

24
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,915
If you women need a hot meal
and a place to crash...

25
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,252
Okay, hi. I'm wearing lip gloss,
do I look homeless?

26
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,629
For god sakes.

27
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:34,386
I think Phoebe's just
been unlucky in love lately.

28
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,763
Do ya think? Hey!

29
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,021
Ugly, metal thing!

30
00:01:56,241 --> 00:02:00,120
Did we know
that the female spits thorns?

31
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,374
We need to have Leo look at this.

32
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,628
It's fine, really. Leo?

33
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,301
- Why are you wearing those?
- The Elders made their decision.

34
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,054
- I have to go.
- Right now?

35
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:20,641
You can't go right now, the boys are
in school, you won't be able to say...

36
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,561
This isn't goodbye, okay? I'm just
going to find out what my punishment is.

37
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,731
You make it sound like
it's no big deal. What if it's bad?

38
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,150
Well, then we'll deal with it.

39
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,278
You're the one who said
the Elders couldn't yank me away.

40
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:36,073
That was before I had time
to stress out about it.

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,117
At least now we're gonna know.
That's a good thing.

42
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,203
The waiting's been killing us.

43
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,874
Yeah, I know, it's just...
I have a bad feeling.

44
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,501
Me too.

45
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,838
But we've been through worse.

46
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,759
We just have to have faith.

47
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,349
- I love you.
- I love you too.

48
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,561
Good luck.

49
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:15,047
Unfortunately the council has been
unable to decide your fate, Leo.

50
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,007
So that's good, right?

51
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,760
- I'm not gonna be punished?
- We didn't say that.

52
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,429
We understand and we fully accept

53
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,016
how being betrayed by an Elder,
by Gideon, led you to the Avatars.

54
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,268
That doesn't excuse your betraying us.

55
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,437
The council has come to realize

56
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,815
that the problem is your effort
to balance two worlds,

57
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,026
yours with us and yours with Piper.

58
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:40,531
The only solution is to find out which
world you belong in, once and for all.

59
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,200
- How?
- A test, if you will.

60
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:47,579
You'll be made mortal, stripped of your
powers and memories and relocated.

61
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:52,584
If the love you share for Piper is so
strong that you're drawn back to her,

62
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,795
then you will live with her forever.

63
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,465
To live fully as a human, without any
interference from us, ever again.

64
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,093
What if I never find her? Then what?

65
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,930
Then it means that your destiny
is with us, and we will welcome you.

66
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,725
- You'll never see your family.
- You out of your mind? I won't do that.

67
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,270
- You have no choice.
- You have to know, Leo.

68
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:15,232
This is not about punishing you,
this is about helping you find your way.

69
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,152
If I end up with Piper, how do I know
you won't eventually butt in again?

70
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,655
Or if I wind up with you as an Elder,

71
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,033
how do you know I'm not gonna
leave, by falling from grace?

72
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,955
- No Elder has ever done that before.
- You take away my family and I will.

73
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,708
We're not taking away anything from you.

74
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,377
This is about you
making a choice. Not us.

75
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,796
Don't you see? This is the only way.

76
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:42,092
Your heart will guide you to your
destiny, be it love or the greater good.

77
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:46,722
Whatever way it turns out,
we will honour it. As you also must.

78
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,268
Fine, I'll do it. But first,
I'm gonna say 'bye to Piper.

79
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,145
It doesn't work that way.

80
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:58,400
Look, I said I'd take your damn test.
I'm gonna say goodbye to my family.

81
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,237
No! The test begins now!

82
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,855
- Come on, we gotta get you outta here.
- Come on.

83
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,712
Check on his legs.
Move the Jeep! Go! Go! Go!

84
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,265
What the hell.
You got any idea what you're doing?

85
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,225
Bite down!

86
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,270
Get in there!

87
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,693
How the hell did you know to do that?

88
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,743
It doesn't look too bad.
They should be able to sew that up.

89
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,496
Got lucky for once,
almost runnin' over a doctor.

90
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,834
You are a doctor, right?

91
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,211
I don't know.

92
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,090
What do you mean you don't know?

93
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,261
Leo went to the Elders this morning,
haven't heard from him since.

94
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,889
That's crazy.
We've been to the Alps and back.

95
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,391
How long does it take
to hand down a sentence?

96
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:58,729
In defence of the Elders, when you live
for an eternity, time does get skewed.

97
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,231
Well, we're human, so this is torture.

98
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,358
This is ridiculous.

99
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,111
Listen, what the hell did you do to Leo?

100
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,614
We tried that already,
didn't work so much.

101
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,243
I'm not saving another innocent till I
find out what happened. You hear me?

102
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,498
I'm not saving another innocent
till you tell us what's going on here!

103
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,957
Don't worry.

104
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,630
- Leo's fine.
- So then where is he?

105
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,425
Piper, the Elders came to
the consensus that Leo has lost his way.

106
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,678
So we've sent him on a path
towards following his destiny.

107
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,015
Like the prodigal son
out to find his way in the world?

108
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,768
This Elder speak is not working for me.

109
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,979
I need straight answers.
What exactly did you do to him?

110
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:44,441
We erased his memories
and put him back on Earth, as a mortal.

111
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:48,820
- Somewhere you'll never find him.
- What? He doesn't remember anything?

112
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,989
Piper or his sons? Nothing?

113
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,700
- Not even having been an Elder.
- That's crazy.

114
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,954
You don't have the right
to wipe out someone's mind.

115
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,041
- An entire life, my life?
- Leo was not just someone, Piper.

116
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:05,462
He was an Elder, by his own choice.
He knew all that that entailed.

117
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,965
He was also a husband
and a father by choice,

118
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,342
and he would never abandon his family!

119
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,594
This was not an easy decision for us,

120
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,430
we love Leo up there
as much as you do down here.

121
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:19,351
He wasn't killed, or recycled. I hope
that you can find comfort in that.

122
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:24,147
You lobotomized the love of my life
and you want me to take comfort in what?

123
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,400
You've got a lot of nerve, lady.

124
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:30,237
Now I don't want to see you again
or any of your kind, ever again.

125
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,239
We're done with all of you.

126
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,700
Now please, go.

127
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,119
Don't give up hope.

128
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,830
You need to stop talking.
Now get out of my house.

129
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,378
That's ridiculous.

130
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,550
Piper, I know this seems
really bad but we can't give up hope.

131
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:56,513
Leo is out there somewhere, and I'm sure
there's lots of ways we can find him.

132
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,348
- How?
- I don't know.

133
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,519
We can scry for him. He doesn't have
his powers, so that might be difficult.

134
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:06,356
- We could... I don't know.
- This is your idea of a rah-rah speech?

135
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,860
You're supposed to cheer her up,
not push her off the ledge.

136
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:14,448
Well, you know what, Paige?
Maybe I'm just rah-rah-ed out.

137
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:21,413
Maybe it's time we face the fact that
perhaps we're not meant to find love.

138
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,332
That is ridiculous.

139
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:27,628
How many Halliwell women have actually
been able to hold on to their men?

140
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,465
Name one.

141
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,427
You're right. That's so depressing.

142
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,263
Exactly. We're destined to be spinsters.

143
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,018
- All for the greater good.
- We might as well be nuns.

144
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:46,522
- With better outfits.
- Now we... all right, let's...

145
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,234
...86 that kind of talk now people,
we will not give up on love.

146
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,945
Repeat, not give up
on love, love is everything.

147
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,447
That's why you're here,
that's why I'm here.

148
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,033
I thought you were here to teach.

149
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,327
The point is, you're young, you're hot,

150
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,664
you got magic powers, come on,
the whole life's ahead of you!

151
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:06,250
That's sweet,
and we appreciate you trying,

152
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,253
but you die at midnight,
and we have to keep fighting.

153
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,423
But love never dies. You might as well
die with me if you're gonna give up.

154
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,260
Leo and Piper's love,
it's epic, it's massive,

155
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,930
like Romeo and Juliet, Anthony
and Cleopatra, Brad and Jennifer.

156
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:22,266
All tragedies, I might add.

157
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,436
Better to have loved and lost than yada
yada yada. The point is it's not lost.

158
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:30,107
I mean, he's lost, but he's not lost.
All you gotta do is find Leo.

159
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:33,402
Either way, if the Elders
don't want us to find him,

160
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,279
we're not gonna be able to.

161
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,239
They're gonna leave it up to him.

162
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:42,286
Come on. The longer you take to look for
Leo, the harder he's gonna be to find.

163
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,289
Or we can stay here
and feel sorry for ourselves.

164
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,959
My husband just developed
a serious case of amnesia.

165
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:53,213
- Give me a moment!
- Phoebe.

166
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,636
If love isn't worth
fighting for, then what is?

167
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,600
We'll look in the Book of Shadows
and see if there's a way to find Leo.

168
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,809
Amen.

169
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,687
- I could check at Magic School.
- Now we're talkin'.

170
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:12,649
Piper, Call Darryl. Now that Leo's
mortal, he might be able to track him.

171
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,568
- Could we go upstairs?
- What?

172
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,486
The Book of Shadows. Let's go.

173
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,211
That ought to do it.
Once we get you in the system,

174
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,005
we'll be on the road
to finding out who you really are.

175
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:38,759
- Thanks.
- You sure you don't remember anything?

176
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,845
Normally, a person with
amnesia remembers something.

177
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,891
I wish I did. Believe me.

178
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,270
Well, at least we know
you're one of the good guys.

179
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,940
Saved old Clyde's life.

180
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:57,236
The paramedics told me that the way you
fixed up his leg looked professional.

181
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,613
Instinct, I guess.

182
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,950
It seems to me that
you could be a doctor,

183
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,160
or a medic or something.

184
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:09,039
- Anything ring a bell?
- No, nothing.

185
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,834
It's okay.

186
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,920
It'll come to you.
Just gonna take some time.

187
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,550
You see that? Old Glen's
got you on the database already.

188
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,685
You're bound to be a bit jumpy.

189
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,980
I'm guessing you went through
some kind of hell to get here.

190
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,233
Yeah, maybe.

191
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,237
Let me take you to Nadine's
to get something to eat

192
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,322
while we sift through the computer.

193
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,992
I'd rather stay here.

194
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,120
A man can't think straight
on an empty stomach.

195
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:52,207
Besides, chances are you got some
loved ones out there looking for you,

196
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:56,253
and once we get the word out,
they'll find you soon enough.

197
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,088
Come on.

198
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,759
We'll never find him,
not scrying anyway.

199
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:06,430
And I don't think we're gonna
make it to the Taj Mahal by sunset.

200
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:10,726
I feel terrible about
ruining your last day here.

201
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:14,605
Don't scry for me, Argentina.
I'm exactly where I want to be.

202
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,108
- In a dingy attic?
- Helping those I'm leaving behind.

203
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,695
See, that's the other
really irritating thing.

204
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:25,908
You're hell-bent on helping Piper and
Leo, and yet you won't let us help you.

205
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,118
Phoebe, I made a deal.

206
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,996
I got to be human
for a whole year, my time is up.

207
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,290
I know, but you made
a deal with a demon.

208
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:38,295
We're the good guys, the Charmed Ones,
why don't you let us help you?

209
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:42,591
Because I've done all I need to do to
die a happy man, all except one thing.

210
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:46,553
- See Niagara Falls?
- Make sure you don't give up on love.

211
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,723
Please. Not that again.

212
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,518
Look, I'm just being realistic.

213
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,437
I have been heartbroken
so many times by love,

214
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:59,441
that I'm beginning to think that
I'm supposed to live my life without it.

215
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,569
That is ridiculous. Nobody is.

216
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:06,114
I've been demonic without love.
I know what I'm talking about.

217
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,825
Love is transcendent, it's miraculous.

218
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,162
It also can save Piper and Leo.

219
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:16,542
Well, I hope so, because if it can't
I'm joining the convent.

220
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,714
The Elders
had an original thought for once.

221
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,217
There's no precedent
for what they've done.

222
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,052
We can't find anything either.

223
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,721
Maybe I should try scrying for him,

224
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:33,684
maybe my Whitelighter side
can tap into something in him.

225
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:39,106
It would be great to be able
to tell Piper something good for once.

226
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,733
Darryl, you have
to do something, anything.

227
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,694
I'm doing the best that I can.

228
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:47,072
The only fingerprints that I have
on Leo are from World War II,

229
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:51,910
and I can't use them because they don't
match his photograph, he's too young.

230
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:55,247
- But you have to find him.
- I will, I promise.

231
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:58,125
- It just might take a little time.
- Well, how long?

232
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,378
Long enough that he has
a new life, a new wife and new kids?

233
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,756
- That is not acceptable!
- Piper, just take a breath.

234
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,759
I don't need to take a breath,
I need to find my husband!

235
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:23,233
Oh, God. Somebody please help me!

236
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,337
Oh, no! Am I dead again?!

237
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,218
Well, not yet, anyway.

238
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,938
I don't know which is worse.
The fact that I'm dying,

239
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:04,775
or that I'm gonna be spending
my last dying moments with you.

240
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,653
I'd say that's what
you should be worried about.

241
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,948
You're not looking so hot.

242
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,243
- What?
- What?

243
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,663
- What are you doing here?
- You called for me.

244
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,792
- I didn't call for you.
- You asked for help. Here I am.

245
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,879
You're the answer to my prayers?
I don't think so, that's just plain...

246
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,549
Piper! Oh, my God! Piper!

247
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,759
Piper, wake up! Piper!

248
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:36,223
- Guys, hi, over here.
- They can't hear you. Or see you.

249
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,017
Thorn demon, I knew
I should have had Leo heal her.

250
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,186
Or maybe it's the shock of losing Leo?

251
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:42,688
- Maybe both.
- Guys!

252
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:45,357
Look really, over here! Watch.

253
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:48,110
- Nice try.
- Shut up!

254
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:51,321
I've run into a few
of these thorn demons myself.

255
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,073
Those pricks can be vicious.

256
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,285
Pun intended. The poison
works slowly but is also fatal.

257
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,120
Wait, fatal?

258
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:00,956
We're gonna have
to call the Elders to heal her.

259
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,624
Over my dead body.

260
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,835
- Piper will kill us.
- She'll be alive!

261
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:07,296
If it's slow working,
that'll give us time.

262
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,631
Maybe we can have
some sort of options.

263
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:13,427
I hate this. I feel so out of control,
like there's nothing we can do.

264
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:14,928
We gotta find Leo.

265
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,931
- He can't help us anymore.
- He's the only one who can.

266
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,475
You weren't paying attention
to my love rant.

267
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:23,520
- Are you saying she's lovesick.
- That's ridiculous.

268
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,899
And it can kill her. Happens
all the time to the bereaved.

269
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,193
If we heal Piper, she still needs Leo.

270
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,154
Pay attention.
He could be on to something.

271
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:33,780
What do you know?

272
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:37,743
You and I should go down to see Darryl
and help speed this whole thing up.

273
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,788
Come on. It's a poison thorn. Could
somebody please go check the Book?

274
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,167
I'm gonna check the Book upstairs,
see what I can do for Piper.

275
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:49,087
- Call us if she gets worse.
- Don't worry, love will conquer all.

276
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,423
What beauty.

277
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,551
"She doth teach
the torches to burn bright."

278
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,891
What?

279
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:03,894
Nothing.

280
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,190
Since when do you quote Shakespeare?

281
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:10,442
It's a recent affliction, actually.

282
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:14,238
But the demon is right,
you know. It is all about love.

283
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:19,785
What are you, exactly? Ghost?
Demon? Poltergeist? Nightmare?

284
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,787
None of the above.

285
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:24,456
We're caught in a cosmic void...

286
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,000
...between life and death.

287
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,461
- I'm stuck with you?
- No.

288
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:32,673
If you play your cards right,
you can get out of this limbo.

289
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,967
I'm the one who's here for all eternity.

290
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,219
Paying penance for your evil past.

291
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:38,637
You were the smart one.

292
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,514
- Cut the crap.
- And direct.

293
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:43,058
I miss that. Actually, no, I don't.

294
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,395
Can you please just tell me
what you're doing here?

295
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:47,855
Simple.

296
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,942
I'm here to help keep you
and Leo... together.

297
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,736
Right.

298
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:02,828
I'm trying to do a good deed, make
sure that you don't end up like me.

299
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:05,873
- This is the thanks I get.
- I know what you're doing.

300
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:10,252
This is just a ploy to break out of your
ungodly plane and back into our lives.

301
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:15,966
- See? I'm right.
- I'm not above an ulterior motive.

302
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,177
- Exactly.
- But...

303
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,971
...l'm here for one reason
and one reason only:

304
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:24,099
To help you find your love...
while you still can.

305
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:37,362
Looks like you worked up an appetite
being the big hero this morning.

306
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:41,575
Since it's on the house, why don't you
try something a bit more substantial?

307
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:45,245
No, this is amazing.
I think it was the best pie I ever had.

308
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,080
I'd take that as a compliment,

309
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,334
except that you can't remember
tying your own shoelaces.

310
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:54,796
I bet you have someone somewhere
who cooks for you just fine.

311
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,841
When it all comes back to you.

312
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:01,220
I'm sorry,
I tend to stick my foot in it.

313
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:05,307
It's okay.
Just wish I could remember.

314
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,481
It looks like you had
a wedding ring on.

315
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:14,483
I guess.

316
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:25,244
- Maybe she dumped you.
- What? No...

317
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,164
Maybe she smacked you on the head
with some cast iron for cheatin' on her

318
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:30,916
and knocked you out.

319
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,670
I wish I'd done that when I found
my husband cheatin' on me.

320
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,713
She didn't dump me.

321
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,470
Are you remembering somethin'?

322
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:45,764
Just...

323
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,809
...a feeling.

324
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,907
Yes, amnesia,
he doesn't remember a thing.

325
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,660
His family's getting desperate.

326
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:10,122
Yeah, we'll send
a photo right over. Thank you.

327
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:16,503
150 police stations down
and another ba-jillion to go.

328
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,339
Like searching for
a needle in a haystack.

329
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,426
I know it's daunting
but we can't give up hope.

330
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:25,012
Maybe that Elder didn't want us to.

331
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:26,805
What are you saying?

332
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:29,850
I think she was trying
to tell Piper something.

333
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:33,645
Why would she tell Piper not to
give up hope if hope was already lost?

334
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:37,649
- Do you think it's a test?
- If it is, it's one we'd better pass.

335
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,611
Any luck?

336
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:46,074
Besides the John Doe that you two found,
my guys have come up with two more.

337
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,118
Any way we can speed this up?

338
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:51,288
I have as many men as I can
without drawing suspicion.

339
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:53,665
This looks like something
you want to see.

340
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,293
A John Doe saved
some guy's life in Texas.

341
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:30,494
- Can I help ya?
- I don't know. Maybe.

342
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,413
Are you going to San Francisco?

343
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:37,084
- Want a ride?
- Sure.

344
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:39,878
All right, well hop in.

345
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:41,880
Thanks.

346
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,735
You gotta have a remedy in here.

347
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,154
Come on, damn it!

348
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:10,075
Sorry.

349
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:14,538
I just let a little bit of the old demon
slip out there. Won't happen again.

350
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,333
Come on, would you?

351
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,048
"Tips for future Whitelighters.

352
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:27,926
To my sons Wyatt and Chris."

353
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,721
Future Whitelighters, huh?

354
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:37,186
Stubbornness
is definitely a family trait.

355
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:41,815
You've tried going upstairs twice,
out the front door four times

356
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,067
and through the wall five...

357
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,821
Make that six... times.

358
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,199
But you haven't tried the chimney yet.

359
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:54,745
- I thought ghosts could go any place.
- You're not a ghost.

360
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:57,122
You will be if you don't
start trusting me.

361
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:58,665
There is only one way out.

362
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:03,378
The last Halliwell that trusted you
ended up burying your demonic spawn.

363
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:06,548
Not one of my finer moments.

364
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:10,594
But Phoebe will make a great mom. Can
you blame me for wanting to be the dad?

365
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:14,097
- You're wasting your time.
- Is that any way to treat family?

366
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:18,185
- You're starting to get on my nerves.
- Why? Because I know you so well?

367
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:22,481
Remember, I go all the way back
to Prue. I was at your wedding.

368
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:24,358
Fact is, Leo and I are a lot alike.

369
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:27,444
We both tried to change the world
to save our marriages.

370
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:29,154
You are nothing alike.

371
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:33,367
Just because we have history doesn't
mean you know anything about me or love.

372
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:36,328
Like it or not, Phoebe and I
were very much in love.

373
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:41,166
Until she suddenly fell out of love
with you rather quickly, remember?

374
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:45,796
I'll never forget.
That's why we were doomed.

375
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:48,006
But you and Leo aren't.

376
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:51,969
What you have is powerful, enduring.

377
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:54,388
A lot of good it's done us.

378
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:58,892
He's wandering around aimlessly with
no idea who he is, and I'm in a coma.

379
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:03,647
Look, you have someone out there who
needs you as much as you need him.

380
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:08,318
If you don't have faith in that love,
it's not the only thing that'll die.

381
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:21,665
If Leo's not here, we've got nothing.

382
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:24,626
We should have come here first
instead of traipsing all over the map.

383
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:28,338
He can't be far, the sheriff just
saw him here not too long ago.

384
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:30,841
Hi, maybe you can help us?

385
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:33,677
We're looking for somebody,
this guy right here.

386
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,096
Have you seen him?

387
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:39,725
I didn't think a fellow
like that'd stay lost for long.

388
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:43,020
He left about an hour ago,
hitched a ride on a big rig.

389
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:45,731
- A big rig?
- Any idea where they were headed?

390
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:49,318
West, I think.
Had some kind of California sign.

391
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:53,113
I'm gonna call Darryl, have him
get in touch with the highway patrol.

392
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,992
Look, we really need to find
him and we're running out of time.

393
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,368
We need a car.

394
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:06,293
- What was that intersection?
- I don't know. Just keep going West.

395
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,671
It's a bumpy ride.
Newer rigs have better shocks.

396
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:12,132
But maybe it'll jog your memory.

397
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:16,470
It does feel like it's starting
to come back some.

398
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:19,806
- I know somebody needs me.
- I'm not surprised.

399
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,559
I heard how you saved
that man's life back there.

400
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,854
Anybody else would have
done the same thing.

401
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:29,816
You are wrong there.
Not everybody's got the calling.

402
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:33,987
Maybe this means there's a bunch
of somebodys out there that need you.

403
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:38,742
Maybe it's your love of helping others
that you're really looking for.

404
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:41,036
You obviously have the healing touch.

405
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:42,871
I don't know about that.

406
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,667
Although it did seem familiar,
like I had a purpose.

407
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,045
Perhaps you were working
for the greater good,

408
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,422
helping people
when you lost your memory.

409
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:56,844
Maybe you sense that the people
that you were helping still need you.

410
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,472
I guess I have to hang in there
till my memory comes back, huh?

411
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:03,058
Listen to that inner voice.

412
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:05,394
You sound more
like a man of the cloth.

413
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:08,438
In a way, maybe I am.

414
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,277
You learn a lot about life on the road.
It's lonely sometimes,

415
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:17,364
but I take heart in knowing that
whatever sacrifices I make personally,

416
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:21,201
I'm bringing people what they need.
To me that's what it's all about.

417
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:24,288
I'm gonna head north soon.
You're welcome to join us.

418
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:26,456
'Us'?

419
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:29,585
Others who think like I do.
You know, who want to help.

420
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,672
If you think that you're meant to be
somewhere else, that's okay too.

421
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,424
It's up to you.

422
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:40,596
I'm not sure what's so hard to grasp.

423
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:43,932
Love transcends every plane
of existence, all you need to do

424
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:46,977
is believe in it and send it to Leo.

425
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:49,813
What does that mean? I don't understand.

426
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,024
I could never get through to you.

427
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:55,235
I could sense when there
was something wrong with Phoebe.

428
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:58,947
Leo is not sensing that
something is horribly wrong with me.

429
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,991
Because he doesn't know who you are.

430
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:05,162
Which means it's gonna take a bigger
jolt from you to jog his memory.

431
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,289
It's odd how invested you are,

432
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,167
considering I'm the one
who helped vanquish you.

433
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:15,172
You know, bygones and all.
But you're changing the subject.

434
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:19,551
Yes I am.
And this is not gonna go any further

435
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,429
until you tell me
what you're getting out of this.

436
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:24,348
Me?

437
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:26,892
I don't know what you're talking about.

438
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,353
I know you as well
as you think you know me.

439
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:35,108
So if you want me to trust you,
then you need to come clean first.

440
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:43,325
I don't want Phoebe to give up on love.

441
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:45,035
What?

442
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:48,789
She hasn't been able to find love
since me, or at least hold on to it.

443
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:51,291
I know that's... my fault.

444
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,127
You should have thought of that
before you decided

445
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,463
to become the source of all things evil.

446
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,966
I already feel guilty enough, all right?

447
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:01,468
Why aren't you talking
to Phoebe about this?

448
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:06,056
You're my only hope. I'm cursed
to live in eternity without love.

449
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:09,977
I don't want Phoebe to be cursed too.
She needs love, she deserves it.

450
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:13,564
She's not gonna keep looking
for it unless you give her a reason.

451
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,859
You and Leo are that reason.

452
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:22,865
All right.
So how I do this love beacon thing?

453
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:27,244
All you need to do is let go, so that
you move on to the next cosmic plane.

454
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:30,414
I see. You mean
the one where I'm dead.

455
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:33,041
It's the only way
to get through to Leo.

456
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:37,462
No. I can't. I have a family,
I have boys that need me.

457
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:40,424
- That doesn't even make any sense!
- Yes, it does.

458
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:42,509
A person halfway across the world

459
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:45,429
knows the instant
their loved one is hit by a car.

460
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:50,017
It's because they're struck with
a sudden burst of love, a psychic shock.

461
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:53,103
The shock that can only come
from loss of a loved one.

462
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,480
You need to let go.

463
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,483
You need to die.

464
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,028
What happens when that doesn't work?

465
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:04,948
What happens when he doesn't feel
this psychic jolt and I'm just dead?

466
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:07,242
I can't take that chance.

467
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:12,039
Besides, my sisters will figure out
a way to save me, they always do.

468
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:15,292
And then you risk
losing Leo and your boys for good.

469
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,879
Can you take that chance?

470
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:27,304
This is where I head north.
What's it gonna be?

471
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:30,182
I've been thinking
about that work you're doing.

472
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:33,143
I can assure you,
there is nothing more rewarding.

473
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:36,855
It would be nice
to have a sense of purpose.

474
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:43,320
You need to make a choice.
Every man does.

475
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:45,989
I know.

476
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:48,659
- This has to be it.
- I hope we're not too late.

477
00:31:48,826 --> 00:31:52,621
Your destiny lies ahead of you.
Which way is it gonna be?

478
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,459
Let's go.

479
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:01,588
You made the right decision.

480
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:06,301
- Leo, thank God.
- Sorry, do I know you?

481
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:10,013
What are you doing here?
And what did you do to Leo?

482
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,892
We let destiny run its course.
And so should you.

483
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:26,613
- Piper?
- I got here as soon as I could.

484
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,617
The damn Elders. None of this would
be happening if they didn't take Leo.

485
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:34,830
You're right. We have to get the Elders.
They're the only ones who can help.

486
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:38,333
Even if they heal her body,
only Leo can heal her soul.

487
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,587
Unfortunately,
Leo chose the Elders over Piper.

488
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:44,923
It's not like we can
force him to remember his wife.

489
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,344
But you can.
And you better do it fast.

490
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:54,099
Trust me, it's your only hope. And hers.

491
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:58,937
Your destiny is with Leo.
You need to learn to trust that.

492
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,616
This can't be a dead end.

493
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,826
Let me double check the Book.

494
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:15,412
I was very thorough,
there's nothing there.

495
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,789
What was that?

496
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:24,588
Wait, I know what to do.
Orb me to the bridge.

497
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,924
She just woke up,
we can't just leave her.

498
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,800
I'll stay with her.
Go work on her spirit.

499
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:30,928
Bridge, now!

500
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:39,520
You can do it, Piper.

501
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:49,071
Look, we know you have Leo.
Bring him down here now!

502
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:53,784
Leo, Piper's dying.
You have to come with us.

503
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:55,160
I'm sorry, who?

504
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:57,704
He doesn't know who she is
or who you are.

505
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:01,166
- You did this to him.
- Leo has chosen his own path.

506
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:04,837
By you leading him there?
How is this a fair test?

507
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:08,882
Some things are so important
that they cannot be left to chance.

508
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:12,010
You need to come home now
because Piper needs you.

509
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:16,348
- I'm there for all those in need.
- Look, this is not a test.

510
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:18,809
He's made his own decision. It's done.

511
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:21,937
No, it's not done.
Leo and Piper are still in love.

512
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:24,857
You can erase his memory
but you can't erase that.

513
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:27,985
It'll seep into his consciousness
until he remembers.

514
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:32,364
I know this is a great loss for you and
that you're going to need time to mourn.

515
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,324
No. We won't.

516
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:37,911
Because he's not gonna leave,
you can't take him away from Piper.

517
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,538
Look, their love is true.

518
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:42,082
It's a true love,
and it's bigger than you,

519
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:45,377
and the Elders, and... all of this.

520
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:04,146
What are you doing?

521
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,785
Oh, my God!

522
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:26,335
- What the hell just happened?
- He has fallen from grace.

523
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:27,711
Leo, are you okay?

524
00:35:27,878 --> 00:35:29,546
Take me to Piper, she needs me.

525
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:34,384
Destiny has spoken.
He's made his choice. He's mortal now.

526
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,138
You should hurry.

527
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:47,940
You're too late.

528
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:50,526
Wyatt already healed her.

529
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:52,110
- Wyatt?
- Thank God.

530
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:56,406
Good job, baby.

531
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:59,952
- How did you know he could do that?
- I didn't. He did.

532
00:36:00,118 --> 00:36:01,662
He even put it in the Book.

533
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:05,541
Looks like you got a second
generation Whitelighter on your hands.

534
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:07,251
Did you heal your mummy?

535
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:10,462
You're such a big boy,
I'm so proud of you.

536
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:13,715
I thought you were never
gonna find your way home.

537
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:15,676
Your faith brought me back.

538
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:19,263
I could hear you calling me,
like you were right there next to me.

539
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,808
I had a good coach.

540
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:27,604
An old friend. I'll explain later.

541
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:31,859
That looks like it hurts.

542
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,111
It doesn't matter.

543
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:37,322
All that matters
is that we're together again.

544
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,742
I'm never leaving you again.

545
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,043
Come here, buddy, come here.

546
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,381
Look who it is.
Can you give Daddy a hug?

547
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:56,717
Hug, hug, hug.

548
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:04,892
"Like as the waves
make towards the pebbled shore,

549
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:07,811
so do our minutes hasten to their end."

550
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:11,064
I'm gonna miss Shakespeare.

551
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,817
That's why I left you this.

552
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:16,695
The complete works
to peruse at your leisure.

553
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:18,739
Thank you.

554
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:23,994
I can't believe it's been three weeks
already, and so much has happened.

555
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:26,163
I know. It's been such a whirlwind.

556
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,000
Burlesque, big fan, Sherwood Forest,

557
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:33,003
I mean, come on,
hold the tights, thank you very much.

558
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:36,882
And a real life Romeo and Juliet.

559
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:39,092
That's just a typical week for us.

560
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:41,512
What do you expect? You're charmed.

561
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:49,853
You really helped me move on.
Thank you.

562
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,899
Are you kidding? Thank you.
I couldn't think of a better day to die.

563
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:56,985
Sorry.

564
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:00,113
I helped you find love.

565
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:04,868
Come on, I did, didn't I?
Come on, I did, I did.

566
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:07,287
- You did.
- Close one.

567
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,124
If that doesn't get me into heaven,
I don't know what will.

568
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:14,127
I'll never forget what you did for me.

569
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:18,757
I guess I fell
for the right guy this time.

570
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:22,135
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

571
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:25,722
He was right.

572
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:29,393
I never knew
what that meant till right now.

573
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:33,605
I just... I have
to ask you one question.

574
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:39,361
How is it that you came into my life
at the exact right time?

575
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,158
A little bird told me.

576
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:47,619
What's magic without mystery?

577
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:55,460
All right, travel check list: Leave
reference books for next instructor,

578
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:58,255
bring a little wisdom
to some young minds,

579
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:00,591
save epic love...

580
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:04,845
...bask in your loving gaze.
Yeah, that about covers it.

581
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:09,850
Alas, pumpkin time.

582
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:14,521
No need for you
to watch my messy demise.

583
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:31,205
Think of me when you dance.

584
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:40,297
I'll miss you.

585
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,472
You did good.

586
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:51,350
Thanks.

587
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,811
So did you.

588
00:39:56,563 --> 00:40:00,150
I couldn't have tasted life unless
you set me up with that sorcerer.

589
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:03,862
I just wish I could save you too.

590
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:05,656
I've come to terms with my fate.

591
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:08,408
Especially now that I know
it won't be Phoebe's.

592
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:10,828
That was a bold move,
sending in thorn demons.

593
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:12,746
I had to risk everything.

594
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:14,915
Understandably.

595
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:21,171
Well...

596
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:22,589
...here I go.

597
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:41,233
That was interesting.

598
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:44,069
Ashes to ashes.

599
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:47,656
If it's any consolation,
you did all that I asked for.

600
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:52,244
- You saved Phoebe.
- I did more than that, buddy.

601
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:55,164
I fell in love with her.

602
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,458
Understandably.

603
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:03,338
Farewell, my friend.

604
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,294
Leo? You okay?

605
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:48,383
I just can't believe
that I don't have powers any more.

606
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:53,805
I don't hear jingling. I can't orb.

607
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,352
Is that bad?

608
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,395
Are you kidding?

609
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:03,482
It's great!

610
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:05,943
It's everything I wanted
since I met you.

611
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:11,532
Me too.

612
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,581
You wanted a normal life.

613
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,502
You take Wyatt, I'll get Chris.

614
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:29,216
I was thinking maybe pancakes
and eggs. How about you?

615
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:31,468
Sounds normal.
