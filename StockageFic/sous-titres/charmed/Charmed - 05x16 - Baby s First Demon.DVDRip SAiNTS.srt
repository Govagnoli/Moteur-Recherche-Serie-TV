1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,633
I could eat him up.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,030
I swear I could,
with a little ranch dressing.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,599
Okay, but let's not, okay?

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,234
I can't make that promise.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,278
Okay, don't listen to your aunties,
okay? They're a little kookie.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,635
Us guys gotta stick together,
don't we, Peter?

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,758
- Peter?
- Peter. I'm just floating it.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,469
Is your name Peter?

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,235
For what it's worth, I dated a Peter
in high school and he wasn't very nice.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,231
Yeah, and you know,
for what it's worth,

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,153
it's kind of the name
of the appendage that he has

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,920
that surprised us all so much.
It might get him teased in school.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,469
Okay, no Peter.
But we're running out of P's.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,154
I can't believe you never
thought of P boy names.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,595
Well, when I went
to the future, I had a little girl.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,270
And obviously that has changed,
as has a lot of things.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,955
But I'm still having trouble letting
go of the name we settled on.

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,671
Yeah, well, Prudence Melinda
might get him in trouble at school too.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm thinking that's probably true,
although he could just zap them

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,437
under a roof,
like Harry Potter would or something.

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,073
God, I hope not.

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,151
Aren't you excited
to see what his powers are?

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,515
Excited, terrified...

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,879
I mean, after seeing what the kid could
do inside the womb, he's no Muggle.

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,837
Hey, what about Potter?

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,315
Potter Halliwell, or is it Wyatt?

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,038
No, it's definitely Halliwell.

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,879
The demons fear it,
good magic respects it.

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,876
I want what's best for him.
That's why I'm gonna say no to Potter.

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,796
Oh, somebody's getting very sleepy.

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,436
We love you, we love you, baby,
so much, love you, love you, love you.

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,789
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,229
You're okay. You're okay.

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,320
You're perfect.
You're a perfect little creature.

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,790
It's too bad
with all the powers your baby has,

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,030
sleeping through the night
is not one of them.

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,713
Yeah, I'm sorry about that,
you guys.

38
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,552
We can cast some
sort of soundproofing spell

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,790
around our bedroom
so you won't have to deal with it.

40
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,871
No. It'll interfere
with the baby's alarm system.

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,234
Which works how exactly?

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,836
Pretty basic stuff.
I just enchanted a few cowry shells.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,991
That's not gonna
shock anything, is it?

44
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,720
In the nursery? I'm not a total idiot.

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,475
It'll just alert us to the presence of evil
so we can all sleep a little sounder.

46
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,232
Now, if you'll excuse me,

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,197
I think I need to
apply some under-eye makeup

48
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,591
to these dark circles
that your sweet baby caused.

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,474
Where are you going?

50
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,029
I'm just gonna go
watch him sleep for a little while.

51
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,559
Phoebe, you must go to work.

52
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,188
Aren't you supposed to meet
the new owner of the paper today?

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,396
I know, but it's
just so hard to leave him.

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,518
I mean, shouldn't there be some sort
of maternity leave for new aunties?

55
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,955
Phoebe, the club
is not raking in the dough these days,

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,031
and Paige is unemployed,
the cost of diapers...

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,794
We kind of need you
to keep your job.

58
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,791
You're right, you're right. I'm going.

59
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,076
Just no Peter, okay. And no Patrick.

60
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,913
I really think you should consider
Potter because it's a great name.

61
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,190
Okay? Just don't make any
decisions until I get back, please.

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,628
Time to go.

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,998
And do me a favour and kiss his
little toes for me when he wakes up.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,228
When are you gonna talk to her?

65
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,595
Oh, she's just excited.

66
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,830
Excited, obsessed.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,309
Why, because she wants
to watch her nephew sleep?

68
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,278
No, because yesterday she was
giving you breast-feeding advice

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,078
and now she wants maternity leave?

70
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,995
Well, she knows a lot about breasts.

71
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,476
And she's an aunt, that's what they do,
it's family, you know.

72
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,598
Okay. Well, how is Mommy doing?

73
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,588
Mommy's tired and happy.

74
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,470
Now try and get some sleep.

75
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,239
- Baby!
- What?

76
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,436
Baby! Hey!

77
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,632
Son of a...

78
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,833
Little guy, way to use your powers.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,197
You okay? No, you're okay,
it's all right. You're okay.

80
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,628
They scare you?

81
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,429
You're okay. You're okay.

82
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,999
It just pisses me off.

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,879
I can't believe they'd come
in the house and try to steal the baby.

84
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,355
Piper, demons aren't exactly known
for their moral compass.

85
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,353
At least he'll be safe with the
Elders until we can figure it out.

86
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,478
But he's just a baby.
He is small and little and innocent...

87
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,114
It's okay. He's got
that invincibility thing going on.

88
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,919
Hey, do you think that's permanent
or is it like a baby-teeth thing?

89
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,071
I have no idea,
but the demons saw the force field.

90
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,912
They're gonna
try and find a way around it.

91
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,913
Unless they can get up
to Elder-land, he's gonna be fine.

92
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,918
- Well, he can't stay up there forever.
- That's what we're here for.

93
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,719
No one is gonna steal him.
I promise you that.

94
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,231
- Leo?
- They wouldn't keep him.

95
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,995
What? Why?
Did you tell them what's going on?

96
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,435
They want us to prove
to ourselves that we can protect him,

97
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,909
like your mom
and Grams did for you.

98
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,320
Oh, no, baby, it's okay. It's okay.

99
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,789
We don't need
them anyway. It's all right.

100
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,796
- You okay?
- I'm having some severe

101
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,794
- separation-anxiety issues.
- We can do this, honey.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,639
Hey, here he is. The Hawker demon.

103
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,952
"A breed of demon known for hawking
magical goods at the demonic market."

104
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,550
Magical goods?
My baby is a magical good?

105
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,119
That is just sick and twisted.

106
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,431
The question is,
who would want to buy him and why?

107
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,916
We paid you for a baby. Not a gypsy.

108
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,038
I told you that the little brat
had a force field protecting it.

109
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,475
Which is why we want it, you idiot.

110
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,234
The shield is what makes
that kid a perfect battery.

111
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,750
A self-sustaining, never-ending
source of magical power.

112
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,959
We tap into that power and it will
return us to our former strength.

113
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,793
Or would you have us
stay weaklings, Hawker?

114
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,474
Doomed to feed on
the magic of others forever.

115
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,598
Look, I am sorry
that the witch cursed you.

116
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,638
And I'm sorry
that you lost all of your powers.

117
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,076
That's a tough break.
But it's not my fault.

118
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,434
Hawker?

119
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,750
Madam, how may I serve you today?

120
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,633
The eyes of two dozen adult brown
bats and a large boar's tongue, please.

121
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,478
Right away.

122
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,949
We're not finished here.

123
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,634
She can wait her turn.

124
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,394
Bottom-feeders. What is it
that's keeping you alive today?

125
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,869
Feed on a troll
for breakfast this morning?

126
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,355
Back off, Crone.

127
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,800
I sense danger, Hawker.

128
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,556
The task these leeches seek you for
will bring only death and destruction.

129
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,790
And not to our enemies.

130
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,356
Turn them away.

131
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,951
Your order, madam.

132
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,599
You're not gonna listen
to that crazy old wretch, are you?

133
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,792
The Crone's wisdom
is ancient and renowned.

134
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,713
I have already lost
one demon on this job.

135
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,953
Now, you either
take the gypsy, or nothing.

136
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,312
We'll take the gypsy to tide us over.

137
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,516
And we'll double
the bounty on the infant.

138
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,280
Or maybe we'll pay
that to another hawker.

139
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,398
In which case,
the bounty will be on your head.

140
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,312
I know it's not much
of a choice, but there it is.

141
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,392
We find ways to make him happy,
or we find new jobs.

142
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,189
Well, he can't be any tougher
to please than you, right, Elise?

143
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,237
One can only hope.

144
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,949
All I know is that
his name is Jason Dean,

145
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,192
he's new money,
some kind of dot-com millionaire.

146
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,592
And he's known for his shaking up
the companies that he buys.

147
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,716
"Shaking up," as in layoffs?

148
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,115
Honestly, Kate,
you know as much as I do.

149
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,113
So you don't know if you'll
be employed tomorrow either.

150
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,313
Look, guys, he'll be here soon.
And we can get a better read then.

151
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,914
In the meantime,
I suggest we all get back to work.

152
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,755
Work, "schmurk," I got baby
pictures here. Gather round, people.

153
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,232
You are looking at 6 pounds,
8 ounces of pure deliciousness.

154
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,510
- How's your sister doing?
- Healthy as a horse.

155
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,517
You think he's gonna
keep those blue eyes?

156
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,671
- He might. His daddy has light eyes.
- How old is he?

157
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,068
Three weeks today.

158
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,708
You look pretty good for a woman
who had a baby three weeks ago.

159
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,713
Oh, no.
I'm not his mommy, I'm just his...

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,718
...auntie.

161
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,996
Hi. Have we met?

162
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,196
- Jason Dean.
- Oh, God.

163
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,473
I'm sorry. You're Mr. Dean?

164
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,868
- Jason, please.
- Well, that's...

165
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,875
That's some weird stuff
because you're really young... Young.

166
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,593
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

167
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,469
You know, it's strange.

168
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,996
I always pictured a newspaper
bullpen as being a little more...

169
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,634
...I don't know, bustling.

170
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,192
- Bustling. Bustling.
- Oh, hey! No!

171
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,391
I'm Elise Rothman,
let me show you around.

172
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,869
Honestly, Elise,
I didn't mean to insult your team.

173
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,034
<i>It's just, I grew up reading
comic books. The Daily Planet bustled.</i>

174
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,437
Well, in all fairness, Superman can
move faster than a speeding bullet.

175
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,670
So he's got a little leg up
on the bustling, you know.

176
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,671
A woman
who knows her superheroes.

177
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,111
I'm impressed.

178
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,236
- I'm... I'm Phoebe.
- I know.

179
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,829
I've been doing a lot
of homework, a lot of reading.

180
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,235
- Circulation is down, l...
- Oh, sorry.

181
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,238
- Plan to bring it up, and from what
I see, that's gonna start with you.

182
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,798
Wow, that's really sweet.
Isn't that sweet? Did you hear that?

183
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,076
I'm sorry about
the little picture show, you know.

184
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,595
Oh, if I had a nephew that cute,
I'd show him off too.

185
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,429
Best I can do is...

186
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,229
Picture of my dog.

187
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,279
Mr. Dean, if you'd like,
I could give you a tour.

188
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,228
Great. Phoebe, let's talk soon.

189
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,833
He has your eyes.

190
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,315
Well, the neighbours who don't already
think we're crazy, now officially do.

191
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,631
But the house
is surrounded by apples and sage.

192
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,751
Thank you. I know you think
it's a waste of time...

193
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,798
Well, you know, if it worked,
we would have done it already.

194
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,793
- Every little bit helps.
- All right. How's your ritual coming?

195
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,359
It's not.

196
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,670
I thought you were gonna
call the baby's fairy guards.

197
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,838
We were, we are,
but to perform the ritual properly,

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,911
you have to have
a name for the baby first.

199
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,918
So we busted out the family tree,
hoping to find some new ideas.

200
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,111
Let me see.

201
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,958
Okay, right away, I'm gonna say
I'm against the name Herbert.

202
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,510
Yeah, we already vetoed
Clarence and Milton as well.

203
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,916
Not to be too self-centred,
but where am I on the tree?

204
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,988
Well, we haven't
had a chance to update it lately.

205
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,034
Oh, right.

206
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,111
Yeah, I mean the baby's
not even on there either.

207
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,910
Well, yeah, that's because
he doesn't have a name yet, Leo.

208
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,118
Oh, well, Paige, it's just a piece
of paper. It doesn't mean anything.

209
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,117
I know that.

210
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,955
Anyway, Wiccan rituals
and fairy guards notwithstanding,

211
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,270
I think it's time
we bust out some serious ammo.

212
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,631
- As in?
- As in an old-fashioned demon hunt.

213
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,349
I say we bypass the Hawker
and go for the jerk that hired him

214
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,039
to steal the baby in the first place.

215
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,918
- How?
- Not so sure just yet.

216
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,039
But I will say this. Once we find him,
we use him to send a message:

217
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,636
"If you come after this baby, you will
die in the cruellest manner possible."

218
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,072
Well, I like the message.

219
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,071
You know, except...

220
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,559
Except?

221
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,312
Except for the part
where I have to leave

222
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,311
my newborn child
to go demon hunting.

223
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,311
I'm just... I'm not ready.

224
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,393
Okay. Fine, I can understand that.
I'll just... I'll take Phoebe.

225
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,710
But except that she's got
a really big day at work today

226
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,393
and we kind of
need her money right now.

227
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,629
- I'll go by myself.
- No way.

228
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,950
You don't even know
what kind of demon we're up against.

229
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,554
Fine, but I am the baby's godmother.
It's my job to protect it,

230
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,598
and if I don't stop him,
the Hawker will come back.

231
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,990
All right, then let's get ready for him.

232
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,589
Exactly, we'll lay a trap for him.

233
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,230
Maybe we'll kidnap him
and sell him to the highest bidder.

234
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,072
What do you think?
That's a good idea.

235
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,800
Then we can find out who hired him,
force him to take us to them.

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,355
No, it sounds risky.

237
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,750
He has his own force field
and your alarm system.

238
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,196
It's no more risky than you going off on
your own on some wild goose chase.

239
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,749
He's right, you should go
get the crystals for the trap.

240
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,717
Fine.

241
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,237
<i>- Hello.
- Don't "hello" me.</i>

242
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,118
You know who I'm calling to talk to.

243
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,872
<i>Well, he's resting right now.</i>

244
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,513
How'd it go with the new boss?

245
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,392
Oh, Jason Dean?
I want to bear his children.

246
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,471
But that's besides the point.
Now let me talk to...

247
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,552
What? You have a crush
on the new boss?

248
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,234
<i>I don't think I like
your tone oF voice, mister.</i>

249
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,119
Please let me talk to my nephew.
I don't want him to forget my voice.

250
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,750
Well, he needs his rest.
It's been a little hectic around here.

251
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,239
Hectic? What do you mean, hectic?

252
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,630
Well, I didn't want to worry you,
but there was an attack.

253
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,789
They were after the baby.

254
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,430
- What? Why didn't you tell me?
- I did tell you. I just told you.

255
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,828
Okay, well, I'm coming home.

256
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,958
You don't have to, we have it under
control. There's nothing to worry about.

257
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,314
We'll call you if we need you.

258
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,118
Leo, this is my nephew
we're talking about.

259
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,508
<i>You should have called me.</i>

260
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,956
I'll just tell Jason I have to work
from home for the rest of the day.

261
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,155
In today's market, image
and content are inseparable.

262
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,311
We can publish a
Pulitzer Prize-winning article,

263
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,590
but with our puny circulation,
who's gonna notice?

264
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,478
Hi. Is this a bad time?

265
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,432
No, come in, come in.

266
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,556
Here. Look at this woman.

267
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,076
Beautiful, smart, funny.
And she can write.

268
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,431
With the right exposure, she could kick
Dear Abby down into the bush league.

269
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,272
She's a commodity.

270
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,153
Thank you, I think.
Now that I have your attention...

271
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,754
And we've worked hard
to capitalize on her.

272
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,798
She has billboards, she's done
guest spots on local radio shows,

273
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,951
<i>she did that spread in 415 Magazine.</i>

274
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,673
And don't think I didn't see it.

275
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,718
What I'm wondering is what we could
do differently with regard to content.

276
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,952
- Content?
- I was thinking we expand her column.

277
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,873
Have her write a series of features
road-testing her own advice

278
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,110
or a series on the
best singles spots in San Francisco

279
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,157
based on her own
undercover experience.

280
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,194
I like it. Phoebe and I can work this
afternoon, put some ideas together...

281
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,271
No, we can't.

282
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,557
I'm sorry, but I have to work from
home for the rest of the afternoon.

283
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,233
Why?

284
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,198
Why? Well,
because I have a new baby,

285
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,511
a new nephew at home
and he demands a lot of attention...

286
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,672
But he's got parents, right?
Is there something here I'm missing?

287
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,031
No. Look, Elise has never
minded me working from home.

288
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,839
Yes, but, Phoebe, we're talking
about expanding your column.

289
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,508
I should think you'd want
a hand in what that's gonna look like.

290
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,393
- Well, of course I do, Elise, but...
- Are we not paying you enough?

291
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,629
No, that's not it.

292
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,870
Okay, sit down with Elise,
come up with some new ideas

293
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,918
and while you're at it, discuss what
you think your new salary should be.

294
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,555
We'll meet again late this afternoon.

295
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,030
Yeah. Great.

296
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,275
Why would somebody
want to hurt something so innocent?

297
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,918
Poor Paige. She's getting
all the hassles of parenthood

298
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,274
with none of the rewards.

299
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,149
Well, I think a smile from
her nephew is all she'll ever want.

300
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,038
It's gonna be okay, Piper.

301
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,276
- How?
- Because babies are resilient.

302
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,158
And ours has a little extra of that.

303
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,595
But even so,
I mean, it can't be good for him.

304
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,110
Even if he can handle the demons,
he must sense the tension,

305
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,158
which means at the very best,
we end up with a neurotic infant.

306
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,709
Look on the bright side.

307
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,156
Growing up with your sisters,
he was bound to be neurotic anyway.

308
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,512
No!

309
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,873
Leo!

310
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,274
I guess I overcharged it.

311
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,237
I gotcha, baby. You're all right.

312
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,839
How's my little buddy doing?

313
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,070
I think we need
a little bit of healing here.

314
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,157
What, he looks fine to me.

315
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,392
Not him. Me.

316
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,831
Okay, now, easy. Watch your head.

317
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,833
Make sure you hold her hands,
we don't want her blowing anything up.

318
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,877
Just do it.

319
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,153
- Where's the baby?
- It's all right, honey, he's okay.

320
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,673
They knew about the force field.

321
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,711
They almost
flew him out of the window.

322
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,553
Yeah, but they didn't, and right now
our concern is about you.

323
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,312
Me? Why? I'm healed.

324
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,511
Yes, but the fact is that
you needed to be healed.

325
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,914
That's what I'm talking about.

326
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,674
Yeah, I guess
I'm not so invincible anymore.

327
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,910
Well, it makes sense, since
you got the power from him

328
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,718
and he's not inside you anymore.

329
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,559
I was just hoping he would have
left a little bit behind for Mama.

330
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,678
Well, the theory did occur to me, but
I haven't had a chance to test it out.

331
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,068
This is serious, Piper.

332
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,515
You need to learn to be careful
now that you're vulnerable.

333
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,633
I don't have the luxury of being careful.
Half of demonville is after our child.

334
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,312
What do you think
about using the athame

335
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,710
to scry for the demonic market?
I mean, it makes sense

336
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,911
- that the Hawker demon got it there.
- Yeah.

337
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,355
We can disguise ourselves
as demons, infiltrate the market

338
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,795
and pretend that we know
how to get the Charmed Ones' baby.

339
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,279
It's a smart plan.

340
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,512
Then we could find out
what sicko is in the market to buy him.

341
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,075
Right, but then we vanquish
them, everyone they've ever met,

342
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,919
and proceed with our original
demon-killing, message-sending plan.

343
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,236
It's a very wordy, very good plan.

344
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,197
It's a good idea to send
the mother of my child

345
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,351
into the hornet's nest
because you overcharged a trap?

346
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,993
Oh, gee, one little mistake, man.

347
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,236
It's okay. She's right. We can go.

348
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,958
Right.

349
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,115
You're sure you're okay to do this?

350
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,236
No, I can't go.

351
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,551
<i>Okay. I'll just go check the Book
oF Shadows, see if I missed anything.</i>

352
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,273
It'll be okay.

353
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,358
I think it's time we call Phoebe.

354
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,551
I called her, she said
she was on her way home.

355
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,631
I'll call her again.

356
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,077
You're okay, little guy.
We're not gonna let anybody steal you.

357
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,716
It's okay, Paige.

358
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,429
It's okay. I fought
fairy tales earlier this year.

359
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,593
You can do this.
You can do this. You can do this.

360
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,593
Lost, little girl?

361
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,398
You have a really messed-up idea
of customer service.

362
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,114
- What?
- I am a dissatisfied customer.

363
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,551
I bought this athame here
at the market, it's supposed to flame.

364
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,712
It doesn't. I paid a pretty penny
for it too. And for what?

365
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,190
It almost got me killed trying
to steal the Charmed Ones' baby.

366
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,038
You want to know
what I got for my efforts?

367
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,439
A nice little blanket. Sweet.

368
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,551
Oh, and the Hawker who hired me?

369
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,393
He got eighty-sixed,
so I didn't even get a payday.

370
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,834
Who are you?

371
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,634
I told you,
I'm a dissatisfied customer.

372
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,636
See? No flame.

373
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,231
So we thought I could hit
a couple of clubs around town

374
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,755
and try out the pickup lines
that I suggested in my column.

375
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,549
Then she'll report back on how they
work off the page and in the world.

376
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,918
I love it. It's sexy as hell.

377
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,432
Okay, great. So why don't
I go home and try to work on...

378
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,158
Yeah.

379
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,109
No.

380
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,271
No, definitely not.

381
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,913
Great.

382
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,109
Are you okay?

383
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,111
Yeah. I'm fine. I just...

384
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,068
I have a little blood-sugar issue,
it's nothing serious, but I have to eat.

385
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,239
Say no more. You like Chinese?

386
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,708
- Food, not people.
- I really need to get home.

387
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,637
Elise, could you
excuse us for a moment?

388
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,074
Sure.

389
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,276
I'll just...

390
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,431
...be over here.

391
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,797
Is this about
your sister's baby again?

392
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,788
Yes. It is, actually. I need
to go spend some time with him.

393
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,474
With your sister's baby?

394
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,108
Yes.

395
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,238
Look, you may not understand,
but that baby needs me right now.

396
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,674
Is your sister a single parent?

397
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,558
- No.
- Look, Phoebe,

398
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,678
I think it's really wonderful
that you love your nephew this much.

399
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,559
I really do. But you have a job.

400
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,153
Yeah, and I
think I do it pretty well.

401
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,676
Yes, you do. Until recently.

402
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,314
Excuse me?

403
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,550
I spent some of the afternoon
going over your columns

404
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,548
from the last few weeks.
And they've become very...

405
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,595
- What?
- Baby-centric.

406
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,991
They're all about diapers
and mother's milk.

407
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,675
They don't even read like you.
They've lost your edge. You're sexy.

408
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,834
Well, any writer, any good writer, uses
their life experiences in their work.

409
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,190
That's true. But if all
you've got to inform your work

410
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,193
is someone else's baby, maybe
you need to re-evaluate your priorities.

411
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,036
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean, but, Phoebe,
your brother-in-law's on the phone.

412
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,633
And it's the third time he's called.

413
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,358
What? Why didn't you tell me?

414
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,435
I don't understand,
why didn't you just orb for me

415
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,953
when they wouldn't put you through?

416
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,759
I didn't want to leave the house
unless it was absolutely necessary.

417
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,912
Oh, right. Okay, so there
was another kidnap attempt?

418
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,433
Yes.

419
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,992
I can't believe
they didn't put you through!

420
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,752
They said you were
in an important meeting

421
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,751
and the boss said
you shouldn't be disturbed.

422
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,309
Unbelievable. And he says
I have my priorities mixed up?

423
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,708
- Who?
- Jason Dean.

424
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,433
Jason? Jason Halli...

425
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,392
Oh, don't even
thing about it, mister.

426
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,152
Please tell me you didn't get fired.

427
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,108
Oh, no, l... I don't think I did.

428
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,509
What the hell is that?

429
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,669
- Baby alarm.
- Baby alarm.

430
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,829
What?

431
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,994
I know, so much excitement.
What was that alerting us to exactly?

432
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,589
Demons. There's supposed
to be demons in the house.

433
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,115
Look at that, he's not even crying.

434
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,919
You are so brave.
You're like a little brave soldier.

435
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,753
Maybe the alarm is faulty.

436
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,992
- Paige would know.
- Where is Paige?

437
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,193
Paige?

438
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,078
Oh, my God, she's not here.

439
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,032
Okay, why is that an "Oh, my God"?

440
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,758
And the scrying tools are out.

441
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,590
The hand-grenade potion is gone.

442
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,433
Will someone please
tell me what's going on here?

443
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,275
What is that, a spell?

444
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,509
No, it's a note.
"Gone to market. Back soon."

445
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,359
Okay, well, that's good news, right?

446
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,795
She went to the market.

447
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,678
Right?

448
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,792
Come on, guys, this is top-of-the-line.
The power to throw fireballs 20 yards.

449
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,951
Now, let me hear a serious offer.

450
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,835
Now, if you need new powers,
there's where to go.

451
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,716
You're such a great tour guide.

452
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,950
Looking for that
little something extra?

453
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,720
You didn't become a demon
to just stand on the sidelines.

454
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,839
Now, watch and see
what my permeatonic can do for you.

455
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,668
I'll take some.

456
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,790
I think up there's the guys
you're looking for. The parasites.

457
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,030
Oh, parasites?
Should I be frightened?

458
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,758
No. They were badass once,

459
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,753
but some witch cursed them,
took away their powers.

460
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,673
Pitiful little bastards.
Even a girl like you could take them.

461
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,674
Oh, really, a girl like me?
Then I might just have to.

462
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,515
Well, thank you for the tour. I suppose
you'll be wanting your payment now.

463
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,874
You know I will.

464
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,313
Fireball.

465
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,837
Hey!

466
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,715
Sorry, he was getting a little grabby.

467
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,030
Excuse me. Anyone here interested
in the Charmed Ones' offspring?

468
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,869
Who are you?

469
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,349
I'm the reason you're not
gonna need that food anymore.

470
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,351
Not after you hear
what I have to say.

471
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,834
The food is dead.

472
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,075
You were saying?

473
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,993
Just that the Hawker
who hired me to grab the baby

474
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,230
screwed up the job
and got himself dead.

475
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,715
He didn't say who hired him,
but I heard it was you.

476
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,914
So, what if it was?

477
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,038
Don't get nervous.
I'm just here for the bounty.

478
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,633
The offer still stands, right?

479
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,078
First, tell us why you're still alive.

480
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,071
I'll take that as a yes.

481
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,835
Come on, people, talk to me.

482
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,474
Bingo. We have
a location of the market.

483
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,557
Yes. Anything on Paige?

484
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,518
I can't sense her at all. But
that doesn't mean we should panic.

485
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,989
Her signal might be blocked
by the magic at the marketplace.

486
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,593
Right, there's no reason to panic.

487
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,069
I mean, our sister went alone
to demonville, she has no idea

488
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,078
what or who she's up against,
so there's no reason to panic, right?

489
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,635
Phoebe, it was my fault.
I should have gone with her.

490
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,950
I would have gone with her,
had she called me.

491
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,758
Well, I told her not to bother you,

492
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,150
because you was trying
to impress your new boss.

493
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,676
I was not trying to impress
my new boss, thank you.

494
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,831
You weren't? But this morning...

495
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,630
Okay, maybe this morning
I was trying to impress him.

496
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,758
But I'm not. So can we talk about
anything but Jason Dean, please?

497
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,909
Thank you very much.

498
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,991
Yeah, let's talk about
how we're gonna find Paige.

499
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,839
Well, we're gonna write a spell
that's gonna carry us to the market.

500
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,479
Can I have some paper?

501
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,835
Are you okay?

502
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,389
No. It's time to panic.

503
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,232
Oh, my God.

504
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,554
I say we suck her dry.

505
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,119
Nice and slow.

506
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,350
- Tempting, but...
- But what?

507
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,354
You forget it was one of her kind
who cursed us to this life.

508
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,993
Please...

509
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,199
Say we kill her,
get revenge on yet another witch.

510
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,876
Then what? We're still parasites.
Nothing will have changed.

511
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,395
She'll be dead. That's change.

512
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,154
But we'll still be bound
to this trivial existence.

513
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,949
Think about it.
She's a Charmed One.

514
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,152
Her sisters will sense her
if we keep her alive.

515
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,591
And then, they will come for her.

516
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,595
And when they do,
the infant will be left vulnerable.

517
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,472
No.

518
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,029
Anything?

519
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,668
Unless they're invisible,
there's no demons in this house.

520
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,319
Then why does
the alarm keep going off?

521
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,118
- We'd have to ask Paige.
- We better hurry

522
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,276
because from what I saw,
she doesn't have much time.

523
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,637
You want me to leave my baby when
the alarm designed to sense evil

524
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,028
is going off every ten minutes?

525
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,430
Believe me, Piper,
I don't want to leave the baby either,

526
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,160
but the alarm is broken.
There is no evil in this house.

527
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,675
But we've gone up against
invisible demons before.

528
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,798
You know, demons that morph into
lamps, lamps that morph into demons,

529
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,949
demons in the walls...

530
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,873
Don't you think if they were here,
they'd be attacking the baby by now?

531
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,594
Oh, look at him, he's smiling!

532
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,597
Oh, you are so brave.

533
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,394
- He's smiling?
- Either that or he has gas.

534
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,589
Piper, put him down.

535
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,869
What?

536
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,712
He was crying
when the demon attacked.

537
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,110
- So?
- So just put him down a minute

538
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,673
and come over here.
You too, Phoebe.

539
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,068
- Why?
- Trust me.

540
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,598
Okay.

541
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,793
What are we doing?

542
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,235
- Just wait.
- For what?

543
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,959
That's what.

544
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,554
- I don't get it.
- He's doing it.

545
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,359
He's using his powers
to set off the alarm.

546
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,238
Because he figured out, when it
goes off, that we all come running.

547
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,996
He's just trying to get attention.
He's a genius. Oh, you're a genius!

548
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,037
That's my boy, using your powers.

549
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,713
You trying to give
Mommy a heart attack?

550
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,154
Is that what you're trying to do?

551
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,029
So I guess it's safe to say
you can go help Paige.

552
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,472
- Right.
- You gonna be okay?

553
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,557
Yeah. Okay.

554
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,073
Grab some potions

555
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,676
because if I'm going to that market and
leaving him, we're not taking prisoners.

556
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,397
Well, just be careful.

557
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,549
I will.

558
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,994
You're not invincible anymore.

559
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,832
I know.

560
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,875
It's just so hard to leave.

561
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,519
It's so hard to make Phoebe leave.

562
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,559
Well, just make sure you come back.

563
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,949
You take care of him.

564
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,317
I mean, one hair out of place,
on the head, you and me, issues.

565
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,119
I will. The first sign of trouble,
I will orb him out.

566
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,592
Okay. Phoebe,
here we go. Here we go.

567
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,309
- Where's the market?
- Who are you?

568
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,311
I'm the mother.

569
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,998
Which one of you dirtbags
put the bounty on my baby?

570
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,748
They're here.

571
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,469
It's baby time.

572
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,594
It's okay, buddy.
Mommy will be home soon.

573
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,075
- Where are they?
- Piper.

574
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,595
I know, you are
very happy to see us.

575
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,189
- Baby.
- He's fine, he's with Leo.

576
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,994
They're parasites.
They'll absorb Leo's power.

577
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,276
What? Can you orb?

578
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,115
No. No. They took my powers away.

579
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,918
We gotta get
to the other side of the gate.

580
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,479
That is mine.

581
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,672
Do you feel the power?

582
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,718
It's fantastic. But how will
we get him out of here?

583
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,193
Keep draining the magic. The force
field will falter. And then he'll be ours.

584
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,998
Go. Don't let them
put their hands on you.

585
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,917
No!

586
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,355
- He got away.
- It's okay, let him go.

587
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,750
I said, no prisoners.
Are you okay?

588
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,119
- Yeah.
- Then we're going back.

589
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,675
You did this to us. I warned you.

590
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,440
The witches did this. Not me.

591
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,956
The witches
are nothing compared to...

592
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,474
This child is powerful
beyond your understanding.

593
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,277
What I have foreseen
is not to be ignored.

594
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,318
What? What did you see?

595
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,708
What is he?

596
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,754
He is our end.

597
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,588
We'll have nothing more
to do with this being.

598
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,870
That's easy for you to say.
You have powers of your own.

599
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,510
And I enjoy using them.

600
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,349
Impressive.

601
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,358
Your sister's powers
have been restored.

602
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,749
Who are you?

603
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,749
I represent those in power.

604
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,309
Rest assured, a law will be passed

605
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,552
forbidding any
further attempts on your child.

606
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,952
Why? What do you stand to gain?

607
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,108
Nothing.

608
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,679
You have proven...

609
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,550
...that the costs of a war
will far outweigh the benefits.

610
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,755
Consider this...

611
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,150
...our white flag.

612
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:06,029
Now, I suggest you rest well
and preserve your energies.

613
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:11,558
From what I've foreseen,
you're going to need them.

614
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,073
Way to send
a message, warrior mom.

615
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,639
I don't know about that.

616
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,789
You didn't believe her?

617
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,509
Well, partially, but I think this had more
to do with him than anything we did.

618
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,557
What do you think she foresaw?

619
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,597
I wish I knew.

620
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,758
Oh, I could eat you.
Yes, I could. Yes, I could.

621
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,597
Pheebs. After the demonic parasites
did want to eat him, not so cute.

622
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:52,596
Gotcha. Oh, I could smoosh you. Oh,
I could just smoosh your little face.

623
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,392
Much better.

624
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,909
Is that his new name,
Smoosh Face Halliwell?

625
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,640
It's about as good
as everything else we've come up with.

626
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,994
No new ideas, huh?

627
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,038
- Actually...
- No. You know, we've been so busy

628
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,476
with the alarm and the demon-fighting
and the sister-saving...

629
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,200
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't be sorry, Paige.

630
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,271
You were brave,
and you inspired me to fight

631
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,431
and you made the world
a safer place for our baby.

632
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,510
Which is why I would like to give
the baby the middle name of Matthew.

633
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,434
In honour of his
super-protective aunt Paige.

634
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,238
I think that's a great idea.

635
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,556
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

636
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,949
Thanks.

637
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,032
And I also have
an idea for his first name.

638
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,909
Wyatt. In honour of his
very protective daddy.

639
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,638
Really?

640
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,274
Well, it doesn't start with a P.

641
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,278
So we break the tradition.

642
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,318
Hi, baby.

643
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,074
Happy baby.

644
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,239
Why don't we ask him?

645
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,748
That's probably your job.

646
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,759
Wyatt Matthew Halliwell,
is that your name?

647
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,469
What do you think? It's a good one.

648
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,471
It's a good one.

649
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,754
I thought you'd still be here.

650
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,311
Yeah, well, there's a lot to do.

651
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,595
I just came by to say that...

652
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,669
...I'm really sorry.

653
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,554
I didn't figure you
for the type to apologize easily.

654
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,675
Yeah, I'm not.
I only apologize when I'm wrong.

655
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,198
And, okay, I wasn't entirely wrong.

656
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,476
There was an emergency
at home and I did need to leave.

657
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,234
In the future, if you're gonna
hold my calls, I hope you tell me.

658
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,433
- This is an apology?
- Yes, because about the other stuff...

659
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,355
...you were right. I got overwhelmed
by the baby and I lost my voice.

660
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,909
- My perspective.
- That's really...

661
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,913
It's just that since we were kids,
we always shared everything equally.

662
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,548
So when the baby came, I just
thought it should be the same way.

663
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,678
You know, which is ridiculous
because I'm not his mom, I'm his aunt.

664
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,519
And it works out great for me because
moms have to parent, you know,

665
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,910
- and I just get to spoil.
- Well, that's understandable...

666
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,548
And I know you're really busy
and you don't need to be listening

667
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,553
to some advice columnist's
psychobabble, but...

668
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,233
...if I still have a job...

669
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,760
...I promise you'll see all
the changes you're looking for

670
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,512
in my column
first thing in the morning.

671
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,238
Great.

672
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,954
- Can I talk now?
- Oh, yeah.

673
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,872
I knew less about
my last girlfriend's family

674
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,156
than I've learned about yours
in the last five minutes.

675
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,639
- Oh, I'm really...
- Still talking.

676
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,229
- Sorry.
- I am busy.

677
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,231
But making this paper work
is important to me.

678
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,637
If that means listening to an advice
columnist's late-night psychobabble,

679
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,319
then that's what I'm willing to do.

680
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,038
- That's... Right.
- Still talking.

681
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,198
This paper can't afford to lose you,
Phoebe. You're too valuable.

682
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,399
Too talented. And if you can admit
where you were wrong, then so can I.

683
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,117
- So?
- So...

684
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,831
...in the future, if I have to hold
your calls, I'll let you know.

685
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,317
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

686
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,037
Done talking.

687
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,792
Okay.

688
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,032
I'll just...
