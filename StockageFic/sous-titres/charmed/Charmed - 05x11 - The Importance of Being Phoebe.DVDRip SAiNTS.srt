1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,968
Okay, so I stopped at five herb shops,
but I finally found some eye of newt.

2
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,137
So if it's good enough for
Shakespeare's witches,

3
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:15,265
I think it'll help us
put a serious dent in Cole.

4
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,393
We've tried everything to vanquish
him, but nothing works, okay?

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,979
So I just say we watch our backs,
and get on with our lives.

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,232
Speaking of which,
do you think eye of newt

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,317
would work on the woman
that's trying to sue me?

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,862
- Is she demonic?
- Well, she's demonically stupid.

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,658
Paige, I am seriously worried that
I'm gonna lose my job over this.

10
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,160
For giving bad advice
in your column?

11
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,746
No, the advice wasn't bad.
I never told her she should

12
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,081
leave the guy at the altar.

13
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,542
Either way, what happened
to freedom of the press?

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:46,713
Well, apparently some dirtbag lawyer
is finding a way around it.

15
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,347
Paige?

16
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,311
Paige, are you okay?

17
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,859
Paige, can you hear me?

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,153
Are you okay?

19
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,781
Paige. Paige.

20
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,270
Can I get you another drink, sir?

21
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,897
Cole.

22
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,318
- How'd it go?
- It was beautiful.

23
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,737
- Was the other driver hurt?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,698
- Good.
- All you gotta do is a little mind control

25
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,410
on the witnesses
and maybe a cop, and we're golden.

26
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,038
Let's get out of here.

27
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,374
No time for one little dance?

28
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,294
Kaia, I was waiting for you earlier.

29
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,171
I'll make it up to you.

30
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,964
Boss.

31
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,097
You know what I want.

32
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,036
You're sure
you don't wanna call Leo?

33
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,830
No, no, it's just a mild concussion.

34
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,665
And besides, I don't deserve
to be healed.

35
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,168
I know better than to talk
on the phone when I'm driving.

36
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,546
- I don't know what I was thinking.
- Do you remember what happened?

37
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,174
I was speaking to Phoebe,
and then the next thing I know,

38
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:20,302
the car just started
spinning out of control.

39
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,262
It's kind of like my career.

40
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,805
Honey, it's not that bad, is it?

41
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,767
I think it is. The newspaper's lawyers
wanna meet with me,

42
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,394
and I don't think it's because
they're huge Phoebe fans.

43
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,272
Well, I'll see you your career
and raise you my club.

44
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,441
The health inspector's
coming back today

45
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,151
and the plumbing just exploded.
Again.

46
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,655
What is going on with us?
Is Mercury in retrograde?

47
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,740
Have you thought about
using a magical Band-Aid?

48
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:45,285
I'd do it in a heartbeat if I wasn't afraid
of the personal gain consequences.

49
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,539
See, this is why demons always
have the upper hand, you know?

50
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,958
They can use their magic
whenever they want to.

51
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,836
Yeah, well, you know,
that's what separates good from evil.

52
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,964
Yeah, I know that,
but it's still very tempting.

53
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,343
I mean, you could fix your plumbing,
I could turn some lawyers into toads.

54
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,556
Aunt Phoebe, little Wiccans
have very big ears that can hear you.

55
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:11,186
I'm sorry, baby,
I was only kidding! Mostly.

56
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,814
So you gonna be okay?
Because I have to go get fired now.

57
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,025
You are not getting fired.
And I'm fine.

58
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,238
From your mouth to God's ears.
Goodbye, my little niece.

59
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,031
- You're smashing me.
- I love you.

60
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,284
Get off me!

61
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,038
This is no segue, but you and I
need to talk about vanquishing Cole.

62
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,291
Because we don't have
enough problems at the moment?

63
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,627
No, because he's actually our
biggest problem at the moment, okay?

64
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,213
Look at Phoebe,
he's totally beaten her down.

65
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,466
I don't know, she seemed cheerful,
considering the state of her career.

66
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,386
That's this wonderful thing
called denial, okay?

67
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,931
The Phoebe I know would
never roll over for lawyers like that.

68
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,767
And this morning when I was talking
to her about vanquishing Cole,

69
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,979
she told me I was wasting my time.
I'm telling you, she is off.

70
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:59,318
All right, okay already, we'll spend the
afternoon with our noses in potions.

71
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,695
But can I go save the sole source
of our income first?

72
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,989
Yeah, go, I'll see you later.

73
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,576
- Are you okay to orb?
- I'm perfectly fine to orb. Go.

74
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,494
All right.

75
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,750
Paige Matthews?

76
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,376
Yeah?

77
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,003
You're under arrest.

78
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:25,093
Felony hit and run.
She's going down.

79
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,179
And P3?

80
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,141
Health inspector's there.
Our guys are in place.

81
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,605
I gotta say, using the law to bring down
the Charmed Ones was genius, sir.

82
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,065
They'll never figure it out.

83
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,527
They will figure it out.
It'll just be too late.

84
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,320
The Halliwell manor.

85
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,117
The doorway to the spiritual Nexus,
all the power that we need.

86
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,371
Man, right under the witches' house.
Who knew?

87
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,289
I did.

88
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,416
Is that why
they're so damn strong?

89
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,336
Partly. The Nexus packs a punch.

90
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,171
But the power can go either way.

91
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,674
In good hands,
good gets a power boost.

92
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,510
But when we tap into it, evil spreads.

93
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,929
- How far?
- Far enough.

94
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,014
The police, the politicians...

95
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,474
...and Phoebe.

96
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:18,063
She will be consumed by evil.
And she will finally give in to our love,

97
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,900
and then I'll torture and kill her sisters
and we'll live happily ever after.

98
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,902
Sir, I thought the point of all this

99
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,696
was to give you
the power to reorganize

100
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,906
the underworld above ground.

101
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,577
Yes. It is, it is. But to be united,

102
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,247
evil must have a happy leader.
And for me to be happy, I need...

103
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,585
- Phoebe, what are you doing here?
- I came to see you, baby.

104
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,337
I thought we could
have a little picnic.

105
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,844
Kaia, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

106
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,347
Damn, how'd you know it was me?

107
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:59,229
Well, for starters, Phoebe hates me.
And she doesn't drink, and,

108
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,315
she uses a little less tongue.

109
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,233
Since when does a stripper
follow a guy back from work?

110
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,778
Hey, hey, hey, Dex, go easy.
She's got a little crush.

111
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,741
With all due respect, sir, Kiran demons
are manipulative vixens.

112
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,536
And this one has an agenda
that goes way beyond a little crush.

113
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:15,787
Sure.

114
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:21,627
She can smell power, can't you, Kaia?
Maybe she wants to be my new queen.

115
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,379
Just send this one away
and I'll prove my worth.

116
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,468
I'm afraid I can't.
I'm in love with someone else.

117
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,722
But I can give her to you.
I can be her.

118
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,183
No.

119
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:41,021
You're good for the occasional dance,
but beyond that, I need the real thing.

120
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,482
All right, you heard him, get out.
And stay gone.

121
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,192
Otherwise I'll make sure you do.

122
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,322
Not like that.

123
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,742
Go out the way you came in.

124
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,370
In this office,
we keep up appearances.

125
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,749
You want me, I can feel it.

126
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,046
Insolent.

127
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,049
Hot, though.

128
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,220
No. No, no, don't do that. Come on,
you've gotta give me another chance.

129
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,763
And why is that?

130
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,266
Because, because, because...

131
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,643
Because we've been in business
nearly four years

132
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,520
and we haven't failed
an inspection yet.

133
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:26,066
Well, I'd have to disagree with that,
Mr. Wyatt. You failed two this week.

134
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,444
Yeah, but this week has been bad.
Like, strangely bad.

135
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,864
And we'll have the plumbing
fixed tomorrow, so,

136
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,282
can't you just come back then?

137
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:37,911
Well, your record has been
impeccable until now... Whoa, hello.

138
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,749
- Rats too.
- No! No, we don't have rats.

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,668
We... They don't live here.

140
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:47,171
They're just...
They're just trying to ruin my life.

141
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,424
Rodent infestation takes
longer than a day to clear up.

142
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,885
Close down, address the problem,

143
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,929
and we'll schedule another
inspection in a few weeks.

144
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,140
I won't need another inspection
in a few weeks.

145
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,726
Because if I stay closed that long,
I'll be out of business.

146
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,020
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

147
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,397
All right, well, I'll show you out.

148
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,444
Where are you?
I hate you, I hate you. Go home!

149
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:15,824
Get out of here, you plague-spreading,
club-ruining rodents! I will get you.

150
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,370
Piper, what are you doing?

151
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,706
Diminishing the rodent population,
obviously.

152
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,417
Come on, honey,
we're gonna get through this.

153
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:29,963
Yeah, we will, but the club won't.

154
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,091
How can this be happening?
I mean, I know I've neglected the club

155
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,969
since I've been pregnant,
but not this much.

156
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,138
These things happen.
It's just bad luck.

157
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:42,935
No, it is more than bad luck.
It is sabotage, it is...

158
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,938
It's demonic.

159
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,190
- What?
- Well, yeah.

160
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,400
Phoebe's lawsuit,

161
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,861
Paige's accident...

162
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,739
No, that's it.
It's all part of it, it has to be.

163
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,533
- Why?
- Because I said so.

164
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,410
And if not, we're losing the club,
which is just not an option.

165
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,424
Damn. She missed me by this much.

166
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,177
This way please, Miss Matthews.

167
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,855
- No film.
- Try the filing cabinet.

168
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,358
She's not going anywhere.

169
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,616
Why? Why am I not going anywhere?
You've always helped us before.

170
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,369
With your other problems.
This is not others.

171
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,121
- I am not so sure.
- Paige...

172
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:47,082
I didn't do what they're saying I did.

173
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:51,378
And if anybody's trying to set me up,
it would be a de... Others.

174
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:54,506
Officer Garcia is not others,
nor is he in league with any others.

175
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:58,677
He's a good cop. And he has
saved my ass on many an occasion.

176
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,805
My God, I think I see
what's going on here.

177
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:04,099
Phoebe's lawsuit, Piper's club...

178
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,019
You have to get me out of here.
Otherwise, it's gonna get worse.

179
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:11,481
Listen, I am a lieutenant now.
I can't just bend the rules like I used to.

180
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,406
Even if I could,
this is legal problems, you know?

181
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,075
I can't just make those go away.

182
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:31,168
We can't just make it go away.
She has a strong case for malice.

183
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:34,004
I don't understand.
How does she have a strong case?

184
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:38,717
She's claiming that as a result
of your own bitter divorce,

185
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,470
you've made it your mission
to destroy other marriages.

186
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,763
That is ridiculous.

187
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,226
"If you have any doubts,
any doubts at all,

188
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:51,146
I suggest you flee at the speed
of a baby cheetah at supper time."

189
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,648
I was using hyperbole.

190
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:56,568
I know that. But she's collected
dozens of similar clips,

191
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,987
and she's threatening to go
to the press with her story.

192
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,824
And as a newswoman,
I can tell you it's a good story.

193
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,535
Okay, well...

194
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,328
...isn't controversy good for sales?

195
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:11,834
It may be good for the Enquirer,
but I've worked very hard

196
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,753
to build this paper
into a respectable news source.

197
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,171
Can't we just pay her off?

198
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,382
We have insurance
for this type of thing, right?

199
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,551
She doesn't want money.

200
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,553
She wants you fired.

201
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,347
It's like she's on
some kind of vendetta.

202
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,766
I'm sorry, Phoebe.

203
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,979
I have to suspend you without pay
while our lawyers try to work this out.

204
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,655
- Cole.
- Excuse me?

205
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,994
Darryl, have you heard from Paige?

206
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,830
Because she was supposed to come
straight home from the hospital...

207
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,457
Paige is in jail.
We tried to call you, but...

208
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,626
What? What...? For...? What for?

209
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,421
Reckless endangerment
and felony hit and run.

210
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,715
What?

211
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:05,429
You have got to be kidding me.

212
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,890
Paige, Darryl said you were in jail.

213
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,224
Oh, I am.

214
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,767
I mean, I was. I will be,

215
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,353
just as soon as I figure out
what demon is doing this to me.

216
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,606
You just disappeared from jail?

217
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,317
No, I put pillows in the bed first.

218
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,195
It always worked
at my parents' house.

219
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,529
- Paige!
- What?

220
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,573
You weren't gonna help me,
so I had to help myself.

221
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,576
Whether you believe it or not,
there is a demon behind this.

222
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,875
At 2:00, they're gonna come get you
for your bail hearing.

223
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,589
If you're not there, that's my ass.
Everybody knows we're friends.

224
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,592
They're gonna just think
I just let you go.

225
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,887
I will be there at 2:00.

226
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,232
See you.

227
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,566
Okay, he hates me.

228
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,819
Yeah, he does.
But for what it's worth, I'm with you.

229
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,322
Leo's doing the Elder thing.

230
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,699
Let me guess,
you didn't pass inspection.

231
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,369
- Nope.
- Let's just cut to the chase, shall we?

232
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:11,745
Our problems are legal, right?

233
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,872
Who's the only demonic lawyer
that we know?

234
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,084
Cole. And he has gone off
the deep end lately,

235
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:20,420
but how is ruining our lives
gonna help him get Phoebe back?

236
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:24,216
I don't know. But until we figure it out,
we should keep her out of it.

237
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,553
You slimy son of a bitch.

238
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:31,223
- Phoebe, is that you?
- What are you, evil and blind?

239
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,102
Yeah, it's me. Look, why don't you
just admit that you're behind this.

240
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,980
Admit it so I can use magic
to fight you.

241
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,858
I don't know... I don't know
what you're talking about.

242
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,654
Look, Cole, my career
is the most important thing to me.

243
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:48,073
Okay, so is that your plan?
To take it away from me

244
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,409
so that I come running
to you for comfort?

245
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,997
Phoebe, I love you.
And I don't know what's going on,

246
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:57,040
but maybe I could help.

247
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,752
Would you like me to
kill someone for you, or?

248
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,713
Your boss, perhaps?

249
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,428
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

250
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,138
I might not be able to use magic...

251
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,140
You're sexy when you're mad,
you know.

252
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,267
I can't wait until
I get to kiss you again.

253
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:20,939
Cole, I will never be with you again.
I hate you. I hate you. Do you get that?

254
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,318
Hate is good.
It's passionate, intense.

255
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,404
It's... It's a breath away from love.

256
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,998
She's great.

257
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,637
What do you want?

258
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,141
Just to give you what you want.

259
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,242
So, what are we gonna do?

260
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,953
We're gonna tell him we're onto him
and it's not gonna work.

261
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:32,261
I can't believe I saw what I just saw.

262
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,887
Probably because I saw it too.

263
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,765
But how? Why is she kissing him?

264
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,684
I don't know,
but I say we go back in there

265
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,602
- and we pull her out by her hair.
- No.

266
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,857
No. We can't make a scene.
Okay, we need a plan.

267
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:50,404
Okay, here it is.
We go home, we vomit...

268
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,531
- And?
- That's all I got so far.

269
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,533
Okay.

270
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,331
Oh, come on, baby,
it was just getting good.

271
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,208
Not good enough.

272
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,211
You'll never be as good as the real
Phoebe and you should stop trying.

273
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:09,590
You're right. I'll never be as good.

274
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,845
I'll be better. I know tricks the real
Phoebe's never even heard of before.

275
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,973
I've been patient with you
up until now.

276
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,810
This is the last time
I'm gonna say this.

277
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:24,688
Leave and don't come back.

278
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,818
You don't know what you're missing.

279
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,623
Hey! What did I tell you?

280
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:46,919
Cole has some serious work to do.
And I will not have you distracting him.

281
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,629
Cole? What the hell...?
Who are you?

282
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,215
Get it through your thick head.
The leader of the underworld

283
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,383
will never have a whore
as his queen.

284
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,802
Did you just call me a whore?

285
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,472
Kaia?

286
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,144
There's not... There's no...
Are you sure?

287
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:07,523
Leo, we saw Phoebe and Cole,
tongues locked,

288
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,901
hands groping all over each other.

289
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,361
Okay. Didn't need the visual.

290
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:14,905
Well, maybe he has her under
some kind of mind control.

291
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,115
I mean, he can do that.
That's possible, right?

292
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,618
Right. I think right now
he could do pretty much anything.

293
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,245
Why? What do you mean?

294
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,122
Well, the Elders have sensed
a major surge in demonic activity.

295
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,834
And they think that evil
is organizing under a new leader.

296
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,838
That's just great, because the last time
Cole was the leader of the underworld,

297
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,297
he took Phoebe as his queen

298
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:35,008
and we were completely
blindsided by it that time too.

299
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,971
Oh, my God, that's why she didn't
want me to try to vanquish him.

300
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,139
She was talking this morning
about being tempted.

301
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,642
She was trying to warn us
and we didn't even see it.

302
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,769
Okay, this just cannot
be happening, people.

303
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,105
I mean, Phoebe would not
do this to us.

304
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:50,858
I mean, it cannot, cannot,
cannot be happening.

305
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:54,194
Okay, let's just calm down, okay?
The last time Phoebe was evil,

306
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,155
she was under the influence
of her demonic pregnancy.

307
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,616
So, what, you're saying
you think she's pregnant again?

308
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:02,119
No, I just think that maybe
we're underestimating her.

309
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:04,246
Maybe there's something
that we're missing.

310
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,373
We saw what we saw.

311
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:09,835
Okay, well, maybe she's under a spell.
Or maybe there was some information

312
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:13,046
that she wanted
and she was using sex as a tool?

313
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:16,383
Okay, I like the sound of that.
Slutty and manipulative,

314
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,885
that's better than evil any day.

315
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,636
So let's not panic.
Let's talk to Phoebe

316
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,431
and give her a chance
to explain what's going on.

317
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:23,974
By the way, Darryl called.

318
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,733
If she's not ready,
the judge won't wait.

319
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,610
Paige?

320
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,656
Hey, guys, what took you so long?

321
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,249
Coming, Darryl?

322
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,713
Hey!

323
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,674
I wouldn't have to hurt you,
if you stopped trying to get away.

324
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:01,845
What happened?

325
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,306
I mistook her for the other one.

326
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,767
And I said too much.

327
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:09,353
I thought I'd bring her here
until the end of the operation.

328
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,606
Well, good thinking.

329
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,738
Well, as much fun
as this has been...

330
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:23,951
I'm sorry, Phoebe, but Dex is right.
I can't let you leave.

331
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,706
- Leo!
- Save your voice.

332
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,418
This place is magically protected.

333
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:37,965
I can't have you people
sensing what I'm doing in here.

334
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:42,636
Now all the windows
and doors are blocked.

335
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:47,224
And please, sweetie,

336
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:48,600
just trust me on this one.

337
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:51,562
I don't want you getting hurt
trying to escape.

338
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,313
All right, don't call me sweetie.

339
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,484
You can't hold a person prisoner
and then call them sweetie.

340
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,779
You know...

341
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:02,614
...I didn't intend this.

342
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:08,495
I just can't have you running off to your
sisters and protecting the Nexus, okay?

343
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,248
It is way too important to us.

344
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,709
Wait, the Nexus?

345
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,463
- Dex didn't tell you about that?
- No. No, he didn't.

346
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,258
He just told me you were trying
to reorganize the underworld.

347
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,845
Don't be mad. I only want the Nexus

348
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:28,515
so that you can come back to evil
and we can be together.

349
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,267
- Cole...
- I'm so sorry

350
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:31,810
I had to involve your work.

351
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:35,272
I just needed you distracted
while I ruined Piper's club

352
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,565
and put Paige in jail.

353
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,027
Paige is in jail?

354
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:42,279
Listen, I'd love to stay and chat,

355
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,656
but all things considered,
I need to speed up my plan.

356
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:47,659
Look, Cole, my sisters
are gonna realize that I'm missing,

357
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:49,161
and Leo is gonna try to sense me.

358
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,497
And when he can't,
they're gonna come straight to you.

359
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:58,337
Look, thanks for the concern,
but I think I've got my bases covered.

360
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:02,466
I knew you'd want me again.

361
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,551
Ignore her.

362
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,887
Oh, my God.

363
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:09,556
Oh, no. Not God. Kaia.

364
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:11,725
Just listen to her voice.

365
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:14,811
You're sick, you know that?
You need help.

366
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,856
I mean, are you sleeping with me?
I mean her?

367
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,443
You're sick, you know that?
You need help.

368
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:23,612
Good.

369
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,072
Oh, my God.

370
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,698
Oh, my God.

371
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:28,200
Excellent.

372
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,285
Come on, Kaia.

373
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:33,747
I'm gonna need this.

374
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,378
There's some leftover Chinese food
in the fridge.

375
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,096
So if you don't want me,
then what do you want?

376
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:52,391
I want you to go to Phoebe's house
and pretend to be her for a while.

377
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,644
Do your job well
and you'll be amply rewarded.

378
00:23:55,853 --> 00:24:00,566
For a while? Why not just get rid of her
and I can take her place forever?

379
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:04,695
Aside from the fact that I love her,
Phoebe's a Charmed One.

380
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:07,865
She's protected by her powers.
You can't just kill her,

381
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,701
so don't get any silly ideas
and stop playing with your hair.

382
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:13,662
Phoebe's more sophisticated
than that.

383
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:18,250
Now, go to the house
and lay low for a while.

384
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:21,461
I just need a little time
to speed things up.

385
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,975
Did you sustain your injuries
in an accident with Paige Matthews?

386
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,354
Yeah. I guess that was her name.

387
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,065
What are you, a lawyer?

388
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:43,567
Yeah.

389
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:44,902
That and other things.

390
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:47,529
What?

391
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,582
Sorry.

392
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:00,417
Nothing personal.

393
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:08,800
Hi, Piper.

394
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:11,345
- Don't you "Hi, Piper" me, I saw you.
- I thought you said

395
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:13,180
- you were gonna be calm.
- I am calm.

396
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:15,390
- You saw me what?
- Don't act like you don't know

397
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:16,975
what I'm talking about.

398
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,144
No, trust me, it's not an act.

399
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,813
We saw you making out with Cole.

400
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:28,820
Okay, well, that's just not possible,

401
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:33,200
you see, because
I'm pretty sure that I hate Cole, right?

402
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:36,578
Phoebe, I am pregnant,
I am emotional, and I am freaking out.

403
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:39,331
And if you are back together with Cole,
then that is just fine,

404
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,416
but do not deny what I just saw.

405
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,669
Okay.

406
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:47,548
All right.
Then I'm back together with Cole.

407
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:51,009
- What?
- What!? How can you say that?

408
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:53,011
Well, I thought you said it was fine.

409
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,431
Well, I didn't mean it. And for
God sakes, the man mummified you.

410
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:57,641
Whoa, seriously?

411
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,395
Okay, something's not right.
Her memory seems gone.

412
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,022
Okay, that's a good sign.

413
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,191
Now, Phoebe, try and focus.

414
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,735
Does Cole have you under
some kind of spell?

415
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:12,823
- Maybe.
- Maybe? Maybe is good.

416
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,324
Because magic we can fight.

417
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,451
Lust, desperation, insanity
we cannot fight,

418
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:17,703
but magic we can fight.

419
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,663
Unless you've used your powers
for evil.

420
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:21,498
Which you haven't, have you?

421
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:22,916
No, no, I don't think so.

422
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,460
And that would be
the worst thing ever, right?

423
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,337
Yeah. We couldn't bring you
back from that.

424
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:29,631
Okay, so this is what we have to do.

425
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:32,676
You have to take away my powers
so I don't misuse them.

426
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:35,220
Yes. She's not evil. You're not evil.

427
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,307
So you think Cole
has you under his control?

428
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:39,975
Well, yeah.

429
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:43,604
I mean, why else would
I have kissed Cole?

430
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,273
Oh, my God,
what has he done to me?

431
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:49,610
Oh, no, honey, it's gonna be okay.

432
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,153
Yes, it is gonna be okay.

433
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,449
It's gonna be okay once you take away
my powers. You know, just to be safe.

434
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,659
Piper, if you take her powers,
she's gonna be vulnerable.

435
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,495
But you guys can protect me, right?

436
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:01,830
I don't know.
If Cole is reorganizing the underworld,

437
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,499
you're gonna need
the Power of Three.

438
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:07,002
No. As long as we're the ones
that take it away, we can bring it back.

439
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:09,338
But if Cole's got Phoebe
under his control...

440
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:11,381
Yes. She's right.

441
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:13,926
I am my own worst enemy.

442
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,261
The sooner we weaken me,
the better.

443
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:26,438
Leo?

444
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:40,702
This witch's power cannot fight
The lure of evil's magic might

445
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,871
Before misuse lands her in hell

446
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,249
Remove the powers
Of Phoebe Halliwell

447
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,719
Well, it wasn't my best work,
but it should have done the trick.

448
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,304
Are you okay?

449
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:01,181
How do you feel?

450
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:04,059
- Fine.
- So the spell worked?

451
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:05,644
- Why wouldn't it?
- You know,

452
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:08,146
maybe you should try it out.
Try levitating.

453
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:16,530
What are you doing?

454
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:22,911
Well, I just thought I'd try everything.

455
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,706
- So you can't levitate?
- Apparently not.

456
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:27,291
That means the spell worked, right?

457
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:29,459
I don't know,
you're still kind of weird.

458
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:31,879
Maybe the spell had a side effect?

459
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:36,925
Or maybe I just feel sick
because I had to kiss Cole.

460
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,011
That's my girl.

461
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,515
Yeah, maybe I need to go and rest
for a little while, you know?

462
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:44,892
That's a good idea.

463
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:51,315
Okay, honey, why don't you just
lay down for a little while?

464
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,275
Do you want some tea
or something?

465
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,903
- Tea sounds great.
- Tea, yes.

466
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:04,661
Tea. Who drinks tea?

467
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:27,226
Knife in the panty drawer.

468
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:29,561
My kind of girl.

469
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:34,358
Poor little witchy lost her powers.

470
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:36,193
I should just put you
out of your misery.

471
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,612
What are you doing here?

472
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,783
I thought I should tell you

473
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,577
that they know you're trying
to reorganize the underworld.

474
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:47,454
I didn't ask you to report to me.

475
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:49,456
What were you doing to Phoebe?

476
00:29:49,665 --> 00:29:51,792
Well, she's lying in the middle
of the room.

477
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,418
I was making sure she's okay.

478
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:55,212
Since when have you been worried
about her well-being?

479
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,256
Since she means so much to you.

480
00:29:57,923 --> 00:30:00,926
What? Do you actually think
I'd be stupid enough to hurt her?

481
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:02,928
That wouldn't make you happy, baby.

482
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:05,639
And you know all I wanna do
is make you happy.

483
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:09,059
If you want to make me happy,
go do the job I asked you to do.

484
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:12,396
Fine, bossy-boots.

485
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,815
- Whatever gets you off.
- And when the time comes,

486
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:17,109
make sure that Piper
goes to the bail bondsman.

487
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:19,695
She'll refuse at first,
but you can convince her.

488
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:21,655
- The bail bondsman?
- You'll figure it out.

489
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:23,991
Now go.

490
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:07,701
What?

491
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:12,623
Are you okay?

492
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:15,167
Phoebe?

493
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:20,756
Didn't you hear me knocking?

494
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:23,467
No, I was listening to music
to help me relax.

495
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:25,677
Why was the door locked?

496
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:30,182
That was Paige on the phone.
Things just got a whole lot worse.

497
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:36,021
How did she die?
I thought it was just a concussion.

498
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:38,106
The doctors think
there was a blood clot in her brain.

499
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:40,609
- It's all my fault.
- No, it isn't.

500
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:44,321
- Yeah, it is, I killed her.
- No, you didn't, Cole did.

501
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:45,989
- What?
- Look, I can't prove it,

502
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:49,576
but we found out that he has Phoebe
under some kind of mind control.

503
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:51,745
Which means he's probably
behind all of this.

504
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:55,624
- That evil bastard.
- He's killing innocent people.

505
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,669
All right, let's get you out of here.
Come on, open this thing up.

506
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:00,337
It's not gonna be so easy.

507
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:02,673
Why?

508
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,591
When the other driver died,

509
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,554
the judge charged Paige
with vehicular homicide.

510
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:11,473
He set the bail at $50,000.

511
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,184
Oh, my God, where are we gonna
get that kind of money?

512
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:16,436
It's after six.
The banks aren't even open.

513
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,858
Bail bondsman.

514
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,694
- We'll just go to a bail bondsman.
- You just go.

515
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:27,447
Do that light thing that you do.
I will try to cover for you.

516
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,241
What about your job?

517
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:32,077
It doesn't matter. I should have
believed you in the first place.

518
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:33,579
I will cover for you.

519
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:36,039
No. Because if they figure out
that Paige is gone,

520
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:37,457
she'll be in even more trouble.

521
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:40,210
We'll go to a bail bondsman,
that's what they're there for.

522
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:44,381
Okay, you may be right. But you don't
have to be so cheerful about it.

523
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:47,509
I'm just saying we can't leave Paige
in jail overnight.

524
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:50,220
You know, that's exactly
what Cole wants, I'm sure.

525
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:53,265
For that kind of bail, you're gonna need
some heavy-duty collateral.

526
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:56,518
We can't use the club because it's...
You know?

527
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:58,061
Then we'll have to use the house.

528
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:06,570
All right, this will cover
the 50,000 bail.

529
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:11,617
Sign here and here. And...

530
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:14,328
...I'm gonna need to hold on
to the grant deed to your house.

531
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:17,164
You'll get it back when the jailbird
shows up for court.

532
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:21,376
Oh, it'll be fine,
Paige won't skip bail.

533
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:24,838
All right, just sign there.

534
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:31,637
This doesn't feel right.

535
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:35,849
Yeah, well, it never does, lady.
It never does.

536
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:41,271
Here's the receipt. Hold on to it.

537
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:46,902
That's it. Your sister shows up
for court, you pay me back.

538
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:48,904
Plus ten percent.

539
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:50,989
Let's go make this worth our while.

540
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:20,060
Okay, people, let's move. The sooner
we destroy Cole's headquarters,

541
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:23,230
the sooner I feel better
about this whole damn day.

542
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:27,568
Piper, we've got a bit
of a situation in here.

543
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:29,361
I knew I forgot something.

544
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,824
My mother always warned me about
protecting my house from orbing.

545
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,909
- Your house?
- Yes.

546
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:39,538
You signed it, I have it.

547
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:43,834
You can take me to court and try to
evict me, but by then, it'll be too late.

548
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:45,335
Too late for what?

549
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:47,212
I don't know what you think
you're doing,

550
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,422
but we have the paperwork

551
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:50,841
that says the house is ours
unless Paige forfeits bail.

552
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,259
Correction.

553
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:59,641
I have the paperwork.

554
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,476
Phoebe, what's going on?

555
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:06,857
Dear.

556
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:25,626
I don't even get one little
thank-you kiss?

557
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:29,129
You did well, and you'll be paid
for your efforts later.

558
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:37,804
Is this what a girl has to do to get
a little attention around here?

559
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,390
She hates you.

560
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,769
You said it yourself.

561
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:46,688
So why fight for her,
when I'm here for the taking?

562
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,566
You know, Kaia,
I haven't killed you yet,

563
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:51,777
because I find you
mildly entertaining.

564
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:54,488
But soon the real Phoebe
will be by my side.

565
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,406
And I'm not too sure
that she'll feel the same way,

566
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:59,618
so in the interest of survival,
I suggest you make yourself scarce.

567
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:09,545
Or maybe I'll just make her scarce.

568
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:16,218
Okay, I said something about hell,
and I rhymed it with Halliwell...

569
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:18,470
How could you not keep a copy
of the spell you used

570
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:20,055
to take away our sister's powers?

571
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:23,183
It was a crappy spell, okay.
So I left it in the house, all right?

572
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,353
Forgive me for not anticipating
the demonic foreclosure.

573
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:28,564
What does he want in the house,
anyway?

574
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,274
Is he after the Book of Shadows?

575
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,608
I still can't sense Phoebe.

576
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:33,485
God, do you think
she's even still alive?

577
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:36,113
Cole wouldn't kill her. I don't think.

578
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,322
What about floozy Phoebe?

579
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,116
Maybe she's got something
up her sleeve.

580
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:41,368
Are you trying to help
or are you just gonna ramble?

581
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:43,704
- I'm just gonna ramble.
- All right, that's enough.

582
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:45,747
Piper, you need to work on the spell.

583
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:48,834
If Phoebe is still alive,
she's gonna need her powers.

584
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:56,258
You don't deserve him.

585
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:59,428
How many times do I have to tell you
I don't want him?

586
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:09,438
"I want the real Phoebe.
I love the real Phoebe.

587
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,732
You'll never be as good
as the real Phoebe."

588
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:24,286
What do you think, witch?
Am I as good as you?

589
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:27,581
Or better?

590
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:32,294
Okay, all right. Look,
I'm sure we can talk about this.

591
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:34,087
I don't think so.

592
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:38,383
See, I'm more of a looker
than a talker.

593
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,677
Oh, you're blond,
I should have known.

594
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:43,305
This is gonna be fun.

595
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:50,354
Your powers!

596
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,785
You were right, that was fun.

597
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,592
Leo!

598
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:29,768
- We're really sorry.
- Hi. Yeah, we're sorry.

599
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:30,978
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?

600
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:33,814
It's okay, it's okay, I'm okay.
I'm not mad.

601
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:36,817
Well, maybe I'm a little bit mad.
I mean, what took you guys so long?

602
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:40,571
- And what happened to my powers?
- Well, she looked like you.

603
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:42,531
At the hospital,
you said you were tempted,

604
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:44,533
and that you didn't want us
to vanquish him.

605
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:46,160
Then we saw you
making out with Cole

606
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:47,661
and we all got a little panicky.

607
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:49,997
Excuse me. Did you really think
I was making out with Cole?

608
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:52,958
- We mention we were sorry?
- You guys.

609
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:55,836
Okay, well, I'm assuming since
you're standing out on the street,

610
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:59,089
- that means Cole's in the house?
- Yeah, but we don't know why.

611
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:02,718
- He wants the Nexus.
- Oh, no, he does not.

612
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:05,053
Wait, didn't I read about that
in the Book of Shadows?

613
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,972
Isn't that what made you evil before?

614
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:10,225
- How does he know about that?
- He knows everything about us.

615
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:13,395
Okay, look, if he wants its power,
he's gonna have to open the earth

616
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:16,231
under the basement
and take the Shadow into him.

617
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,859
- Okay, so how do we stop him?
- Well, we can't.

618
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:22,362
But once he has the Shadow,
there is a spell that can

619
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:25,282
send it back into the earth,
and hopefully take Cole with him.

620
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:28,535
Yeah, but it has to be said
over the Nexus in the basement.

621
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:31,330
Great, there's only a whole load
of demons in the house,

622
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:33,290
and a force field keeping us out.

623
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:36,877
But the one good thing
about Cole's little girlfriend,

624
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:38,086
who is dead by the way...

625
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:41,006
...she looks just like me.

626
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:43,592
Wait a second.
So you're gonna pretend to be her

627
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:44,843
pretending to be you?

628
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,678
If you go in there,
you'll be vulnerable.

629
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:47,888
To turning evil?

630
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,516
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's his plan.

631
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:55,395
Look, you guys underestimated me
once already today.

632
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:56,772
Please don't do it again.

633
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:03,862
She twirled her hair.

634
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:05,697
A lot.

635
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:08,867
She twirled her hair. Like this?

636
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:13,956
Okay, I'm going in.

637
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,716
Hey, baby,
wanna escort a girl inside?

638
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:26,802
Kaia, are you still playing
good witch?

639
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:29,179
It's the way the big man likes it.

640
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:30,764
Sick.

641
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,102
Hey, look who it is.

642
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:37,646
Hi, boys. Did you miss me?

643
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:40,566
All right, the entertainment's here.

644
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:42,276
Hey!

645
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:48,282
Sorry, I'm just, you know,
saving the goods for Cole.

646
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:50,200
Take my jacket, boys.

647
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:55,664
Step aside and let a lady by?

648
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:59,209
You're no lady, Kaia.
And the boss sent you away.

649
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:03,046
Yeah, but he didn't mean it.
Come on, let me past.

650
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:05,048
I'll let you past.

651
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:08,302
If you can drop that witch act
right now.

652
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:39,166
I'm so happy you came.

653
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:42,127
I am light
I am one too strong to fight...

654
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,671
Oh, don't fight it, Phoebe.

655
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:46,381
Let evil take you.

656
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:50,052
Return to dark where shadows dwell
You can't have this Halliwell

657
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:52,596
- It's no use, Phoebe.
- So go away and leave my sight

658
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:54,348
And take with you
This endless night

659
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:31,093
My sweet Phoebe.

660
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,720
I don't know how you did it.

661
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:37,099
How you got past the force field,
past the guards.

662
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:39,101
But I love that you did.

663
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:41,770
It's that fight that made me
fall in love with you in the first place.

664
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:44,523
- I thought you were dead.
- So did I for a minute there.

665
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,692
But now that I know the earth
can't even hold me,

666
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,569
I guess I'll just call the Shadow
and try again.

667
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,237
You could do that.

668
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:53,198
Hell, you could even
turn me evil again.

669
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:57,744
But you will never win.
Because I'll never come back to you.

670
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:01,248
- Phoebe.
- You just don't get it, Cole, do you?

671
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:04,251
I thought you were dead
and I felt nothing.

672
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:08,005
No pain, no love, nothing.

673
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:11,300
I'm free.

674
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:15,679
And when we do vanquish you,
and we will...

675
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:19,099
...I'll never look back.

676
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:43,040
Okay, where are they?
Where are the demons?

677
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:45,834
Sorry, my sweeties,
but they're all dead.

678
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:47,961
You didn't even leave us one?

679
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:51,632
Well, there is one left.
Believe me, there is one left.

680
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,177
But I was able to get back the house,

681
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:57,012
and keep Cole
from getting the Nexus.

682
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:00,933
What about your job? And my club?

683
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:04,520
I think you can use your magic
to reverse Cole's, consequence-free.

684
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:06,813
Well, thank the Lord for that.

685
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,817
It won't reverse everything, though.
What about the woman he killed?

686
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:14,488
I promise you he won't
get away with that.

687
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:30,254
You asked for me?

688
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:31,964
Kaia's friend?

689
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,801
- Used to be.
- She tell you what I want?

690
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:39,346
You mean this?

691
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:42,099
Yeah, that's it.

692
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:48,564
Just tell me what you want, baby.

693
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:58,782
That's what I want, baby.
