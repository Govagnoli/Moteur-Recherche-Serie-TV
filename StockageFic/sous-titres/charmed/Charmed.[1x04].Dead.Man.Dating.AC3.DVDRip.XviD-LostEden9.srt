1
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,971
Andy, hi.

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,892
I was nowhere near the neighbourhood,
thought I'd stop by.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,186
Honest man. I like that.

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,607
So...

5
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:28,695
...I had a great time last night.
- Yeah, me too.

6
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:33,575
But I forgot to give you something
very important. Happy birthday.

7
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,912
- But it's not my birthday till next week.
- Consider this a preview.

8
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,751
- A key?
- To the Calistoga Spa.

9
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,836
We leave Friday night after work.

10
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,801
- Don't worry, I got us adjoining rooms.
- Adjoining rooms?

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,305
I wouldn't want to assume something
I'm not supposed to be assuming.

12
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,600
Although, it has been
over a month since we...

13
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,894
Then decided to take it slow.

14
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:05,857
But no pressure.
I just want to be with you, away.

15
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,692
Together.

16
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,404
- Think about it.
- Okay.

17
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,123
Let me know. Bye.

18
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,466
Happy birthday to me.

19
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,385
Give me a break, Mom.

20
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,349
You're like the Chinese
Shirley MacLaine, you know?

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,437
- I'll risk it.
- You should have more respect

22
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,856
for Ghost Month.
If your grandmother were here...

23
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,442
She'd warn me about all the
evil spirits walking the streets

24
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,110
of Chinatown, I know. I know.

25
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,030
You should take this.

26
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,532
For protection.

27
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,956
Maybe the ghosts
need protection from me.

28
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:12,757
I'll be okay, Mom. I'm 23 now.
I can take care of myself, okay?

29
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:15,509
- I gotta go.
- Happy birthday, Mark.

30
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,553
Thanks.

31
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:22,600
- Hi, Mark.
- Hey, how are you?

32
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:50,127
- This the guy?
- That's him.

33
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,714
- Today your birthday?
- Who are you? What do you want?

34
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:56,967
You. Make a wish.

35
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:23,493
Perfect fit.

36
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:26,913
Come on, now, douse him.

37
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:31,209
Come on. Hurry up.

38
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,632
What are you doing?

39
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,801
Hey, wait. No!

40
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:45,849
Let's get out of here.
Let's go. Come on.

41
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:27,992
Good morning.
What are you doing?

42
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:30,035
Prue's coming down,
put those away.

43
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:32,746
Phoebe, you were supposed to send
these invitations last week.

44
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:35,875
- The party is Friday.
- We're right on schedule.

45
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:40,004
The restaurant's reserved, the menu's
selected, the cake has been ordered.

46
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,464
That's because I did all those things.

47
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,509
At least tell me you've managed
to buy Prue something

48
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:47,636
other than your
traditional birthday gift.

49
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:50,723
- What's my traditional gift?
- A card, three days late.

50
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,811
Yeah, well, I decided to break
that tradition and start a new one.

51
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:57,104
You bought Prue a gift?

52
00:05:58,397 --> 00:06:00,232
Where did you get
the money to pay for it?

53
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:03,026
- Morning.
- Morning.

54
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:05,821
Hey, I forgot to ask,
how was your date with Andy?

55
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:10,159
Great. Until he asked me to
spend my birthday at a spa with him.

56
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:13,036
- Oh, I hate it when they do that.
- For this weekend?

57
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:16,873
- You didn't say yes, did you?
- My body did, screamed it actually.

58
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:18,792
But I don't know.
I have to think about it.

59
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,672
A weekend of rest, rubdowns and
room service, what's to think about?

60
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:26,842
I mean, you could be right.

61
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,678
Going away with a guy is like...

62
00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:32,723
It's like bringing them home to meet
the parents. Changes everything.

63
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,059
And if you're not sure if you're ready to
make a commitment or not, you know,

64
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:38,478
you don't wanna send
the wrong signal.

65
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:40,272
You need a week to prepare
for a weekend away.

66
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,608
I mean, there's lingerie shopping,
waxing, manicure, pedicure.

67
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:46,820
I mean, it's basically a full-time job,
and you've already got one.

68
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:50,699
So you'll never be ready. Not even
if you started packing this second.

69
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:56,413
Bottom line. Unless you're ready
to put your toothbrush next to his,

70
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,831
you shouldn't go.

71
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,959
You guys aren't trying to plan
another surprise party for me, are you?

72
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,877
No, never.

73
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,755
No, we've given up on
trying to surprise you, Prue.

74
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:09,467
Well, that's good, because you
both know how much I hate surprises.

75
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,430
Damn it, Phoebe.
If you had sent Andy his invitation,

76
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:14,848
we wouldn't be in this mess.

77
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:17,142
Okay, what are you talking about?
You heard Prue,

78
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:20,103
she doesn't want a party.
You should be glad that I flaked.

79
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,357
Besides, you know as well as I do
she's gonna go away with Andy.

80
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:29,696
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a present to pay for.

81
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:32,156
Which means I have a job interview.

82
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:41,332
No other hotel does psychic readings
at the bar, it's kind of our trademark.

83
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,460
<i>Well, that's why I'm here.
I saw your ad in the Chronicle.</i>

84
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:47,630
- I am a natural-born psychic.
- Yeah, right.

85
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:51,259
So, what's your act? Tea leaves,
tarot cards, crystal balls, what?

86
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:54,345
No, I can see the future.

87
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:57,932
I mean, I can't always see it. I never
actually know when it's gonna work.

88
00:07:58,099 --> 00:07:59,809
Usually, when I touch someone,

89
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:02,353
or I'm in the same general area
as them.

90
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,063
It's kind of hard to explain.

91
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:10,444
- Next.
- No, wait! Frankie, hold it. I see it.

92
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:12,571
You're having dinner
with a blond woman.

93
00:08:12,738 --> 00:08:15,116
She's gorgeous, all over you.

94
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:19,787
Then some redhead shows up.
You look surprised.

95
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:24,750
She looks pissed. Your wife?

96
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:31,549
When can you start?

97
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,845
<i>So have you made your
mind up about Calistoga?</i>

98
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:37,847
I don't know.
I keep thinking it's a bad idea,

99
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:41,100
then I think, what's the big deal?
It's not like we haven't slept together.

100
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:44,061
I think you should go. On Saturday.

101
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,771
On Saturday, why?

102
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:48,524
Piper, you promised.
No surprise party.

103
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:52,152
It's not what you think. It's Phoebe.
She bought you a present.

104
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:55,489
Phoebe doesn't give presents,
she gives cards, three days late.

105
00:08:55,698 --> 00:08:57,616
Not this year. Surprise.

106
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:59,660
<i>And she really wants to
give it to you Friday,</i>

107
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:02,913
<i>so could you please just ask Andy
about leaving on Saturday instead?</i>

108
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:06,792
You have no idea how much Phoebe
has put herself through. She even...

109
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:10,254
She even got a job and everything.

110
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,464
<i>Okay, I'll ask. If I decide to go.</i>

111
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:17,719
<i>- So, what kind of job did Phoebe get?
- Don't know. Gotta go. Ciao.</i>

112
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:31,358
You're in a large room,
with lots of other people.

113
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:34,861
- With lots of other women.
- Go on.

114
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:40,992
You're standing at a podium.
No, wait, you're on a scale.

115
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:46,289
It's a Weight Watchers meeting.

116
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:50,460
Honey, it looks like
you've gained some weight.

117
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:54,172
That's impossible.
I only cheated once this week.

118
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:56,424
No, no, I'm not judging.
I'm just seeing.

119
00:09:56,591 --> 00:10:00,303
You're a fraud, that's what you are.
I've never been so insulted in my life.

120
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,181
- I want my $20 back.
- No way. I saw you.

121
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:04,975
You know I saw you.

122
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:10,105
Hey, you want me to lie next time?
Just say so.

123
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:13,400
- Phoebe.
- Piper.

124
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:16,653
I am so busted, aren't I?

125
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:22,033
- Are you out of your mind again?
- No, I'm the Amazing Phoebe.

126
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:24,577
This is not funny. Our powers
are supposed to be a secret,

127
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:26,121
not a marketable job skill.

128
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:28,665
Relax, they didn't hire me
because they think I'm a witch,

129
00:10:28,832 --> 00:10:30,708
they hired me
because they think I'm a psychic.

130
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,711
Hairsplitting. You know you can't
use your powers for personal gain.

131
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:38,174
- Not without consequences.
- No, but it's for Prue. It's not for me.

132
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:41,052
It's to pay for her present.
It's completely selfless.

133
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:42,720
Besides, this is the last place

134
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:45,723
anyone would expect to find
a real psychic, believe me.

135
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,225
Which one of you is the psychic?

136
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:49,227
- She is.
- Oh, I am.

137
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:51,604
You can see me? Both of you?

138
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,816
Of course we can see you.
Now back off.

139
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:57,944
Thank God. I've tried communicating
with every psychic in the city.

140
00:10:58,111 --> 00:10:59,570
You were my last chance.

141
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,573
Phoebe, what are you doing?
We got customers waiting.

142
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:05,618
Okay, listen to me, you're the
only ones who can help me.

143
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:08,287
Excuse us? We're trying
to have an argument here.

144
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:15,253
Who are you?

145
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:18,256
She's just leaving.

146
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:20,675
Bye. Go. Now.

147
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:25,596
- Wait a minute. I need your help.
- Yeah? Talk to the psychic.

148
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:29,141
Please, I'm begging you. I was
murdered last night, I can prove it.

149
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:31,060
Stop harassing me, buddy.

150
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:33,354
Please, I'm desperate.
You gotta help me.

151
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:36,982
Leave me alone or I'll call the police.
Can you believe this guy?

152
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:40,611
All you have to do is come with me
to Chinatown and see for yourself.

153
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,863
All right, that's it.
Look, either back off or...

154
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,281
Look out!

155
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:52,915
Now do you believe me?

156
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:57,461
Oh, my God.
I can see you, but no one else can?

157
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,588
I'm dead. I'm a ghost.

158
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,554
Would you like another one?

159
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:17,147
So she goes, "Okay."

160
00:12:17,314 --> 00:12:19,316
So he leans over
and gives her a kiss.

161
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:21,527
- Right on the cheek...
- Hi.

162
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:22,778
Prue.

163
00:12:23,362 --> 00:12:26,698
I tried calling the station house for you.
They said that you'd probably be here.

164
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:28,367
- Hi.
- Hi.

165
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:35,040
- Oh, Prue, this is...
- Susan Trudeau. Nice to meet you.

166
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:37,250
- Pleasure.
- Trudeau?

167
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,461
- Sister?
- No, actually...

168
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,713
Wife.

169
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,340
Ex-wife.

170
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:45,801
- Prue, wait, I can explain.
- Don't bother.

171
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:49,679
It's not what you think.
We divorced over...

172
00:12:56,853 --> 00:12:58,021
Thanks for helping me.

173
00:12:58,188 --> 00:13:01,525
When you wouldn't leave my doorstep,
you didn't leave me much of a choice.

174
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:06,071
- Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
- Please, I don't have much time.

175
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:08,615
Somebody has to find my body
before it's too late.

176
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:10,200
Too late for what?

177
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:14,788
It's a Chinese myth, or at least
I always thought it was a myth.

178
00:13:14,996 --> 00:13:18,208
<i>It's called Da Jui.
When the gates of hell open.</i>

179
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,294
- We're almost there.
- The gates of hell? I don't understand.

180
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:25,632
If the gatekeeper, Yama, captures my
soul before my body's properly buried,

181
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,592
he'll take me to hell. Forever.

182
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,427
But you said you were murdered.
How can...?

183
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:34,182
Yama doesn't care about good or evil.
He just wants souls.

184
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,809
I should've listened to my mother.

185
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:41,689
Is that you?

186
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:50,448
- Yama.
- Yama?

187
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:57,288
- Run.
- It's too late. You'd better go. Run!

188
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:04,921
- What happened?
- I'm a good witch, remember?

189
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:07,548
- But how?
- I don't know.

190
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:11,260
I panic, I put up both hands,
and bad things tend to freeze.

191
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:13,471
- For how long?
- Not very. Let's go.

192
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:44,084
Prue, you can't do this.
Piper's gonna be crushed.

193
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:48,088
- I'm gonna be crushed?
- The surprise party is off.

194
00:14:48,297 --> 00:14:49,840
- What party?
- She's onto us.

195
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:52,718
The restaurant called
while we were out.

196
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,428
Is that why you were
so upset earlier?

197
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:56,472
Let's just say
it hasn't been a great day.

198
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,059
Does it have anything to do with
why Andy's been calling all night?

199
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:02,144
Piper, where did you say
today's paper was?

200
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:04,271
Hey, I'm practically naked here.

201
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,023
Sorry.

202
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,900
What's the drunk
from the hotel doing here?

203
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:11,111
- The name's Mark. I'm not a drunk.
- He's a ghost.

204
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,572
- Excuse me? A what?
- A ghost.

205
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:15,949
He was murdered,
and he obviously needs our help.

206
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:17,826
Why else would we
be able to see him?

207
00:15:17,993 --> 00:15:20,496
- Well, he can see us, that's for sure.
- Hey!

208
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:25,000
- Of all the days to be a dead man.
- You sure this guy's really a ghost?

209
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:29,129
Positive.

210
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:35,135
So how do we know that the guy
doesn't really belong in hell?

211
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:39,014
Because we can see him. He's one
of the innocent we have to protect.

212
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,266
Protect from what? He's dead.

213
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:44,478
All we have to do is get Mark's family
to give him a proper burial,

214
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:48,857
and then he can move on
to wherever it is he moves on to.

215
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:52,569
Okay, so call the police
and let them know where the body is.

216
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:56,323
I already did. I just wanna give them
a little time to notify Mark's mom

217
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:59,951
- before I go and I talk to her.
- Talk to her? And tell her what?

218
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:02,746
That you're a witch in touch
with the ghost of her dead son?

219
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:05,290
No, I'm just gonna try
and get her to have a funeral

220
00:16:05,457 --> 00:16:09,419
as soon as possible,
before Yama gets Mark's spirit.

221
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:13,548
Hello?

222
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:17,218
Hi, I can't really talk right now.

223
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:20,805
It's important?
Okay, I'll be at the hotel in a little while.

224
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:25,268
All right, bye. That was my
new boss calling, I gotta run.

225
00:16:27,437 --> 00:16:32,025
Okay, so when you called the police,
you didn't talk to Andy, did you?

226
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,277
No, it was anonymous.

227
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,654
Why, did you decide
to not to go away with him?

228
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,865
Actually, I decided to go.

229
00:16:39,073 --> 00:16:43,077
Until I went to tell him and found him
having dinner with his ex-wife.

230
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:45,079
- His what?
- Yeah. I mean,

231
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:47,957
you'd think that
he would have remembered

232
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:51,586
to reveal that little fact
before we jumped in the sack.

233
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,755
Well, what did he say?
Why didn't he tell you?

234
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:56,674
I don't know. I didn't hang around
long enough to ask.

235
00:16:58,009 --> 00:16:59,344
How's it going in there?

236
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:03,389
Sorry.

237
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:05,725
You know?

238
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,102
Don't these guys knock?

239
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,816
The guy's staying in the grand suite.
Could be a sultan, I'm not sure.

240
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,318
Anyway, that's why I called.

241
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:18,154
Let's make this bozo's night.
Read his future.

242
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:20,990
Tell him something good
and he'll extend his stay, guaranteed.

243
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:23,701
Look, like I said, I don't always know
when my psychic switch

244
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,161
is gonna be in the up position.

245
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:27,747
Look, I have the utmost confidence
in you, Phoebe, baby.

246
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,624
I don't know how you do it,
but keep it up

247
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,459
and you'll always have work here.

248
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:39,925
Excuse me, sir! You forgot you're...

249
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,618
You okay? What's the matter?

250
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:08,579
Nothing. I...

251
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:11,915
Nothing.

252
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:35,856
Still new to me.
I keep forgetting I'm...

253
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,614
- Those for me?
- Yeah. Stupid question:

254
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,034
- Do ghosts sleep?
- I don't even get cold anymore.

255
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,328
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

256
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:51,038
It's the thought that counts.

257
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:56,918
I guess it's finally sinking in.

258
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:59,629
What's really happened.

259
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:01,173
What I've lost.

260
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:05,343
No more sucking down a bucket
of oysters at the Wharf.

261
00:19:05,552 --> 00:19:07,387
Playing pickup ball with friends.

262
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:12,601
Coming home and hearing
my mother's voice on the machine,

263
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,855
nagging because I haven't
married a nice Chinese girl.

264
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,567
Your mom means a lot to you, huh?

265
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,737
She's a great friend.

266
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:26,698
Was.

267
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:36,916
It was just me and her
after my father died.

268
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,252
Taught me everything I know.

269
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:41,838
Especially how to cook.

270
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:45,383
- Mom's a great cook.
- My Grams taught me how to cook.

271
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:48,928
- I loved it so much I became a chef.
- Really?

272
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:52,432
- Ever make a Peking duck?
- No. You?

273
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,933
It's a piece of cake.

274
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,394
Mom told me
I could've been a great chef,

275
00:19:56,561 --> 00:20:00,315
if I hadn't sold out to the
molecular biology program at Stanford.

276
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:03,568
So you can make Peking duck
and clone DNA.

277
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:05,862
The duck's harder.

278
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:10,992
Well, I can talk about food
all night long.

279
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,953
Yeah? Well, I can
talk about it forever.

280
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:28,342
Oh, Mr Correy, thank goodness.
I need to talk to you.

281
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:29,927
- You do? Me?
- Yeah.

282
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:32,471
- Hey, you're that psychic, right?
- Yeah, right. Look...

283
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:35,891
- Is that how you knew my name?
- No. Yes.

284
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:38,352
Did you get the note
that I left for you?

285
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:41,480
That note warning me
not to go outside? That was you?

286
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:44,650
You get your jollies
out of trying to scare people?

287
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:46,485
Or is that how
you drum up business?

288
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:48,738
What? You don't understand...

289
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:51,157
Honey, where do you
want to eat break...?

290
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:54,076
- Hi.
- What's she doing here?

291
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:56,328
- She sent the note.
- It's not what you think.

292
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:58,164
Look here.
When I picked up your wallet...

293
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,750
- You stole my wallet?
- I didn't steal your wallet.

294
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:06,171
I don't know what you want, but just
stay away from us, you understand?

295
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:08,757
But he's going to die.

296
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:14,179
That didn't come out right.
Look, I can't tell you how I know this,

297
00:21:14,346 --> 00:21:19,518
but I swear, if you go outside,
you're gonna get run over by a pink...

298
00:21:20,102 --> 00:21:22,855
Wait, you don't have your briefcase.

299
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:26,233
That's good, that's really good. It
doesn't happen without your briefcase.

300
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,571
You leave us alone,
or I'm gonna call hotel security.

301
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:53,885
Hi.

302
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:56,638
You of all people should know
that bribery is a crime.

303
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:59,391
Apologizing isn't, is it?

304
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:03,395
Look, Prue, I'm sorry I didn't tell you
I was married before. I should have.

305
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:07,441
- I was going to.
- Really? When?

306
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:10,235
Before or after the door
to our adjoining rooms

307
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:13,321
- swung open this weekend?
- Okay, I deserve that.

308
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:16,533
I don't understand how you
couldn't have found the time to tell me.

309
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:18,743
Unless you really were
trying to hide it from me.

310
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,745
Come on, Prue,
you know me better than that.

311
00:22:20,954 --> 00:22:23,957
- Do I?
- It was an innocent dinner, that's all.

312
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:26,668
I've got an ex-wife and I don't
hate her, is that so horrible?

313
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:29,337
No. No, it's not.

314
00:22:30,338 --> 00:22:33,091
But not being honest
and telling me up front is.

315
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:36,344
Which I've already apologized for.

316
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,222
Why are you trying to turn this
into something it's not?

317
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:46,729
What's really bugging you, Prue?

318
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:52,735
Looks like I'm not the only one
trying to hide a secret.

319
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,414
Are you sure this is going to work?

320
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:07,083
If you speak her language,
she'll trust you.

321
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:08,793
Can I help you?

322
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:32,733
She asked if you know where I am.

323
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:37,822
- Wait, you don't?
- No. And I'm worried sick.

324
00:23:37,989 --> 00:23:40,116
I haven't heard from him
since his birthday.

325
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:45,454
- The police haven't notified her yet?
- How's that possible?

326
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:50,835
- I mean, that he hasn't called yet?
- I don't know, it's not like him.

327
00:23:51,001 --> 00:23:53,295
When did you last see him?

328
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:56,674
Well...

329
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:59,510
Piper, you have to tell her.

330
00:23:59,718 --> 00:24:03,097
You have to tell her where
my body is so she can bury me.

331
00:24:03,556 --> 00:24:05,224
I can't.

332
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:09,061
I can't remember
the last time, actually.

333
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:12,523
But if I see him or hear from him,
I'll let you know.

334
00:24:13,148 --> 00:24:15,025
Thank you. Thank you.

335
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:17,903
You can't walk away, Piper.
You have to tell her.

336
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,990
Mom. No!

337
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,827
- What happened?
- She's got the house protected

338
00:24:24,994 --> 00:24:26,203
against ghosts.

339
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:29,164
All the Chinese fairy tales
she told me growing up are true.

340
00:24:29,873 --> 00:24:31,458
And I'm gonna burn in hell.

341
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:42,302
- Man trouble?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

342
00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:45,180
By the way,
where were you last night?

343
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:49,977
- Something wrong?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

344
00:24:55,524 --> 00:24:57,401
Okay.

345
00:24:57,567 --> 00:25:00,529
You never clean, and you'll talk
about anything. What's up?

346
00:25:00,737 --> 00:25:02,489
Nothing.

347
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:04,908
Phoebe.

348
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,704
Okay, I had a premonition.
A really bad one too.

349
00:25:09,913 --> 00:25:13,208
I saw a guy getting run over
by a pink Cadillac.

350
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:16,294
- Pink Cadillac?
- I know it sounds ridiculous,

351
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:20,215
but it's true. I saw it,
and I don't know what to do about it.

352
00:25:20,423 --> 00:25:21,550
Did you warn him?

353
00:25:21,716 --> 00:25:24,094
Yeah, I tried.
He thought I was out of my mind.

354
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:26,513
Thought I was stalking him
or something.

355
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:30,183
How do you tell a complete stranger
that you know they're gonna die?

356
00:25:30,392 --> 00:25:31,893
Where is he now?

357
00:25:33,186 --> 00:25:35,689
The Hotel Neptune.

358
00:25:35,897 --> 00:25:40,068
- And what were you doing there?
- I knew you were gonna ask that.

359
00:25:40,276 --> 00:25:43,029
I wanted to get you
a really great birthday present

360
00:25:43,196 --> 00:25:45,657
to make up for all those cards.

361
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:50,245
So I got a job at the hotel
as their lounge psychic.

362
00:25:50,453 --> 00:25:52,956
Go ahead, yell at me.

363
00:25:53,164 --> 00:25:56,042
Phoebe, you have to save him.
You can't let him out of your sight.

364
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:58,294
Don't worry,
I waited until he went to sleep,

365
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:00,838
and then I broke a key off
in his door to lock him in.

366
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:03,174
He's safe till morning.

367
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:08,263
Hey, wait. That's it?

368
00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:09,764
You're not gonna get mad at me?

369
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:13,267
You were trying to do
something good.

370
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:17,647
And now you're gonna get to do
something wonderful.

371
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:20,483
I couldn't ask for a better
birthday present than that.

372
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,615
- You guys have to see this.
- They found my body.

373
00:26:27,824 --> 00:26:30,701
<i>Although police reported that the body
was burned beyond recognition...</i>

374
00:26:30,868 --> 00:26:31,911
It's finally over.

375
00:26:32,078 --> 00:26:34,997
<i>... personal effects found at the scene
preliminarily identify him</i>

376
00:26:35,164 --> 00:26:38,501
<i>as Tony Wong,
head of the Chinatown Triads.</i>

377
00:26:38,668 --> 00:26:40,461
That can't be.
That's the guy who killed me.

378
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,339
<i>Police sources say Wong,
who was a suspect in...</i>

379
00:26:51,263 --> 00:26:55,434
Wait, I see him.
Wong. He's still alive.

380
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:57,687
Of course he's still alive.
That's me they found.

381
00:26:57,895 --> 00:26:59,814
Can you see where he is now?

382
00:27:07,113 --> 00:27:10,032
I see a sign. Quick, give me a pen.

383
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:12,117
I don't understand why Wong
would wanna kill me.

384
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:15,287
- I never did anything to him.
- Yeah, but you look a lot like him.

385
00:27:15,454 --> 00:27:17,206
Maybe he used you
to fake his own death.

386
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,085
What does that mean?

387
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:24,546
Wu Han lmports.
It's a warehouse over in Chinatown.

388
00:27:36,475 --> 00:27:39,520
I don't know about this, Piper.
I think it's too dangerous.

389
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:41,688
It's your only chance.

390
00:27:41,855 --> 00:27:44,358
Piper, listen to me.
You don't wanna go up there.

391
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:47,027
Those men pulled the trigger on me
without even thinking.

392
00:27:47,194 --> 00:27:49,905
- They'll kill you.
- I can freeze things, remember?

393
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:52,449
- But there are three thugs in there.
- Keep talking.

394
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:54,076
- With guns.
- Even better.

395
00:27:54,284 --> 00:27:58,705
Wait, wait, wait. He's got an amulet
on the door. I can't go in.

396
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:03,043
Never mind.

397
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,128
- Aren't you scared?
- Terrified.

398
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:07,923
Trust me, that's a good thing.

399
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,887
Okay. We gotta hurry.

400
00:28:18,475 --> 00:28:19,684
Say, "cheese."

401
00:28:23,438 --> 00:28:25,023
Run!

402
00:28:25,732 --> 00:28:27,943
- Come on.
- Let's get her.

403
00:28:36,785 --> 00:28:38,244
Move, move!

404
00:29:08,358 --> 00:29:09,734
Okay, all set.

405
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:12,612
I snuck the photograph
into Andy's interoffice mail.

406
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:16,741
My afterlife's in the hands
of a cop named Andy.

407
00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:18,993
He's an inspector
and he's very good, Mark.

408
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,539
After he sees Wong is alive,
he'll know exactly what to do.

409
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:26,125
Busts Wong maybe,
but that doesn't help me.

410
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:28,628
They won't have any way
of identifying the body as mine.

411
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:30,630
I put your name in with the picture.

412
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:33,341
Andy will get dental records
or something and match it up.

413
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:37,386
All we have to do is keep
Yama away from you until then.

414
00:29:37,595 --> 00:29:40,723
- I don't know what to say.
- Don't say anything.

415
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:42,433
I made you a promise, didn't I?

416
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:52,318
As much as I like you,
I have no intention of joining you.

417
00:29:52,485 --> 00:29:54,403
Talking to yourself, huh?

418
00:29:56,822 --> 00:29:58,407
Andy. Hi.

419
00:29:58,616 --> 00:30:02,370
Yeah, it's an old habit,
I do it all the time.

420
00:30:02,536 --> 00:30:04,789
My mom used to call it
"interesting conversations

421
00:30:04,997 --> 00:30:07,750
- with an interesting person."
- Yeah? Interesting.

422
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:09,126
Very.

423
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:11,462
Not that it's not a pleasure,
but what are you doing?

424
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:15,132
Oh, nothing, you know.
Just passing by.

425
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:18,260
- Prue tell you what's going on?
- No.

426
00:30:18,427 --> 00:30:22,723
Well, yeah, I mean, sort of.
Kind of screwed up, huh?

427
00:30:22,932 --> 00:30:24,725
- Any idea what I should do?
- That Andy.

428
00:30:24,934 --> 00:30:26,894
Yeah.

429
00:30:28,103 --> 00:30:29,271
I mean, yeah.

430
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:33,609
Just give her some space,
let her work it through.

431
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:35,444
Yeah, okay.

432
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,200
Thanks.

433
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:43,911
- Take care.
- You too.

434
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:47,706
What?

435
00:30:47,873 --> 00:30:50,709
You're a really sweet person,
you know that?

436
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:53,587
No, I mean that.
I wanna take you somewhere.

437
00:30:53,754 --> 00:30:55,506
There's something
I wanna do for you.

438
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:11,188
- Oh, Mr Correy...
- Stay away.

439
00:31:11,355 --> 00:31:12,898
Please, you have got
to believe me.

440
00:31:13,065 --> 00:31:14,566
You locked me in my room,
didn't you?

441
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:16,068
Just for your own protection.

442
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:18,987
What do you want? Money?
Is that what this is, a shakedown?

443
00:31:19,154 --> 00:31:22,991
No, I'm trying to save your life,
for God's sakes. Listen to me.

444
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,118
You're crazy.

445
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,541
If you walk out that door,
you're a dead man!

446
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,544
- Call security.
- Mr Correy, don't do it!

447
00:31:38,173 --> 00:31:39,466
Watch out!

448
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,477
Nick!

449
00:31:50,685 --> 00:31:54,814
That'll be 20 dollars, tip not included.

450
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:12,081
This is your place?

451
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,293
- It's beautiful.
- Thanks.

452
00:32:16,794 --> 00:32:19,714
Camus. I'm impressed.

453
00:32:20,173 --> 00:32:21,966
Wish I had a chance to finish it.

454
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:24,636
Of course, I can say that
about almost everything, I guess.

455
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:26,971
"A loveless world is a dead world,

456
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:31,184
and always there comes an hour
when one is weary of prisons,

457
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:33,936
and all one craves for
is a warm face,

458
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:36,606
the warmth and wonder
of a loving heart."

459
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:40,151
- I like that part.
- Me too.

460
00:32:41,152 --> 00:32:43,863
Listen, if your cop friend
comes through,

461
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:48,117
maybe I'll get a chance to ask
Camus himself how it turns out.

462
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:51,996
I want you to reach for something.

463
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,463
Go ahead, open it.

464
00:33:05,843 --> 00:33:09,055
- What are they?
- My grandfather's recipes.

465
00:33:09,764 --> 00:33:12,099
My dad translated them
when I was born.

466
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:16,270
They've been serving these
in my family's restaurant for decades.

467
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:17,813
They're yours.

468
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:21,108
But they belong in your family.

469
00:33:21,317 --> 00:33:24,987
I want you to have them.
For everything you've done for me.

470
00:33:26,363 --> 00:33:29,074
I just ask one favour.

471
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,036
Use them for your sister's
surprise birthday party.

472
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:36,498
- Prue doesn't want a party.
- Birthdays are important.

473
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:38,542
I know.

474
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:40,878
I walked out of my last one...

475
00:33:41,378 --> 00:33:43,964
...and it never occurred to me
that I wouldn't get another.

476
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:50,179
She may not know it, but she needs
to celebrate her birthday.

477
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:52,431
You all do.

478
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:55,392
Don't take it for granted.

479
00:34:04,151 --> 00:34:07,279
Prue? What are you doing?

480
00:34:08,196 --> 00:34:11,450
- Just flicking through channels.
- You don't flick. You never flick.

481
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:14,244
Well, I flick now.

482
00:34:14,828 --> 00:34:20,125
- Are you okay? You look...
- Awful? I know. But I feel fine.

483
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:23,795
- Did you warn that guy?
- I did better than that.

484
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,630
I saved that guy.

485
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,299
And it was great too.

486
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:30,177
I mean, I knew doing it
would be good for him,

487
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:34,639
but I had no idea what a rush it
would be for me. I felt so good.

488
00:34:34,848 --> 00:34:38,351
And not just about myself,
but about everything.

489
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,148
That even in my own little way,
I can make a difference.

490
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,483
Can you believe it's me saying this?

491
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:50,322
What can I say?
It's been a week full of surprises.

492
00:34:52,198 --> 00:34:55,118
Yeah, speaking of surprises,
what are you gonna do about Andy?

493
00:34:55,285 --> 00:34:56,411
I don't know.

494
00:34:56,911 --> 00:34:59,205
Andy kept something from me,

495
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:01,875
but the truth is
I keep something from him every day.

496
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:07,589
And it's not like I'll ever be able to tell
him our secret, so, what's the point?

497
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:11,342
We're the charmed ones, Prue,
not the doomed ones.

498
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,511
We have lives like everyone else.

499
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,183
Call him. Go see him.
Do something.

500
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,936
Give to get. That is the secret of life.

501
00:35:22,562 --> 00:35:25,106
Not our powers.

502
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:40,621
- You okay?
- Yeah.

503
00:35:40,788 --> 00:35:43,916
I was just thinking,
walking under the stars,

504
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,626
what's really up there?

505
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,754
- What's waiting for me?
- I don't know.

506
00:35:48,963 --> 00:35:51,382
Maybe you can give me a hint
when you get there.

507
00:35:51,591 --> 00:35:54,302
I don't want this night to ever end.

508
00:35:56,095 --> 00:35:58,431
I'm not ready to say goodbye, Piper.

509
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:06,647
Close your eyes.

510
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:13,571
Pretend you can feel my hand
on your skin.

511
00:36:14,113 --> 00:36:16,407
That my touch gives you comfort.

512
00:36:18,784 --> 00:36:20,244
No.

513
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:22,746
Just close your eyes.

514
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:41,473
Where were you my whole life?

515
00:36:43,684 --> 00:36:45,978
No. Piper!

516
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:51,275
No! Somebody help! Help!

517
00:36:53,736 --> 00:36:55,612
- What's wrong? What happened?
- They took her.

518
00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:58,198
- Wong's men took Piper.
- Do you know where they took her?

519
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:03,162
- I'm calling 911.
- No, do it from the car. Let's go.

520
00:37:03,328 --> 00:37:06,915
- We've got to find her.
- Even if it takes all night.

521
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:17,467
First time I saw you,
I thought you were a ghost.

522
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:24,558
You know, these ropes are really tight.
If you could just untie my hands.

523
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:28,770
- Why did you kill Mark?
- I needed his identity.

524
00:37:29,646 --> 00:37:31,857
Who else knows I'm alive?

525
00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:38,572
I had plans.

526
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,074
I had a boat ready
to take me to Hong Kong.

527
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:45,620
I had a whole new life,
but you screwed it all up.

528
00:37:52,752 --> 00:37:54,629
Thanks.

529
00:38:11,938 --> 00:38:14,190
Quick, they have her upstairs.
Look out!

530
00:38:18,403 --> 00:38:21,030
I'll take her. You shoot anyone
who comes through that door.

531
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:31,082
Look out!

532
00:38:37,755 --> 00:38:39,674
Thanks, sis.

533
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:44,220
- Right back at you, sis.
- How long's this last again?

534
00:38:44,429 --> 00:38:45,596
Not very.

535
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:52,562
Who are you people?

536
00:39:05,283 --> 00:39:07,201
Police! Freeze!

537
00:39:19,964 --> 00:39:21,757
I've never seen
anybody killed before.

538
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:23,551
- Jeremy.
- Javna.

539
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:25,302
I mean humans.

540
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:28,597
Come on, we need to get out of here
before Andy sees us.

541
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,588
Wong.

542
00:40:03,924 --> 00:40:05,968
But you're dead.

543
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:07,886
Yeah, so are you.

544
00:40:10,764 --> 00:40:12,975
Mark, I think you should
get out of here.

545
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:22,067
Make a wish, you bastard.

546
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:25,529
No!

547
00:40:36,957 --> 00:40:38,875
No! You can't take him.

548
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:41,294
He's a good man.
He doesn't belong with you.

549
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,691
Let us remember,
though we gather in sorrow,

550
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:07,737
we are here to celebrate
the joy of Mark's life.

551
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:13,493
And the redemption
of his spiritual journey.

552
00:41:25,255 --> 00:41:27,924
All those stories.

553
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:31,886
All those legends you taught me.
They saved my soul, Mom.

554
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,889
You were right.

555
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:45,692
Take it from me, Prue.

556
00:41:46,234 --> 00:41:49,821
Don't miss your birthday,
not any of them.

557
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:51,447
They're precious.

558
00:41:51,906 --> 00:41:53,491
I won't.

559
00:41:59,205 --> 00:42:01,374
I wish...

560
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:05,378
I know. Me too.

561
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:21,143
I'm gonna miss you, Piper.

562
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:29,568
Who's that man?

563
00:42:35,116 --> 00:42:37,159
That's my dad.

564
00:42:38,577 --> 00:42:41,288
I guess this really is goodbye.

565
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:13,862
Leave it to me to fall for a dead guy.

566
00:43:14,696 --> 00:43:16,365
It's an improvement.

567
00:43:16,532 --> 00:43:19,535
- At least he wasn't a warlock.
- Yeah.

568
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:26,583
You know what?
I've changed my mind.

569
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,086
Maybe we should
have a party, after all.

570
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:30,587
Are you serious?

571
00:43:30,754 --> 00:43:33,757
Yeah, why not?
I mean, Mark is right.

572
00:43:33,924 --> 00:43:37,761
Well, Prue,
I'm glad you said that, because...

573
00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:39,763
Surprise!

574
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:47,062
- Did I get you? I got you.
- Yeah, you got me.

575
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,482
And an actual present too.
And it's paid for.

576
00:43:50,649 --> 00:43:53,151
- I hope you like it.
- I'm speechless.

577
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:56,029
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.
