1
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,350
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.

2
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,913
It's all right.

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,718
I'm just glad you're still here.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,273
You didn't think I would be?

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,996
Well, you're a woman
of mystery, Paige.

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,273
The Celtic Wheel of Being.

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,276
Four elements, all balanced,
all connected to each other.

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,193
How did you know that?
Nobody knows that.

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,919
I just...

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,229
...read a lot about different things,
sometimes magic things.

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,358
Do you ever read
about magic things?

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,516
No, I just got it because
I thought it would look cool.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,515
I'm joking. I'm kidding.

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,157
Come on. Let the voice mail get it.

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,279
Oh, it's my sister. Hello?

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,557
I found a way to vanquish
the leader of the Creepers.

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,598
Okay, not a good time.

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,432
Sorry, but the potion's
already been made.

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,953
<i>Strike while the iron's hot.</i>

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,275
No can do.

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,113
Look, we take him out,
we take out his entire clan,

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,952
<i>which means there's
no demons left out there</i>

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,634
- to threaten the Wiccanning.
- Timing bad.

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,836
What part of that
don't you understand?

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,228
Okay, fine.

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,318
If you don't want your nephew
to be blessed by his ancestors

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,994
and you don't mind him
falling prey to evil...

28
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,755
- All right, all right.
- Is there a problem?

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,354
Always.

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,556
- What, are you leaving?
- No, I'm just going to the bathroom.

31
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,679
I'll be right back. Promise.

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,958
- All right, let's get it over with.
- Oh. Sorry.

33
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,593
Yeah, me too. What do you got?

34
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,358
You summon, I will vanquish.

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,078
<i>Demons who dwell
In slivers oF night</i>

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,232
<i>Uncloak your shadows
To witches' sight</i>

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,033
Creepers, check.

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,589
- We done here?
- Yes. Sleaze away.

39
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,479
- Yeah, well, at least I get some.
- Yeah, yeah.

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,319
Paige?

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,510
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,195
You didn't hear me?

43
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,549
You don't have to hide in here.
I know what you're doing.

44
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,472
- You do?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,239
You smoke.

46
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,597
Okay, so we have Wood Mist,

47
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,830
which is kind of natural and earthy,

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,434
or Rouge Sensation,
which definitely has that...

49
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,235
More of that, you know,
"va-va-va-voom" feel.

50
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,713
You're a guy. What do you think
Jason will like more, huh?

51
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,077
We got this one or this one.

52
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,396
Okay, Rouge Sensation it is.
Very good.

53
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,994
You are so cute. Yes, you are.

54
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,038
Your grandmother is just gonna
eat you up when she meets you.

55
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,593
But no spitting up

56
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,435
and none of that toxic poop
that you like to do,

57
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,632
because she hasn't been around
babies since she was alive, okay?

58
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,919
Piper is gonna freak if Wyatt's not
down in his Sunday best in, like, five.

59
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,992
- Hi.
- I know, I got a little sidetracked.

60
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,630
Hey, what's with
the come-hither makeup?

61
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,669
Jason called from his corporate jet,
and I'm gonna meet him at the airport.

62
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,872
- Oh, he's back from Hong Kong.
- Yeah, just for the day.

63
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,150
International booty call.
Most impressive.

64
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,072
Hey, there's a minor
in the room, Paige.

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,912
Sorry. But you know
what will be good?

66
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,953
Piper and I don't have to see you
moping around the house anymore.

67
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,235
I was not mopey.

68
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,599
You are too mopey.

69
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,478
Okay, that's just because
I missed him,

70
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,478
and I didn't expect to miss him
as much as I did.

71
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,631
<i>I'm just curious. Has anyone ever
tried the truth spell that's in the Book?</i>

72
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,273
Yes, and don't.

73
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,759
- Don't what?
- Don't try it, especially not on Nate.

74
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,752
I wasn't going to.

75
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,515
Be good.

76
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,477
Okay, fine, so maybe I was.

77
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,070
But how else am I supposed to find out
if he can handle the big, dark secret?

78
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,556
Don't you think it's a little early in
the relationship to start thinking that?

79
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,918
No, I don't think so. He's the first guy
I've really liked since Glen

80
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,913
and I actually think he might be able
to handle my being a witch.

81
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,718
Really? How do you know?

82
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,913
I know this sounds insane,
but he's got this kind of cool, mystical

83
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,117
Celtic tattoo, and he actually knows
what it means.

84
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,750
<i>You could be on the cover of GQ,
you're so handsome.</i>

85
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,559
I don't think it would really hurt
anything if I did the spell,

86
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,393
because, you know,
it does wear off after 24 hours,

87
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,358
and he'd forget everything anyway.
What's the harm?

88
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,115
It could hurt a lot. You never know
what you'll get when you cast that.

89
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,719
I know what I'll get if I don't.

90
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,309
I'm gonna have to dump him.
It's not gonna work otherwise.

91
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,717
- Come on, hurry up!
- Okay, we're coming!

92
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,072
So you think the green outfit is cute?

93
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,073
Because I can have them put him
in the one with the clouds on it.

94
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,391
It's her great-grandson. I don't think
she's gonna care what he's wearing.

95
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,119
She's not coming
as a great-grandmother.

96
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,551
She's coming in an official capacity
as the matriarch of our family.

97
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,995
Well, she's not gonna come at all
unless we summon her.

98
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,875
Okay.

99
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,356
<i>Hear these words, hear my cry
Spirit From the other side</i>

100
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,671
<i>Come to me, I summon thee
Cross now the great divide</i>

101
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,710
Well, it's about time, Piper.
What took you so long?

102
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,791
Hello to you too, Grams.

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,198
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just so excited.

104
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,519
- How are you, my dear?
- Excited too.

105
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,757
- Hi, Grams.
- Leo.

106
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,512
So where's the little one?

107
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,116
Right behind you.

108
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,795
Grams, meet the next generation
of Halliwells.

109
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,429
- Baby Wyatt.
- Wyatt?

110
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,795
That's a silly name for a girl, isn't it?

111
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,470
Grams, it's a boy.

112
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,318
- Look at the outfit.
- What?

113
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,794
You didn't know?

114
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,872
Well, no. I mean,
I just assumed it was a...

115
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,512
- What went wrong?
- Wrong?

116
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,357
Well, I don't mean "wrong" wrong,
it's just that we've always had girls.

117
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,558
Well, now we have a boy.

118
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,597
Right, well...

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,037
Okay, well, we've got a lot of work to
do before I perform the Wiccanning.

120
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,031
- Work? What work?
- Are you kidding?

121
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,437
I'm gonna be calling every matriarch
in our family since the witch trials.

122
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,192
We've got to make sure
the manor is safe.

123
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,191
Oh, we've got that covered.

124
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,920
Every demon that could attack
their spirits has been taken out.

125
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,197
- The zombies, the rigors...
- Creepers.

126
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,670
- We're all set.
- What about the Necromancer?

127
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,677
- Who?
- Okay, you guys discuss this,

128
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,798
I have to pop by the airport
and pick up my friend Jason.

129
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,554
- Who's Jason?
- A guy, Grams.

130
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,280
Don't start the Wiccanning without me.
Be right back.

131
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,950
Actually, I have to check
on my man too.

132
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,870
You know, they'd be better off
with a dog.

133
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,632
More loyal and they die sooner.

134
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,669
- Excuse me?
- Oh, don't mind me.

135
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,472
I never had very
much luck with men.

136
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,188
You've been married four times.

137
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,793
Exactly.

138
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,270
So can we get back
to this Necromancer?

139
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,515
Yes, we should, and fast.

140
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,069
The last time he attacked
was during your mother's Wiccanning,

141
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,074
and we can't take any chance on that
happening again. So chop, chop.

142
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,718
Now you know why we don't
summon her more often.

143
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,995
Yeah.

144
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,958
You've got to be kidding.

145
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,599
Don't judge it by its size, sir.

146
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,513
She's not just any fairy,
she's a queen.

147
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,910
I don't know.
Hardly seems worth the trouble.

148
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,150
You forgot to put holes in the lid.

149
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,831
No, actually, I didn't.

150
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,559
Go for it, sir.

151
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,956
Well, that won't sustain me for long.

152
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,789
Okay, well, what,
maybe I should get you an ogre?

153
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,155
Or maybe I should just devour you.

154
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,157
But, sir, you need me, remember?

155
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,312
A century ago I didn't need anyone.

156
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,033
I was a powerful demon.

157
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,349
A ruler.

158
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,788
Alive!

159
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,477
I grow weary of it all.

160
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,792
Scrounging around for magical spirits
just to get a taste of life.

161
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,913
Actually, I do all the scrounging.

162
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,230
I wanna live again,
do you understand?

163
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,753
I wanna be resurrected.

164
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,398
I will be resurrected.

165
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,877
I am so glad you're home.

166
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,755
Well, if leaving means more reunions
like this, I'll go away more often.

167
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,275
No, don't go away ever.

168
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,793
I'm afraid I have to.

169
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,315
What do you mean, baby?

170
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,552
We just bought an Asian media
conglomerate, I gotta go to set it up.

171
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,269
Well, for how long?

172
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,876
Six months, maybe longer.

173
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,989
I got you something.

174
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,829
Open it.

175
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,991
It's a dictionary.

176
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,674
Chinese-American.

177
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,477
- Thank you.
- You don't like it?

178
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,238
No, I do.

179
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,756
It's just... I found out that I'm not
gonna see you for the next six months,

180
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,434
I was kind of hoping
for jewellery or something.

181
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,799
Well, jewellery won't help you
get around Hong Kong.

182
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,154
The dictionary will.

183
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,276
What?

184
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,154
Come back with me, Phoebe.

185
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,914
That's why I flew out,
to see if you'd fly back with me.

186
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,548
It leaves tomorrow morning.

187
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,431
Are you serious?

188
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,151
I can't just pick up and leave and move
to Hong Kong for the next six months.

189
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,875
- Why not?
- Well, for starters, I have a job.

190
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,190
Well, I'm your boss, I'll transfer you.

191
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,076
Okay, and how about my family?

192
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,549
My sisters
and my new little nephew?

193
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,434
You can use the jet
whenever you want.

194
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,158
It'll be at your disposal.

195
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,354
I missed you, Phoebe.

196
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,758
- I missed you too.
- Well, I don't wanna miss you again.

197
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,674
Come back with me.

198
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,516
Yeah, what's this gonna cost?

199
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,355
For a new thermostat?
Come on, you can do better than that.

200
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,590
All right.

201
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,191
Hey, let me call you back, all right?
All right.

202
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,634
- Hey.
- Hi.

203
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,519
Nice to see you.
What are you doing way out here?

204
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,195
I just... I kind of wanted
to talk to you.

205
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,557
- Do you have a minute?
- Yes, we don't open for another hour.

206
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,557
You wanna have a seat,
you want a drink?

207
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,637
No. It's okay.

208
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,872
What's the matter? You all right?

209
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,991
Maybe nothing, but there's
only one way to find out.

210
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,878
<i>For those who want
The truth revealed</i>

211
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,473
<i>Open hearts and secrets unsealed</i>

212
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,993
<i>From now until it's now again</i>

213
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,596
<i>After which the memory ends</i>

214
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,989
Did you see that?

215
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,437
Okay, here goes nothing.

216
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,993
Nate...

217
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,308
...I'm a witch. A real witch,

218
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,677
with real magical powers,

219
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,798
and I just kind of wanted to see
if maybe you'd be open to that.

220
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,239
What are you talking about?

221
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,838
I'm talking about this.

222
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,031
Behind you.

223
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,910
- How did you do that?
- I told you, I'm a witch.

224
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,233
I just kind of wanted to see
how you'd feel about it

225
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,073
before I went any further
into the relationship.

226
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,433
I can see that you don't feel
so very good about it.

227
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,155
Let me just get my head around this.
You don't see stuff like this every day.

228
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,949
Maybe you would be okay with it?

229
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,272
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

230
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,711
I mean, but I always sort of thought
this stuff was real, you know,

231
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,713
I just didn't really know
it was really real, you know?

232
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,313
My God, my wife is gonna love this.

233
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,995
- Excuse me?
- Did I just say "wife"?

234
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,715
You're married?
You never told me you were married.

235
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,713
Yeah, and I didn't tell you
I had children either, but...

236
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,632
Did I just say kids too?

237
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,149
See, I was right. You vanquished
this demon 60 years ago.

238
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,072
The Necromancer is not a demon,

239
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,550
he's the ghost of a demon.
And it wasn't a vanquish,

240
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,517
I banished him back
into the spirit realm.

241
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,038
Well, then you should be
a little more specific in your wording.

242
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,593
The point is, he's had about 70 years
to find a way out of the spirit realm.

243
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,557
And that man, that...

244
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,472
That demon is nothing
if not confident.

245
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,039
I guess I'll take your word for it,

246
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,317
considering you seem to know
so much about him.

247
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,596
"Enjoys Clark Gable movies"?

248
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,594
"Favourite dinner,
lamb chops with mint jelly."

249
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,035
Well, I mean, you never know
what will be useful.

250
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,591
So, what do you suggest, that I go to
the video store and you get cooking?

251
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,034
Don't be so literal.

252
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,158
I was just trying to show
how much he craves life,

253
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,756
the sensuousness of it.
Food, drink, sex...

254
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,315
Don't! I don't wanna hear
about a dead demon doing the dirty.

255
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,197
He wants to be resurrected.

256
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,795
It says that he has dominion
over the dead.

257
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,558
You would think
that would be enough.

258
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,518
Not for him it isn't.
He only uses his power over the dead

259
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,717
to absorb their spirit
and get a temporary fix of life.

260
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,474
But he was always searching
for magical spirits

261
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,349
with enough power
to resurrect himself for good.

262
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,030
Like all the spirits
of the Halliwell matriarchs.

263
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,191
That's why he attacked
at your mother's Wiccanning.

264
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,191
Now you see why I'm so worried.

265
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,432
Okay, so if he's out, we'll send him
packing back to the spirit realm,

266
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,955
because nothing is gonna get
in the way of Wyatt's Wiccanning.

267
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,396
Good. And I know just the potion
to use on him too.

268
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,909
Let's see,
we'll need some dragonroot,

269
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,591
eelskin, blood wort...

270
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,190
You know, Piper,
I'm still surprised that you had a boy.

271
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,278
- Well, fifty-fifty chance.
- Not in our family.

272
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,715
Three hundred years
and not a male in the bunch.

273
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,590
I guess our family's changing.

274
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,190
Well, I mean, it just begs
a few questions, don't you think?

275
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,717
I mean, we've never had a male witch.
And, you know, men are just so...

276
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,190
They're just evil,
that's what they are.

277
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,237
They are just plain evil.

278
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,757
Oh, I take it Nate wasn't too happy
about you being a witch.

279
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,629
Nate was fine with it. It's maybe
his wife that would've had a problem.

280
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,113
- He's married?
- Yeah, with two kids.

281
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,840
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

282
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,996
I told you she should've
gotten a dog.

283
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,153
What did you do
when you found out?

284
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:23,395
Plenty. I mean, I'm sure plenty will
happen to him, karmically speaking.

285
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,551
The cheat.

286
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,233
Well...

287
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,680
...there's no wrath like a witch scorned,
I always say.

288
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,109
Care to take it out on him?

289
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,236
What measly crumbs
have you brought me this time?

290
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,914
Nothing you're gonna like.

291
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,631
- Penny!
- Penny?

292
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,148
What are you waiting for?
Throw the damn potion.

293
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,751
What?

294
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,550
Wait, so he called her by her name?

295
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,398
Penny. Yeah. Kind of weird, huh?

296
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,312
Yeah, and he acted like he liked her.

297
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,238
- That's Chinese for "excuse me."
- Fascinating.

298
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,359
- Did you guys vanquish him?
- He's dead, he can't be vanquished.

299
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,155
But we did send his sorry male ass
back to the spirit realm.

300
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,433
Okay, let's not jump on Grams'
male-bashing bandwagon, please.

301
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,318
Grams is a wise woman.

302
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,799
I'll be sure to let Wyatt know.

303
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,793
Don't worry, we're not gonna let him
grow up to be a slime bag.

304
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,873
Great, so let's focus on blessing him
in light and goodness.

305
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,913
Okay, we don't got a lot of time.
Now, white or patent leather?

306
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,035
That's "white."

307
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,158
Okay, what is with
the Chinese thing?

308
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,788
It's a little souvenir that Jason
brought me back from China

309
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,552
when he was there
on his business trip.

310
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,550
Business trip. Yeah, business trip.

311
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,274
A likely story.

312
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,715
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'm just saying.

313
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,711
He could be leading a double life.

314
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,634
He could be married, he could have
a mistress, he could be gay.

315
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,035
You don't know.
There are many variables.

316
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,312
- Or he could just be perfect for me.
- Don't be so sure.

317
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,948
Men are full of surprises, that's all.

318
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,756
Funny you should mention surprises,
because he had a little surprise for me.

319
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,478
Paige?

320
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,632
Darryl's on the phone. He's pissed.
Something about your boyfriend?

321
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,949
He's not my boyfriend,
he's my ex-boyfriend.

322
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,911
What are you doing with Wyatt?
Grams was gonna spend time with him.

323
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,192
- Well, she didn't want to.
- What? That's ridiculous.

324
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,916
Really? Then why didn't she want to
touch him, change him or feed him?

325
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,152
Well, she's probably just resting
before the ceremony.

326
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,880
She said she would do it as soon
as we get rid of the Necromancer.

327
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,474
This has nothing to do with
the Necromancer, and you know it.

328
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,673
Grams doesn't like that Wyatt's a boy,
and she makes no bones about it.

329
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,475
- Am I really back?
- Yes.

330
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,911
And I summoned you
in record time too.

331
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,276
Bet Penny didn't count on that.

332
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,035
She can't fool me.
She's a spirit too. I can tell.

333
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,236
- Who's Penny?
- Penny Halliwell.

334
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,153
The witch who stole my heart.

335
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,914
You should have seen her.
The glint in her eye.

336
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,868
The way she held up her hand
and sent me hurtling into that wall.

337
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,510
Didn't hurt as much
as the potion did, though.

338
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:05,708
I could tell she made it herself.
The flames were excruciating.

339
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,678
She was furious with me.
Which can only mean one thing.

340
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,034
She still feels the passion, the heat.

341
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,389
You sure that wasn't the fire?

342
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,551
If only I knew why
she came back here.

343
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,031
Why leave a cosy eternity up there?

344
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,878
It could have to do
with the new baby.

345
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,911
Baby? What baby?

346
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,038
It's the talk of the underworld.
One of the Charmed Ones had a kid.

347
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,556
It's a powerful one too,
one we're not to mess with.

348
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,871
That's it!
She's here for the Wiccanning.

349
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,548
I'll need you to get me a troll.
No, better yet, an elf.

350
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,034
I'm gonna need all my energy
if I'm gonna take on Penny Halliwell.

351
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,593
- Grams?
- Oh, Piper, you scared me.

352
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,870
I didn't know you could
scare a ghost.

353
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,429
- We need to talk.
- About?

354
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,834
I think you know what about.

355
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,552
Leo seems to think you don't wanna
be around Wyatt for some reason,

356
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,870
and I'm beginning to wonder myself.

357
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,517
This is all my fault.

358
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,717
I mean, maybe if I'd lived longer,
had been around longer,

359
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,555
maybe things would've worked out
the way they were supposed to.

360
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,353
What are you talking about?

361
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,359
This. Wyatt.

362
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,396
Oh, you mean because
he's not a girl?

363
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,398
Piper, you know as well as I do

364
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,672
that the Charmed line
is supposed to be led by women,

365
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,512
- not men.
- Who says?

366
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,274
Tradition says. Destiny says.

367
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,593
Tell me that you didn't hope
to have a little girl,

368
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,519
expect to have a little girl,
just like you foresaw.

369
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,114
Well, of course, but so what?

370
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,272
"So what" is something went wrong,
terribly wrong.

371
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,795
This is not the baby
you were meant to have.

372
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,989
Grams.

373
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,513
You saw it when you went
to the future.

374
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,559
The future where Prue was still alive
and witches were burned at the stake.

375
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,790
- Things change.
- Not this.

376
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,149
It's just that I'm worried
about the family, you know.

377
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,998
We don't know what to expect.

378
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,109
I know. That's why we shouldn't treat
him any differently because he's a boy.

379
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,316
That's why we're going
to do the ceremony.

380
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,989
At the very least, he deserves that.

381
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,999
I'm sorry, Piper.

382
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,599
I can't.

383
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,838
Come on, this is outrageous.

384
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,558
I'll sue you for false imprisonment.

385
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,154
When I get out, I'm gonna tell
everybody about you, you witch.

386
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,989
For your information, spells can do
more than just make you tell the truth.

387
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,639
Something you might
wanna think about.

388
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,511
Are you out of your mind? You can't
orb in here and think that's gonna fly.

389
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,193
- Because it's not.
- Why not?

390
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,073
- Do you know what he did?
- I don't care what he did.

391
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,514
Get him out of here, now.

392
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,034
Listen to the doughnut hog.

393
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,752
What?

394
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,915
Men.

395
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,119
Do you know how much trouble I'm in?
The man's got constitutional rights.

396
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,356
Oh, constitution,
shmonstitution, Darryl.

397
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,670
Look, he's a jerk, fine.

398
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,673
But cheating is immoral,
it's not illegal.

399
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,473
All right, I understand that.

400
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,232
And I can't deny
that I'm taking some sort

401
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,152
of personal pleasure from this,
because I am.

402
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,596
But that's not the main thing
that's happening here.

403
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,999
I cast a truth spell.

404
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,068
- Oh, no.
- It's just a little one.

405
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,357
But it's a good thing I did. Otherwise
I wouldn't know what a jerk he is.

406
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,432
- This is so not my problem.
- Actually, it is.

407
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,398
Because if he goes out, he's gonna
be telling people that I'm a witch,

408
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,269
and also about my special friend,
the cop who helps the witch.

409
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,472
What am I supposed to do,
keep him in here indefinitely?

410
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,155
No, not indefinitely.
Just, like, the next 20 hours or so.

411
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,993
What am I supposed to tell
the other cops if they hear him?

412
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,270
Just tell them he's insane.

413
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,790
You are crazy.
This isn't about him or our legacy.

414
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,554
- This is about you.
- Piper, you don't understand.

415
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,109
That you don't want to perform
a blessing on my son?

416
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,236
You are damn right
I do not understand.

417
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,110
You see him as an innocent little boy.
But he won't be like that, not for long.

418
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,430
So you can't even hold him
because someday,

419
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,398
some very far-away day,
he will become a man?

420
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,755
Men cannot be trusted with magic.

421
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,552
They can't handle it. They're weak.

422
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,435
- And evil will eventually win out.
- That is silly. Look at Leo!

423
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,433
Oh, well, Leo. I mean, he's an angel.
You can't count Leo.

424
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,273
Hey, what's going on here?

425
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,159
Your grandmother hates her grandson,
that's what's going on.

426
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,435
That is not true.

427
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,108
Oh, I'm sorry, you just hate men,
is that correct?

428
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,352
No, I don't trust men.
There's a difference.

429
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,114
And there is a reason that
they don't last long in this family.

430
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,555
They're always trying to
take advantage of what we have.

431
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,278
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

432
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,313
Look what Cole put you through. Look
what your father did to your mother.

433
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,399
We're supposed to give up on trying to
find love because we might get hurt?

434
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,709
Oh, no, you will get hurt.

435
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,077
- That's our legacy too, unfortunately.
- You know what, forget it.

436
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,436
You couldn't bless my son
with any kind of goodness

437
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,160
because you are too consumed
by your bitterness.

438
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,034
- Piper.
- And since his father is an angel,

439
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,350
we will take our chances
without a Wiccanning!

440
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,670
Leave them alone.

441
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,273
- Surprise.
- Piper!

442
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,989
Well, let's face it.
Grams would not be in this position

443
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,720
if she hadn't sent us after the guy
in the first place.

444
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,235
Not helpful. We have to
summon her back here, fast.

445
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,318
We can't. The Necromancer will follow,
and you don't have a way to stop him.

446
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,399
How did he get a clean shot at her?
Weren't you guys with her?

447
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,157
- We were fighting with her.
- Fighting? About what?

448
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,551
Later. Let's just focus
on the vanquishing and the saving.

449
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,278
Yeah, but I don't know how to.

450
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,829
It's not like we could even
vanquish him, he's a ghost.

451
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,794
Well, ghosts can still feel pain. Maybe I
could just orb his testicles somewhere.

452
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,635
Paige, there will be no talk of
testicle-orbing in front of the child.

453
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,030
And not around his daddy either.

454
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,156
Oh, criminy, I'm just trying to help.

455
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,399
Okay, there's got to be a weakness
in here somewhere.

456
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,312
I mean, he must have
a weakness, right?

457
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,318
Well, do mint jelly
and Clark Gable movies count?

458
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,837
She wrote it.

459
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,394
Oh, my God.

460
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,039
That's why she's so obsessed
with him.

461
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,838
Grams was
the Necromancer's lover.

462
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,749
- That's disgusting.
- Oh, no, I think you're right.

463
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,433
That would explain everything.

464
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,197
Grams was alive when she banished
the Necromancer, right?

465
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,197
- Right.
- Okay, so now she's dead.

466
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,073
- You sound so happy about that.
- No, that's not what she means.

467
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,832
The ghost-vanquishing spell.

468
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,036
- You gotta be dead to use it, right?
- It's worth a shot.

469
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,036
Your spirit is strong, Penny.

470
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,435
Almost strong enough
to sustain us both.

471
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,917
Almost.

472
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,758
Awaken.

473
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,554
No need to worry, Penny.
You're safe here.

474
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,349
You're well aware
of my powers, Penny.

475
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,833
I covet your spirit,
and any spirit I covet, I control.

476
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,149
You son of a...

477
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,834
Of course you know,
the more you fight me,

478
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,117
the more I know
that you still love me.

479
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,273
Are you crazy? I hate you.

480
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,989
Yes. But you only hate me
because you once loved me.

481
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,551
After all, we only hate those
who have gotten close to us, don't we?

482
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,439
Those who've gotten close enough
to touch our hearts.

483
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,398
You used me.

484
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,155
You preyed on my affections
just to get to my family.

485
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,999
And for that I am truly, truly sorry.

486
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,071
I was just trying to survive.

487
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,797
I never intended to
fall in love with you either.

488
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,159
What do you want, Armand?

489
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,438
What I wanted then. Life, with you!

490
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,350
Think about it. Think about it, Penny.

491
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,149
There's enough magic in
the Halliwell line to resurrect us both!

492
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,952
To give us
a second chance together.

493
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,278
All you have to do is to call up
the spirits of the matriarchs.

494
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,509
I'll do the rest.

495
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,590
No, no.
You will never make me do that.

496
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,632
I can if I have to.

497
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,756
I'll tell my granddaughters,
they will destroy you...

498
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,070
Oh, you haven't changed one bit.

499
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,757
Isn't that why you loved me?

500
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,551
Because I was dangerous?
Exciting?

501
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,392
Why your heart beats a little faster
when I'm near you?

502
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,115
Or when I do this?

503
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,392
You still love me, Penny.

504
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,472
You know it and I know it.

505
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,189
And you're going to help us both
to live again...

506
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,672
...forever.

507
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,748
<i>As soon as we summon her,
we gotta get her straight to the Book,</i>

508
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,911
because the Necromancer
is gonna be right behind her.

509
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,308
All over it.

510
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,357
All right, let's do this.

511
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,513
- Who is that?
- It's Jason.

512
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,638
Guys really do have bad timing,
don't they?

513
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,110
- Yeah, I kind of owe him an answer.
- Answer to what?

514
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,035
He asked me to go back
to Hong Kong with him.

515
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,072
To live.

516
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,355
I'll be right back.

517
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,989
- Now is not really a good time.
- I need to talk to her.

518
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,276
- I don't have much time.
- It's okay, Leo.

519
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,198
- What about...?
- Don't worry about it.

520
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,830
Come in. Come in.

521
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,036
- Hi.
- Hi.

522
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,629
- Listen, Phoebe, I've been thinking.
- Yeah, me too.

523
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,469
I shouldn't have asked you
to come with me like that.

524
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,433
- You shouldn't have?
- It's not that I don't want you to, I do.

525
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,589
I just... I think I sort of blind-sided you
with it and I feel bad about it.

526
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,875
- Jason...
- And it was unfair of me

527
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,959
to spring it on you like that, knowing
how close you are to your family.

528
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,395
That's really sweet...

529
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,518
I don't wanna pressure you
into deciding.

530
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,878
And I wanted you to know that if

531
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,957
- you need more time to think about it...
- I don't.

532
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,279
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

533
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,789
I do love my family,
and I don't wanna leave them.

534
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,470
But I think if I don't,
at least for a little while,

535
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,672
then I'm gonna wind up like my
grandmother, and I don't want that.

536
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,239
- I don't think I understand.
- You don't have to understand.

537
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,799
What time does the plane leave?

538
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,955
- Ten. In the morning.
- I'll be there.

539
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,189
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

540
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,918
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

541
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,874
Okay.

542
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,069
- Okay.
- All right, so...

543
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,473
- Okay.
- All right.

544
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,916
Go on, go on.

545
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,429
Well?

546
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,551
How do you guys feel
about intercontinental orbing?

547
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,034
We'll talk about that later.

548
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,477
Read.

549
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,791
<i>Hear these words, hear my cry
Spirit From the other side</i>

550
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,080
<i>Come to me, I summon thee,
Cross now the great divide</i>

551
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,959
They're calling you, my love.

552
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,398
Don't. Don't try to fight it.

553
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,678
You have no choice
but to do as I wish.

554
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,990
Welcome back, Grams.

555
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,596
- Girls...
- No time for apologies.

556
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,433
Come on, come on.
This way, this way, this way.

557
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,915
That is a spell to vanquish a ghost.
But only a ghost can read it.

558
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,719
- And that's you.
- You shouldn't have done this.

559
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,552
Oh, come on, Grams,
we're not that mad.

560
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,589
You will be.

561
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,876
Grams, he's gonna
be here any second.

562
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,110
I know, I know.
It's just that I don't think that...

563
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,959
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

564
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,269
I never meant to hurt you.
Or Wyatt.

565
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,076
Right. Okay, we kind of need to focus
on the demon at hand here, okay?

566
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,598
Incoming!

567
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,752
- Now, Grams!
- Grams, read the spell.

568
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,195
Don't bother. She's with me now.

569
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,996
It's time, dear.

570
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,079
Piper, blow him up or something.

571
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,232
The ghost? You want me to blow
up the ghost? He's already dead.

572
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,749
<i>I call Forth From space and time</i>

573
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,551
<i>Matriarchs From the Halliwell line</i>

574
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,149
Paige, the truth spell.
Use it on Grams.

575
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,198
<i>For those who want
The truth revealed</i>

576
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,357
<i>Open hearts and secrets unsealed</i>

577
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,078
<i>From now until it's now again</i>

578
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,515
<i>After which the memory ends.</i>

579
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,319
Penny, finish the spell.

580
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,870
Grams? Tell him how you really feel
about him. Tell him the truth.

581
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,069
I love you.

582
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,919
Any other bright ideas?

583
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,311
And now I know that
you didn't just use me,

584
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,476
that you really did love me too.

585
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,914
I still do.

586
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,112
I know. But the truth is

587
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:16,075
that our love isn't nearly as powerful
as the love I have for my family.

588
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,193
<i>Ashes to ashes, spirit to spirit
Take his soul</i>

589
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,918
Penny, what are you doing?

590
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,638
<i>Banish this evil</i>

591
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,433
Penny.

592
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,399
I am so sorry.

593
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,472
I never realized how much my anger,
my bitterness, affected my life.

594
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,432
Or yours.

595
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,314
But I'm most sorry for what I did
to my great-grandson and you.

596
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,876
And if ever I wanted a second chance,
it would be with him...

597
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,159
...and you.

598
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,471
Don't make the same mistake I did.

599
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,358
Don't ever give up on love.

600
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,151
Paige, you gotta
let me out of here sometime.

601
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,719
You can't keep me in here forever.

602
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,748
Don't worry. When the spell wears off
you won't remember a single thing.

603
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,996
Although I've got a couple of things
I'd like to say to you before it does.

604
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,594
Say it fast, will you?

605
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,435
You know, Paige, I've been thinking.

606
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,073
I've been in here a long time,

607
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,110
and I realize what I did to you
was really wrong.

608
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,233
I hope you're buying this.

609
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,795
You know, I thought you would
have a problem with magic,

610
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,555
I didn't think you would be a problem
on a basic human level.

611
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,951
I was gonna tell you about Morgan
and the kids at some point.

612
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,232
No, I wasn't.

613
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,155
For what it's worth, Nate, I don't
hate you. You're just too pathetic.

614
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,872
It doesn't matter anyway, it's gonna
be over in, like, a second.

615
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,995
What happened? Why am I in jail?

616
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,952
I don't know,
why don't you ask your wife?

617
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,269
- What's so funny?
- You'll never know.

618
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,632
A little friendly advice:
Don't ask any questions,

619
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,718
don't call Paige,
and walk away as fast as you can.

620
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,673
Is that a threat?

621
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,912
Actually, Nate, it is.

622
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,438
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean,

623
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,750
if we don't leave very soon,
you'll miss your meeting.

624
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,150
I know, I know.

625
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,398
- Jason!
- Phoebe!

626
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,870
Wow, you're cutting it pretty close,
aren't you?

627
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,708
Where are your bags?

628
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,838
- Jason...
- You're not coming, are you?

629
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,388
No, I'm not.

630
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,354
I want to. More than you know.

631
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,748
Well, then why don't you?

632
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,358
It's hard to explain.

633
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,035
I just feel like, for now at least,

634
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,319
that my place is here, you know?
That this is where I need to be.

635
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,951
Not forever.
I mean, God, I hope not forever.

636
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,668
Just for now.

637
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,400
I guess I should've gotten you
jewellery after all.

638
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,996
Hurry back.

639
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,991
I think he looks a little like
your grandfather.

640
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,357
Oh, trust me, that's a good thing.

641
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,949
- He was a good man.
- Nice to know.

642
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,231
Shall we?

643
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,237
<i>I call Forth From space and time</i>

644
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,431
<i>Matriarchs From the Halliwell line</i>

645
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,837
<i>Mothers, daughters, sisters, Friends</i>

646
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,032
<i>Our Family spirit without end</i>

647
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,199
<i>To gather now in this sacred place</i>

648
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,069
<i>And help us bring this child to grace</i>

649
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,194
The next generation has been born
into our family.

650
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,199
Our legacy.

651
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,156
We pledge to be with this child,
this beautiful boy, always.

652
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,916
Apart but never separate,
free but never alone.

653
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,913
He is one of us,
and because of that,

654
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,516
we will bless him with
all the goodness that we are.

655
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,560
Welcome to the family,
Wyatt Matthew Halliwell.

656
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,990
- Blessed be.
- Blessed be.

657
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,991
- Blessed be.
- Blessed be.

658
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,351
Take good care
of my great-grandson.
