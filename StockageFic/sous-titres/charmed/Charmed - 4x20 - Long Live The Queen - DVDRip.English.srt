1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,273
Come in.

2
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,628
My queen,

3
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,995
it's time for your tonic.

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,239
Can you do anything
about this thunder?

5
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,038
Because it's making me nuts!

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,395
I have no sway over the weather.

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,199
I do have a friend
who works with wind,

8
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,509
but she's out of town.

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,636
What about demons?

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,836
Any sway over them?
Because I swear,

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,718
if they don't shut up...

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,669
I hate this stuff.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,398
It's for your own good.

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,437
Well, whatever happened
to regular old vitamins?

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,160
There is nothing regular
about your pregnancy.

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,391
The new power you're experiencing

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,028
is a mere shadow
of what's to come.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,033
The tonic strengthens you
to bear the weight of it.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,475
Okay. Well, then do me a favour.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,995
Find something that strengthens me

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,196
and doesn't taste like crap.

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,352
Are you feeling all right?

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,750
Yeah, it's just...

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,711
I have all this work that I have to do,

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,871
and I can't concentrate!

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,111
But you are queen now.

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,919
There's no reason for you to
continue with this work at all.

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,879
I like my work.

29
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,314
It's a good distraction.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,638
A distraction from what?

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,960
Still struggling with your decision?

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,952
No, I mean...

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,156
I love Cole, and, you know,
don't get me wrong,

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,276
this whole queen thing
is kind of fun. It's just...

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,396
Your sisters.

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,871
Yeah, I don't understand
why they have to be so stubborn.

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,954
Why they can't just
respect my decision.

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,157
Because it's not in the nature
of good to compromise.

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,753
They'll never understand.

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,070
They'll only want to change you back.

41
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,435
The sooner you accept that
and let them go,

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,113
the happier you will be.

43
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,112
Here, drink your tonic.

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,510
What the hell is going on out there?

45
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,035
You know, ever since the coronation,
all he does is work.

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,397
The underworld's been
in chaos for some time.

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,836
- And he has a great task--
- I don't care.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,151
I want some attention
from my husband.

49
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,714
You're excused.

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,710
Make certain
you drink that upon waking.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,831
It is after midnight, Cole.
Come to bed.

52
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,549
Phoebe, please,
we're in the middle of a ceremony.

53
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,229
We're almost done.

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,075
"Almost" doesn't work for me.

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,837
I thought we talked about this.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,560
Sorry, it's hormones.

57
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,270
Damn it,
I have read through this 1 5 times.

58
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,796
There's nothing even remotely helpful
about how to save Phoebe.

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,992
I told you, she made a choice.
There's no magical cure for that.

60
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,037
Yeah, well, she's pregnant, Piper,

61
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,359
so she's being influenced
by the baby inside.

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,953
And we could have helped her

63
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,872
overcome that, but she chose Cole.

64
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,870
Will you just stop
with the potions already?

65
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,554
You've already overrun the kitchen.
I'd say we have enough.

66
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,510
This one duplicates
my freezing power,

67
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,989
plus it scalds the flesh,
so we should only use it

68
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,479
in a dire emergency.

69
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,798
No.

70
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,474
I will not scald Phoebe's flesh.

71
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,358
She's still our sister.

72
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,959
Paige.

73
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,679
How is she?

74
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,718
She's like Piper Light.

75
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,519
All the personality without any
of those messy emotions.

76
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,193
We'll see.

77
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,920
Rumour on the demonic grapevine is,

78
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,991
their new queen
is killing upper-level demons.

79
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,837
- Word is, she killed two just last night.
- What does that mean?

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,037
It means it looks like Phoebe's working
from the inside for the good guys.

81
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,599
That's great.

82
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,515
Since when
do you guys believe rumours

83
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,875
that are spread by demons?

84
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,988
Alison Whitt.

85
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,879
Among other things,
she's spearheading the campaign

86
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,110
to clean up Dolores Park.

87
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,554
That's my district.

88
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,432
I got men there too.

89
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,714
- Since when?
- Since I put them there.

90
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,440
- Then they're working my territory.
- Gentlemen.

91
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,269
It's all my territory.

92
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,995
Next.

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,832
Gregory Conroy,

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,072
a probation officer
to juvenile offenders.

95
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,595
Manages to rehabilitate
the worst of the worst.

96
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,669
He's cost us
several potential demons.

97
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,512
He's yours.

98
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,955
He works at the--

99
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,195
Relax, boys.

100
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,351
I'm here to cook, not kill.

101
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,637
Although I'd keep
your voices down if I were you.

102
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,909
Hi, honey.

103
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,193
Honey?

104
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,913
Will your friends
be staying for dinner?

105
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,913
I'm gonna find it hard to convince
them to stay unless you stop

106
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,997
- threatening to kill them.
- I was kidding.

107
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,230
You killed five of my best demons
this week, so forgive me

108
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,515
if I'm missing the joke.

109
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,396
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

110
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,517
I know I've been working a lot.

111
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,353
But that should lighten up soon.
In the meantime,

112
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,033
no more killing.

113
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,714
Promise?

114
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,669
Promise.

115
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,512
It's hard enough for them
to accept the fact

116
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,750
that my queen
is a former Charmed One.

117
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,071
We don't want them
to think you're playing both sides.

118
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,234
I said, I promise.
But if it will make you feel better...

119
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,799
Hi.

120
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,077
I just want to say that I'm really sorry

121
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,549
for killing your friends last night.

122
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,235
Oh, and the night before that.

123
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,392
And it's nothing personal,
you know. It's just...

124
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,352
- Phoebe, was that a...?
- Cramp.

125
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,398
I just need to lay down.

126
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,233
Should I call the Seer?

127
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,394
No.

128
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,435
No. I'm fine.

129
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,393
Where were we?

130
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,159
Gregory Conroy.

131
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,389
Malek's in for the kill.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,072
He spends his time
at the Mission Hill Community Centre.

133
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,790
These are meant
to slow an attacker down

134
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,791
but not do real serious harm.

135
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,188
It's kind of like magical Mace.

136
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,868
Sounds reasonable, I guess.

137
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,951
These are a little more lethal.

138
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,519
Explosives, paralytics,

139
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,392
your garden-variety poisons.

140
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,879
So you're gonna poison Phoebe?

141
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,511
Leo, she's carrying
the spawn of The Source.

142
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,632
She's throwing fire from her hands.
If she shows up here,

143
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,075
we'll do what we have to do
to protect ourselves.

144
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,878
You're not even giving her a chance.

145
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,156
Paige, we gave her
every chance in the world

146
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,675
to come back to us.
And she threw it in our faces.

147
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,510
She chose The Source of All Evil

148
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,511
over her own family.

149
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,348
Surprise.

150
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,550
Nice to see you too, Piper.

151
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,154
What do you want?

152
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,957
And here I thought
you'd be happy to see me.

153
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,557
I'm happy to see you.

154
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,159
- Paige.
- What?

155
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,830
Unless you're here
to tell us you filed for divorce,

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,558
we don't really have much
to talk about.

157
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,835
Oh, that's not true.

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,833
For instance, we could talk
about how rigid you are.

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,592
It's really not
a very attractive quality.

160
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,073
Wait.

161
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,958
Phoebe, what are you doing here?

162
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,112
I had a premonition.

163
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,635
We have an innocent to save
and not a lot of time.

164
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,516
That is so great. Look, I told you.

165
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,750
Don't get excited.
It's not what you think.

166
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,317
I haven't changed my mind.
I'm not leaving Cole,

167
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,038
and I'm not renouncing my crown.

168
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,394
It's just,

169
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,471
I've never ignored
a premonition in my life,

170
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,868
and I'm not about to start now.

171
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,949
Phoebe, you're evil.

172
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,395
You're, like, the queen of all evil.
Literally.

173
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,233
- That's beside the point.
- How can that be besides the point?

174
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,633
I say we do it.

175
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,629
- What?
- Excuse me.

176
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,633
Look, this is what
we've been hoping for:

177
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,313
A sign that there's still good in her.

178
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,391
Why else would she care
about saving an innocent?

179
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,913
Because it's a trap.

180
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,157
Piper, this could be our only chance.

181
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,708
I think Paige is right.

182
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,834
Maybe by helping her do good,
it might sway her back to our side.

183
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,713
Fine.

184
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,475
Okay, you're on. We'll follow you.

185
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,472
What's that for?

186
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,073
Insurance.

187
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,958
Why do I always have to land
in the mud?

188
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,394
Come on, over here.

189
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,192
How do you know
when he's gonna get attacked?

190
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,429
I know.

191
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,993
There he is.

192
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,074
Hey.

193
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,918
- What are you doing?
- Stop.

194
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,438
My queen.

195
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,478
Leave that innocent alone.

196
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,353
Go.

197
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,629
What?

198
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,153
He's one of my subjects.

199
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,030
How--? How could you do that?

200
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,474
How could you just let him go?

201
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,200
I don't know why you're so upset.
We saved the innocent, didn't we?

202
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,112
I can't talk to her. You talk to her.

203
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,077
- Phoebe--
- Things are not as black-and-white

204
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,798
as they used to be.

205
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,758
Okay, I can't just go around
killing demons anymore.

206
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,911
Why not? We heard
you just killed two last night.

207
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,389
Yeah, well, that was different.
He was getting on my nerves.

208
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,429
I promised Cole
I wouldn't kill anymore.

209
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,511
And killing Malek
would have been a huge betrayal.

210
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,558
Malek? You're on a first-name basis
with the demons?

211
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,314
If you were gonna order him to stop,
you could've done that on your own.

212
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,278
- Why did you even come to us?
- Because I missed you guys!

213
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,318
Okay? Is that so wrong?

214
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,232
I missed you.

215
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,470
Well, Phoebe, you can't be
the queen of the underworld

216
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,437
and a Charmed One.
You can't have it both ways.

217
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,999
Why not?

218
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,594
Just because it's different
doesn't mean that it can't work.

219
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,794
And you all miss me too,
even though I'm sure

220
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,349
Piper probably doesn't want
to admit it to herself.

221
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,353
- Of course we miss you, honey.
- Well, you can have me back.

222
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,112
You can have
the power of three back.

223
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,430
You just have to be willing
to meet me halfway.

224
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,558
Phoebe,
you can't protect the innocent

225
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,188
and save demons.
It just doesn't work that way.

226
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,191
Apparently, it does.

227
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,634
He's alive, isn't he?

228
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,831
Yeah, but your friend Malek
is gonna come back.

229
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,070
- You don't know that.
- That's what they do Phoebe,

230
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,959
they come back.
They snarl and come back.

231
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,712
Now we have to worry
about protecting him

232
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,074
instead of trying to save you.

233
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,478
- You think I need saving?
- Are you kidding me?

234
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,835
That baby inside you
has corrupted you

235
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,149
more than you think.

236
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,516
- Piper--
- Don't "Piper" me.

237
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,393
This is insane.
What you are saying is insane.

238
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,312
You cannot come back.

239
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,119
You cannot work with us
as long as you are married

240
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,191
- to The Source.
- So, what do you want me to do?

241
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,952
- You want me to leave my husband?
- Yes.

242
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,156
- That is not fair!
- It's not fair, Phoebe,

243
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,435
but you have to pick a side.

244
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,955
Good or evil. That's how it works.

245
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,191
Even though it means giving up
someone you love,

246
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,509
you have to choose.

247
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,031
I'm really sorry you feel that way.

248
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,077
I can't do this.

249
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,269
What about Greg?

250
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,598
Oh, no, not again.

251
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,916
Did you guys see
anybody take off

252
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,274
on a chrome and orange bicycle?

253
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,998
No, sorry.

254
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,630
I don't even know
why I bother to lock it.

255
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,550
- What should we do?
- Follow him.

256
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,352
They were animal-sacrifice caverns.

257
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,238
For the most part,
they've been abandoned.

258
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,718
Waste of space, don't you think?

259
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,873
Put a team on it.
Have it cleaned out--

260
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,314
My liege.

261
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,315
- State your business.
- I have news for The Source.

262
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,031
It concerns his queen.

263
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,836
- What happened? Is she hurt?
- No.

264
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,670
The Charmed Ones interfered
with my kill.

265
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,472
I have no control over my in-laws.

266
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,995
If you want them out of the way,
I suggest you take backup.

267
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,878
I mean all three of them,

268
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,632
including the queen.

269
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,076
She ordered me
not to harm the innocent.

270
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,834
I thought you should know.

271
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,913
Have you told anyone else?

272
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,316
No. I came straight to you.

273
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,359
Thank you...

274
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,558
...for your loyalty.

275
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,239
- Am I next?
- No, Dane.

276
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,193
You...

277
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,358
...I trust.

278
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,159
- It's just my damn wife.
- With all due respect...

279
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,429
...I think you better take care
of the innocent...

280
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,352
...before others hear of this.

281
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,153
My liege.

282
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,359
Get up. I have a job for you.

283
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,270
The only requirement for membership
is a desire to stop drinking.

284
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,237
There are no dues or fees
for membership.

285
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,960
We are self-supporting
through our own contribution.

286
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,951
We do not wish to engage
in any controversy,

287
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,633
neither endorse nor oppose--

288
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,074
So you really think Piper's okay?

289
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,153
I don't know. I think it's good
that she's feeling something again.

290
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,673
Right.

291
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,718
Right. You're right.
She's probably fine.

292
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,950
Is anyone celebrating
30 days today?

293
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,919
So you think I just need
to give her some space, right?

294
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,159
You could try that, yeah.

295
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,556
It's just when Piper lost Prue,

296
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,278
she barely survived,
and she thinks

297
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,512
she's gonna lose Phoebe.
She might just...

298
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,316
Listen, just go talk to her, okay?

299
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,118
Remind her that we have
a demon to fight.

300
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,669
And that will do her some good
and take her mind off Phoebe.

301
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,831
Right, right.

302
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,190
- What about you?
- Me? I'm fine.

303
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,952
Listen, I don't think
Malek's gonna attack

304
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,759
in front of all these people.
So just go get Piper

305
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,639
and bring her back
before the meeting's over.

306
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,552
- Okay?
- Okay.

307
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,553
Okay.

308
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,749
Let me start by...

309
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,800
First, let me start
by congratulating the chip-takers.

310
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,754
- Where's the real column?
- Excuse me?

311
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,672
This is cute, very clever,

312
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,592
and I appreciate
the evening chuckle,

313
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,591
but I need to see the real pages.

314
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,112
Are you calling my writing a joke?

315
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,712
"Dear Betrayed,

316
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,996
I suggest you beat
your cheating husband

317
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,752
with his secretary's stapler.

318
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,997
Then he'll think twice
before bending her

319
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,230
over her desk again."

320
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,475
Well,

321
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,200
might be a little harsh,
but I think it makes a point.

322
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,590
What it makes is a lawsuit.

323
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,432
So unless you're looking
to lose your job...

324
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,274
Are you threatening me?

325
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,995
I am telling you
to get a shrink if you have to,

326
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,878
but get it together.

327
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,315
Rewrite that column and do it fast.

328
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,071
Excuse me.

329
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,472
If you wanna kill your boss,
we have people

330
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,079
who can take care of that for you.

331
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,076
Aren't you sweet.

332
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,436
Truth is...

333
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,589
...she's right.

334
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,669
My advice was a little off this week.

335
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,194
I don't understand
what you're doing here.

336
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,670
- You're queen.
- And you're cranky.

337
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,271
I told you I'm not quitting my job.

338
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,358
And what about your other job,
you gonna keep that too?

339
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,628
And what job would that be, Cole?

340
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,233
The Charmed One.

341
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,713
Malek told me what you did.

342
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,951
So what? I let him go.

343
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,396
- That doesn't make it okay!
- Keep your voice down.

344
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,595
This is where I work.

345
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,833
You can't save an innocent
and free a demon, Phoebe.

346
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,194
It doesn't work like that.

347
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,510
- You sound like Piper.
- Well, Piper's right.

348
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,671
You made a choice when you stood
by me at the coronation.

349
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,070
If you're questioning
that choice now, if you're not sure

350
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,196
you wanna be with me,
you need to let me know.

351
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,510
Of course I wanna be with you.
I just don't understand

352
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,831
- why you have to be so rigid.
- Because I am The Source!

353
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,718
Because you are my queen!

354
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,108
Because there are expectations!

355
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,714
Do you think I care
about anyone's expectations?

356
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,188
This is not a game, Phoebe.

357
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,191
You walked through a one-way door.

358
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,869
You try to turn around now,
they will destroy us.

359
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,673
Who?

360
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,112
- My sisters?
- The underworld.

361
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,960
If they think
we're working both sides...

362
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,789
...they will revolt.

363
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,958
If they do that...

364
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,832
If they unite against us...

365
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,559
...I promise,

366
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,876
we will pray for death.

367
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,512
I'm sorry.

368
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,878
- I didn't--
- I get it, Phoebe.

369
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,990
Better than anyone,
I know what you're going through.

370
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,996
It will rip you apart if you let it.

371
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,391
How do I not let it?

372
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,198
You make a choice.

373
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,396
And you stick to it.

374
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,630
Even though it's hard.

375
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,839
Even though it means
giving up the people that you love.

376
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,988
Let's go home.

377
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,514
We're closed.

378
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,555
- Honey--
- I don't want to talk.

379
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,277
- I know you're feeling--
- Even more than I don't want to talk,

380
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,829
I do not want a pep talk.

381
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,192
Piper.

382
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,034
What are you doing?

383
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,749
What does it look like I am doing?

384
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,194
I am trying to stop myself

385
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,510
from feeling like
the failure that I am.

386
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,672
You're not a failure.

387
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,515
- It's not your fault that Phoebe--
- I am the oldest sister, okay?

388
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,399
It is my job
to keep the family together.

389
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,073
And see, at this, my friend,

390
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,434
I am a failure.

391
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,829
That's enough.

392
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,835
Paige could see
that Cole clearly had turned evil.

393
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,470
And she tried to tell me
over and over and over

394
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,950
and over and over and over.

395
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,557
That doesn't even sound
like a word anymore.

396
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,188
You know, I didn't see
that he was evil, Piper.

397
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,318
Phoebe didn't see it at first.

398
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,799
We didn't want to see it.

399
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,149
We wanted a normal, happy family.

400
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,072
That's just human nature.

401
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,039
She is my baby sister.

402
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,112
And I let him destroy her.

403
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,109
That is not human nature.

404
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,718
That is the nature of failure.

405
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,709
All right, I'm not gonna listen
to this anymore.

406
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,313
You are a good witch, and--

407
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,070
I said, no pep talks.

408
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,115
Nobody listens
around here anymore.

409
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,314
Trey.

410
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,552
- Congratulations on your 30 days.
- Thanks.

411
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,839
Leo.

412
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,239
You again.

413
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,153
Are you following me?

414
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,113
Yes.

415
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,272
Strangely, I am,
and I would love to explain it to you.

416
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,000
But it would be better if we
could go talk inside by the crowd.

417
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,999
No!

418
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,233
What the hell?

419
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,833
Leo!

420
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,113
Athame!

421
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,354
Damn it, where are my sisters?

422
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,071
Oh, my God. Piper.

423
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,838
--and a good sister.

424
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,913
Paige, what--?

425
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,797
You were frozen, Leo,
and I'm guessing

426
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,714
- demons didn't get her.
- No, more like inner demons.

427
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,950
I can't believe she froze me.

428
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,712
- Are you okay?
- Barely.

429
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,474
It was a different demon this time.
They really want that guy dead.

430
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,757
You have to heal him
and orb him somewhere safe.

431
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,959
And then what?

432
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,475
Then I'm gonna put this family
back together.

433
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,789
Can you heal Piper?

434
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,952
No, I can't heal
self-inflicted wounds.

435
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,554
Great, now I'm down two sisters.

436
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,709
My queen?

437
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,670
It is time for your tonic.

438
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,716
What if I promise never to save
any innocents with them ever again?

439
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,393
Then can I see my sisters?

440
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,312
You'll feel better after this.

441
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,832
Oh, my God.

442
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,519
- It's poison.
- No.

443
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,272
- You told me it was good for me.
- It is.

444
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,953
- You're lying!
- Think about it.

445
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,350
Last night you were strong,

446
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,034
angry perhaps.
But now look at you, whining.

447
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,193
It's a weakness unbefitting
of a queen.

448
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,831
- What's in it?
- Pure evil.

449
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,353
The baby feeds on it.

450
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,236
- And as he grows stronger...
- I get weaker.

451
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,470
Only the good in you.

452
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,835
You're trying to destroy me.

453
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,634
I am trying to help you.

454
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,315
I gave you clarity
where now you have confusion.

455
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,478
I gave you conviction
where now you have pain.

456
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,677
- You took away my will.
- No.

457
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,354
You made the choice
to stand by your husband

458
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,239
all on your own. For you, for Cole

459
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,632
and for your baby.

460
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,519
Don't risk all of your lives

461
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,636
by questioning that now.

462
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,190
Drink the tonic, Phoebe.

463
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,068
What gives you the authority
to call a meeting and summon me?

464
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,511
I summoned you, my liege,

465
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,432
but I didn't call this meeting.

466
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,238
We all did.

467
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,629
Then someone had better speak.

468
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,552
- The concern--
- Someone else.

469
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,319
Malek is missing.

470
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,118
And the Charmed Ones
are guarding his mark.

471
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,312
Word on the street is that the queen
worked alongside her sisters,

472
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,754
who interfered with the kill.

473
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,716
I wonder how that news spread.

474
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,751
Forgive our confusion,

475
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,148
but we were under the impression

476
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,912
that the power of three
no longer existed.

477
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,839
The queen is pregnant.

478
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,160
She's prone to hormonal fits.

479
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,752
But I can assure you all

480
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,912
that the power of three
is indeed extinct.

481
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,111
Then who killed Malek?

482
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,839
I did.

483
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,032
I was convinced
he was about to betray me.

484
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,314
Nevertheless, his mark still lives.

485
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,235
Then assign someone
to finish the task, Dane.

486
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,954
I believe you already tried that,

487
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,475
- my liege.
- Are you questioning me?

488
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,639
The innocent

489
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,597
is still in the hands of the witches.

490
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,111
Until we've seen evidence
that the queen's...

491
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,829
...hormones
are indeed under control,

492
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,595
it might be best
if you took out the mark,

493
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,875
personally.

494
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,279
For morale.

495
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,315
How many hangover cures
do you have?

496
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,072
A lot. There was a time in my life

497
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,196
when I needed these often.

498
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,718
I'm sorry, Paige,
I don't know what got into me.

499
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,348
I mean, it's one thing
when your sister has a husband

500
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,839
that you can't stand. It's another

501
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,594
when he is The Source of All Evil.

502
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,313
Drink up. We got some work to do.

503
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,272
I can't lose her.

504
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,273
I can't lose another sister.
I don't think I'll survive it.

505
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,513
I've been thinking about it.

506
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,599
Phoebe was different today.

507
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,076
Yeah, she was nuts.

508
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,629
Yeah, but she cared about us,
about Greg.

509
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,752
Something has changed, and I think
now is our chance to get her back.

510
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,717
- How?
- Well, I think we storm the penthouse,

511
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,677
bring the crystals.
We still know the spell.

512
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,115
We vanquish The Source
the same way we did the last time.

513
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,713
Yeah, but now,

514
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,552
this time, The Source is Cole.

515
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,712
Do you really think she's gonna say
a little spell with us to vanquish him?

516
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,590
If she doesn't, we die.

517
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,836
Is that supposed to be comforting?

518
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,956
Actually, yeah.

519
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,156
The good in Phoebe
is fighting to the surface.

520
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,952
We saw that today.

521
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,953
I don't think she's just gonna stand by
and watch Cole kill us.

522
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,190
Are you willing
to bet your life on that?

523
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,159
Aren't you?

524
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,393
You know,

525
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,675
you're pretty amazing, Paige.

526
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,630
I mean, a year ago
you were an only child.

527
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,677
And I don't want to be again.

528
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,672
Let's go.

529
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,558
There we go.

530
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,519
I'll get the crystals.

531
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,033
Phoebe.

532
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,156
Cole is gonna kill Greg Conroy.

533
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,639
And I can't let that happen.

534
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,638
So, what do you wanna do?

535
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,391
I think that we

536
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,073
have to vanquish Cole.

537
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,831
I knew it. I knew she was ready.

538
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,759
We have to use Greg as bait.

539
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,834
Bait? He's an innocent.

540
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,433
I know, but Cole is looking for him.

541
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,273
He'll find him wherever he is,
so he's safest here.

542
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,194
So we have Leo bring Greg here,
but then when Cole arrives,

543
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,157
Leo's gotta orb Greg out of here.

544
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,993
And then we vanquish Cole.

545
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,991
I'll get the crystals.

546
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,671
Phoebe...

547
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,430
... I know how much you love Cole.

548
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,477
- And I'm really--
- I can't get

549
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,473
emotional about this now,
Piper. If I do,

550
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,232
I won't be able to go through with it.

551
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,915
Ready.

552
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,396
Leo, bring Greg.

553
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,471
So how long do you think
till Cole gets here?

554
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,472
Sooner than you think.

555
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,998
Phoebe, we have to--

556
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,118
What's the matter?

557
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,034
Did you know
about the Seer's tonic?

558
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,952
What it really does?

559
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,192
What's this?

560
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,319
You're planning to leave me?

561
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,637
I wrote two letters.

562
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,069
One saying goodbye to you, and one
saying goodbye to my sisters.

563
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,356
I haven't decided
which one I'm gonna send.

564
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,272
Well, you better decide.

565
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,396
- Right now.
- Did you know about the tonic?

566
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,992
Yes.

567
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,956
So you knew
she was poisoning me with evil.

568
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,272
You took my hand

569
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,749
and walked me
through that coronation

570
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,037
Iong before anybody
gave you anything to drink.

571
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,952
If you wanna pretend
that you're poisoned--

572
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,635
So why even bother with the tonic?
Why not just let me think for myself?

573
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,189
I know how it feels to have
good and evil fighting inside of you,

574
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,749
ripping your insides out.
I wanted to save you that pain.

575
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,471
You should have trusted me...

576
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,833
...to stand by you,

577
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,399
all on my own.

578
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,393
So...

579
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,797
...show me I can.

580
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,472
You know what's in the tonic now.

581
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,790
You know how it works.

582
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,193
Drink it.

583
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,668
All on your own.

584
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,592
Cole.

585
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,557
I don't have time
for games, Phoebe.

586
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,599
Just drink the tonic,

587
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,955
or leave now.

588
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,158
What is going on with you?

589
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,231
- What happened?
- What happened is, you had to go

590
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,790
- play demon catcher with your sisters.
- Cole, it's who I am!

591
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,879
And now we're in danger.

592
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,469
Serious danger.

593
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,033
If you don't care about your life

594
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,908
or mine

595
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,832
or the baby's,

596
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,159
what about Paige and Piper?

597
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,673
Don't you threaten them.

598
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,432
I'm not.

599
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,510
If there's a coup, do you think whoever
takes over for me will let them live?

600
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,316
Without the power of three,
they're sitting ducks.

601
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,673
I don't know what to do.

602
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,877
You can't go back.

603
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,795
There is only one choice.

604
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,435
Drink the tonic.

605
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,392
You have to know

606
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,676
that I would never do
anything to hurt you.

607
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,315
Please?

608
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,359
For us.

609
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,509
For our son.

610
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,029
I love you, Phoebe.

611
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,990
Just remember,
whatever happens next,

612
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,912
we can handle it
as long as we stay together.

613
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,312
What do you mean,

614
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,199
"whatever happens next"?

615
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,112
The Conroy thing got serious.

616
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,793
I had to take care of it.

617
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,589
- You killed him?
- It was your mess.

618
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,832
- I was just cleaning it up.
- Cole, they're gonna come after you.

619
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,036
- They're gonna come here.
- Well, if they do--

620
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,713
No.

621
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,156
Phoebe, if it comes down
to them or us...

622
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,669
Oh, God.

623
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,678
Phoebe, wait.

624
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,312
Phoebe.

625
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,514
Phoebe?

626
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,832
You evil son of a bitch.

627
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,274
Phoebe. Get out here
and help us, damn it.

628
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,119
Paige.

629
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,999
Don't make me kill you.

630
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,552
Phoebe? You heard what he said.

631
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,790
He's gonna kill us. Help us.

632
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,114
Forgive me.

633
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,671
I'm sorry.

634
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,193
It's...

635
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,113
It's for the best.

636
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,233
I know it is.

637
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,993
Phoebe?

638
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,712
I'm sorry too.

639
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,629
Phoebe, no.

640
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,749
- No!
- I'm sorry, baby.

641
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,194
I'm so sorry.

642
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,755
Prudence, Penelope
Patricia, Melinda

643
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,793
Astrid, Helena
Laura and Grace

644
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,515
I'll always love you.

645
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,069
Halliwell witches
Stand strong beside us

646
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,192
Vanquish this evil
From time and space

647
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,749
- Hey.
- Hey.

648
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,719
Why don't you go up and see her.

649
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,633
I don't know what to say.

650
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,236
I mean, I can't imagine...

651
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,468
If it had been you...

652
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,549
Hey.

653
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,673
Hey.

654
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,829
How is she doing?

655
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,039
I don't know.
She hasn't come down yet.

656
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,598
How long you been standing there?

657
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,119
A while.

658
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,593
Maybe we should go see her?

659
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,274
Okay.

660
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,438
What if she wants to be alone?

661
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,794
She's gonna be alone a lot.

662
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,951
Maybe right now she needs us.

663
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,675
Right.
