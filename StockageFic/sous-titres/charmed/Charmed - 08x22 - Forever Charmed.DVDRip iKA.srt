1
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:07,382
Piper, you gotta keep it down.

2
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,284
There's nothing in the book
that could fix this.

3
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,454
- No, there's gotta be something.
- There's not.

4
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,624
And they can't undo
what's already been done.

5
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,590
Are you sure the boys are okay?

6
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,553
I'm sorry you had to
come back to this.

7
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,606
Dumain.

8
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,276
- Good, you're still here.
- Billie, what happened?

9
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,821
- Where's Christy?
- She's gone.

10
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,240
What about the Charmed Ones?

11
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,200
Piper. Piper's the only one left.

12
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,871
I don't understand.
You said The Hollow would be enough.

13
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,665
They got it too.
They somehow found out

14
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,458
you were going to use it
against them,

15
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,045
so they summoned it too.
It must've split, infected you all.

16
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,298
I just want Christy back.

17
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,009
You might be able to.

18
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,721
You've got the power, Billie.

19
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,807
You've projected yourself
back into the past before, haven't you?

20
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,310
When Christy was young,
when she was trapped in that cave?

21
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,021
- Well, yeah, but I...
- Then why can't you do it again?

22
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,816
Only this time you can go back
to change what was.

23
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,860
To save her.

24
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,696
You trust me, don't you?

25
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,312
Damn.

26
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,281
- Hi, Daddy.
- Oh, sweetie, I'm so happy to see you.

27
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,951
- Leo. You're back?
- Hello, Victor.

28
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,328
I don't believe it, it...
This is good, right?

29
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,538
I mean...

30
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,874
...everything worked out all right?

31
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,754
Maybe you should sit down.

32
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,012
No, I don't wanna sit down.
What happened? What's going on?

33
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,142
Phoebe and Paige...

34
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,229
They didn't make it.

35
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,817
- What?
- But it's okay. I mean, I'm gonna fix it.

36
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,987
I don't know how,
but I'm gonna fix it.

37
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,160
- Where's Wyatt and Chris?
- Sleeping.

38
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:13,378
We need to take them someplace
where nobody can find them,

39
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,924
so we can figure this out.
Do you understand?

40
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,842
No.

41
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,222
What about the Elders?
Can't they help?

42
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,390
Apparently not.

43
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,185
How about the rest of the
magical community?

44
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,188
What about that guy Coop?

45
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,482
How do you know about Coop?

46
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,567
Well, he was here yesterday,
looking for Phoebe.

47
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,486
Who's Coop?

48
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:39,863
He's a cupid...

49
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,992
...who took Phoebe
to see her past loves.

50
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,205
- So?
- So maybe he can do the same for us.

51
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,709
Coop? If you can hear me,
I need to talk to you now.

52
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,089
Guys, if this is about Phoebe,

53
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,883
she's made it very clear to me
about the way she feels, so...

54
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,220
- Phoebe's dead.
- What?

55
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,807
But if you lend me your ring, I think
I can go back in time and save her.

56
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,144
It can do that, right?
I mean, you can go back in time.

57
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,063
- Yeah, to follow love, but...
- Okay.

58
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,065
So hand it over.

59
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,951
Okay, what do I do...
How does it work?

60
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,955
You just think about that person and...

61
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,040
...how much you love them.

62
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:37,004
I gotta tell you, it doesn't always work
the way you want it to, because love...

63
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,590
Love isn't practical, it's emotional.

64
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,886
- That's okay. It's all I've got.
- I'm going with you.

65
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,347
I'm not losing you again.

66
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,933
Keep it simple.

67
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,603
Just follow your heart
to one of them.

68
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,357
Phoebe.

69
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,947
This isn't right.

70
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,663
Oh, my God.

71
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,707
Demons.

72
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,878
- What happened? She didn't freeze.
- I don't know.

73
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,839
Probably because I'm your daughter.

74
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,388
You must be a pretty powerful witch,

75
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,641
you know, to be able to
come here from the future.

76
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,561
Oh, no, it really didn't have much to do
with me. It was Coop's ring.

77
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:39,816
- Who's Coop? A future son?
- No, Dad, sorry. All girls.

78
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,237
You mean it's just
you and Prue, huh?

79
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,197
Maybe we shouldn't
tell them too much?

80
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,491
You know, changing the past
might change the future.

81
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,034
Well, we gotta
tell them something.

82
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,995
I mean, how are we gonna figure out
why we're here?

83
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,248
Coop will fix it.

84
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,504
What?

85
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:05,092
I'm just not used to
seeing you guys holding hands.

86
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,052
Let alone...

87
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,304
Never mind.

88
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,517
Hey, I remember this.

89
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,939
How old am I?
I mean, now, in your time?

90
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,357
Almost 3.

91
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,360
So Prue would be 5.

92
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,780
- And Phoebe...
- Phoebe?

93
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,032
Wha... Who's Phoebe?

94
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,993
Not born yet.

95
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,203
I don't understand how this happened.

96
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,621
I was focusing on Phoebe,

97
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,624
and it was supposed to take me
to when she would be alive again.

98
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,503
Well, maybe it did. You know,
maybe we just overshot it a little bit.

99
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,674
A little? Try 30 years.

100
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:51,638
Wait a minute, I'm still a little new
with the witch thing. So...

101
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,223
...what happened?

102
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,769
Well, we were trying to save
Phoebe and Paige...

103
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,899
Paige? Do you mean
we have another daughter?

104
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,864
Yes, Mom, you do.

105
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,115
But the point is...

106
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:12,743
...they died.

107
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,246
In a huge battle. And we were trying to
go back in time to warn them.

108
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,958
But without the power of three,
we had to use this.

109
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,045
Wait. Did you say
the power of three?

110
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,589
Then that makes you
the Charmed Ones, right?

111
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,382
And you all came from me?

112
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,592
Well, yes.

113
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,260
- So...
- So...

114
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,221
If I'm the mother
of the Charmed Ones,

115
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,264
and we could
find the grandmother,

116
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,018
then maybe we'd be able to
re-create the power of three.

117
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,645
At least in theory.

118
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,146
You know what she's
talking about?

119
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,524
I'm talking about

120
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,778
using our family magic to
get you to where you wanna go.

121
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:51,448
Instead of that silly ring.
Could that thing take us to her?

122
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,618
I mean, your grams? Because
it would be faster than driving.

123
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,457
Look. You can't come
barging in here from the future,

124
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,629
and tell me that
two of my girls are dead,

125
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,215
without expecting me to help.

126
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,968
So...

127
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,804
...let's get going.

128
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,307
I'll be right back, baby.

129
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,770
Grams.

130
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,280
- What happened?
- Where's Victor?

131
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,954
Now where are we?

132
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,165
Triple Word Score.

133
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,168
Hold it. That's not spelled right.

134
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,670
- Well, sure it is.
- No, it's not.

135
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,882
No? Is that an official challenge?

136
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:54,803
- Excuse me.
- How do you spell Zankou?

137
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,015
- With a Z or X?
- That's cheating.

138
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:01,268
I'm not asking you, I'm asking me.

139
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,023
Well?

140
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,775
- Z.
- Told you.

141
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,614
- Are you?
- The future you and Leo? Yeah.

142
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:21,079
- And we've been expecting you.
- Yeah. I baked cookies.

143
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,553
I just don't understand how...

144
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,307
You were aiming for Grams
but you weren't specific enough.

145
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:44,269
So you came to the future where
you're the grams instead,

146
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:48,607
- and here I am.
- Wait, I'm a grandmother?

147
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,568
Blows your mind, doesn't it?
Mom?

148
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,822
Hold on. I don't understand
how you know all this stuff,

149
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:57,950
and how did you know
we would come?

150
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,036
Because 50 years ago
we were sitting there,

151
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,914
where you're sitting,
talking to our future selves.

152
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,415
That's why we were expecting you.

153
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,251
Now, you sure
you don't want some cookies?

154
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,129
- No, I think I'd rather have aspirin.
- Like she said...

155
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,341
...we were expecting you.

156
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,928
You remember when
we were them?

157
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,431
Kicking butt, fighting demons.

158
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,852
Losing you, getting you back,
losing you again.

159
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,771
- But it was all worth it.
- Oh, you bet.

160
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:30,107
Oh, that's so sweet.

161
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,069
You know what, I'm just
not quite ready for all of this.

162
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,779
Besides, we need to get back to

163
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,031
- save Phoebe and Paige.
- Save Phoebe and Paige.

164
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:43,287
Right. And the only way you're gonna
be able to do that is if you...

165
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,372
Don't say too much, hon.

166
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,584
We don't want them to
mess up the future.

167
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,460
Well, isn't it already messed up?

168
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,129
Oh, no, not yet.

169
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,509
The future is worth saving.
Believe me.

170
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,304
You keep using the ring.

171
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,224
Focus on who you want to go to
with your heart, not with your head.

172
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,812
That way, you'll get to your grams,
and then to Phoebe and Paige.

173
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,523
But what do we do
when we get there?

174
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,320
- How do we save them?
- You get rid of The Hollow together.

175
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,666
I think we're back in my time.

176
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,294
- You want another tissue?
- No, I'm okay.

177
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,547
Well, you're
more than okay, sweetie.

178
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,884
You're very, very special,
and you need to know that.

179
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,179
Not as special as Prue.
Or even Phoebe.

180
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,847
Everyone likes Phoebe.

181
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,725
But you're special
in your own way, Piper.

182
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,186
I mean, you're kind and caring.

183
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,689
You're the best little helper
I've got. Plus,

184
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,359
you are the only one who

185
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,612
can keep your sisters
from killing each other half the time.

186
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:05,160
And you may not know it yet,
but you've got gifts.

187
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,415
The most... The most amazing gifts.

188
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:16,004
And someday, those gifts are
gonna make you even more special.

189
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,924
- How?
- Well, you'll see.

190
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,554
Now, run on upstairs
and play with your sisters, okay,

191
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,056
- while I make dinner.
- Okay.

192
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,475
You loved your grams.

193
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,770
Who's there?

194
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:34,606
- It's okay, Mom. It's just me.
- Oh, no. Mom.

195
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,441
Patty?

196
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,154
Mom! Oh, my...
What happened?

197
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:48,912
- Why'd she faint?
- Oh, well, probably because you're...

198
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,664
...dead.

199
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,920
All you need to do is
focus on saving your sister.

200
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,923
Which means
focusing on the battle.

201
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,217
Let's try again.

202
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,930
Clear your mind of everything else.

203
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,765
From all that has happened since.

204
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,520
Let go of the pain of loss,

205
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:17,983
because where you're going,
that hasn't happened yet.

206
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:21,111
Think only of Christy.

207
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,615
See her at your side.

208
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:29,244
You want to save her
more than anything else.

209
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,498
And that's what you're going to do.

210
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,251
That's it.

211
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,796
You're almost there.

212
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,007
Now go...

213
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:47,262
...project yourself back
to the Triad.

214
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,642
The Triad?

215
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:54,811
What the hell are you talking about?

216
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,564
- Are you trying to trick me?
- No, of course not.

217
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,317
Then what was that? You said
I was going back to see my sister.

218
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,153
You're right. I should have told you.

219
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,573
Should have told me what?
What's going on?

220
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,159
What's going on is that
if you don't go back

221
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,287
to warn the Triad about the battle
they won't be able to stop it.

222
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:15,415
Which means they'll still be killed
and so will your sister.

223
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,379
So you're saying
the Triad was still alive?

224
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:23,674
- More or less.
- And you didn't tell me?

225
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:28,387
So you've been manipulating me
this entire time? And Christy too?

226
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,348
Christy understands
exactly what is going on.

227
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:32,683
And what might that be?

228
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,353
Why don't you go back
and ask her yourself?

229
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,730
Then maybe
you'll understand too.

230
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:49,700
- How is she?
- I think she's coming to.

231
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,702
No, I meant Mom.

232
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,371
I think it's more information overload
than anything else.

233
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:57,541
Yeah. Well, welcome to the club.

234
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,713
What's wrong?

235
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,382
Nothing.

236
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:12,389
I just was thinking about after you guys
say the spell to get rid of The Hollow.

237
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,975
Well, hopefully it'll work.

238
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:18,520
Yeah, if it does it means
everyone's gonna come back to life.

239
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,897
Including Billie and Christy.

240
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,232
Not for long.
Not if I have my way.

241
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,944
Until you do, it means the ultimate
battle wouldn't have been fought yet.

242
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,947
Which means the Angel of Destiny
might take me away again until it is.

243
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:34,745
Listen. All I know is that we will be
playing Scrabble in the future.

244
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,956
And I'm pretty sure
you won't be losing.

245
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,668
Oh, what happened?
Where am I?

246
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,504
You're okay, Mom.
You just fainted.

247
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,882
Well, of course I fainted.
You're dead.

248
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:50,260
Yeah, I know.
They just told me.

249
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,095
Hi.

250
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:55,599
- And who are you?
- Well, believe it or not,

251
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,226
I am Piper.

252
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,314
From the future.
And this is my lovely husband, Leo,

253
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:06,276
- from the future as well.
- But I'm from the past. Obviously.

254
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:11,949
I need a drink.

255
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,117
- Oh, Mom.
- Okay, Grams, relax.

256
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,454
I know this is all very complicated,
but we don't have time to explain.

257
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,498
Something very bad has happened
in the future,

258
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,291
and we need your help to fix it.

259
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,127
We have to save her sisters, Mom.

260
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,213
We have to save
the Charmed Ones.

261
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,467
The Charmed Ones?

262
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:35,514
You become the Charmed Ones?

263
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,893
What do we have to do?

264
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,857
Christy?

265
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,651
Christy?

266
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,028
Christy?

267
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,008
Whoa, wait.

268
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,760
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm from the future.

269
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,429
I came back to warn you...
Me.

270
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:16,889
Not to do this.

271
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,559
No, no, I'm serious. You're gonna get
yourself killed. This is not gonna work.

272
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,868
We've been waiting for you.

273
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,537
Well, the wait is over.

274
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,209
- No potions, huh?
- We don't need any potions.

275
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,252
Funny. Neither do we.

276
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,214
I knew we shouldn't have
trusted you.

277
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,882
You should've followed
your instincts.

278
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,926
Next time.

279
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,719
There won't be a next time.

280
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,581
- What the...?
- Don't ask. You'll get a headache.

281
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,719
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

282
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,596
What is going on?

283
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,015
Looks like time
caught up with itself.

284
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,935
How did everybody get here?

285
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:48,564
Well, actually you have
Coop to thank for that.

286
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,315
What happened?
What went wrong?

287
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:52,276
Not here.

288
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,364
Damn it.

289
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,491
It's okay.
At least Phoebe and Paige are alive.

290
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:03,954
- Right. But where's Prue?
- Oh, Mom.

291
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,706
Not now.

292
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,552
I'm sorry, but I have no choice.

293
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,138
Wait, but...

294
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,824
Okay. So let me get this straight.

295
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:46,330
Because you guys altered
a key moment in time by saving us...

296
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:47,956
- And the manor.
- Right.

297
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:53,837
Because of all that, what is supposed
to happen after this, won't happen?

298
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:57,925
Exactly. That kind of
makes this the new present.

299
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,551
Says the woman from the past.

300
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,720
Though a different past than mine.

301
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,681
Are you getting any of this?

302
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:08,143
Whatever. As long as we're
alive again, that's all I care about.

303
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,646
Plus, it's really nice
to see you guys again.

304
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,064
Actually, we've never met.

305
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:14,525
Yeah, we have, but you were a ghost.

306
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,028
Does she know?

307
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,405
Yes, yes, we know.
We're both dead by now.

308
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:22,699
- We're over it.
- Well, you speak for yourself.

309
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:26,703
Okay, the problem is we're still
right back to where we started

310
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,374
with Leo, and if I'm gonna have that
future that I saw with him...

311
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,959
Wait, you went to the future too?

312
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,628
We sure did miss a lot
when we were dead.

313
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,297
Anyway, the point is
if I'm gonna get my husband back,

314
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,049
we have a battle to finish.

315
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,218
And we're gonna have to
get Mom home safely,

316
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:44,555
- otherwise Paige and I won't be born.
- Good point.

317
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,390
Well, fantastic.
Are there any other

318
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,058
problems we should be
worrying about?

319
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,815
- Wyatt.
- Chris.

320
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,149
What are you two doing here?

321
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:58,819
Somebody just
screwed up our future.

322
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:07,244
We're gonna need Dumain's help
if we're gonna finish what we started.

323
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,913
Haven't you been listening to me?
He's been manipulating us,

324
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,248
probably since we met him.

325
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,292
If we could get to
The Hollow sooner this time.

326
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,960
- Christy, listen...
- We can figure...

327
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:16,628
What is the matter with you?

328
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:20,507
Dumain is using us, okay?
And he's not the only one.

329
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,593
The Triad is also.

330
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,928
Yes, that's right,
they're still alive.

331
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:27,389
Or they were, but Dumain
didn't tell us that, did he?

332
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:30,934
Instead he tried to trick me into
saving them instead of you.

333
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,519
Maybe you should've
listened to him.

334
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,313
- What?
- The Triad

335
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,690
could have helped us figure out
how to kill the sisters

336
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,860
- if they were still around.
- Okay. Look at me.

337
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:43,488
Listen to me very carefully.
They don't care about us.

338
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,200
They have twisted everything.
They're using us, Christy.

339
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,577
They're using us for our powers,
our sisterhood,

340
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:51,663
and our lives so all we can do is kill.

341
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,000
And that's exactly what we're
going to do, Billie. We're going to kill.

342
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:58,337
Well, I can't do it. I won't.

343
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:00,547
Then I'll do it on my own.

344
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,219
Christy.

345
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,805
God.

346
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,478
We don't know what happened.
One minute everything's fine.

347
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,523
- We're kicking demon ass...
- Actually, I was kicking demon ass.

348
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:20,317
- Watch your language.
- Sorry, Grams.

349
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:23,570
- Wait, Grams? As in the Grams?
- Yeah.

350
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:28,325
Confused. Are these my
future grandkids or yours?

351
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:30,619
No, yours.

352
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,788
Oh, hi.

353
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:34,456
As you were saying.

354
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:37,459
Suddenly, in the middle of
all the fighting, everything changed.

355
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:41,088
And the demons started
kicking our as... Butts. Butts.

356
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,340
- Just because
Wyatt here lost his powers.

357
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:46,552
- Wait, how did you lose your powers?
- That's the thing. We don't know.

358
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,763
So we cast a spell to take us back to
when they were lost and it took us...

359
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,515
...here. To you.

360
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,725
Maybe we messed up something
without realizing it.

361
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:55,602
With all the jumping around
we've done,

362
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,521
it's a wonder
everything's not messed up.

363
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:00,023
No, it's gotta be
Billie and Christy.

364
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,734
They used The Hollow
to steal his powers.

365
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,319
I'm gonna kill them.

366
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,447
Well, before you do that we need to
get Wyatt's powers back,

367
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,033
otherwise there's not gonna be
any future to save.

368
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,662
Well, I think the only way to do that
is to go back and stop them.

369
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:16,707
But how do we know
exactly when to go back to?

370
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:20,252
I'll know. Or at least I'm hoping
little Wyatt might jog my memory.

371
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:24,089
Well, he's at Dad's.
I mean Grandpa's.

372
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:28,218
- Do you remember how to get there?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

373
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,971
- I'll go too.
- But Dad's gonna be there.

374
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,390
I know. I miss him.

375
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:36,727
Besides, I'm dying to know what he
looks like at this age.

376
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:40,189
She doesn't know.

377
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,941
Apparently, I hadn't
chased him away yet.

378
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,318
What are you talking...?

379
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:46,737
What don't I know?

380
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:50,073
All right. Everybody go.

381
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,911
But just, you know,
hurry back if you find anything.

382
00:24:58,332 --> 00:24:59,833
Hey.

383
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,587
- Phoebe.
- Hi.

384
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:07,049
Thanks a lot for
telling me she's alive.

385
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:08,800
You're welcome.

386
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,135
Uncle Coop.

387
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,097
Uncle Coop?

388
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,975
What?

389
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,272
All right, everybody out. Go.

390
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:30,239
Okay, let's get to the condo
and get to the "Book. "

391
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,115
Wait for me.

392
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:33,700
Wait...

393
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:46,839
Damn.

394
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:55,013
Oh, surprise!

395
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,559
Oh, my goodness.

396
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,561
Oh, you're just as handsome
as you ever were.

397
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,397
- Wha... What's going on?
- Hey, Gramps, how you doing?

398
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,816
Chris. What are you doing here?

399
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,318
Hey, Grandpa. How you doing?

400
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:13,824
Now, this is our grandson, Wyatt.
So handsome.

401
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:18,162
But I'm...
I'm, I'm, I'm so confused.

402
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,164
Yeah, you'll get over it.
I did.

403
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,334
- Where did you come from?
- 1975. How do I look?

404
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,005
Didn't anyone tell her
we're divorced?

405
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:30,674
What?

406
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:34,344
You dumped me
for your whitelighter.

407
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:37,014
- Who, Sam?
- Yeah, Sam. Paige's father?

408
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:39,433
Gramps, we're in a bit of a jam.
Where's little Wyatt?

409
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,394
He's in the other room with...
With you.

410
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:44,062
Thanks.

411
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:48,525
Oh, come on, Patty. It's all right.

412
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,861
It's a long time ago.

413
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,531
What do you mean Billie's not coming?
We need her.

414
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:56,742
We can defeat the Charmed Ones
without her.

415
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:58,076
No we can't.

416
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,536
We need the Triad to do that,

417
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:01,872
and we need her power
to go back and save them.

418
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,957
Well, maybe there's another way.

419
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:11,757
That's not nearly enough.
Here, let me do it.

420
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:14,593
I think I know how to do it
after all this time.

421
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,512
It's Billie and Christy.
They're not demons.

422
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,931
They might as well be
from everything you've told me,

423
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,725
which means we
can't take any chances.

424
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:26,730
I can't get over
how big this book has gotten.

425
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:30,734
- I'm so proud of you girls.
- Then why don't you let me stir?

426
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:34,196
Piper, why don't you get that?

427
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:36,740
Paige, why don't you get that?

428
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:38,659
Okay, I'll get that.

429
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,710
Hey. What are you doing here?

430
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,838
What am I doing here?
I'm looking for my wife.

431
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:53,131
She didn't come home last night.
Are you okay?

432
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:57,219
Yes, I'm okay. Of course I'm okay.
I mean, we weren't...

433
00:27:57,386 --> 00:28:01,515
..."okay" okay, but now we're okay and
I think in the future we're gonna be...

434
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,350
I think we're gonna be
more than okay.

435
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:05,936
Okay.

436
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:08,522
Don't tell me she marries
a whitelighter too.

437
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,440
Worse. A mortal.

438
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,235
Oh, good God.

439
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:15,112
Didn't I teach you girls anything?

440
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,657
Hey, what can I say?
There's always Uncle Coop.

441
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,910
I really should be
out there helping them.

442
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,453
No. Not until we talk.

443
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,332
- Look, there are lives at stake here.
- Yeah, and so is love. Ours.

444
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:30,878
I let you kick me out of here yesterday,
I am not doing it again today.

445
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,380
And you know why?

446
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:35,299
Because I love you,
Phoebe Halliwell.

447
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:40,262
With all of my heart, with every
fibre in my being, I love you.

448
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:43,098
I've found love for thousands of people
all over the world,

449
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:46,018
but I have never found love for myself.
Not until now.

450
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:48,562
Until you, and...

451
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:52,357
I know you feel the same way
because I can see it.

452
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:54,484
I know what love looks like.

453
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,571
And I am not letting this
get away from us, Phoebe.

454
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,576
- Apparently not, Uncle Coop.
- Yeah.

455
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:08,123
Look, I don't know what you want me
to do with this information.

456
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,792
I mean, we haven't even been
out on a date yet,

457
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:14,004
and I don't know how to get past
the whole forbidden-love thing, I...

458
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:15,797
Phoebe?

459
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,218
I'm... I have to go.

460
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,888
I will call you
when we need the ring back.

461
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:36,693
Nice ring.
Can I borrow it?

462
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:43,951
Okay, all we need to do now
is find Billie and Christy.

463
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,119
You don't have to look far.

464
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:48,664
Can we talk?

465
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,967
Look, I am so sorry for
what I've done to you guys,

466
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,885
after everything you've done
for me.

467
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:04,847
I just wanted
my sister back so badly.

468
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,140
I couldn't even see
that she was manipulating me.

469
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:08,934
Well, that's very convenient.

470
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,812
But how are we supposed to know
this isn't a trap?

471
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:14,648
Guess we have to let her talk.

472
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,525
- Where's Christy?
- I don't know.

473
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:19,695
Probably at Magic School trying to
figure out a way to kill you.

474
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:22,406
- But you're not.
- No. No.

475
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:24,908
That was before. They twisted
everything to make us think

476
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:26,285
we were doing the right thing.

477
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:27,911
- Who?
- The Triad.

478
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:29,913
They used us. They used Christy.

479
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,375
They have spent the last 15 years
turning her into a killer.

480
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,586
That's all they care about.
That's all they wanted.

481
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:37,129
We already vanquished the Triad.

482
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:39,715
Dumain will figure out a way
to bring them back. I know it.

483
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:41,175
- Who's Dumain?
- He's a demon,

484
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:44,052
but he knows them better than anyone,
and with Christy...

485
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,804
...they will stop at nothing.

486
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,890
Mom, are you here?

487
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:51,268
Keep an eye on her.

488
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,773
Where's Mom... I mean Grandma?

489
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,525
She wanted to stay
with Grandpa to talk.

490
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:00,986
Well, that had better be
all that they're doing.

491
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:03,697
What did you find?

492
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:06,241
Grandpa said that someone
came and picked up little Wyatt

493
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:07,743
at 5 in the afternoon yesterday.

494
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,995
Some man, but that's
all I could get out of him.

495
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:12,456
- Wait, what man?
- Dumain.

496
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:14,917
He brought Wyatt to Christy and me
to summon The Hollow.

497
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,585
And then you stole his powers.

498
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:18,670
We were being infected.
We didn't have a choice.

499
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:21,298
You used my son?

500
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:26,261
That is all in the past, dear. Now, let's
just focus on how to fix it now, okay?

501
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:29,473
Okay, so we have to go back in time
to the day Dumain took Wyatt.

502
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,974
No, we have to go before that.

503
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:34,311
I know him. He's gonna warn the Triad
before you can vanquish them.

504
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:36,522
Then you have to get the ring.

505
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:38,941
Coop?

506
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,610
Coop? We need you.

507
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:46,698
Something's wrong.

508
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:51,912
What?

509
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:55,374
The Elders sent Coop
down to you, Phoebe.

510
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:58,168
Not just to help you find love,
but to help you find him.

511
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:00,045
They hoped you'd fall in love
with a cupid.

512
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:02,381
It was their way to make up
for all your sacrifice.

513
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:05,467
They weren't gonna put you through
what Mom and Dad went through, so...

514
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:08,095
It wasn't and it will not be
a forbidden love.

515
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,058
Okay.

516
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,229
I don't know how that information
helps us right now.

517
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:19,147
Well, in the future,
when you're together,

518
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:20,858
you guys are like one.

519
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,735
All you have to do is think about him
and he's there.

520
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,872
Oh, my God.

521
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:37,916
What happened?

522
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:41,628
I fought him for
as long as I could.

523
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:43,213
Okay, who did this to you?

524
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:44,715
Some demon.

525
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,427
I'm sorry, he took my ring.

526
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:53,599
We're too late.
They're going back in time.

527
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:58,645
But I can too.

528
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:08,405
- What?
- My lords,

529
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:10,616
we come from the future
to warn you about it.

530
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:14,077
The Charmed Ones will get The Hollow
at the same time Billie and Christy will.

531
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:17,164
Which means we've gotta get to it
before they do this time.

532
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:19,416
Get out of here!

533
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:30,802
- No!
- Oh, yes.

534
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:40,270
I don't understand.

535
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:41,480
How could this happen?

536
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:43,440
Billie projected us here.

537
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:45,359
By focusing on you.

538
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:48,320
- Paige.
- Ring!

539
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:56,370
How could you?

540
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:57,913
Christy, please.

541
00:33:58,539 --> 00:33:59,623
It's over.

542
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,667
Just come home.

543
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:38,829
Oh, thank God.

544
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:42,666
Is everything all right? Did anything
change that wasn't supposed to?

545
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,293
Nope.

546
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:50,424
- I got my powers back.
- I can see that.

547
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:53,969
- Now, where's Billie?
- She used her own power to get back.

548
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:55,804
But she at least
tried to help out, right?

549
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:58,849
- I mean, try to make amends at least?
- Yeah.

550
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,403
Okay, hang on a second.

551
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:13,989
You're not gonna
take him away again, right?

552
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:18,452
No. This is the way the battle
was supposed to end all along.

553
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:21,705
And it's over.
Congratulations.

554
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:28,003
Hi there.

555
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:33,467
<i>Come here.</i>

556
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:43,727
Did we miss anything?

557
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:49,691
No, well, we changed the past, we
fixed the future, and saved the present.

558
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:52,319
- That's all.
- What's that?

559
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:55,906
Yeah, if you haven't figured it out
by now, you probably won't.

560
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:59,701
Doesn't matter, just as long as
everything's back to what it should be.

561
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:02,496
It will be if you get us back.

562
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:04,414
I mean, otherwise...

563
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:05,833
How are we gonna
get them back?

564
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,251
Oh, I can take care of that.

565
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,586
Yeah, but how will you know
when to take them back to?

566
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:12,297
Well, the ring will.
If I can ever get it back.

567
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:16,009
Be sure you return them
just before they were taken.

568
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:18,095
That way they won't
remember anything.

569
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:20,931
Oh, no... Don't, don't do that.
I mean, there's so many things,

570
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:23,851
wonderful things, that I just
don't wanna forget, you know.

571
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:27,104
There's just as much
I don't ever wanna know.

572
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:29,022
Like what happened to Prue.

573
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,693
- Victor told me.
- Oh, Mom.

574
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,944
It's all right.

575
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:37,906
I know everything
happens for a reason.

576
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:40,659
I believe that.

577
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:46,331
I also know that when one door closes
another one opens.

578
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,005
- Thank you for coming by.
- Anytime.

579
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,126
Don't tell me we have to
go fight a demon.

580
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:34,379
No. I don't think we'll have to
do that any time soon.

581
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:37,174
Then what's with the book?

582
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:40,135
Well, I think we should
write everything down.

583
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:44,014
Everything that happened, everything
we want future generations to know,

584
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:47,476
so that we can pass it down.
Just like it was passed down to us.

585
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:53,023
After you.

586
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:12,084
<i>So much has happened
over the last eight years.</i>

587
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:14,419
<i>So much has been
gained and lost.</i>

588
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:18,590
<i>Still, in some ways, I feel like
my life is really just beginning.</i>

589
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:20,425
Do you, Phoebe Halliwell,
take this man

590
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,636
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

591
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:24,221
I do.

592
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:27,266
<i>And it was.
For though I had love before,</i>

593
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:30,394
<i>I've never really known love.
Until I met Coop.</i>

594
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:32,688
<i>A man who I shared this
special little girl</i>

595
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:36,108
<i>I had long ago foreseen,
but feared I might never have.</i>

596
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:38,110
- Good night.
- Mommy, we love you.

597
00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:42,489
<i>Along with two other
special little girls I had not foreseen.</i>

598
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:46,827
<i>I was suddenly so blessed to have
a new family of my own.</i>

599
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:49,788
<i>And old friends to share it with.</i>

600
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:54,543
<i>And though I kept working
and giving advice to those who asked,</i>

601
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,504
<i>I was more interested in
helping them find love.</i>

602
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:59,631
<i>Since finally having been loved.</i>

603
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,095
<i>Phoebe had become somewhat
an expert on the subject. As for me,</i>

604
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:08,432
<i>life without demons
opened up similar avenues.</i>

605
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:11,685
<i>Henry, of course, continued to
look after his parolees.</i>

606
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:14,313
<i>Even if they didn't
want to be looked after.</i>

607
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:17,649
<i>While still making time to help me
with little Henry and the twins.</i>

608
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:22,696
<i>Which allowed me time to finally
embrace my inner whitelighter.</i>

609
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:25,073
Arrow!

610
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,496
<i>And to help the next generation of
witches come into their own.</i>

611
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:33,332
<i>So that Paige could pass on
all that she'd learned.</i>

612
00:39:33,499 --> 00:39:37,669
<i>Not just to her own children,
or to mine, or to Phoebe's,</i>

613
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:41,715
<i>but to other future witches
and whitelighters as well.</i>

614
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:44,927
<i>Which filled the time between when
we were doing the fighting,</i>

615
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:48,263
<i>and when our kids were
old enough to take over.</i>

616
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,599
<i>Allowing me time to
get back to my roots,</i>

617
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:53,852
<i>and cook something
other than potions for once.</i>

618
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:57,731
<i>And open the restaurant
I had always dreamed of owning.</i>

619
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:00,359
<i>As for Leo,
after we reclaimed Magic School,</i>

620
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:02,236
<i>he went back to teaching.</i>

621
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:04,238
- So who'd like to try it first?
- I do!

622
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:10,911
<i>Which he continued to do
until it was time to retire.</i>

623
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:12,704
Awesome. Great job, Matthew.

624
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:15,374
<i>And although we certainly
had our struggles...</i>

625
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:19,378
"And heartaches over the years,
we're a family of survivors,

626
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:26,218
and we will always be. Which is why
we've truly been charmed. "

627
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:29,221
Again, Grandmamma. Again.

628
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:31,807
No, dear, I can't.

629
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:37,104
I need to rest. But you can
look at it for a little while if you'd like.

630
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:41,233
After all...

631
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:44,611
...it'll be yours one day.
