1
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:08,508
There aren't any pictures
of me growing up.

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,428
That seems impossible. I mean,
you weren't exactly camera-shy.

3
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,805
Yeah, well, neither
were you and Piper.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,726
Or you and Grams or,
oh, you and Dad.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,354
Oh, look, here's another one
of you and Piper.

6
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,774
Okay.

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:28,111
- Here's a picture of you and Grams.
- Oh, wasn't I cute?

8
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,744
Here's one of you and Mom.

9
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,667
I don't even remember that.

10
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,004
What was I, about 2 here?

11
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,966
She died on us a year later.

12
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,844
- Phoebe.
- Okay.

13
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,431
Hurry, I need a pen and paper.

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,642
Well, quick,
we don't have a lot of time.

15
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,190
I always wondered how
you got in the candy drawer.

16
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,442
Yeah, too bad all the candy's gone.

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,695
I thought it would be easier for us
if we just write him a note.

18
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,615
- Who him?
- You know, what's-his-name.

19
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,121
Grandma's little friend,
comes every year.

20
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,748
Same day, same time.

21
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,500
Says, you know, the flowers
are from a secret admirer,

22
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,629
when it's obvious he's the admirer.

23
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,174
Hi, come on in.

24
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,009
Hi.

25
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,931
- How are you?
- Flowers for Miss Penny Halliwell.

26
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,436
Every year. What a klutz.

27
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:47,023
At least this year I can freeze him
so I can spare myself the cleanup.

28
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,400
Why did you wanna
write him a note?

29
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:54,280
- To tell him Grams is dead.
- Oh, you're gonna break his heart.

30
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,079
Five chimes.

31
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:05,624
- Excuse me?
- The clock.

32
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,127
I only heard five chimes.

33
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,754
It's noon.

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,589
That means you froze me.

35
00:02:13,257 --> 00:02:15,259
Which means you have
your powers at last.

36
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:19,054
I don't know what you're talking about,
but thanks for the flowers. Okay, bye.

37
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:21,390
Call me Nicholas.

38
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,476
Your mother did.

39
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:24,977
Oh, dear.

40
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,068
I had to appear to age
over the years,

41
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:34,904
otherwise you would've
been suspicious.

42
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:36,822
What?

43
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,533
You see, 24 years ago today,

44
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,368
your mother and I, we made a pact.

45
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,999
To spare her life, she gave up
your future powers to me.

46
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,627
She blessed this ring,

47
00:02:50,794 --> 00:02:53,630
which gave me immunity
from your powers.

48
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:56,967
Immunity so that I could kill you

49
00:02:57,134 --> 00:03:00,179
and take the powers
on for my own...

50
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:02,598
...to become invincible.

51
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:05,726
Our mother would never
give away our powers.

52
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:08,145
She didn't have much of a choice.

53
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:11,857
Your blood is boiling.

54
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:16,153
Soon your lungs will sear.

55
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:21,325
Your organs will overheat,
and death will come.

56
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,338
Why would Mom
make a deal like that?

57
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:38,008
More importantly,
what are we gonna do?

58
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,969
Wait, I think I found a spell
to unbind a bond.

59
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:43,430
You can't run from me!

60
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:46,016
- Okay, we have no choice.
- Okay, Phoebe, hurry.

61
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:50,604
<i>The bond which was not to be done
Give us the power to see it undone</i>

62
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:53,106
<i>And turn back time
to whence it was begun</i>

63
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:06,411
- It didn't work?
- Nothing happened.

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,381
Whose phone is that?

65
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:20,466
Not ours.

66
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:22,760
- Halliwell residence.
- You go.

67
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:25,638
- You go.
- She goes.

68
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:30,768
I beg your pardon?
Well, Donna, I'm just hurt

69
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:34,147
that you would suspect
my little angels of such a thing.

70
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,943
- Grams?
- Prue.

71
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,319
Just a moment, Donna.

72
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:44,532
Prue, Piper. Girls,
don't run in the house.

73
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:47,410
Yes, yes.

74
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:54,959
- What did you see?
- The warlock?

75
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:58,087
No...

76
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:00,423
...us.

77
00:06:41,857 --> 00:06:43,400
How do we know
we're back in time?

78
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:48,113
What if we just brought the past to us
accidentally? We've done it before.

79
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,574
Piper, look around.
What do you see?

80
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:54,536
- A messy attic, like always.
- No, not just like always.

81
00:06:54,703 --> 00:06:56,288
You have a black light,

82
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:58,623
a typewriter,

83
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:02,669
eight-track tapes and a pet rock.

84
00:07:02,877 --> 00:07:05,839
I mean, we got rid of this stuff
years ago, remember?

85
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:08,800
- And you saw us as kids?
- Yeah.

86
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:11,010
Oh, this can't be happening.

87
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:12,846
- I'm getting a migraine.
- Better not.

88
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:15,557
I don't think Advil's
been invented yet.

89
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:19,060
And apparently, neither has this spell.
It's not in here anywhere.

90
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:22,522
But we just cast it.
That's how we got back here.

91
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:26,025
Yeah, well, wherever here is,
it's before the spell was written.

92
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:28,903
So there's nothing in there about
how to get back to our own time?

93
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:31,072
Nothing.

94
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:34,242
Let me be the first to say
that we're screwed.

95
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,619
No, because at least we're alive.

96
00:07:36,786 --> 00:07:39,539
I mean, if we'd stayed in our time,
Nicholas would've killed us.

97
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,958
We barely got away as it was.

98
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,127
Is. Will be.

99
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:46,003
You know, I've never
been good with tenses.

100
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:50,258
- What are we gonna do?
- Well, Grams is right downstairs.

101
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:53,052
Maybe we should just go
and tell her who we are.

102
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:55,138
And say what?

103
00:07:55,304 --> 00:07:57,431
Hi, we're the ghosts
of grandchildren future?

104
00:07:57,598 --> 00:07:59,976
Come on, even Grams
is gonna have trouble with that.

105
00:08:00,143 --> 00:08:03,104
Plus, she has that heart condition.

106
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:05,189
Okay, fine, so we need another plan.

107
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:08,442
But first, we just need
to get out of the house.

108
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:13,614
You're talking too fast, I can't...

109
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:16,909
Patty, sweetheart, slow down.

110
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:19,412
- Patty?
- Mom.

111
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,957
What premonition? That's impossible.
You don't have premonitions.

112
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:25,543
Wait, I thought you said
Mom's power was to freeze time.

113
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,046
It is. Was.
You know what I mean.

114
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:31,173
Maybe you should go see a doctor.

115
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,509
<i>I don't need to go
to the doctor, Mom.</i>

116
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:35,177
Piper.

117
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:40,140
She's talking to Mom.

118
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:42,726
<i>I can't explain it either, Mom.
It just happened.</i>

119
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:45,437
<i>I felt a twinge in my stomach
and then, bam, I saw it.</i>

120
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:47,690
<i>- Saw what?
- Three women, warlocks.</i>

121
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:49,566
<i>And one of them was taking Prue.</i>

122
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,360
Do you think that's
really Mom's voice?

123
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:54,071
- Yes.
- Are you still nauseous?

124
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,739
Why don't you come home?

125
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:58,575
<i>I can't, and it was not a daydream.</i>

126
00:08:58,742 --> 00:09:01,370
Three warlocks? She can't be
talking about us, can she?

127
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:03,372
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

128
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:07,042
Okay, let's just get out of here.

129
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:21,056
Prudence, Piper.

130
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:29,648
No fair, using magic.

131
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:35,237
Wait, we had powers back then?

132
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:37,572
Oh, this is freaky.

133
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:47,332
- Hey.
- Hi.

134
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:55,840
You got one too.

135
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,802
Come here.

136
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:01,638
How many times
have I told you girls...?

137
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:07,394
Grams, we can explain.

138
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:09,187
Warlocks, begone.

139
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:15,777
Oh, God, let's go.

140
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:18,488
Grams definitely
had her power down.

141
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:21,157
She is one scary witch.

142
00:10:21,324 --> 00:10:24,410
I don't remember having
powers at that age, do you?

143
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:28,373
No, I thought that we got them
for the first time last year.

144
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:31,709
Apparently not.
We must have lost them

145
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:34,921
before we could even
remember having them.

146
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:39,467
Yeah, how weird was that,
seeing us as kids? Totally bizarre.

147
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:41,678
Mom is barely pregnant with me.

148
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:45,723
March 24th, 1975.

149
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:48,226
That's the day that Mom
made the pact with Nicholas.

150
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:51,771
So maybe that's why the spell
sent us back here, to stop the pact.

151
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:54,857
Which means it could be the only
way for us to get back to our time.

152
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:57,652
We've gotta go see Mom
and warn her about Nicholas.

153
00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:00,822
Yeah, but we have to do a better job
of convincing Mom than we did Grams.

154
00:11:00,988 --> 00:11:02,490
This time we have to
use our powers.

155
00:11:02,657 --> 00:11:05,201
The problem is she's on
the lookout for three warlocks now.

156
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:11,123
So then maybe only two of us
should approach her, just in case.

157
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:13,626
Well, since I don't
have any powers to show Mom,

158
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:15,002
I think it should be you two.

159
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:18,673
And I'll just stand outside
and watch for Nicholas.

160
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:22,259
That doesn't seem fair to you,
Phoebe, not being able to see Mom.

161
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:26,472
I know, it's not. But I got
over that a long time ago.

162
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,933
I don't need to see her now.

163
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,813
Really, it's okay.

164
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,818
We better get going, though,
before we miss her.

165
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:58,128
Scary.

166
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:01,131
Buddy's has not changed a bit.

167
00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:02,716
Wouldn't?

168
00:12:02,883 --> 00:12:04,677
Didn't?

169
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,096
Give it up, I know what you mean.

170
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:09,598
I don't see Mom anywhere, do you?

171
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:11,642
No.

172
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:14,728
Prue.

173
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:20,609
Mom.

174
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,503
She's so beautiful.

175
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:42,798
Yeah, she is.

176
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:51,890
I don't remember her working here.

177
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:55,393
Well, yeah. I mean, with Dad gone,
she had to pay the bills somehow.

178
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,189
I remember she used
to come home late at night

179
00:12:59,356 --> 00:13:02,192
and she would kiss me and she
always smelled like burgers.

180
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,031
You're lucky, you have
a lot more memories than I do.

181
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:11,534
Well, at least you have some.

182
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,162
I mean, poor Phoebe,
she doesn't have any.

183
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:23,046
Here she comes.

184
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:26,049
What do we do
if she recognizes us?

185
00:13:26,216 --> 00:13:30,887
You freeze the place, and when
she sees that we don't freeze either,

186
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:33,598
then she'll believe us
when we tell her who we are.

187
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:37,435
- Okay. How do I look?
- Great.

188
00:13:37,894 --> 00:13:39,187
Ready to order?

189
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:48,488
Take your time, I'll come back.

190
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:51,741
No, wait! We're ready,
aren't we, Prue?

191
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:53,576
Prunes.

192
00:13:55,745 --> 00:14:00,249
Prunes. She wants to know
if you have any prunes.

193
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,752
Prunes? Sure.

194
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,296
Yeah, I think so.
I just started here.

195
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:07,757
- I'll go check.
- No.

196
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:10,426
She can order something else.

197
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:16,224
Have we met before?
You look familiar.

198
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:18,517
Yeah, so do you.

199
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:22,688
Now.

200
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:31,280
- What's the matter?
- It's not working.

201
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:32,865
You try.

202
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:38,746
Okay, how is that possible?

203
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:42,583
- Patty, phone.
- Okay, thanks.

204
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:46,045
I'll be back.

205
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:50,424
Wait. We know you're pregnant.

206
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,012
What?

207
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,850
This is gonna sound really weird,
but we're actually your...

208
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:01,769
Cousins...

209
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:05,064
...from out of town.
- Right, cousins.

210
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,442
And we... We need to tell you
something really important

211
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:12,363
about the baby
that you're carrying, sort of.

212
00:15:13,822 --> 00:15:17,493
Not that this is any of your business,
but I can't get pregnant anymore.

213
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,871
Medically impossible.

214
00:15:21,747 --> 00:15:24,124
Excuse me.

215
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,377
I panicked.
I thought, you know,

216
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:30,047
close family would know
that she's pregnant.

217
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:31,882
Yeah, well,

218
00:15:32,424 --> 00:15:34,551
not only does she not know
that she's pregnant,

219
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:37,012
but she doesn't even think
that she can get pregnant.

220
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,347
But we got bigger problems.

221
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:41,600
We have no powers, which means
we have no way of stopping Nicholas.

222
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,143
Yeah, how do we not have powers?

223
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,937
I mean, little Prue and little Piper,
they have powers.

224
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,482
I don't know,
maybe only one set of us

225
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,985
can have powers at the same time,
in the same time.

226
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:54,446
Thank you, Mr Spock.

227
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,158
I was working, that's why
I couldn't take your call.

228
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:01,369
<i>The premonition you had, did you see
what the warlocks look like?</i>

229
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,955
The warlocks?
No, I didn't see their faces. Why?

230
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:07,876
I'll tell you why: Because I saw them.
All three of them, here.

231
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:09,836
<i>And one of them
had a hold of Prudence.</i>

232
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,005
<i>- Are the girls okay?
- For now, thanks to me.</i>

233
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,299
I'm coming right home.

234
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:36,112
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, no. It's totally my fault.

235
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:38,156
So silly.

236
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:43,953
I'm such a klutz sometimes.

237
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,706
Really?

238
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,751
- So am I.
- Yeah?

239
00:16:50,293 --> 00:16:52,420
Yeah.

240
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,884
- Crackers?
- Upset stomach.

241
00:17:00,094 --> 00:17:03,097
You know, you shouldn't
be smoking these now.

242
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,893
It's bad for your upset stomach.

243
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:08,811
You're very sweet.

244
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:13,399
Thanks. I gotta go.

245
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,485
- So soon?
- Excuse me?

246
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:19,238
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, thanks, officer.

247
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:22,241
Oh, my God. Nicholas.

248
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:26,495
I'm late. Thanks again. Goodbye.

249
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,293
Excuse me,

250
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,254
- how do you get to Berkeley?
- Get out of my way.

251
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,479
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Nicholas is here.

252
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:53,022
What? Where?

253
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:54,773
Run.

254
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,879
- Was Nicholas wearing his ring?
- I don't know. I don't think so.

255
00:18:17,046 --> 00:18:18,547
Good thing you were there, Pheebs.

256
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:21,300
That was probably when Nicholas
was gonna make his move on Mom.

257
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,303
No, I don't think so. Otherwise,
we'd be back in our own time by now.

258
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,556
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

259
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:31,560
It's just, seeing Mom
for the first time and talking to her,

260
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:33,937
I just didn't expect to feel so...

261
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:36,106
Feel what? Good?

262
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:37,983
No.

263
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,193
Overwhelmed.

264
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:43,739
Well, Mom's car is here.
At least we know where she is.

265
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:47,200
Question is, how do we get to her?
Grams must've told her about us.

266
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:49,536
She probably thinks
that we're the warlocks.

267
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:52,581
Our only option is to wait
for Nicholas to show.

268
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:55,000
But what are we gonna do
without our powers?

269
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,961
Well, technically
you still have your powers.

270
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:01,089
If you count
little Prue and little Piper.

271
00:19:03,884 --> 00:19:06,511
We need powers,
and they have them.

272
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,221
Come on.

273
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,894
Coast is clear.

274
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,604
What if Grams catches us?

275
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,856
She'll kill us before Nicholas
has the chance.

276
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,109
She won't catch us. Observe.

277
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:25,322
You said yourself the girls are safe
with you. Besides, I want to go.

278
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:30,076
You are making a big mistake, Patty.
Victor is not coming back.

279
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:32,287
- How did you...?
- Heating duct to upstairs.

280
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:34,080
I used to listen
to you guys for hours.

281
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:38,126
Especially when you used to sneak
Andy to your bedroom in high school.

282
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:41,087
Okay, you stay here
and keep tabs on them.

283
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:43,798
We're gonna try
and go find the little girls.

284
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:49,512
- That's my doll.
- You gave it to me.

285
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,348
- No, I didn't, you stole it.
- It's true, you did steal it.

286
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:54,642
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

287
00:19:56,102 --> 00:19:58,271
Hey, that's not fair.

288
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:02,233
You came back.

289
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,698
Yes, we did. And we're
gonna keep it a secret, right?

290
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,159
- Okay.
- Okay.

291
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:15,288
- You're pretty.
- Oh, so are you.

292
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:17,665
Give me a break.

293
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,209
Grams said you're bad people.

294
00:20:20,668 --> 00:20:22,128
No, no, no. We're good people.

295
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:25,006
We're just like you.

296
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:27,592
Yeah, we're family.

297
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:33,347
Victor sent me a note, asked me
to stop by his hotel after my shift.

298
00:20:33,514 --> 00:20:36,309
- Dad?
- It was doomed from the start.

299
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:38,936
You never even took his last name.

300
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:42,732
- You wouldn't let me.
- Well, that's beside the point.

301
00:20:42,898 --> 00:20:44,859
Why can't you just
wear your uniform to see him?

302
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,486
Because I don't want him
to know I'm a waitress.

303
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,241
Look, it can't hurt to talk, right?

304
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:54,493
Well, let him go, I say.

305
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:56,495
If husbands were
supposed to stay married,

306
00:20:56,662 --> 00:20:59,165
God would've made them live longer.

307
00:20:59,331 --> 00:21:02,376
- Mother.
- What?

308
00:21:02,543 --> 00:21:04,003
Grams.

309
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:07,172
We're not supposed
to go places with strangers.

310
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:10,467
Yes, but we're not strangers, Prue.

311
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:13,137
You're safe with us. And I know
that you know in your heart

312
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:17,224
- that you can trust us.
- If you're really family, prove it.

313
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:19,977
Prove it? How the hell
are we supposed to do that?

314
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:21,311
Piper.

315
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,646
Piper?

316
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:24,940
Your name's Piper too?

317
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:27,901
Yeah.

318
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,071
And not only do we have
the same name,

319
00:21:31,238 --> 00:21:36,451
but we have the same secrets.

320
00:21:37,202 --> 00:21:39,288
Okay, follow me. Come on.

321
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:43,917
- Freeze!
- No, wait...

322
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:47,671
I'm telling Mom. You're not
supposed to freeze people.

323
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:49,172
But he said to.

324
00:21:50,465 --> 00:21:52,759
Prue, Piper, Mom's coming down.

325
00:21:54,803 --> 00:21:57,597
Fine, if you must go, go.
I can't stop you.

326
00:21:57,764 --> 00:22:00,017
I also can't promise I won't
teach the girls a new spell

327
00:22:00,183 --> 00:22:01,977
while you're gone.

328
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:06,356
Can't you just bake cookies with them,
like all the other grandmothers?

329
00:22:06,523 --> 00:22:11,403
The recipes they learn from me
don't come from Betty Crocker, dear.

330
00:22:11,987 --> 00:22:13,613
Bye, girls. Love you.

331
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,454
- Where did you come from?
- Yeah, that's a good question.

332
00:22:21,663 --> 00:22:23,540
Don't ask. Okay, we gotta go fast.

333
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:26,209
- Mom just left and Grams is...
- Prudence? Piper?

334
00:22:26,418 --> 00:22:28,461
Coming.

335
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:35,343
- I wanna go too.
- No, Andy, you have to stay here.

336
00:22:35,552 --> 00:22:37,512
- No!
- Okay, we got it, we got it.

337
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,807
- Little Andy Trudeau is so cute.
- All right, ready?

338
00:22:41,975 --> 00:22:44,185
Freeze him.

339
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:47,605
Okay, cool. Come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

340
00:22:47,772 --> 00:22:51,317
Okay, maybe that's why
Andy's so suspicious of us.

341
00:22:51,484 --> 00:22:56,656
Okay, Grams keeps the keys
in the same spot? Yes, good.

342
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:05,206
Oh, Andy, did Piper
freeze you again?

343
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:09,210
You poor dear.
You won't remember a thing.

344
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:14,173
- Do you know where the girls went?
- I think the strange ladies took them.

345
00:23:30,147 --> 00:23:33,943
Okay, girls. When we see
a bad guy, what do we do?

346
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,489
- She's gonna cry.
- Am not. I'm gonna freeze him.

347
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:42,994
And then I'm going to move him.

348
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:46,163
Okay, then we'll take care
of him and then we will all...

349
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:48,541
- Run like the wind.
- Run like the wind.

350
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,668
Exactly. All right,
let's give it a try. Ready?

351
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:52,044
Yes.

352
00:23:57,633 --> 00:23:59,510
Can we do it again?

353
00:23:59,677 --> 00:24:03,013
Yes, yes.
Practice makes perfect. Okay.

354
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,932
Go try it.

355
00:24:06,684 --> 00:24:08,978
These girls have major juice.

356
00:24:09,603 --> 00:24:11,939
They have control, they can aim.

357
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:15,526
Yeah, well, they've had their powers
a lot longer than we have.

358
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:17,736
I mean, did. I think.

359
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,657
What do you think happened
to our powers when we were kids?

360
00:24:21,865 --> 00:24:24,118
Well, we lost a lot growing up.

361
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:26,704
Somehow, we must have
lost them too.

362
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:29,707
Okay, I finally found a payphone.

363
00:24:29,873 --> 00:24:32,751
Mom is at work until 5
and Nicholas is on duty till 6.

364
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:36,046
Good, at least we know where he is.
The girls are ready.

365
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:37,631
Well, I'm not.

366
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,842
Why not?

367
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:44,429
Mom died before I could grab onto
enough to keep her alive in my head.

368
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:50,644
And now she's here alive,
pregnant with me.

369
00:24:51,687 --> 00:24:55,315
If we stop Nicholas, we have
to go back to our own time.

370
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,443
And there's no Mom there.

371
00:24:58,652 --> 00:25:00,487
Well, we don't
have a choice, Phoebe.

372
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:09,746
Ladies, is this your car?

373
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:26,846
Come in.

374
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:30,141
Victor?

375
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,605
Get off me!

376
00:25:37,357 --> 00:25:41,569
Wouldn't have you freezing me, Patty.
That would ruin everything.

377
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:46,032
- You.
- Call me Nicholas.

378
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:48,493
- Where's Victor?
- Not here.

379
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,329
Bait for the hook.

380
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,252
Your blood is boiling.

381
00:25:57,418 --> 00:26:00,171
And then, death will come.

382
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:06,803
What do you want?

383
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:10,974
What does any warlock want?
I want your power, Patty.

384
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:12,934
At least, that's what I wanted at first.

385
00:26:13,393 --> 00:26:17,397
Until I realized you're
the mother of the Charmed Ones.

386
00:26:17,605 --> 00:26:20,400
No. No, you're mistaken.

387
00:26:20,566 --> 00:26:24,362
- I only have two children.
- Oh, but there will be a third child.

388
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:27,031
Where did that premonition
of yours come from, Patty,

389
00:26:27,198 --> 00:26:31,119
if not from the unborn
child inside you?

390
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:32,995
I tapped your phone.

391
00:26:33,746 --> 00:26:37,583
I heard you and the old witch
talking about it.

392
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:41,295
I saw three warlocks. Women.

393
00:26:41,504 --> 00:26:44,257
I saw them too, at the diner.

394
00:26:45,174 --> 00:26:47,551
Rivals, perhaps.

395
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:55,017
I got to you first.

396
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:13,369
Oh, please.

397
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:16,080
I beg you.

398
00:27:16,872 --> 00:27:18,457
Don't hurt them.

399
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:22,628
There is another option, Patty.

400
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:30,094
I can't believe we got arrested
for kidnapping ourselves.

401
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,555
Yeah, well, it should make
for a pretty interesting defence.

402
00:27:33,764 --> 00:27:34,807
You think this is funny?

403
00:27:34,973 --> 00:27:37,434
Prue, we're not just stuck in jail,
we're stuck in the past.

404
00:27:37,643 --> 00:27:39,853
Yes, I know, Piper,
I've been following.

405
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,024
- Bright side?
- I dare you.

406
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:46,944
Well, maybe we can
get to know Mom better.

407
00:27:47,152 --> 00:27:49,696
Or in my case, finally.

408
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:51,406
I mean, if we really are stuck here,

409
00:27:51,573 --> 00:27:54,201
we might as well
take advantage of it, right?

410
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:57,412
Maybe we can even keep her
from dying young this time.

411
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:00,999
Five minutes, ma'am.

412
00:28:05,963 --> 00:28:08,632
How did you know I was pregnant?

413
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:11,760
Who are you people?

414
00:28:13,095 --> 00:28:14,846
Your daughters.

415
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:29,069
Okay, I bailed you out.
You just better not be warlocks.

416
00:28:29,277 --> 00:28:32,906
Well, we wouldn't have needed
you to bail us out if we were.

417
00:28:33,949 --> 00:28:38,995
I've seen some magic in my life,
but this is a miracle.

418
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:41,331
More than you know, Mom.

419
00:28:41,498 --> 00:28:43,792
Where are the little ones?

420
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,210
Home with Grams.

421
00:28:45,377 --> 00:28:48,254
I called her before I came. That's how
I found out you'd been arrested.

422
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:50,131
Did you tell her about us?

423
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:53,676
No. I didn't know what to say.

424
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:55,929
I didn't know who you were myself.

425
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:03,228
You're all so beautiful.

426
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,815
More than I ever would've imagined.

427
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,735
Phoebe.

428
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:17,909
Phoebe.

429
00:29:18,868 --> 00:29:21,329
Talk about miracles.

430
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,291
I must've named you
after my favourite aunt.

431
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:28,127
But if you don't like the name,
I can always change it.

432
00:29:28,294 --> 00:29:29,837
No, I love it.

433
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:35,802
Mom,

434
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:39,138
we cast a spell to come
back in time to help you.

435
00:29:39,305 --> 00:29:41,974
- To stop you.
- To stop me from what?

436
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:45,561
From making a pact
with a warlock named Nicholas.

437
00:29:46,187 --> 00:29:48,189
Then you're too late.

438
00:29:48,397 --> 00:29:49,857
What?

439
00:29:50,608 --> 00:29:54,570
I thought I was going
to see Victor, your father.

440
00:29:54,737 --> 00:29:56,447
But it turned out to be a trap.

441
00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:58,407
Nicholas.

442
00:29:58,574 --> 00:30:00,785
He tried to kill me.

443
00:30:00,993 --> 00:30:02,787
Phoebe too.

444
00:30:02,995 --> 00:30:07,249
I had to give him immunity to your
powers in exchange for your lives.

445
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:13,506
I'd rather love you
as mortal daughters...

446
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,967
...than have to mourn you
as dead witches.

447
00:30:17,134 --> 00:30:19,386
But he's gonna kill us
anyway to get our powers.

448
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,683
No, not until Phoebe's born
and all your powers are complete.

449
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:28,604
I bought us some time in the hopes
that Grams could help us.

450
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:33,525
Oh, she's going to be
so thrilled when she sees you.

451
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:36,695
The Charmed Ones.

452
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:54,379
- Where was I born?
- Mom.

453
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:57,424
I'm still not convinced
that they're not warlocks.

454
00:30:57,633 --> 00:31:00,260
We have a pact to undo.
We should be looking for a spell.

455
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:01,887
Boston.

456
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,098
In a hotel room, breech.

457
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,018
What was my husband's name?

458
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:10,437
Which husband?

459
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,524
- Who's Melinda Warren?
- The beginning of our family line.

460
00:31:14,691 --> 00:31:16,902
She gave us our powers,
our destiny.

461
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:20,113
What's the secret ingredient
in my blueberry cobbler?

462
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,782
Honey and a splash of rum.

463
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:24,576
What's IBM selling at in your time?

464
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:27,287
- Mom.
- What?

465
00:31:27,496 --> 00:31:30,832
- This is not the time for personal gain.
- You're right.

466
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:34,127
If they could just nod their heads.

467
00:31:34,336 --> 00:31:36,421
Okay, forget it.

468
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:40,759
Well, look at you.
The three of you.

469
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:46,973
Oh, Patty. I always knew that
I would deliver the Charmed Ones.

470
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,268
Once removed, of course.

471
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,980
Prue.

472
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:56,399
Piper.

473
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:58,068
- And...
- Phoebe.

474
00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:00,445
Oh, another P.

475
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:02,989
- What a surprise.
- About the pact.

476
00:32:03,364 --> 00:32:06,493
We must keep the girls safe
until we can reverse it.

477
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:10,497
- I'll have to bind their powers.
- Bind our powers?

478
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:13,082
Strip them from the young ones

479
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:17,670
so Nicholas can't get ahold of them.
It doesn't have to be done right away.

480
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:22,008
As soon as Phoebe's born,
I'll cast a spell and suspend their...

481
00:32:22,175 --> 00:32:23,968
Your powers.

482
00:32:24,636 --> 00:32:27,305
Yeah, but that's exactly
what you did.

483
00:32:27,722 --> 00:32:29,599
Or, do.

484
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:32,018
- Will do. You know what I mean.
- That explains

485
00:32:32,185 --> 00:32:34,687
why we don't remember having
our powers when we were younger.

486
00:32:34,896 --> 00:32:35,938
What do you mean?

487
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:39,150
Well, how old were you
when you got your powers back?

488
00:32:40,318 --> 00:32:43,279
- We just got them.
- What?

489
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:48,534
I unbound your powers
without having broken the pact?

490
00:32:48,743 --> 00:32:50,036
Why would I do that?

491
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:53,539
I mean, unless I died, which,
of course, would automatically...

492
00:32:57,752 --> 00:32:59,211
Unbind your powers.

493
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:16,645
Guess I'm not going to make it
to the next millennium, huh?

494
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:22,735
- Speaking of that, Mom...
- No.

495
00:33:22,943 --> 00:33:24,695
We mustn't know about the future.

496
00:33:24,904 --> 00:33:28,115
You came back here
for one reason, to break the pact.

497
00:33:28,282 --> 00:33:31,285
You mustn't tamper with
anything else. It's much too risky.

498
00:33:31,452 --> 00:33:34,204
Heaven knows what damage
you've done by coming back here.

499
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:38,042
We haven't done anything. We
missed our chance to stop the pact.

500
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,127
And there's a reason for that.

501
00:33:40,294 --> 00:33:42,880
Destiny always gets its own way.

502
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:46,216
It's not as easy to change
the past as you might think.

503
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:50,721
And if you do it incorrectly,
everything will change.

504
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:55,559
The evil that you vanquished,
the good that you've done,

505
00:33:55,726 --> 00:33:57,227
none of it may have ever happened.

506
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:00,772
Well, we have to change this. We can't
go back and just let him kill us.

507
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:02,983
The only way to vanquish him
in your time

508
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,861
would be for me to unbless the ring
and take away its immunity.

509
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:07,738
It's in a drawer in his hotel room.

510
00:34:07,905 --> 00:34:11,116
Okay, let's go to Nicholas'
hotel room and steal back the ring.

511
00:34:11,325 --> 00:34:13,660
- Hopefully it'll be there.
- It's too dangerous.

512
00:34:13,827 --> 00:34:15,370
You don't have powers.

513
00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:17,456
- I'll go.
- No.

514
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:20,667
If something happened to you, future
history could be changed forever,

515
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:22,961
just like Grams said. We have to go.

516
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,256
Well, I'm glad to see that you
finally learned to listen to me.

517
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:30,552
You better hurry. In the meantime,
I'll write a new spell

518
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,762
that will get you back
to your own time.

519
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:35,891
Wait, you can... You can do that?
You can send us home?

520
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:39,978
We're witches, dear.
We can do anything.

521
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:43,982
I wish that were true.

522
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,820
Okay, we need to go.

523
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,157
Be careful.

524
00:34:58,121 --> 00:35:01,124
Why am I not surprised
that you know how to do this?

525
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:03,668
Let's just hope Nicholas isn't inside.

526
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:07,839
The concierge says he's not,
and Piper's out front watching for him.

527
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,932
Mom said it's in a drawer.

528
00:35:19,642 --> 00:35:21,144
Found it.

529
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,354
Oh, okay.

530
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:28,943
Okay.

531
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,321
We gotta get it back to Mom.

532
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:37,577
We have the ring. Here it is.

533
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:41,497
- Okay, now what?
- Go back to where you belong.

534
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,834
I'll unbless the ring and get it back
before Nicholas finds it missing.

535
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:47,044
Now, remember,
there is no time to lose.

536
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:50,256
You will return at the exact moment
you left. Nicholas will be there.

537
00:35:52,842 --> 00:35:54,510
Hopefully without immunity
to our powers.

538
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,721
We'll be ready. Phoebe?

539
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,306
Okay, I'm coming.

540
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,852
I love you, Mom.

541
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,066
I'm never gonna learn
to like lima beans, Grams,

542
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:12,028
but thanks for everything else.

543
00:36:17,992 --> 00:36:20,161
You're going to be
a handful, aren't you?

544
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:22,621
You'll learn to love me.

545
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:26,041
Bye, Phoebe.

546
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,836
I'm gonna miss you.

547
00:36:40,514 --> 00:36:45,102
<i>A time for everything
And to everything its place</i>

548
00:36:45,311 --> 00:36:50,107
<i>Return what has been moved
through time and space</i>

549
00:36:56,363 --> 00:36:58,115
Let me help.

550
00:36:58,323 --> 00:37:02,828
<i>A time for everything
And to everything its place</i>

551
00:37:02,995 --> 00:37:07,624
<i>Return what has been moved
through time and space</i>

552
00:37:15,591 --> 00:37:17,759
You did well, Patty.

553
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:21,138
Oh, they're fabulous.

554
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,057
I just hope they're safe.

555
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:37,821
- What happened?
- Where did you go?

556
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:40,157
We didn't go anywhere.
We were just standing here,

557
00:37:40,323 --> 00:37:42,784
- and the next thing we knew...
- We were just standing here.

558
00:37:42,993 --> 00:37:44,870
I told you to use poplar buds.

559
00:37:45,036 --> 00:37:48,957
It's a perfectly good spell.
I mean, it moved them through time.

560
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:50,292
Yeah, ten seconds.

561
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:53,128
It's not the spell. Must be
the power behind the spell.

562
00:37:53,295 --> 00:37:57,132
- There's not enough power.
- Maybe we need the power of three.

563
00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:00,927
The only problem is
it doesn't exist yet.

564
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:13,398
Nothing.

565
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:15,525
Maybe this is our destiny.

566
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:18,069
Not for the Charmed Ones.

567
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:20,321
We don't exist yet.

568
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:24,158
- Yes. Yes, you do.
- No, not with powers.

569
00:38:24,617 --> 00:38:27,662
Yes, little Prue and Piper
have their powers.

570
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:30,373
And Phoebe gave me a premonition,
so she must have hers.

571
00:38:30,957 --> 00:38:32,959
If we can teach the girls the chant,

572
00:38:33,126 --> 00:38:35,628
maybe the three of us
can get you back to your time.

573
00:38:35,795 --> 00:38:37,922
The power of three. It's worth a try.

574
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:41,426
Where are you witches?
Where's my ring?

575
00:38:41,676 --> 00:38:44,137
- Nicholas.
- You and Piper get the girls.

576
00:38:44,303 --> 00:38:46,097
We'll fend him off.

577
00:38:51,227 --> 00:38:53,271
Come on, Phoebe.

578
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:01,821
Oh, Grandma,
don't get too close, his power.

579
00:39:01,988 --> 00:39:04,323
- I know, I know.
- We can't risk you being hurt.

580
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,950
Go help Mom start the spell.

581
00:39:06,117 --> 00:39:08,744
Phoebe and I will
take care of him. Come on.

582
00:39:19,255 --> 00:39:22,216
We're gonna play a little game, okay?
Now, give me your hands.

583
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:24,468
- Okay, hurry.
- Now, repeat after me.

584
00:39:24,718 --> 00:39:29,056
<i>A time for everything
And to everything its place</i>

585
00:39:29,265 --> 00:39:34,603
<i>A time for everything
And to everything its place</i>

586
00:39:34,812 --> 00:39:38,524
<i>Return what has been moved
through time and space</i>

587
00:39:38,691 --> 00:39:43,904
<i>Return what has been moved
through time and space</i>

588
00:39:51,704 --> 00:39:56,125
<i>A time for everything
And to everything its place</i>

589
00:39:56,291 --> 00:40:00,045
<i>Return what has been moved
through time and space</i>

590
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:03,590
- All right, we don't have much time.
- What about his ring?

591
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:06,176
Don't worry about the ring now.
Let's just get you back.

592
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:08,011
Well, but it is unblessed, right?

593
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,430
Yes, but there wasn't time to test it.

594
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,268
- Then how will we know if it works?
- You won't. Not until you get back.

595
00:40:14,476 --> 00:40:18,814
And since time will pick up right
where it left off, he won't know either.

596
00:40:20,524 --> 00:40:23,443
Goodbye, girls. Be good, darlings.

597
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:36,498
<i>A time for everything
And to everything its place</i>

598
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:40,794
<i>Return what has been moved
through time and space</i>

599
00:40:48,718 --> 00:40:50,971
It worked. We're back.

600
00:40:52,055 --> 00:40:53,682
Hurry.

601
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:02,190
Time's up.

602
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,324
All right, the ring's unblessed.

603
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:21,167
- Phoebe, find anything?
- The Nicholas Must Die spell.

604
00:41:21,376 --> 00:41:24,295
- That wasn't there before.
- Maybe it's Grams' way of saying

605
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:25,755
welcome back, or front.

606
00:41:25,964 --> 00:41:29,008
"Spell pouch included
at no extra charge."

607
00:41:29,175 --> 00:41:31,970
<i>Okay, okay.
Lavender, mimosa</i>

608
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:33,429
<i>- Holy thistle
- Oh, dear.</i>

609
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:37,809
<i>Cleanse this evil from our midst
Scatter its cells throughout time</i>

610
00:41:37,976 --> 00:41:40,603
<i>Let this Nick no more exist</i>

611
00:42:01,457 --> 00:42:04,836
I'm really glad I never
got on Grams' bad side.

612
00:42:05,795 --> 00:42:07,088
Right.

613
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:13,386
I can't stop thinking about Mom.

614
00:42:13,552 --> 00:42:16,764
How I lost her and then
I found her again.

615
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:20,142
I'm just glad that you
finally have memories of her.

616
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:21,602
What?

617
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:24,480
I'm supposed to throw out flowers
because they came from a creep?

618
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:27,775
If that was the rule, we'd never
have flowers in this house.

619
00:42:27,942 --> 00:42:29,819
Well, but they didn't
just come from a creep.

620
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:32,613
They came from a warlock
who tried to kill us.

621
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,283
Still, if it weren't for him, I probably
would've never gotten to know Mom.

622
00:42:36,617 --> 00:42:38,369
We all wanted
to save Mom, Pheebs,

623
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:41,664
but both Mom and Grams
said we can't change destiny.

624
00:42:41,831 --> 00:42:47,419
I know, but I still wrote
her a note anyway.

625
00:42:47,628 --> 00:42:49,797
- You did?
- Yes, I wrote her a note

626
00:42:49,964 --> 00:42:53,133
telling her to stay away from water
on the day that she died.

627
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,469
<i>And then I put it in
the Book of Shadows.</i>

628
00:42:55,678 --> 00:42:58,972
- I can't believe you did that.
- You don't understand.

629
00:42:59,139 --> 00:43:02,768
Every time I've made a wish,
I've wished for time with Mom.

630
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,064
And I believed in my heart
that someday,

631
00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:10,359
somehow,
that wish would come true.

632
00:43:10,526 --> 00:43:15,531
And when it finally did,
I didn't wanna let her go.

633
00:43:17,741 --> 00:43:20,869
You know, but then I realized
that I had to let her go.

634
00:43:23,914 --> 00:43:26,333
So I took the note out
and I put it in my pocket.

635
00:43:29,086 --> 00:43:31,922
Maturity sucks, doesn't it?

636
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:38,679
But still, faith has its rewards.

637
00:43:41,014 --> 00:43:43,725
It's a pretty good one of us,
but once again,

638
00:43:43,892 --> 00:43:45,394
not a great one of you, Pheebs.

639
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,437
Are you kidding?

640
00:43:47,604 --> 00:43:50,857
That is the best picture
of me I've ever taken.
