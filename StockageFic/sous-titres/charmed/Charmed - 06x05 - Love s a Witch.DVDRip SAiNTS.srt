1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,467
Mail clerk at Dutton & Howser,
greeter at Yarn Mart,

2
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,304
pre-school assistant.
How are you at diapers?

3
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,807
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,061
No? Well, let's see, how about this?

5
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,396
Bagger at Grocery Plus.

6
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:26,485
Cashier at Lucy's Landscaping.

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,447
Computer programmer...
I don't think so.

8
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,117
Listen, I was just curious.

9
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:38,163
Why have all the temp jobs you've
sent me out on been so unusual?

10
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,624
Unusual? What's unusual
about a fruit packer?

11
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,585
Okay, maybe it's not the job.

12
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,296
It's kind of what happens to me
after I get there.

13
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,341
Things just kind of go little wonky.

14
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:52,261
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

15
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,805
- No.
- No.

16
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,890
No. Okay, maybe it's just
a coincidence.

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,142
Although I don't believe
in coincidences.

18
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,563
Okay, look, here's the thing.
I'm not picky.

19
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:09,653
I'll take anything as long as it's really,
really normal.

20
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,864
Oh, you want normal.

21
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,076
I've got the perfect thing for you.

22
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,670
This is not what I had in mind.

23
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,218
Wasn't someone supposed
to call a trump?

24
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,221
Oh, yes, right. Trump.

25
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,848
I was just waiting for you.

26
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,559
Oh, I see.

27
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,605
Still can't believe you know
how to play pinochle.

28
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,649
Not a lot of young people
do anymore, you know.

29
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,110
I used to play with my grandma
all the time.

30
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,697
- Really? Lucky me.
- No, actually, lucky me.

31
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:57,743
Babysitting a sick old lady?
How is that lucky for you?

32
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,245
Well?

33
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,540
Well, I think it's time
for your medicine.

34
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,960
Watch out!

35
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,133
Mother? What, are you okay?

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,512
I'm okay, the sons of bitches
missed me.

37
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,680
Really, I'm okay.

38
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,850
So much for normal.

39
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,832
Piper, do you mind?

40
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,210
I'm trying to meditate,
if you haven't noticed.

41
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,755
- Can't you block out the noise?
- The vacuum cleaner I can block out,

42
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,508
- your nerves I can't.
- My nerves?

43
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:19,801
Oh, for God's sakes, woman.

44
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,095
I'm sorry, you're anxious,
I'm anxious.

45
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,389
But it's my first date, it's not yours.

46
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,142
Unfortunately, it feels as though
it's my first date.

47
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,477
Can't you control it?

48
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,271
What do you think I'm doing,
cleaning the chandelier?

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,981
Now that would be helpful.

50
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,237
Talk about your psychic hit.

51
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,948
Hi, how's it going? Don't ask.

52
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,450
Are you hurt? What happened?

53
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,118
It's nothing, I'm fine.

54
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,371
You're not fine, Paige,
you're scared to death.

55
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,665
Why don't people in this family
own their emotions?

56
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,251
Okay, this empath thing?
Very annoying.

57
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,836
Copy that. Hey.

58
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,840
You haven't seen Leo, have you?

59
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,133
Oh, Chris, not now.

60
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,138
- Paige?
- It's nothing, I'm fine.

61
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,267
It doesn't look like nothing to me.
Was that an energy ball?

62
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,562
I don't know, I was playing pinochle,
I didn't see.

63
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,399
I'm temping. Grandma, she's got
some dark secrets, let me tell you.

64
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,193
- Another temp job involving magic?
- Yeah, right,

65
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,611
I'm never gonna get away.

66
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,446
But you want to.

67
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,157
Sorry.

68
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,452
- Do you want me to get the Book?
- No, actually, I don't.

69
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,789
I wanna follow this one through
all by myself.

70
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,459
She's feeling a little suppressed
by us.

71
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,795
You are?

72
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:40,507
You know, what I was talking about.
The temp job thing.

73
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,094
Why I'm trying to find my own path,
just separate from...

74
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,387
From us?

75
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,724
- I checked, no sign of...
- I should cancel my date.

76
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,184
What? Why?

77
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,768
Because we're having issues.

78
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,229
No, the issue is you're afraid
to date, Piper.

79
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,274
But you can't let your fears stop you.
You should.

80
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,568
Gee, I wonder why
I'm feeling suppressed.

81
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,362
Phoebe, this is ridiculous.
It's just getting worse.

82
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,864
I know.

83
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,950
So, what should I do?
Just keep all your feelings to myself?

84
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,660
Would that make you guys happy?

85
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,078
- Yeah.
- Yes.

86
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,581
Okay, then that's what I'll do.

87
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,586
Someone's hiding something
from me.

88
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,673
Just let me know if anyone
sees Leo, okay?

89
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,551
I gotta go back
and check on grandma.

90
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,595
Wait, you're going?
You're scared to death...

91
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,097
- Apple!
- I can't believe you'd still go...

92
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,271
Well, that's one way to do it.

93
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,490
All sold out, I'm afraid.

94
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,743
Good for me, bad for you.

95
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:53,580
- How long will it take to make more?
- The potion you desire

96
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,958
is pricey for a reason.

97
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:01,922
The main ingredient is quite rare
and hard to come by.

98
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,343
What secret are you
so eager to hide?

99
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,971
Just tell me how long.

100
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,058
Hard to say. Six weeks or a month.

101
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:17,145
Demonic suppliers
are notoriously unreliable.

102
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,439
I can't wait, all right? I need it now.

103
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,818
The impatience of youth.

104
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,781
Then again, it takes a young heart
to brave great danger.

105
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,783
Spare me the Morpheus speech,
old man.

106
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,952
What are you saying?

107
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:38,417
Swampland is where you'll find
the kotochu egg your potion requires.

108
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,131
Now you understand the difficulty.

109
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,633
Fine, I'll get you your damn egg.

110
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,428
Just make sure you're ready
by the time I get back.

111
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,747
Hi, it's me, Paige?

112
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,624
Paige, your home-helper?

113
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,167
Please buzz me in.

114
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,213
Look, I know you're there.

115
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,009
I am not gonna expose you,
I promise. I just wanna help.

116
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,346
Don't you think it's a little risky
coming back here?

117
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,308
Please buzz me in, Miss Callaway.

118
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,519
No, seriously.
In case you didn't notice,

119
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,480
there's kind of a war going on
between these two homes.

120
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,234
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

121
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,236
Don't you?

122
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,737
It's me!

123
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,948
Pinochle girl.

124
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:57,037
Hey. You're not the first, you know.
Others have come to try to help.

125
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,083
You should leave before you get hurt.

126
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,001
I'm sure I can handle it, thanks.

127
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,005
You're not a muse, that's for sure.

128
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,882
Or a whitelighter.

129
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,762
- You're a witch like us.
- How do you know that?

130
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:17,766
Ever since I was a kid,
one sort of magical being or another

131
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,768
has come to try to help end the feud.

132
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,480
Hasn't worked though.

133
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:27,109
I mean, this last truce
was the longest, but...

134
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,700
Okay, go:

135
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,995
Good. All right, take a look.

136
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,371
Yeah, okay.

137
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,457
Think newly-single mom,
not two-bit hooker.

138
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,876
Okay, we try again.

139
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,920
You're a little distracted.

140
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,131
I'm having a very hard time
concentrating.

141
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,465
I think this empath power

142
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,050
- is driving me crazy.
- You?

143
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:55,637
Well, you try having PMS
for three sisters every month.

144
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,974
It's a good thing no one in the family
is having sex, I'd be feeling that too.

145
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,935
Yeah, okay, so let's skip
the "vamp red."

146
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,479
You know, if I can't ignore
the bloating

147
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,857
and the cramping
and the mood swings,

148
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,611
how am I supposed to ignore the fact
that my sister is scared to death?

149
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,779
- Phoebe.
- All right, okay,

150
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,823
I'm just gonna
mind my own business.

151
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,201
All we have to do is respect
what Paige wants.

152
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,995
And clearly what she wants
is not our help.

153
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:23,332
She thinks that's what she wants,
but I know what she really wants.

154
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,167
What she really wants is our help.

155
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,336
- That's it, I'm staying home.
- What? Why?

156
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,087
To make sure you leave Paige alone.

157
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,007
No, Piper, no. You have to go out.

158
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:35,594
You need to go out.
And this is not me channelling.

159
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,679
This is just me talking.

160
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,141
Trust me. The sooner you get back on
the dating horse, the easier it will be.

161
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,810
No, I know. You're right,
you're absolutely right.

162
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,771
The truth is, I'm a little scared.

163
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,774
I mean, I was married to an angel,
for crying out loud.

164
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,609
Who is gonna compare to that?

165
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,695
But, Piper, you also dated a demon,
a warlock and a ghost.

166
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,656
That's what you should be scared of.

167
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,616
Super pep talk, sis.

168
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,828
You look beautiful.

169
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,918
- Hey.
- Hi.

170
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,379
Wow, you look great.

171
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,965
I'm not surprised, it's just that
you normally...

172
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,634
Oh, yeah, no bottle, no binky.

173
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,135
Yeah, no spit up.

174
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,971
Yeah.

175
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,431
So you ready? Wanna go?

176
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,229
He likes you, I can tell.

177
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,775
One second.

178
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,027
Leave Paige alone, I mean it.

179
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,571
I will. I will.

180
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,740
- Okay.
- Have fun, have fun.

181
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:43,245
I will leave Paige alone...
I can't. I can't. Chris!

182
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,038
Yeah?

183
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,583
I need you to watch Wyatt for me.

184
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,418
What? No, no way.

185
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,712
What's wrong?
Why are you worried?

186
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,673
What's wrong?
What's wrong is I don't do babies.

187
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,592
One-and-under crowd?
Not my thing.

188
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:00,721
Leo, however, great with kids.
Especially his own.

189
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,683
- You're not following me, are you?
- Why, should I be?

190
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,269
Oh, there's a lot of love in this room.

191
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:10,480
Okay, so there's a bottle in the fridge
if Wyatt wakes up

192
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,358
and the diaper rash cream
only if he needs it, okay?

193
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,403
We gotta keep that butt moist.

194
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,530
Did you get that?

195
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:21,909
Phoebe.
Phoebe, wait, wait, wait.

196
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,870
I can't do this right now,
I gotta follow up...

197
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,122
...on some things.

198
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,624
I have to check on Paige

199
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,668
- and make sure she's all right.
- Where's Piper?

200
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,462
Piper is...

201
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:35,881
She's kind of...

202
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:39,635
Piper's on a date.

203
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,977
I'm so sorry, you're hurting.

204
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,897
I'm here for you.
I just can't be here for you right now.

205
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,816
I'm gonna be in there for you,
though.

206
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,151
Checking on Paige.

207
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,371
Lead me back
From whence this came

208
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:10,457
Help me help my sister's pain

209
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:18,882
- I want her out of here, Richard.
- She wants the fighting to stop.

210
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,969
Yeah? How come the fighting
started the minute she showed up?

211
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,554
Probably just a coincidence.

212
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,515
I thought you didn't believe
in coincidences.

213
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,355
Hey.

214
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:37,359
- Here, drink that.
- What is it?

215
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,987
It's a family recipe,
make you feel better,

216
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,239
speed up the healing process.

217
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:46,285
I'm the one that shouldn't trust you,
remember? Drink up.

218
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,458
Are those potions?

219
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,212
Yeah, I told you, we're witches.

220
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,881
Good ones or bad ones?

221
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,799
What do you think?

222
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:04,553
I don't know, you did just try to fry
an 80-year-old with an energy ball.

223
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,931
That was the Callaways,
they made it look like it was us.

224
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,142
- It was a setup.
- Okay, so they're bad?

225
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,895
Well, no, they're not bad,
they're just bad to us.

226
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,483
See those scars?

227
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,819
Years ago, the Callaways
cast a plague on us.

228
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,822
Of course, in return,
we cursed them with boils.

229
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,366
Or was it the boils
and then the plague?

230
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:30,370
I can't remember. A feud this long,
you start to lose track, you know.

231
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,539
How come you don't have scars?

232
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:36,293
You can't curse people
that don't practice magic.

233
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,794
I don't do that anymore.

234
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,713
Why not?

235
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:46,678
Last time I did, it... It brought me
to a place I don't wanna go again.

236
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,935
That's Olivia, my fiancée.

237
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,604
Olivia Callaway.

238
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,482
Sleeping with the enemy.

239
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:02,778
She was actually killed
in the crossfire last year.

240
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,448
I'm... I'm really sorry.

241
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:09,660
It's all right, you didn't know.

242
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,746
She'd be more upset than anybody
that this truce ended.

243
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,707
She... She wanted peace.

244
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,794
Maybe that's why I'm here, to help.

245
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,404
- Boo.
- What?

246
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,408
Olivia?

247
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,660
- But you're a...
- A ghost?

248
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,163
Yeah. Sucks, too, believe me.

249
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,291
- What do you want?
- What you took from me:

250
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:01,170
My life, my love.

251
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:05,841
And one way or another,
I'm gonna get them both back.

252
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,594
Now, just wait a minute. Don't...

253
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,471
There's a Charmed One here.
She'll come after you.

254
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,141
I'm counting on it.

255
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,030
Oh, please, God, no.

256
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,574
Oh, my God.

257
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,680
I'll have the salmon
with fusilli and the eggplant.

258
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:57,684
And could you make sure they
use basil and not Italian parsley?

259
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:01,647
And could you ask them to sauté
the eggplant lightly?

260
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:05,234
And also grill the salmon
after the pasta is done?

261
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,195
That way it won't dry out.
Thank you.

262
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:11,907
- What?
- Nothing.

263
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:15,536
I just never dated an ex-chef before,
that's all.

264
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,162
Oh, was I being too picky?

265
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,622
No, no.

266
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:22,376
Yeah, I was. It's... I'm sorry,
I'm just a little...

267
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,086
Nervous.

268
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:26,463
- Is it that obvious?
- Nah, it's just...

269
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:29,383
It's my fault, this is not a very good
first-date place.

270
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,343
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

271
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,931
It's just, you know,
that I haven't dated in a while.

272
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,225
How long were you...
Were you married?

273
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,519
Two years,
but we were together four.

274
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:41,812
It gets easier.

275
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:44,857
I think I went on five,
six dates after my divorce

276
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:48,235
until finally I started feeling
comfortable dating people again.

277
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:52,322
Oh, so I guess you don't mind
being the guinea pig then.

278
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:54,533
Not at all.

279
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,958
If you don't mind me asking,
when's your divorce finalized?

280
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,334
My divorce?

281
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,044
You... You filed, right?

282
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:12,217
Not exactly. It's... It's kind of
a weird arrangement.

283
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:13,927
It's hard to explain, but...

284
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,721
Piper.

285
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,140
What...? What are you doing here?

286
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,683
Why are you covered in mud?

287
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,519
Excuse me a second.
Who is this?

288
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,855
Me? I'm from the future.

289
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,108
- What?
- Excuse us.

290
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:32,946
Are you crazy?

291
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,240
You're not serious
about that guy, are you?

292
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,745
You know what?
That is none of your business.

293
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,247
- Where have you been?
- That's none of your business.

294
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,791
You better get home
before your sisters kill each other.

295
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,670
What? Why, what happened?
Oh, no. Phoebe?

296
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,343
Paige, I said I'm sorry.
What more do you want from me?

297
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,094
Sorry doesn't begin to cover it.

298
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,514
I was worried about you.
I thought you were in trouble.

299
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,601
- Then why were you at the Callaways'?
- The spell was to take me to you.

300
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,062
How was I supposed to know
you were across the street?

301
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,940
You weren't supposed to know.
You weren't supposed to be involved.

302
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:11,985
It's a good thing I did get involved.
Obviously there's a war going on.

303
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,654
- I can handle it.
- Really?

304
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:19,576
- Hi! Hey, what is this about a war?
- Ask Miss Buttinsky over there.

305
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,204
She was with the Callaways
when they killed Richard's dad.

306
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:24,832
Paige, I'm telling you,
they didn't kill anyone.

307
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,751
- I was there.
- Yeah, so was I.

308
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,336
Can you guys keep it down?

309
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,797
- I just got Wyatt to sleep.
- What are you doing here?

310
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:36,760
Okay, in the living room,
in the living room. Let's go, let's go.

311
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,054
- Can I go now?
- No.

312
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:42,933
Paige, I'm telling you, the energy ball
did not come from the Callaways.

313
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,978
I saw it come through
the Callaways' window.

314
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,273
- It couldn't have.
- Oh, she's taking sides.

315
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,025
Paige, it's not only what I saw,
but it's what I felt.

316
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,278
Don't you think if they
just tried to kill someone,

317
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,281
I would've felt some intense anger
coming from them? But I didn't.

318
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,659
I don't know. Are you sensing any
intense anger coming at you right now?

319
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:04,997
No, but what I can sense
is that maybe your attraction

320
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:08,333
to this Richard guy is clouding
your better judgement.

321
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,377
I hate talking to an empath.

322
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,670
Wait a second, hold it.

323
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,464
Didn't they fire on the Callaway
grandmother when you got hurt?

324
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,216
Maybe this is just retribution.

325
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,553
No, Richard said his family didn't
fire on them. I believe him.

326
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,390
Then where did the energy ball
come from? They don't just materialize.

327
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,350
- Maybe they do.
- What do you mean?

328
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:28,395
Well, if Richard says
it was no one in his family,

329
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,190
maybe it was somebody else,
maybe a third party.

330
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,151
If so, the two families need to know
before this escalates.

331
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,987
Do you think you could get them
to come here?

332
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:39,531
- What, like peace talks?
- Yeah, why not?

333
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,576
You've got an Elder right here,
who better to mediate?

334
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,495
Good luck.

335
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,206
I actually think this could work.

336
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,541
I don't know, this feud's
gone back for generations.

337
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,627
I don't even think
they know how it started.

338
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,170
Still, it's worth a shot.

339
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,846
Nicely done.

340
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:06,517
- These aren't easy to find.
- Tell me about it.

341
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:07,976
How long before it's ready?

342
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,103
You'll have it...

343
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,648
...when you need it.

344
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,990
What are you doing?

345
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:25,869
Paige, get out of here.
It's none of your business.

346
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:29,039
- I thought you weren't using magic.
- Just save me the speech.

347
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,708
I don't need it. Go save an innocent
or something.

348
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,502
Yeah, I'm trying.

349
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,964
Look, they killed my fiancée,
they killed my dad,

350
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,174
what do you want me to do,
just sit back and watch?

351
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,468
We don't know
the Callaways even did it.

352
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:43,136
Who then?

353
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:46,056
- I don't know.
- "I don't know."

354
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:49,434
Great. Just go, please,
before you get hurt.

355
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,649
Hi. You have two choices.

356
00:21:55,858 --> 00:22:00,487
Either you go over to the Callaways'
and use your considerable influence,

357
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,823
not to mention your fairly
neutral reputation,

358
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,075
- and bring them to the peace table...
- What?

359
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:08,245
Or I can orb your butt down
to purgatory

360
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:11,456
and you can spend all of eternity
getting a lovely sunburn.

361
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:13,542
- You're crazy.
- Quite possibly.

362
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:18,130
More importantly, I'm serious.
Look, it's the only way to end the feud.

363
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,509
It's what Olivia would have wanted,
right?

364
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,477
This it?

365
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,688
That's it, drop it in.

366
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,398
What are you looking for?

367
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:40,777
I want to see if Paige was actually hit
by an energy ball after all.

368
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,322
- What else could it be?
- Let's see.

369
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,366
So...

370
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,785
...how was your date?

371
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,163
Short.

372
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,998
Oh, really? Sorry.

373
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:57,294
Short? You mean, like,
"leprechaun" short?

374
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:02,633
No, Leo, he wasn't short,
the date was cut short by this.

375
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,968
Oh, right.

376
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:06,845
Sorry.

377
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,224
So...

378
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,143
...don't you think
you should use protection?

379
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:18,398
- I mean for your hands, the soup?
- Okay.

380
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:23,111
Look, I know this is awkward,
me being here and all.

381
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,696
It's just as I suspected.

382
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,407
- What does that mean?
- Not you, the pan.

383
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,700
Keep up, will you?

384
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:31,578
Her shirt, it's getting lighter,
which means

385
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,665
Paige was not hit by an energy ball,
she was hit by a plasma ball.

386
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:36,875
- Plasma?
- And plasma only occurs

387
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:39,419
on the spiritual plane.

388
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:41,922
Okay, they're all here

389
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,925
and these people are in major need
of peace talks.

390
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:48,679
Actually, what they need is a séance.

391
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:53,308
You think a ghost
is trying to break the truce?

392
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,227
An angry relative maybe?

393
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,230
Someone who's still tethered
to the feud.

394
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,608
Someone who can't or won't let go.

395
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:06,321
- Why didn't you tell me about this?
- No time, sorry.

396
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,614
This is ridiculous.

397
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,908
- Just another one of their tricks.
- No, it's not.

398
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,202
I asked them to come,
just let it play out.

399
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:15,581
By summoning the spirit,
we bring them into our plane.

400
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:20,002
So be careful not to break the circle
until we've helped it move on.

401
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,921
Or else we're gonna have some
angry spirits running amok.

402
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,882
Everybody ready?

403
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,178
Phoebe?

404
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:35,475
Oh, sorry. It's just there's...
Everybody's like:

405
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:55,954
Paige?

406
00:24:56,163 --> 00:25:01,460
Unknown spirit, we call to thee
Those who wish to set you free

407
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:07,132
Cross on over so we may help
Come to us, reveal yourself

408
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:11,386
Hold on.

409
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:21,730
Olivia.

410
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:24,107
Hello, Daddy. Miss me?

411
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:30,697
Richard.

412
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,033
I don't understand.

413
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:36,036
You attacked us. Why?

414
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:38,705
Because you didn't avenge my death,
that's why.

415
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:41,667
But you were hit by one of your own.

416
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,670
Or so you were led to think.
But that's not exactly true.

417
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,338
Is it, Steve?

418
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:52,094
It was an accident.

419
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,346
We were set up.

420
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,557
Okay, don't break the chain.

421
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,684
We wouldn't want that,
would we, Paige?

422
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,895
Okay, we have to move this
along now because:

423
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,647
This can't be right.

424
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,315
That... That can't be you.

425
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:10,362
I was wrong about the feud, Richard.
It can never end, I know that now.

426
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:15,284
But that doesn't mean
we can't still be together.

427
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:17,744
Once I have my revenge.

428
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:29,089
- Your son killed my daughter.
- Your daughter killed my husband.

429
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,384
Come on.

430
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,772
Richard, don't go.

431
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,736
Okay, next time I tell you to butt out,
butt out.

432
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,617
Richard, wait.

433
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,537
Why don't we go after Richard
together?

434
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,146
Hey, what are you doing,
making soup?

435
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,398
Not exactly.

436
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,818
"Banishing a ghost."

437
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:34,863
Wait, I thought we weren't gonna
try and help Paige anymore.

438
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,115
We're not. We're assisting.

439
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,201
Oh, we're assisting.

440
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:42,871
We're just giving her a little ammo,
should she need it.

441
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,916
You know, that was one
really pissed off ghost.

442
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,835
That was also one
very pissed off sister.

443
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:50,587
Which is why we are not helping her.
Not directly.

444
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,548
We're just giving her an option.

445
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:56,927
- You're worried.
- So?

446
00:27:57,135 --> 00:28:01,098
So you can actually worry,
and really you're just worried.

447
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:04,935
Whereas if I worry, people think
that I'm psychically intruding.

448
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:09,314
Precisely. Now, I need to call Leo
so he can babysit.

449
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,567
I could call him if you want me to.

450
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,652
Just trying to help.

451
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:16,405
I know you want me to, though.

452
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,918
- Knock, knock.
- You ever give up?

453
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:31,712
Never.

454
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:34,173
Penny for your thoughts.

455
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:37,759
What?

456
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:40,637
Olivia used to say that.

457
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:46,101
Oh, I should be more careful.

458
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,395
Must have been hard.

459
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,772
Seeing her again after all that time.

460
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:52,482
Yeah.

461
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,943
She just seemed so bitter, you know?

462
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:57,654
Bitter? She wasn't bitter,
she was pissed.

463
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:04,161
I mean, I would be
if I'd lost everything.

464
00:29:04,495 --> 00:29:05,871
Just wasn't like her.

465
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,624
Well, maybe she was lonely.

466
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,502
Maybe she was just reaching out.

467
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:14,463
And maybe she just wants
some justice.

468
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,381
Justice?

469
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,926
She wants revenge.

470
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:28,227
There's something to be said
for revenge.

471
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:30,145
Weren't you the one
advocating peace?

472
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:33,524
Said you'd send me to purgatory
if I didn't agree.

473
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:38,237
Well, a girl's allowed
to change her mind, right?

474
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:42,574
And if Olivia's right,
and the feud can't be stopped...

475
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:46,036
...then the last man standing wins.

476
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:48,288
Besides...

477
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,916
...l'll be there.

478
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,460
You won't be alone.

479
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,255
Why are you doing this?

480
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:00,509
Because it's the right thing to do.

481
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:09,768
Together, we can't lose.

482
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:22,781
Are you sure this is gonna work?

483
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,702
As long as it doesn't
make you violently ill.

484
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,455
Side effects, you never know.

485
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:32,791
Thanks for the tip.

486
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,460
You sure it's worth the risk?

487
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,421
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't.

488
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,426
- He won't tell me.
- Tell you what?

489
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:44,428
What you need the potion for.

490
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:50,017
Other than to hide your secrets,
that is.

491
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:53,937
What? This was all a setup?
This isn't even legit?

492
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:56,315
It's legit, all right.

493
00:30:56,481 --> 00:31:01,320
But I'm afraid you have to answer
to a higher power now.

494
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,242
Go ahead, take it.
It wasn't for me anyway.

495
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:09,578
- Really?
- I got it for the sisters.

496
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:12,164
Phoebe's new power's wreaking
havoc on their relationship...

497
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:13,457
...or haven't you noticed?

498
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:16,710
You expect me to believe this
wasn't meant to protect your secrets?

499
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,003
No, I don't.

500
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,339
But seeing as how you haven't
figured me out yet,

501
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:21,798
why would I even need it?

502
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:23,634
Don't get too cocky, kid.

503
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:28,305
Wouldn't want me to clip
your wings now, would you?

504
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:32,893
Looks like Wyatt needs
another babysitter, Dad.

505
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:38,106
All right, how fast can you make
another one?

506
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:42,986
Take it, don't be afraid.

507
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,739
You can do it.

508
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:48,617
They're attacking!

509
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:34,538
Think she needs help now?

510
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:50,470
Mom!

511
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:22,002
Richard?

512
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,339
Richard, please wake up.

513
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:28,383
Richard, please wake up.

514
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:30,594
It's me, it's Olivia.

515
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:33,388
Oh, no.

516
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:41,480
If I can't have him in life,
I'm gonna have him in death.

517
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:49,947
Oh, Richard. Richard!

518
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,415
It's okay.

519
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,794
You're all right, sweetheart.

520
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:07,464
We couldn't be together before.

521
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:11,718
We can be together now.

522
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:17,307
No!

523
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:29,945
Don't fight it.

524
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:31,822
Just breathe.

525
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:35,951
Olivia, please don't do this to me.

526
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,621
It's the only way.

527
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:43,458
It's the only way we can be together.

528
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:46,378
Dying's not so hard.

529
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,047
That's it.

530
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,386
Just breathe.

531
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:07,399
Blood to blood, I summon thee
Blood to blood, return to me

532
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,360
- It's not working.
- Neither is scrying.

533
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,488
I knew I should have
followed my instincts.

534
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:14,823
I knew that she was in
over her head.

535
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:16,074
- Phoebe...
- What?

536
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:18,368
I know I'm driving everyone crazy
with my power,

537
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:20,120
but it doesn't mean I'm not right.

538
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:23,499
We're all tense, but that's not gonna
help us get Paige back.

539
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,918
What is? It's like
she doesn't even exist anymore.

540
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:29,463
Well, that's because Olivia's energy
is suppressing hers.

541
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:31,757
So maybe we should be
scrying for Olivia.

542
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:35,010
Only we'd need something of hers
to scry with.

543
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,353
We think we know where they are.

544
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,066
We want to help end this
before we lose anyone else.

545
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:52,569
Come on in.

546
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:14,550
You're too late.

547
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,343
No, we're not.

548
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,179
- Paige.
- I'm okay.

549
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:28,021
- Phoebe, the potion.
- You don't need to banish her.

550
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:33,485
No, you felt her anger
but I felt her pain.

551
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:37,823
I know how much you loved him.

552
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,034
How much it hurts to have lost him.

553
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,329
You have to let him live.

554
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:47,040
It's the only way for you
to move on and get out of limbo.

555
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:51,211
Olivia, please,
come away from vengeance

556
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:55,757
and come back to forgiveness,
back to who you were.

557
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:00,596
Just let the feud end with life
and not with death.

558
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:12,274
I'm scared.

559
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,277
I know.

560
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:25,787
Forgive me.

561
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:14,586
Come on, you can't stay
in there forever.

562
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:16,296
Yes, I can.

563
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,841
Phoebe, this is nuts. Open the door.

564
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:20,509
- No.
- Phoebe!

565
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:22,344
Okay, let's see if this one works.

566
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:24,096
In the name of the Halliwell line

567
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:26,181
Bar my sisters
From this power of mine

568
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:28,517
- Phoebe.
- Phoebe!

569
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:31,478
It's not working,
I can still feel your frustration.

570
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:34,147
- I don't know what else to do.
- Hey.

571
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,151
People lock doors for a reason.

572
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:40,070
I figure if you can use your powers
to intrude on my life,

573
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:42,239
then I can use mine to intrude
on yours.

574
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:45,159
Phoebe, none of us like this new
power of yours any more than you.

575
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:47,369
But it's pointless to isolate yourself.

576
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:49,663
Well, if I can't read you,
I can't hurt you.

577
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:54,251
How about instead of trying to control
your power, you control yourself?

578
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:55,711
Because, Paige, I can't.

579
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:58,589
I can sense how annoyed you
are and that's hurting me.

580
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,717
What's annoying me is I discovered
I have this magical destiny

581
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:04,887
and I can't trust you to leave me
alone for me to follow it.

582
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,722
What do you think I'm trying to do?

583
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,557
Let's look at the bright side.

584
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:12,144
We settled a family feud,
we set free a tortured soul,

585
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:15,772
maybe your new power
and Paige's new solo path

586
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:19,026
away from the sisterhood
is some kind of synergy,

587
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:22,738
that it's all working together
in some kind of divine way.

588
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,239
- Nah.
- Nah.

589
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,618
Leo didn't give you
the empath-blocking potion?

590
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:28,911
What potion?

591
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:31,288
Leo!

592
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,958
- Where is it?
- Give me, give me, give me...

593
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,668
- Faster.
- Come on, come on.

594
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:38,712
They're anxious about that potion.

595
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:42,925
I think you should wait. Phoebe
was given her power for a reason...

596
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:44,343
Forget that.

597
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:04,738
Nothing. Nada. Zilch.

598
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:07,491
- Yes.
- Hallelujah!

599
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:10,828
I have to go finish a game
of pinochle with Grandma Callaway.

600
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:13,580
- Maybe you'll run into Richard.
- I'm sorry?

601
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,834
That was a sister thing,
not an empath thing.

602
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,418
Come on.

603
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:21,213
So it worked, right?

604
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,757
No nausea, no queasiness,
nothing like that?

605
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:25,968
Nope, nothing.

606
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:32,850
Well, it looks like we're one, big,
happy family again.

607
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:35,435
You're not family.

608
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:48,198
Piper?

609
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:52,494
I... I want to apologize.

610
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:54,121
For what?

611
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:55,914
For being...

612
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:57,958
...around so much.

613
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:01,545
I know you asked for your space
and I want to honour that but it's just...

614
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:03,589
Yeah. No, I understand.

615
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,216
- I'm not upset.
- Good.

616
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,094
I don't really think it's necessary
anymore.

617
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:13,056
Besides, I can't think of a better
babysitter for Wyatt than his daddy.

618
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,517
Really?

619
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:16,977
Anytime.

620
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:21,231
I know this hasn't been easy
for you, either.

621
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,733
But I really appreciate it.

622
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,486
It's given me some time to think.

623
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:26,737
About?

624
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:29,531
About where we go from here.

625
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:33,744
And I think it's time
maybe we make it official.

626
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:37,789
You know, legal.

627
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:43,545
I understand.

628
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,714
Piper, Seth's on the phone.

629
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:50,886
Guess you better get that.

630
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,763
Yeah.
