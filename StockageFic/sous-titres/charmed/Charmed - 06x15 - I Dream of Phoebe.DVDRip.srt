1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,047
Good morning. Any phone calls?

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:10,010
Take your pick.
You've got adulterers, cross-dressers,

3
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,055
34-year-old virgins
and your nephew.

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:14,890
Oh, Chris called?

5
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:18,435
No, Wyatt.
Actually, I think Piper did the dialling.

6
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,521
But you have another nephew?

7
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:25,234
No, but you know,
maybe someday I will.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,444
You know what I mean? Okay.

9
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,074
Phoebe, I need your help.

10
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,493
I've been calling for you all week,
didn't you hear me?

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,038
For the first couple of days, yeah.
Then I put you on mute.

12
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,498
You could put me on mute?

13
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:43,168
I had to. I was busy.
Now, I need your help.

14
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,629
Oh, yeah, and I need yours too.

15
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,173
Because you come here,
you drop this bombshell on me,

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,842
and you expect
me to keep this secret?

17
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,844
I don't even know why
I'm keeping this secret.

18
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,137
Nobody can find out
Piper and Leo are my parents!

19
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,848
It could mess with the whole future.

20
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,809
If you didn't want anyone to know,
I don't know why you told me.

21
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,478
I told you because you busted me
and I'm glad you did.

22
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,564
I have been so focused
on protecting Wyatt,

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,484
I've completely forgotten about me.
This month is my conception date.

24
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,529
- Your conception date?
- That's where I've been.

25
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,074
Oracles, fortune-tellers, soothsayers,
they all say the same thing.

26
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,327
If Mom and Dad don't screw
this month, I'm screwed.

27
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,373
Okay, I'm just trying to get used
to you being my nephew.

28
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,669
- I never hit on you, did I?
- What? No.

29
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,380
- Oh, thank God.
- Can we focus here, please?

30
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,882
Mom and Dad need to have sex.

31
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,884
Now, who's gonna tell them,
you or me?

32
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,305
Nobody's gonna tell them because
we're not gonna reopen those wounds.

33
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,101
Okay.

34
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:46,315
- How do we get them back together?
- No. We? There's no "we" here.

35
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,650
We don't.
You're the one that split them up.

36
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,153
And why did you split them up?

37
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,406
Leo had to become an Elder to make
room for me as your whitelighter.

38
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,326
It was the only way
I could protect Wyatt from turning evil.

39
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,827
You're unbelievable.

40
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:02,873
I mean, most kids who are the cause
of their parents' divorce

41
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:07,211
actually feel guilty and yet you're sitting
here like it's part of your master plan.

42
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,422
- I'm sensing some real issues here.
- You're damn right there are issues!

43
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,258
You can't just pop in from the future
and play with people's lives

44
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,177
because your big brother
picked on you!

45
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,096
- He picked on the world, Phoebe!
- I'm not finished!

46
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,849
Your parents were happy
until you split them up.

47
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,434
And now you want my help

48
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,020
because you didn't think
this all the way through?

49
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,688
- Feel better?
- Yes.

50
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,190
- Will you help me?
- No.

51
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,236
Oh, I don't know.

52
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,697
If I'm not conceived in the next
couple of weeks, I'll disappear forever.

53
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,995
You're willing to help
complete strangers.

54
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,540
How about family?

55
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,460
No, no, no. No, please!

56
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,799
What is it? What'd you see?

57
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,594
- A woman being attacked.
- Where?

58
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,563
- Looks like a dig site.
- In the desert in the Middle East.

59
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:11,483
- Are you sure your scrying wasn't off?
- Maybe Jinny is an archaeologist.

60
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,069
Yeah, why would an archaeologist
in the Middle East

61
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,114
send a letter to an advice columnist
in San Francisco?

62
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,283
She said she was with
a controlling man.

63
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,786
Okay, you're missing my point.
What happens if this is a trap?

64
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,747
What is that?

65
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,297
You think anyone heard them?

66
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,763
No!

67
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,941
- You okay?
- I'll be fine. Was that a flying carpet?

68
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,277
What is that?

69
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,411
Thank you for responding
to my letter.

70
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,039
Wait. Are you Jinny?

71
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,000
At your service, master.

72
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:46,180
I could heal him, master.
Your warrior needs his strength.

73
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,807
My last master
will be coming back for me.

74
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:53,103
- I think he's got it under control.
- Good idea. Save your wishes.

75
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,522
- You get a good look at the demon?
- I did.

76
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,317
When we're done, I'll go to the
Book of Shadows to check it out.

77
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,737
I also called Paige to see if she'd
keep an eye on Jinny for me.

78
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,364
- Thanks.
- There is no need to guard me.

79
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,950
Even if I was not bound to serve you,
I would do it anyway,

80
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,744
for sparing me from Bosk.

81
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,913
- Bosk?
- My last master.

82
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,458
He's cruel, even for a demon.
And I would know.

83
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,003
My bottle has been passed around
from demon to demon for centuries.

84
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,839
- That's terrible.
- You cannot begin to know.

85
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,592
That is why I got the message
to Phoebe.

86
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,386
I knew if she had my bottle,
she would wish me free.

87
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,681
No wishes. I know all about genies.

88
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,226
- You're tricksters.
- Listen, I gotta get back up there.

89
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,478
You think you can handle this
without Piper?

90
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,855
- Where is Piper?
- On a date.

91
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,025
- On a date in the middle of the day?
- Yeah, Greg works nights.

92
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,528
Greg, Greg.

93
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:47,616
Greg the fireman? You mean the one
she's insanely sexually attracted to?

94
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,244
- Doesn't that bother you?
- No.

95
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,288
- If she's happy, that's all that matters.
- Oh, come on!

96
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,500
What about all this forbidden lovers,
you and me against the world stuff?

97
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,460
That just doesn't go away.

98
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,838
You know, Chris,
it's a little late for male bonding,

99
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:04,258
especially since I'm petitioning
the other Elders to send you back.

100
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,510
- What?
- Wait, are you serious?

101
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,679
You look tense, master. Neck rub?

102
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,722
Even though Chris' intentions
are good,

103
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,351
his methods have put us all at risk.
So he's going back.

104
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,936
You mean abandoning me again.

105
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,438
You did your job.
You warned us of an evil after Wyatt.

106
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,440
I think we can handle it from here.

107
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,237
- I gotta stop him.
- Don't worry, I'll talk to Leo.

108
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:29,825
No, no, not Leo. Greg, the fireman.
He's about to sleep with my mom.

109
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,994
I really wish you wouldn't do that.

110
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:38,750
- What just happened?
- Your wish is my command, master.

111
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,295
All right, where's the genie?

112
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,631
Oh, my God, you landed one.

113
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,675
She's a genie, not a trout.

114
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:50,304
You still have two wishes, master.
I suggest you save one for Bosk.

115
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,638
I told you, no wishes.

116
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,224
- We're gonna do this our way.
- But you cannot handle him.

117
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:58,228
Nobody can. He has a flying carpet
and an army of 40 thieves.

118
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,730
Thirty-eight, I vanquished two.

119
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,566
Let me guess.
He wanted a crew and a nice ride.

120
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:06,486
- Original for a demon's wish, huh?
- Yes, and if Bosk gets me back,

121
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,739
he will force me to grant
his third wish.

122
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,699
What's his third wish?

123
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,119
- Did you do that?
- No, but they are lovely.

124
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,038
Who conjured them for you?

125
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,124
My boyfriend, Richard. He's been
showering me with gifts all week.

126
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,502
Didn't you talk to him
about binding his powers?

127
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,297
I have! But every time I bring it up,
I just get another present.

128
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:28,258
- Luxury problem I know, but still...
- Yeah, not good.

129
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,886
Back to the demon.
What was his third wish?

130
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,514
- Zanbar.
- Zanbar.

131
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,225
- What's Zanbar?
- The lost city.

132
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,227
Before being swallowed up
by the desert,

133
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,605
it was the seat of power
for an evil empire.

134
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,484
Phoebe, will you do something,
please? I can't orb.

135
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,071
Damn him.

136
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,615
If he won't listen to you,
maybe he'll listen to family.

137
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,742
Most of them are dead, remember?
The feud?

138
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,744
Please, we do not
have time for this!

139
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:59,748
If Bosk captures me,
Zanbar will rise again from the dust.

140
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,542
It's just a city.

141
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,752
A city of magic.

142
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,089
Bosk has been using his thieves
to search for its former site.

143
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:11,510
If he finds it and wishes it back,
there will be no stopping him.

144
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,929
That is why you must
wish me free, master.

145
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:18,934
If I am not a genie, it will solve
your problems and mine. I beg you.

146
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,728
Hey, a little help here, please?

147
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,986
Okay, I'm losing my mind.

148
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,864
Paige, go to Richard,
deal with it so you can help us.

149
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,699
Okay.

150
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,619
You, I will help you get
your parents back together,

151
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,164
but it has to be
on my terms, agreed?

152
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,500
- Agreed.
- Go get Piper. We could use her help.

153
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,544
I wish that he could orb.

154
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,467
And we need to find
a vanquishing potion for that demon.

155
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,428
- Yes, master.
- Phoebe!

156
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,805
Yes, master, Phoebe.

157
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,358
Piper! Piper!

158
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,110
Forget it.

159
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,989
I know you're in there.
Please, open the door now.

160
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,033
Just a second.

161
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,870
Piper, open the door. Piper!

162
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,499
- Go away.
- We have an emergency.

163
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,710
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah, many problems, many levels.

164
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,170
Piper has to come home now.

165
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,925
- Excuse me? Who are you again?
- I'm a friend of her husband's.

166
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:37,429
Ex-husband.
And he's not really a great friend.

167
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,806
It's okay, I got it.

168
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,018
I'm here if you need me.

169
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,986
What is this big emergency?
Can it wait an hour or two?

170
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,822
No, it can't. There's a demon
on the loose, a genie running amuck

171
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,533
and it took me two wishes
to get here.

172
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,243
You can't make wishes
with genies.

173
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,245
See, we need you.
Come on, let's orb.

174
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,372
No, no, no! Listen.

175
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,500
I am not gonna leave him high and dry
again without an explanation.

176
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,211
So your demon
can wait five minutes.

177
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,552
Open sesame!

178
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,310
- What happened?
- The genie was stolen,

179
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,562
thanks to your warriors.

180
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,188
But they were
my two best swordsmen.

181
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,066
Well, swords don't work real well
against potions.

182
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,819
What the hell are witches doing
way out here?

183
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:36,905
We have defences
against their type.

184
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:46,456
The Eye of Aghbar.
It protects against witches' magic.

185
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,252
I need that genie.

186
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,756
All this work for nothing
if we don't get her back!

187
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,801
I'll gather my warriors,
all my warriors.

188
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,513
No. No, you and your men,
you keep digging.

189
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,684
I've got to find out where Zanbar
is buried before I wish for its return.

190
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,103
I can't risk another demon
beating me to the throne.

191
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,523
As you wish.

192
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,320
Richard?

193
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,157
Richard.

194
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,120
You like your earrings?

195
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,165
Oh, you're materializing now.

196
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,667
Yeah, pretty handy, huh?

197
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,378
So you like your earrings?

198
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,048
Yeah, there's a bit of a problem.

199
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:41,178
They're too small. No, they're too big.
I can shrink them. Let's see...

200
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:47,434
No, that's not the problem. I just...
You've given me enough.

201
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:50,646
I'm just trying to make you happy.
I want you to know that I care.

202
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:54,441
What would make me really happy is
if you just stopped with all the potions

203
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,902
and all the magic, just for a while.

204
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,655
- Didn't we have this conversation?
- Yeah.

205
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,241
- But only one of us was listening.
- No, I was listening.

206
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,327
I mean, that's why I'm doing this,
to prove that I can handle it.

207
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:09,039
- I'm not becoming a dark beast, right?
- But that's not the point.

208
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,668
Most women
would thank a guy for that,

209
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,837
but you're treating me
like a common criminal.

210
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,630
Well, I guess I'm not most women.

211
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,262
I gotta go.
Hope you like the earrings.

212
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:35,691
Oh, he was my master once.
And him too. And her.

213
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,985
Boy, you sure got around.

214
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,154
How did so many demons
get ahold of you, anyway?

215
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,699
Some bought, some stole.

216
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:47,536
I changed hands so many times,
I lost track.

217
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:55,002
I'm sorry I can't set you free.
But wishing is just too risky right now.

218
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,259
Okay, let's go.
Greg's not gonna wait forever.

219
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,928
- Then you should dump him.
- What is that supposed to mean?

220
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,556
He's just being overprotective.

221
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,642
I take it you're the genie.

222
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,561
- Jinny.
- Jinny the genie.

223
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,814
Of course. Who's the demon?

224
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,030
He's a low-level demon
with minimal powers.

225
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,117
- There's a vanquishing potion.
- That's what I'm working on.

226
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,162
Good. Then you're almost done
with me too.

227
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,706
Okay, so, what's your plan,
gonna summon him to us?

228
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,083
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
- What's the rush?

229
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,753
Well, not that it's any
of your business,

230
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,424
but Greg's shift starts in a few hours
and I won't see him for three days.

231
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,301
So I'm gonna go call him

232
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:49,264
and I'd put the genie back in the bottle,
just to be safe, no offence.

233
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:51,475
But we've been burned before.

234
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:57,147
- Do you mind?
- Yes, master.

235
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,944
I feel so bad.

236
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,905
As well you should.
If we don't do something soon,

237
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,699
I could end up half fireman
instead of half whitelighter.

238
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,828
- Oh, for goodness sake.
- Look, I'm running out of time here.

239
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:14,998
So, what do you say we use that genie
to make Mom and Dad, you know...

240
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,043
That's vile and against the rules.

241
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,587
I think that you wouldn't want
to be conceived that way.

242
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:23,549
- It beats not being conceived at all.
- I told you I would help you

243
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,469
on my terms, okay? So back off.

244
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,681
- What are your terms?
- I'm not really sure yet.

245
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,432
But I am done with this potion.

246
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,936
As soon as Piper gets back,
we are ready to go.

247
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,028
Not this time, witch!

248
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:49,283
Piper! Jinny, I wish you free.

249
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:56,498
Well, it's about time.
Who's the master now?

250
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:02,796
Chris!

251
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:16,810
- Where's Phoebe?
- Here! In here!

252
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:23,025
Hello, master.

253
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:30,908
- Will you come out of there, please?
- I can't, I don't know how!

254
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,618
Try commanding me.

255
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,455
Okay. Get the hell out of there.

256
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,791
No, not you. My master.

257
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,593
- You mean me?
- Well, yeah.

258
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,222
- You picked up the bottle, didn't you?
- All right, get out of the bottle.

259
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,806
I command you.

260
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:04,691
- You look ridiculous.
- I feel ridiculous.

261
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,195
Well, how am I supposed to get back
to Greg now with this?

262
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,988
Is that all you care about?
Look at me.

263
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:14,409
I am trapped in pantaloons right now.
Where is the mirr...?

264
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,246
Oh, and why do I always
get stuck with the wig?

265
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,123
Trust me, you don't. Leo!

266
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:23,794
Have you noticed that Leo is the first
person you call in your time of need?

267
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,882
Yeah, right.

268
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,593
I still can't believe
you made a wish with a genie.

269
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,263
- You know better than that.
- I thought she was an innocent.

270
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,765
How was I to know
that I was gonna unleash a demon?

271
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,519
- It says so right here.
- Oh, right. Right there, in Arabic.

272
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:42,938
There's a warning label
on the genie bottle?

273
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:46,233
Yeah, an ancient sorcerer
condemned a demon into the bottle

274
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,484
for not marrying him.

275
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,654
It says whoever tried to free her,
they'd have to switch places with her.

276
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,907
- Missed a big one here, bud.
- You wanna pin this on me?

277
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,160
Leo, it's not his fault. It's my fault.

278
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:59,955
How come your empathy thing
didn't give her away?

279
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,291
She tricked me
and obviously the Book too.

280
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,126
Let's figure out a way to fix this.

281
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,171
Well, the only way to fix it is to get
the demon to wish Phoebe free.

282
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,673
- Reverse the magic.
- That's what we need to do then.

283
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:11,049
I'll call Paige.

284
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:15,262
Yes, I do believe the element
of surprise is very important here.

285
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,514
Are you sure?
We can always take our time with this.

286
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,933
You know, keep Piper around
just a little bit longer?

287
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,228
- Yes, master.
- Good. I'm glad you agree.

288
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,565
Actually, I don't agree, but I can't...

289
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:29,484
How am I supposed to take charge
and take commands at the same time?

290
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,778
You won't have to.
Chris is coming up there with me.

291
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,615
- The Elders agreed to send him back.
- What?

292
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,325
You don't know
what you're doing, Leo.

293
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,576
You don't belong here.

294
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,162
And as your whitelighter,
he's doing more harm than good.

295
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,747
You are so full of it!

296
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,874
This isn't about me
being a bad whitelighter.

297
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,210
It's about you feeling
like I've let you down somehow!

298
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,295
So whatever issues
you might have with me,

299
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:51,089
I wish you would
just get over it already!

300
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:59,306
Leo?

301
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,683
Of course I forgive you, man.
You don't have to yell.

302
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,644
- All you gotta do is ask.
- I did?

303
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,272
Yeah. And listen, with that whole
going back to the future thing,

304
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:08,899
you know, don't worry about it,

305
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,318
because I'll talk to the Elders
and we'll work it out.

306
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:14,488
It's no big deal, okay?
Come give me a hug.

307
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,285
What do you mean
she didn't read the warning?

308
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:23,247
I'll explain later. The bottom line
is we need you home now.

309
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:27,292
Well, I can't. I'm kind of in the middle
of saving Richard right now.

310
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,669
Be right with you.

311
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,296
I took Phoebe's advice,
I got his family here.

312
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,800
- Aren't most of his relatives dead?
- They are.

313
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,886
You're holding a magical intervention
with ghosts?

314
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,346
Well, I thought about it

315
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,723
and I realized
that one of Richard's problems

316
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,352
is that he's got no family here.
He's got no support system.

317
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,063
So the burden of helping him
has kind of fallen on me.

318
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:51,358
Okay, fine. Hey, maybe since
you have all those ghosts there,

319
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,485
you can get one to help us out
when you're done.

320
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,946
Help us do what?

321
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,622
- What's going on here?
- I'll call you back.

322
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:08,125
What are they doing here?

323
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,503
Your family is here
because they care about you.

324
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,755
They've seen what happens to you
when you use magic,

325
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,466
and they don't want it
to happen again.

326
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:17,885
You summoned them?

327
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,761
We're here
because we want to be here.

328
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,472
We need you to listen to us.

329
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,018
This is crazy.
This is an intervention, right?

330
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,770
- Look, I'm out of here.
- Richard, wait!

331
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,772
After everything,
this is how you thank me,

332
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,608
by embarrassing me
in front of my family?

333
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,819
Look, if you keep doing this,
something bad is gonna happen.

334
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:38,405
Something terrible, I can feel it.

335
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:41,909
She's right, Richard.
Our family...

336
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,912
I died because of the magic.
You can't let yourself end up like that.

337
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,122
I can make you
a power-stripping potion.

338
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,708
It'll turn you back into yourself.

339
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,169
Just let me help you.

340
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,384
What do we do now?

341
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:07,184
Anyone else have a problem
taking orders from an ex-genie?

342
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:12,022
We are at your service, my queen.

343
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:17,611
Queen. I like the sound of that.

344
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:20,489
Every queen deserves an empire.

345
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,825
Have you found the location
of the lost city yet?

346
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,785
We believe
we've discovered the site.

347
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,540
Very good.
Now all I need is that bottle.

348
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:34,670
Gather your best fighters.
We're going on a witch hunt.

349
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:47,182
Hey, Piper says to hurry up
with those crystals.

350
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:50,269
Genie Phoebe is getting
on her last nerves down there.

351
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,688
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing you an apology.

352
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:55,566
I just... I can't seem to get it right.

353
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,110
Leo, come on, man,
you don't need to do that.

354
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,988
I know that I don't need to,
but I want to.

355
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,406
It feels good to forgive.

356
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,992
Yeah, why don't you just hold on
to that feeling, okay?

357
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,202
- We gotta help the sisters.
- Well, in a minute.

358
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:11,623
This is just as important.
"Dear Chris, l..."

359
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,500
All right, all right, enough already.

360
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,003
You said you're sorry,
let's just not go overboard.

361
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:18,922
But after everything I've put
you through, I feel I owe it to you.

362
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,425
Honestly, a letter's not gonna mean
a hell of a lot to me.

363
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:24,219
- I got plenty of them growing up.
- Sorry?

364
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:29,474
From my father.
He wasn't around much.

365
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,143
That's awful.

366
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:34,521
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

367
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,565
What I want from you
is to grab the crystals

368
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:39,610
and go downstairs to where Piper is.
Do you remember her?

369
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,987
Sure. But right now
I'm more concerned about you.

370
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:44,489
- You seem stressed.
- You're damn right I'm stressed.

371
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:47,618
I'm concerned about you two.
You need to get back together already.

372
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:49,870
- Any chance that'll happen?
- I don't think so.

373
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,830
But thanks for caring, man.
It means a lot.

374
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:54,082
Wait.

375
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,420
You still love her. I know you do.

376
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,631
How could you just
throw that away?

377
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,634
- It's a little personal, don't you think?
- More than you know.

378
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,845
Look, are you telling me
that there is no chance

379
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,431
that you and Piper
are gonna hook up in, let's say,

380
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,725
I don't know,
the next couple of weeks?

381
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:14,645
Actually, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
We've both moved on.

382
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,523
And nothing short of a miracle
could make that happen.

383
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:27,366
The wording is not quite right there.
Jinny is an upper-level demon.

384
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,535
Hey, I don't need a bossy genie
on my back.

385
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,621
I'm giving up a lot to be here.
I'll write the vanquishing spell my way.

386
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:35,666
- You should invoke the name of...
- Should I call Chris to shut you up?

387
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,418
- You wouldn't!
- Keep pushing me.

388
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:42,840
- Back so soon?
- Yeah.

389
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,801
The intervention
was a complete train wreck.

390
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:49,263
- Richard wouldn't listen to anyone.
- Oh, Paige, I'm so sorry.

391
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:53,267
You're laughing at me?

392
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,769
I'm trying to be sympathetic,
and you're laughing at me.

393
00:23:55,978 --> 00:24:00,899
I'm sorry. Maybe I needed a laugh
after what I just went through.

394
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:03,360
Yeah, it's okay.
Is there anything I can do?

395
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:08,198
Yeah, but don't you need
to go help Major Nelson?

396
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:11,785
What?

397
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:14,997
- It's funny. This is kind of funny.
- Let's just finish the spell, okay?

398
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:17,666
All right. Hey, I want this done
just as badly as you do.

399
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:21,128
- Did you find us a ghost?
- Yeah, I got us Richard's dad.

400
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:24,631
He's hanging out in limbo waiting
for my call. Why do we need a ghost?

401
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,008
Well, once we capture Jinny,

402
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:29,011
he can possess her
and force her to wish Phoebe free.

403
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,016
Here's the crystals you wanted.

404
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,769
Well, you guys sure are chummy.

405
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:41,106
Yeah, I had a change of heart.
Decided to let bygones be bygones.

406
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:42,399
Really?

407
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:46,195
- There's something I have to tell you.
- After we talk in the kitchen.

408
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,071
- But...
- Phoebe.

409
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:53,660
Now, that was cool.

410
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:57,039
Excuse me, I'm gonna have
a little one-on-one with the help.

411
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,084
What's he hiding now?

412
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:04,505
I'll get it.

413
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:08,091
You know, Chris is a hell of a guy.

414
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,136
You two should really give him
a chance once in awhile.

415
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:17,184
- Hey.
- Richard. What are you doing here?

416
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,937
I came to apologize.

417
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,776
You wanna make them do what?

418
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:27,486
We finally got Dad in a good mood.

419
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:29,738
And Mom,
she's all sexed up for the fireman.

420
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:31,907
It's the perfect time
to hit them with the whammy.

421
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:35,327
No, we are not gonna make
Piper and Leo sleep together, okay?

422
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,746
- We're gonna do this my way, mister.
- Master.

423
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:40,457
- Oh, you know what? Listen to me...
- I'm sorry, Phoebe.

424
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,751
I'm running out of time here.
A guy's gotta survive.

425
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,755
I wish for Piper and Leo
to sleep together tonight.

426
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:47,965
I'm not...

427
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:53,762
What was that?

428
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:00,894
Oh, no.

429
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:05,023
They're sleeping. You tricked me.

430
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:07,734
No, you made me wish
for them to sleep together.

431
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,486
And they're sleeping together.

432
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:12,739
This is a mess! I've only got
one more wish to sort this thing out,

433
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,032
so if you don't mind...

434
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:17,119
Oh, no, actually, I do mind, because
Jinny could be here at any moment.

435
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:19,204
You know what,
I'll summon you when she does.

436
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:20,914
I command you back into the bottle.

437
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,000
When I get out of this...

438
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:31,675
You're gonna break up with me
over some flowers?

439
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,635
Look, I'm sorry. It's me or magic.

440
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:36,680
- You just have to choose one.
- You can't give me that kind of choice.

441
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:38,891
- I just did.
- You wanna talk about dependencies?

442
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,143
Why are you always running off
with your sisters?

443
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,148
Wait here.

444
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:54,823
Find the bottle. Phoebe's inside.

445
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,291
Sword!

446
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,521
Crystals!

447
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,022
Circle!

448
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,525
Got her.

449
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,864
Where's the bottle?

450
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:40,077
Richard.

451
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:51,255
You think these crystals
can hold me?

452
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:55,634
Nope, not for long. That's why
we're putting you back in your bottle.

453
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:58,887
When I form my empire, the first thing
I'll do is rid the world of witches.

454
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,639
Well, when you're back
in your bottle,

455
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:03,684
the first thing I'm gonna do
is put you in the microwave.

456
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:05,477
How do you like that?

457
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,573
Think she can scare me.

458
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:22,369
They're still asleep?
Have you tried smelling salts?

459
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:25,038
It won't work. Trust me.

460
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:27,958
- What's wrong with them?
- It's a long story.

461
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,711
I don't know, why don't you give me
the Cliff Notes version?

462
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:33,755
Come on, Chris. You and Leo
and Phoebe have all been acting weird

463
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,632
since before the demon attacked.

464
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:40,012
- What's going on?
- All right. I made a little wish.

465
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,473
- You did what?
- Two little wishes.

466
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,642
It's not bad enough
I have to worry about Richard,

467
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:48,687
now I have to worry about you too.
What did you wish for?

468
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:52,065
For Leo to forgive me, which,
by the way, was an accident.

469
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:55,152
- And?
- For Piper and Leo to sleep together.

470
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:58,071
You...

471
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,117
Oh, my God, you are sick! What is
wrong with you? You're disgusting.

472
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:05,078
You are some creepy registered
sex offender from the future.

473
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,915
- No, no, no. I'm Piper and Leo's son.
- My God, you're so gross!

474
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,208
What?

475
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:13,921
They're my parents.
I came back to save my family.

476
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:18,926
- You're serious?
- Yeah. Only now I gotta save myself.

477
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:22,763
If my mom doesn't get pregnant
in the next month, there is no me.

478
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,016
This is all so wrong.

479
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:30,729
And this has been such a long day.

480
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,108
Look, I'm gonna orb over to Richard's,
okay? And grab the bottle.

481
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:39,112
No, you can't. He's...
He's crazy right now.

482
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:40,364
He might hurt you, okay?

483
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:43,033
I need to strip him of his powers.
It's a whole thing.

484
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,119
- Well, how is that gonna help?
- Well, he's been corrupted by magic,

485
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:51,083
and if I don't strip him of his powers,
I might not be able to save him.

486
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:56,755
- Who else knows about this?
- About me? Just Phoebe.

487
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:00,467
All right, you watch Jinny.
I'm gonna go make this potion, okay?

488
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:02,553
Okay.

489
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,480
Come on. Come on!

490
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,750
Oh, thank God.
I thought a demon got me.

491
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:36,712
- Why didn't you let me out?
- I'm not ready for you yet.

492
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:39,798
Hey, we're in the black magic vault.

493
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:43,719
Is there a phone around? Because I'd
love to call Paige and just check in.

494
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:47,681
No, you're not. I know I got a book
of wishes around here somewhere.

495
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:50,601
- Wishes?
- Yeah. Gotta get the wording right.

496
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,395
Yeah, maybe you should
just wish for sleep,

497
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:55,147
because I'm really good at that wish.

498
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:57,608
Look, I just want Paige
to accept me the way I am,

499
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,943
with magic,
it's the only way it will work.

500
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,154
I don't think magic is the answer
to your problems.

501
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:05,491
- It's the cause of your problems.
- She got you brainwashed too?

502
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:08,577
I'm gonna have to cast
a spell on the entire family.

503
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:12,039
Here it is.

504
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:16,585
Paige, I told you,
don't orb in and surprise me.

505
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:17,836
He's not himself right now.

506
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,464
How come you didn't tell me
Chris was my nephew?

507
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,174
Maybe we could talk
about that later

508
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:26,053
- because your boyfriend's about to:
- Look, I'm fine, all right.

509
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,764
Just need to do some reading.
Call you when I'm ready.

510
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,517
This is for your own good.

511
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,563
Paige!

512
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:47,157
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

513
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:49,451
I'm on a break.
Came to surprise Piper.

514
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,037
Oh, a little booty call, huh?

515
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:56,083
- Is she here?
- No, sorry. She's sleeping.

516
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,086
Wait. I don't believe you.

517
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,338
Okay, see for yourself.

518
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:18,313
You want me to tell them
you stopped by?

519
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:22,651
No, that... That won't be necessary.

520
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,919
Sorry, Mom. It's for the best.

521
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:44,923
Take me to the bottle.

522
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:57,644
Are you okay?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

523
00:32:57,811 --> 00:33:01,398
- It's okay. It's fine.
- I'll make it up to you.

524
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:03,108
No, no, no. Not that way.

525
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:04,860
No more wishes.

526
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:09,656
No, no, it's okay. It's not for me.
Phoebe, I wish you free.

527
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:16,121
What is this?

528
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,334
What are you doing here?

529
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:33,514
Genie, I wish
the Charmed Ones dead!

530
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:38,852
No!

531
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,691
Now, into the bottle!

532
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:51,698
My condolences.

533
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:02,793
No, you can't be dead yet.
It's not your time.

534
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,462
I know it's not your time.

535
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:12,845
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

536
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:16,056
She was gonna kill Mom and Dad.

537
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,355
Oh, no!

538
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,233
Leo, wake up.

539
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:33,157
But how...?

540
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,006
Hey, Chris, we're not moving on.

541
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:52,009
- Why aren't we moving on?
- Who cares? You're still here.

542
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:53,927
- Got any unfinished business?
- No. You?

543
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,430
Now that you mention it,
it would've been nice to find out

544
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,849
I had another nephew before I died!

545
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:02,019
I was gonna tell you,
but I just didn't get a chance.

546
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:03,937
We can fix this.
We can reverse the magic.

547
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:05,731
All we need to do is get the bottle.

548
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,526
That's true, we're ghosts. We can
possess Jinny. Where is Jinny?

549
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:12,779
Well, she was planning
to conjure the lost city.

550
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:15,157
Don't worry,
we're gonna take care of this.

551
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:18,285
- Should we go check on Piper first?
- No, no, no. Piper's fine.

552
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:21,538
I mean, she has to be, right? If she
was dead, I would have vanished.

553
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:25,250
- How do we reach Jinny?
- You can haunt anybody you want.

554
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:29,004
You should just concentrate
and it should wisp you right to her.

555
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:33,800
Wait for me!

556
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,680
You're sure this is the site?

557
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,394
One of the hounds of the Zanbar.
They guarded the city for the sultan.

558
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:47,314
I could use a few of those myself.

559
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:49,691
You ready in there?

560
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:54,696
I wish to resurrect
the lost city of Zanbar!

561
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:18,262
Finders keepers.

562
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:20,931
I wouldn't unpack just now
if I were you.

563
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,938
Why haven't you moved on?
You're dead!

564
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:29,439
So are you.

565
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:38,031
- Watch out!
- Phoebe, a little help here?

566
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,118
I think I've got control of her body.

567
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:48,709
Okay, all clear.

568
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:53,005
Richard, I wish you free!

569
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,553
No!

570
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:02,764
Hi, honey.

571
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,726
Let me out of here!

572
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,312
I wish the Charmed Ones
alive again.

573
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:11,982
Yes, master.

574
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:22,868
You okay?

575
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:26,580
Take this, get it out of my sight.

576
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:30,584
Sure. But could you get rid
of that thing first?

577
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:34,838
Yeah, no problem.

578
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:02,574
Hey.

579
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:06,286
What's going on?

580
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:08,080
Just thinking.

581
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:10,916
Oh, yeah, what about?

582
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:15,587
Everything. I mean,
sometimes it feels like

583
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:19,091
my life's just one big disaster
after the next, you know?

584
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:22,427
Like right from the start,
being born into this stupid feud.

585
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:24,137
All that family hatred.

586
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:30,227
I mean, it's amazing that I've gone this
far without ending up like one of them.

587
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,775
Well, Richard, you have.

588
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,777
That's what's important, right?

589
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:41,321
And you are here for a reason,
for a purpose.

590
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:44,825
You just have to figure out what it is.

591
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:47,661
How can you have
so much faith, Paige?

592
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:50,622
I mean, with everything out there,
all the evil...

593
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:55,919
Well, it's because I don't just see
all the evil, I see all the good too.

594
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:58,797
Especially in you.

595
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,466
Sometimes I'm not sure.

596
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,260
- I am.
- Well, I hope you're right

597
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:07,556
because I'm giving up a lot
to see it too.

598
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:11,685
I mean, my whole life
I've had powers and magic.

599
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:14,521
And even if I didn't use it,
it was just a part of me.

600
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,361
And now, it's kind of scary to think
that I'm gonna be losing it.

601
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:24,948
And losing you too.

602
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,661
Well, you have to take care
of yourself first, right?

603
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:36,502
And as long as I'm around
and bringing magic into your life,

604
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:38,962
you won't be able to.

605
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:42,049
I know.

606
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:50,849
So have you taken
the power-stripping potion yet?

607
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:07,282
They're not waking up.
How come they're not waking up?

608
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:10,077
- Would you relax?
- Relax? I'm sorry, did you say relax?

609
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:14,206
Because I'm about to disappear,
vanish forever, cease to exist.

610
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:16,583
Oh, my God, you are so dramatic.

611
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,379
Hey, you okay?

612
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:26,051
I think so. What are you doing?

613
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,846
I don't know, I swear.

614
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,057
What's going on?

615
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:37,062
Arabic sleeping potion,
very strong, not good.

616
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,106
You mean Jinny did this?

617
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:41,483
- Who else?
- Well, we gotta stop her.

618
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,570
We already did while you were
sleeping. She's back in the bottle.

619
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:48,949
Which we were sort of hoping
you could take care of for us.

620
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:51,451
So that's it, it's all over?

621
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,371
Pretty much.
I mean, you still forgive me, right?

622
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:56,415
- Of course.
- Good.

623
00:40:56,874 --> 00:41:00,586
I still wanna know why we all
didn't die. What? I'm curious.

624
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,381
Sure, you don't mind them knowing
that they almost died, but not that l...

625
00:41:05,757 --> 00:41:08,302
- Never mind.
- What are you talking about?

626
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,846
Jinny made a wish for us to die
and we almost did,

627
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:15,767
- but then we turned into ghosts, and...
- So that wasn't a dream I had.

628
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:21,398
I was floating over my body,
looking down at me and then...

629
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:24,151
...you healed me.

630
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:26,195
- I did?
- Yeah.

631
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,363
I called to you
when you were sleeping

632
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:32,784
and somehow you must have
heard me and you wouldn't let me go.

633
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:37,289
Well, then that must be why Phoebe
and Paige's spirits didn't move on.

634
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:40,167
See, the wish was
for all the Charmed Ones to die.

635
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,419
So saving you
must have saved them.

636
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:44,296
That was really sweet of you.

637
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:45,756
Any time.

638
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:51,094
So you wanna go with me
to get Wyatt?

639
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:52,721
Sure.

640
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:57,351
Wait. What...?

641
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:00,395
What about me?

642
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:06,193
I wouldn't give up.
There may be hope for you yet.
