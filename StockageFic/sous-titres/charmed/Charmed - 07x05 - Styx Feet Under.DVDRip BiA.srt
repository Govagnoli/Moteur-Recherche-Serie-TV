1
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,968
Good morning, sir.

2
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,016
This is ridiculous.
We need more than ten cases of beer.

3
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:20,103
We can't keep doing this, Phoebe,
because Piper and I actually have lives.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,857
Call Phil at the Beauty Bar. He'll
lend you a couple of cases of beer.

5
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:28,028
No, I haven't seen a demon, or half
demon, or whatever the hell he is.

6
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:32,074
Demon fighting is important, but you,
missy, are at home doing research.

7
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,284
Piper and I are here on the front lines.

8
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,203
- I gotta go.
- Bye.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,125
Why is it every time Phoebe runs away
from a guy that we actually pay for it?

10
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,504
She sleeps with Leslie
and she's got us chasing demons

11
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,589
all over town, while P3 falls apart.

12
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:51,176
She has to get her powers back.
We can't keep picking up the slack.

13
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,679
I wish the demon
would hurry up and attack.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:58,183
It's okay. I cast a protection spell on
the innocents. It should be all right.

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,562
- Excuse me? You did what?
- I cast a protection spell.

16
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,648
Because we can't keep
watching 'em all the time.

17
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,151
Protection spells backfire,
that's why we don't use them.

18
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,947
Don't worry. I got the spell from my
best grad student. I'm all over it.

19
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,242
Well, it better be,
because the chaplain's on the move.

20
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,915
He's going in alone.
Come on. Put that down.

21
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,667
I have to put my shoes on.

22
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,964
Come to pray, have you, Arthur?

23
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,217
Who's that?

24
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,180
Kevin?

25
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,641
- That's actually my human name.
- Human?

26
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:44,730
- What? What's happened?
- This?

27
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:48,692
It's just a little ritual I've been
performing to reveal who I truly am,

28
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,737
or who I hope to be... soon.

29
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:55,115
- What are you talking about?
- My real name is Sirk,

30
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,493
from my father's side.
He was a demon.

31
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,454
And I will be complete,

32
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,917
as soon as I have eliminated
the last of my human lineage.

33
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,547
And that's where... you come in.

34
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,348
Ouch.

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,851
Well, that really stings!

36
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,024
How many powers does this guy have?

37
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,735
- Arthur, get down!
- What?

38
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:34,988
Fireball!

39
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,673
Nice protection spell, sis.

40
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,652
How did this happen?

41
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,238
Actually, we're not really sure.

42
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,284
Would you mind covering up?
It's a little unnerving.

43
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,997
How am I still alive?

44
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,583
You see,
I kinda cast a protection spell.

45
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,586
- You cast a what?
- Already been there, done that.

46
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,046
A spell?

47
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:18,258
Yeah, but the spell she cast
was clearly a very, very bad idea.

48
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,760
I had to do something.

49
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,262
We couldn't sit and wait
for demons to attack,

50
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,515
because Piper and I actually have lives.

51
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,475
- Don't drag me into this.
- What?

52
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:30,145
We agreed the only reason we are
out hunting for demons constantly

53
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,148
is because Phoebe won't deal
with her Leslie issues.

54
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,192
Wait, I have Leslie issues?

55
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,028
Okay, we have issues right now
with the chaplain.

56
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,864
I have to get out of here.
I gotta find my wife.

57
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,575
Paige, would you mind?

58
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,246
Can't have him running around
San Francisco like that

59
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,331
with Agent Brody snooping around.

60
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,877
What are you people?

61
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,005
We're witches. It's okay. Just relax.

62
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:01,218
Look, my spell got us into this mess,
I'll figure out a way to reverse it.

63
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,471
I'll add it to the list of things
I have to do at Magic School.

64
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:09,059
Can you tell me if I'm alive... or dead?

65
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,104
Well, the thing is...

66
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,605
We're not really sure.

67
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,692
I might be able to answer that question.

68
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,363
And you would be?

69
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,616
I'm the Angel of Death.

70
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,416
I knew your sister, your mother,
of course, and your grandmother.

71
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,502
- We get the point. What do you want?
- Do you kill people?

72
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,255
No, Paige, I don't kill.

73
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,592
I merely claim the souls of those
who have already died.

74
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,094
And you're here for who now?

75
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,805
Oh, don't worry. Not any of you.

76
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,517
No, this time, I'm here for him.

77
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,899
The problem is, I don't seem
to be able to claim his soul yet,

78
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,775
even though he's dead.

79
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:03,071
It's fascinating, really.
I've never had this problem before.

80
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,200
Any ideas why now?

81
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,746
I cast a spell.

82
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,624
A spell?
You trapped his soul with a spell?

83
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,044
- It wasn't intentional.
- Reverse it now.

84
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,796
Hey, listen, tall dark one,

85
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,466
if we give you him,
the demon gets what he wants.

86
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,676
Then we won't be able to stop the demon.

87
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,470
You don't understand.

88
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,935
People have to die in order,
according to my list.

89
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,104
Otherwise,
the cosmic balance is thrown off.

90
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,107
Give us some time to figure out
what to do with the demon.

91
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,693
The demon is not my concern.
I'm neutral.

92
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,738
All I care about
is maintaining the Grand Design,

93
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:49,618
but in order to do that, I must
claim the soul of the chaplain soon.

94
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,579
I'll be back.

95
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,041
Okay, this is what we're gonna do.

96
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,087
No, we are not doing anything
until you deal with Leslie.

97
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,923
Paige, are you crazy?
There's a demon on the loose!

98
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,509
Right, but you're
not dealing with it, we are,

99
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:09,471
- because you don't have active powers.
- Oh, this is ridiculous!

100
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,808
Look, all I know is that since
you slept with the fellow,

101
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:16,728
all you've been talking about
is demons and vanquishings and...

102
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:20,899
See, the thing is that Piper and I
have lives. We're not on sabbatical.

103
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,777
- Okay, so, what do you want me to do?
- Talk to Leslie!

104
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,697
Fine. I will talk to him.

105
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,825
Paige, you figure out a way
to reverse your spell.

106
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:34,204
Piper, you work on the vanquishing
potion and take care of that innocent.

107
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,790
- I'm gonna go talk to Leslie.
- Good luck.

108
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,464
Okay, I think you should go let
the Elders know what's going on.

109
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,217
I don't know if I can
keep facing them, Piper.

110
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,803
Yes, you can, Leo.
You did great last time,

111
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,472
and we really need you
to do this. Please?

112
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,149
Oh, great!

113
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,910
Call it. Time of death: 11.35am.

114
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,913
- 11.35am. I'll make a note of it.
- It's your time.

115
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,457
Get his wallet and ID,
find out what happened

116
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,001
- from the paramedics.
- Right away, Doctor.

117
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,757
- I can't move.
- What do you mean?

118
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,677
Your time has come. Now free yourself!

119
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,433
Doctor!

120
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,020
How in the world?

121
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,191
Looks like we both have a problem.

122
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,742
How is it that you see me, demon?

123
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:59,873
Simple. With each life I take,
I absorb whatever gifts they have.

124
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,877
You can have your gifts.
I just want my souls.

125
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,713
And I want you to have them.

126
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,924
That's why I'm here, to help.

127
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,927
The witches really screwed up
the natural order.

128
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:15,472
The witches stopped one death
with their spell, that's all.

129
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,059
No, no, no, no, no.
They've stopped many deaths,

130
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,853
just like the one in there.

131
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,771
Don't you see it?

132
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:26,775
By messing with the Grand Design,
they've created a bottleneck,

133
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:30,112
one where death literally ceases.

134
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,282
That's the only explanation.

135
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,952
Perhaps by combining
our vast array of gifts,

136
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,789
you can learn how to reverse
the protection spell yourself.

137
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:44,918
Then we can both just move on.

138
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,093
You can do it.

139
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,472
You can do it. Come on.

140
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,099
I can't do it. Gotta go.

141
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,769
Phoebe, where have you been?
I've been calling you for days.

142
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,898
Hey! Yeah, well, you know,

143
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,734
I'm just... I'm so busy, Les.

144
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,111
You know me, busy little bee.

145
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,821
Wait, weren't you?

146
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,656
Weren't you going in?

147
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:18,327
No. Actually, I was...
I was coming... I was coming out.

148
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,703
Okay, I'll call ya.

149
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,873
Well, no, you won't.
You're... You're avoiding me.

150
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,959
I am not avoiding you.

151
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,588
Okay, maybe... Maybe I'm avoiding you,

152
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:33,091
but it's just...
It's just a very, very little bit.

153
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:38,597
Are you sorry about
what we did upstairs? Is?

154
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:42,559
No. No, I mean, you know, it was great.

155
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,312
I mean, of course I'm not sorry.

156
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,190
You know, but, I just...

157
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:52,361
I don't know. I think that maybe I feel
like we don't really know each other.

158
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:56,782
Look, Phoebe,
what happened was... was great.

159
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,493
- Yeah.
- We... We didn't do anything wrong.

160
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,664
I know. I just...

161
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,961
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

162
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,297
Whatever this could potentially be.
I mean, I don't...

163
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,424
I don't know if I'm ready for it.

164
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,427
Because of me
or because you're in trouble?

165
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,680
What do you mean, "trouble"?

166
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,892
Some cop came by yesterday
asking questions about you,

167
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,686
FBI or something.

168
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,813
What was his name?

169
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,065
Brody. Agent Brody.

170
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,903
I don't know
what you want with me, Brody.

171
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,615
All right, clearly you want
to say something to me.

172
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,451
So, go ahead, pretend I'm not a Fed.

173
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,329
No ranks.

174
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,509
I don't want to end up
like Inspector Sheridan, okay?

175
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,264
Look...

176
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,308
...I got kids.

177
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,853
Sheridan. She got transferred
to another district, that's all.

178
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,939
I saw you shoot her in the neck
with a tranquilizer dart.

179
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,817
- She's fine, trust me.
- That's just it, I don't.

180
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:18,197
You're gonna have to, because I'm gonna
need your help to get to the Halliwells.

181
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,199
Not this again.

182
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,408
No.

183
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,036
What?

184
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,706
You don't even know
what I want with them.

185
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,958
No, and I don't want to know.

186
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,420
Look, the sisters and I may not
be getting along well right now,

187
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,964
but I sure as hell
don't wish them any harm.

188
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,800
I'm not gonna harm them.
I just need their help.

189
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,636
With what?

190
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,514
With something.

191
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,644
You know, if I wanted to harm them,

192
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,022
I would have let Sheridan bust them,
expose them.

193
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:56,193
I have been on a trail for years
that has just now led me to them.

194
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,488
And as soon as they know
that I know that they're magical,

195
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:02,824
that I'm not a threat to them,
they're gonna have to help me.

196
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:07,412
So unless you want to get transferred
like Sheridan, I suggest you help me.

197
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,632
- Harriet!
- Oh, Arty.

198
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,969
Goodness, I didn't see you there.
What are you doing here?

199
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,470
You don't look so well.

200
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:27,015
Don't worry about me.
Listen, there's not a lot of time.

201
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,561
- Are you getting sick?
- No, I'm...

202
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,105
There's just so much
I want to say to you,

203
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:34,773
so much I have to say to you.

204
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,987
- I just wanted to see you.
- Arty, you're scaring me.

205
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,198
Do you have the keys
to the safety deposit box?

206
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,159
- Of course I do.
- Well, everything's in there.

207
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,537
Just in case something
should happen to me.

208
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:51,456
You know, I kinda worry
about stuff like that.

209
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,419
Arty, I'm...

210
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,591
...kinda late for the doctor's.

211
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,551
Well, go, go, go.

212
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,387
Are you gonna be home for dinner?

213
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,724
Probably not.

214
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,272
I love you.

215
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,524
I love you too.

216
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,042
Arthur.

217
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,545
I've been looking all over for you.

218
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,218
Hey.

219
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,554
Would you please tell me
you found a way to reverse the spell?

220
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,891
Not without losing the chaplain,
which means the demon...

221
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:54,686
Will become whole, I know. Honestly,
he scares me a hell of a lot less

222
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:58,398
than the Angel of Death does right now.
If I don't find the chaplain...

223
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,900
What do you mean find him?

224
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:04,112
He ran off and I can't find him
because your spell is protecting him...

225
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,866
...or at least it was.

226
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,204
- You didn't lift the spell?
- No, I told you I didn't.

227
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,831
Then who did?

228
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,135
What have you done?

229
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,471
What I should have done
in the first place.

230
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:32,307
I reversed your spell
and took the chaplain's soul.

231
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,685
And you helped a demon in the process.

232
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,062
On the contrary, your demon helped me.

233
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:40,148
You can't do that,
you're supposed to be neutral.

234
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,484
Circumstances were unusual.

235
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,696
Your spell had unforeseen consequences.

236
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,447
What kind of consequences?

237
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,242
People have to die
in the order on my list.

238
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,453
If one person doesn't, all death ceases.

239
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,875
Now I have to work overtime to collect
the souls I've been unable to claim,

240
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,170
to undo the damage you've done
to the Grand Design.

241
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:06,216
Damage? We've done more than almost
anyone to protect your Grand Design.

242
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:09,344
We should just leave it.
We still have a demon to go after.

243
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,306
We've given up a lot
to make sure you have less work.

244
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:16,560
I have two kids and a business, and
I still find time to fight demons too.

245
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,812
It's not our fault you can't keep up!

246
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,858
That isn't my problem.

247
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,235
Well, it sure as hell isn't my problem!

248
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,613
- Stop yelling at Death!
- I don't care.

249
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,615
He's getting on my last nerve.

250
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:33,035
You witches created this mess, not me.

251
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,829
But you're going to help me clean it up.

252
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,208
- Piper!
- What happened?

253
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,002
- I don't know, she just fell.
- Call 911.

254
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,634
What's going on?

255
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,093
Oh, no!

256
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,472
I told you I need your help.

257
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,226
- What did you do to me?
- It's a practical matter.

258
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:01,230
If you're alive, you won't be able
to help with the backlog,

259
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:04,066
to take souls to where they have to go.

260
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,109
No. Hold it, buddy, if you...

261
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,820
Do your job and I'll return your soul.

262
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,535
I suggest you get going.

263
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,246
You've a lot of catching up to do.

264
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:41,353
Well, do something.

265
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,981
What do you want me to do?

266
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,400
It's easy for you to say,
dude, you're dead!

267
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,236
That's just crazy,
'cause I'm not supposed to be.

268
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,655
What are you yelling at me for?
Not my issue!

269
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:54,700
- Excuse me, miss?
- Yes?

270
00:17:56,618 --> 00:18:00,455
- Again, I'm sorry for your loss.
- It's okay.

271
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,417
Could you sound
a little more upset, please?

272
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,462
I mean, it's really sad.

273
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,965
I feel like my sister's spirit
is around me.

274
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:14,136
Of course.
Now, earlier you told the officer

275
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:17,598
that you two were walking by
and your sister just fell.

276
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,099
No warning, nothing?

277
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,728
Yeah, no... no warning.

278
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:26,440
You didn't happen to notice the body
in the alley there, did you?

279
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,610
- No, I didn't.
- Forensics is done.

280
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,487
We're gonna take the bodies,
if it's okay with you.

281
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,947
Go ahead.

282
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,992
Where are they taking me?

283
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,619
Where are you taking her?

284
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:42,831
The morgue. After the autopsy,
we'll release your sister's body to you.

285
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,626
Oh, no, no, they can't do that,
they can't do that!

286
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,338
Stop yelling in my ear!
No... No, you can't do an autopsy

287
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:53,509
because, you see,
it's against our... religion.

288
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:54,718
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,804
This is a murder investigation.
State law.

290
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:02,976
If you think of anything that might
be able to help, please give us a call.

291
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,146
Okay, starting to panic.

292
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,440
Oh, no.

293
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:09,733
Oh, no? What is it?

294
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,154
What could be more "oh, no" than they're
taking my body away for an autopsy?

295
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,156
Agent Brody.

296
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,036
- Yeah.
- What's he doing here?

297
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,331
Probably watching me talk to myself.

298
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,258
Paige, where have you been,
I was worried!

299
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,592
Actually, I...

300
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,429
- Did you reverse the spell?
- No. But someone has.

301
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,808
Wait a minute, missy. What's going on?

302
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,477
Where's Piper?

303
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,063
Whoa!

304
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,691
Whoa! How'd you do?
What are you wearing?

305
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,943
- You didn't tell her.
- No.

306
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,113
- Okay, fine. Piper's dead.
- What?

307
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,365
I'm not dead, I'm Death,

308
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,868
as if my life
wasn't busy enough already.

309
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,121
- What?
- Okay, long story short...

310
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:08,417
...Death has temporarily
recruited Piper.

311
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:11,628
And now I have to collect
all the souls on this list

312
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,381
before the coroner
starts cutting up my body.

313
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,508
- Cutting up your body?
- Autopsy.

314
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:21,972
Why are these names changing?

315
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,933
- Maybe we should call Leo.
- We should call Death.

316
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,644
Does this mean the demon's
working at full force?

317
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:30,522
- If he is, why hasn't he attacked?
- Excuse me!

318
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:34,276
Can we focus on the person
with the non-dead problem over here?

319
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:36,904
- Let me see that list.
- Well, it...

320
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:42,284
So Sirk was killing his family
members to become full demon, right?

321
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:45,913
So that would mean he'd have
to get rid of his human soul.

322
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:51,960
If he succeeded, Sirk's name would be
on the dead list, right? And it is not.

323
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:55,047
That would mean he has
a family member alive somewhere.

324
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:58,050
So we just track down
that person before he does.

325
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,385
Excuse me. I have souls to collect.

326
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,013
Where did she go?

327
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:20,864
You scared me.

328
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:24,701
I scared you? Who are you
and what's happening?

329
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:28,622
Well, I think you might actually be,

330
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,249
you know, dead.

331
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,710
I know. Bummer, huh?

332
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:40,425
Are... you here to take me away?

333
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,845
I don't know. I think so.

334
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,888
See, I'm kinda new at this.

335
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,112
What's happening?

336
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,781
Good question.

337
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,370
Where does that go?

338
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:11,915
I'm not sure, but I think
I'm supposed to take you in there.

339
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,834
What do you say?

340
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:21,842
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm a little scared too.

341
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,140
You lied to me!

342
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:34,271
I'm a seer. Hello, I saw that coming.

343
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,982
I did everything you said.

344
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,526
I killed every last member of my family,

345
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:42,404
and yet, still, I'm part human.

346
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:45,616
So just 'cause I can see the future,
it must be my fault?

347
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,285
Give me an answer!

348
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:52,206
Relax. Did you kill
all of your blood relatives?

349
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,665
Yes.

350
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,585
Every last little one?

351
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,295
You want to join 'em?

352
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:01,423
You'd think since
your first threat failed so miserably,

353
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:06,178
you'd be a little bit nicer to me.
You've obviously missed somebody.

354
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:11,183
There has to be another.

355
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:18,941
Nice.

356
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:22,945
It's unclear whether
the death of Piper Halliwell

357
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,364
is related to the death of Arthur Casey.

358
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:29,243
Police insist every possibility
is being investigated.

359
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,869
More on this story at 11.

360
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:35,415
- This is really bad.
- Leo, relax, Piper's been dead before.

361
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,877
Not like this, not on the midday news.
What if the kids find out?

362
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,839
- They're at Magic School.
- We're very sorry too.

363
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,966
Thanks for your condolences.

364
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:47,469
Bye. Okay, I think this is too big
for even us to cover up.

365
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:51,098
- What about the Cleaners?
- They won't help, not after last time.

366
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:54,017
If Piper wakes up in the morgue,
you have to explain it.

367
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,561
So, what are we gonna do?

368
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,605
Well, we'll figure something out.
We always do.

369
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,817
We have to find the demon
before he kills another relative.

370
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:06,113
Okay, I'm gonna call Darryl to see if
I can get him to postpone the autopsy.

371
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,199
I'm gonna go to Magic School
and stay with the kids.

372
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:13,954
All right. Now what?

373
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,208
Leslie! Hold on!

374
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,503
I thought you dealt with him?

375
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,840
No, I said I saw him.
I did not say I dealt with him.

376
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:28,677
Get rid of him because we have
a little bit going on right now, okay?

377
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:34,641
I just can't believe it!
You've gotta be in shock.

378
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:36,810
Oh, yeah. You know, I am,

379
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:40,022
but... things happen, you know?

380
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:43,859
I just don't understand. I mean,
was Piper? Was she even sick?

381
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:47,237
No, she wasn't. It was all very sudden.

382
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,657
You sure are handling this awfully well.

383
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,910
Yeah, well, you know, I'm okay.

384
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:56,663
It's hard, but I'm trying
to stay strong for Paige.

385
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,999
Oh, I... I understand.

386
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,295
There's just so much to do.

387
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:05,422
Well, can I help with anything?

388
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:07,716
I don't even know where to start.

389
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:11,553
Well, it's always good to start
with people you need to contact.

390
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,096
I could help make a list.

391
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:16,517
Wait, what did you just say?

392
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:20,103
Make a list. You know,
friends, family, people like that.

393
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,525
Phoebe, can we talk?

394
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,235
Yes. Just one second.

395
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,195
Thank you so much for coming by.

396
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:31,240
I thought I was gonna help you
make a list and...

397
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:34,117
I just really need to spend
some time with my sister.

398
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,744
Of course.

399
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:39,998
- Just call me if you need anything.
- I will. I will, definitely. Thanks.

400
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:43,085
Okay, bye! Bye.

401
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:48,048
- I struck out with Darryl.
- Doesn't matter.

402
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:50,843
I know how to find out
who the demon's going after.

403
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:55,305
- How?
- Piper's list. The name will be on it.

404
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,018
Harriet?

405
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:03,146
Do I know you?

406
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:06,650
We've never met.
I'm Arthur's cousin, Kevin.

407
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:09,361
But you can call me Sirk.

408
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:17,828
So it's true.

409
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:19,830
You are gonna be a mother.

410
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:22,457
- How did you know?
- I have many gifts.

411
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,252
And unfortunately for you,
I just need one more.

412
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:34,845
Oh, no, you can't interfere.
You're neutral.

413
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:38,473
You're right. I can't. But they can.

414
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:45,647
Come on.

415
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,151
It's okay, you're going to be all right.

416
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,533
- So, how did you?
- Know?

417
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,785
I saw her name on the list.

418
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:02,831
But it's not there any more.

419
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:04,917
It will be again.

420
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,002
One way or another.

421
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:19,640
Wait, so now you don't want me
to help you vanquish the demon?

422
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,684
- I don't understand.
- Phoebe, that's not the issue.

423
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:26,104
Names come and go off that list
all the time. Harriet's did.

424
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:27,564
So, what's the big deal?

425
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:30,234
Sometimes the names
don't come off the list.

426
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,945
- Well, ours does.
- Not always.

427
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,949
- How's it going?
- She's resting.

428
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:38,492
It's a lot to swallow.

429
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:42,538
Your husband's dead, magic exists
and, by the way, a demon's after you.

430
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,414
- How are you holding up?
- Fine,

431
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:48,710
once Phoebe realises that
she's better off here where she's safe.

432
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,254
Oh, there they go again.

433
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,257
We've cheated death before,
so why can't we do it again?

434
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,260
Because we can't this time. I can't.

435
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:58,428
Maybe you should just listen to her.

436
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:02,599
Maybe she should focus on collecting
the souls, so her death isn't permanent.

437
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:05,435
- This is going nowhere.
- Where are you going?

438
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:08,188
I'm not in the mood
to lose another sister.

439
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:14,027
- So, what's our next move?
- Our next move is for you to stay here.

440
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,738
You are on top of the list,
you have no powers

441
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:20,993
and Leo and I are gonna take care of
the demon. You just need to accept it.

442
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:40,888
I'm not doing this any more.
I give up, I quit.

443
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:43,390
You can't quit, Piper.

444
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:45,893
Not until you catch up.

445
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:51,398
You can't make me take
my sister's soul. I won't do it.

446
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:55,110
We don't get
to decide who lives or dies.

447
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:58,822
Only circumstances
can change someone's fate.

448
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:03,410
Well, then I won't collect
any more souls. I'll go on strike.

449
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:07,623
So to save your sister,
you would threaten to stop all death?

450
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,709
- You got it.
- That's rather selfish of you.

451
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:15,255
Unless, of course,
you think that death is pointless.

452
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:17,466
- Well, I...
- It's not, you know.

453
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,801
Far from it.

454
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:24,223
Life only has meaning specifically
because there is an end.

455
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:27,476
Death is what forces people to live.

456
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:28,769
Yes, but...

457
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:32,022
Which means that ending death
effectively ends life.

458
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:35,150
Throws off the entire cosmic design.

459
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:38,445
The whole point, and for what?

460
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:41,073
A single fleeting life?

461
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:45,369
This is bigger than your sister, Piper.

462
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:47,621
Much bigger.

463
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:56,088
- You get the records?
- Yes, Doctor.

464
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:59,883
The sisters had Death's list.
They knew who I was trying to kill.

465
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,594
And you knew
about the woman's unborn child.

466
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,888
Foreknowledge is a bitch sometimes.

467
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:06,640
But it didn't help me.

468
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:09,434
I was so close
to losing this foul human soul,

469
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:13,230
but the Charmed Ones still thwart me.

470
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:17,860
Well, they are the Charmed Ones.
They're pretty good with the thwarting.

471
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:22,197
I want to peel the flesh
from their bones while they still live!

472
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:26,994
Okay, just because we're demons doesn't
mean we always have to be so "eww".

473
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,579
Tell me how to defeat them.

474
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:31,331
And you'll stop with the gross
flesh-peely talk?

475
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:36,253
Because there is an old seer's trick
that might be able to help you here.

476
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,006
- Like you helped last time?
- Hey.

477
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:42,467
Premonitions don't come
with a guarantee, okay?

478
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:44,553
Do you want my help or not?

479
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:48,974
See, whenever someone knows the future,

480
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:52,686
you can always get the drop on them
by knowing the future too.

481
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:57,816
So, you can change it.

482
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:11,788
- Where's Phoebe?
- She's back at Magic School.

483
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,458
But she's still on my list.
And she's next.

484
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:17,878
- What happened with the Angel of Death?
- He's stubborn.

485
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:21,590
- Did you find Sirk?
- No, he found us telepathically.

486
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:23,217
He wants to call a truce.

487
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:27,095
It's a trap. We need to keep Phoebe
at Magic School long enough...

488
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:28,764
It's too late.

489
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:31,808
Phoebe, what are you doing here?

490
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,810
Remembering what we're all about.

491
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:37,940
- What we're about is keeping you alive.
- Not at the expense of an innocent.

492
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:41,860
This death thing might not be
very real to you, but it is to me.

493
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:43,362
I've seen it. I am it.

494
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:46,240
We've all seen it,
and it's never stopped us before.

495
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,867
That's before we knew
you were next on the list.

496
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:51,245
Why are you not listening to me?

497
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,622
Because this isn't just about me.

498
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:57,793
Look, I don't want to die,
but I'm not gonna sit around

499
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,212
and wait for an innocent to die either.

500
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:03,590
And I think that's why
I needed to take that sabbatical,

501
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,384
to remind myself of that.

502
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,681
Are you finished
with the vanquishing potion?

503
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:13,642
- Well, yeah, but...
- Paige, he doesn't know we know.

504
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:15,769
We're gonna use this to our advantage.

505
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:19,565
When he focuses on me,
you just focus on him.

506
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:30,993
Interesting.

507
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,453
I was expecting more of a family affair,

508
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,998
like perhaps your other sister.

509
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:39,251
You wanted to discuss a truce? Discuss.

510
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:43,839
All right.

511
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,258
Here's the offer.

512
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:48,844
You give me my cousin's wife,

513
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:51,221
and I won't kill you.

514
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:55,475
That's it? That's your offer, huh?

515
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:57,352
No deal. Forget it.

516
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,315
In that case,
I guess I'll just have to kill...

517
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:05,235
...her.

518
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:13,994
Didn't see that coming, did ya?

519
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,082
Why isn't it working?

520
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:20,584
We're too late.

521
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,169
What do you mean?

522
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:37,684
What's going on? Why am I in this?

523
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:39,269
Piper, do something!

524
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:41,688
I can't.

525
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:53,283
Piper, you can't do this.
You can't take her.

526
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,744
Do you think I want to?
I don't have a choice.

527
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:58,539
Yes, you do, just don't take her.
Take me instead.

528
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:02,417
- That's not how it works, Phoebe.
- I wasn't on the list.

529
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,461
Circumstances changed.

530
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:08,257
Yeah, because I changed them!
It's not her fault.

531
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:10,759
It's not anybody's fault.

532
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:22,062
This isn't good, right?

533
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,108
I'm so sorry, Paige.

534
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:29,903
It's much easier if you just let go.

535
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:41,665
Where does that go?

536
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:44,209
To where you're supposed to go.

537
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:48,297
Don't be afraid.
I'll be with you the whole way.

538
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:58,599
This can't be happening. This can't be
happening. This can't be happening.

539
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:14,781
- I think I just had a premonition.
- What? How?

540
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:18,744
I don't know, I must have
earned back my powers somehow,

541
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,662
or at least one of 'em.

542
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:26,793
We have to save Harriet.

543
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:30,088
How did you get in here?
She told me it was...

544
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:33,008
Protected? Oh, it is,
from demons, not witches.

545
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:37,596
That's just another little gift I picked
up when I killed one of the sisters.

546
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:39,640
Paige, I think her name was.

547
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,351
Do say hello to her for me, won't you?

548
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,036
I'm human!

549
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:09,127
Interesting how our paths
keep crossing, isn't it?

550
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:19,638
- What happened?
- Come.

551
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:24,476
Not so fast. I want Paige's soul back.

552
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:28,272
Sorry, you know the rules.

553
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:32,150
Yeah, I do, better than you think.
Check your list. He's not on it.

554
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:37,447
We changed the circumstances.

555
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:40,200
First you want to stop a soul
from moving on,

556
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:43,120
- and now you want to add one.
- Not add, trade.

557
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:45,497
His soul for Paige's.

558
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:47,541
This is unprecedented.

559
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,626
What? You can't do that.

560
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:54,006
Keeps your precious cosmic balance
in order. What have you got to lose?

561
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:56,049
You can't be taking her seriously.

562
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,719
Dude, you're dead!
Start acting the part.

563
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:04,349
This has been quite
a remarkable day, even for me.

564
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:06,185
So, what do you say?

565
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,520
Do we have a deal?

566
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,029
Piper...

567
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:20,240
...I have something to tell you.
- Paige.

568
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,743
You know that brown suede coat?

569
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:26,330
You thought you lost it, but...

570
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:27,789
...it's in my closet.

571
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:32,211
And those earrings you liked,

572
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:34,880
I borrowed them and never gave 'em back.

573
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:37,883
You're stalling.

574
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,552
I know.

575
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:43,889
But you can't blame a girl for trying.

576
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:49,770
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

577
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:55,317
Your sister... made a trade.

578
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,752
See you.

579
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:00,007
Talk about your miracle recoveries.

580
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:02,217
What are you doing here?

581
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,138
Confirming my suspicions.

582
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,392
Confirming that magic really does exist,

583
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,103
even though I don't
quite understand it yet.

584
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:15,939
What do you want?

585
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,194
I want to help you get out of this mess.

586
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,363
I want to tell the authorities
you were working undercover

587
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,407
to help solve the chaplain murder.

588
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:29,328
I want to tell them that I asked you
to fake your own death.

589
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:31,205
What's the catch?

590
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:36,752
The catch is that I'm going to need
your help with something even greater.

591
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:40,714
I'll be in touch.

592
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:10,285
Oh, forget this.

593
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:22,130
You didn't just see all that, did you?

594
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,554
It's probably what I looked like
yesterday at the elevator.

595
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,931
Good. So we're even?

596
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:32,808
Even.

597
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:36,854
So...

598
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,189
So let me get this straight.

599
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,733
Your sister owns a nightclub,

600
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,778
but she also moonlights
as a government agent?

601
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:47,114
Yeah. Kinda weird, huh?

602
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:50,784
And how often does she do that?

603
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,287
Oh, not often at all. I mean...

604
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:57,624
I mean, you know, that was just
a one-time thing, very unique situation.

605
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:01,420
Well, at least that explains
why that Fed was looking for you

606
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:04,756
and why you weren't broken up
when I came to see you.

607
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:06,758
Yeah, I wanted to tell you, but...

608
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,845
No, look, I understand.

609
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:13,849
And I really appreciate you coming by
to see if I was okay. That was sweet.

610
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:18,937
I care about you, Phoebe...

611
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,565
...a lot.

612
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:23,609
I like you too.

613
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:30,532
I... I just don't know
where we go from here.

614
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:34,912
Neither do I.

615
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:40,083
Maybe we should
just see where it takes us.

616
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,504
I'd like that.

617
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:56,475
You want anything?

618
00:41:57,684 --> 00:42:00,354
No, just this.
