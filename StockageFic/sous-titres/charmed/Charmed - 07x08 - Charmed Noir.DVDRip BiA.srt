1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,047
- Lord of the Rings?
- Historically inaccurate.

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:08,050
- Harry Potter?
- Filled with juvenile delinquents.

3
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:11,720
- Even The Wizard of Oz?
- Disparagin' to little people.

4
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,889
Munchkins bein' persecuted.

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,308
Filth!

6
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:19,019
Oh, come on, seriously.

7
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:23,232
It is the same story with all the books.
None of them deserve to be banned.

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,735
I suppose you want another
naked Godiva ridin' out again?

9
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,946
Is that what this is all about? Godiva?

10
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,281
It's just an excuse and he knows it.

11
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:35,744
He's using it to push his own agenda,
which is to stifle freedom of speech!

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,332
That's what I call stifling.

13
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,544
That is uncalled for.
You give her her mouth back now!

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,881
Why, you little worm. I should...

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,758
Little? Did you hear that?

16
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,261
- She's a size-ist!
- What? I...

17
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:57,015
Okay, Miss Donovan, would you please
just give us a moment, okay?

18
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,897
It's always the ones you least expect.

19
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,693
Professor, please,
you have to understand.

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,820
She is a librarian.

21
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,864
Books are her life.

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,949
Besides, I don't think she's wrong.

23
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,910
None of these books are dangerous.

24
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,414
Crossed, Double-Crossed?
This doesn't even look magical.

25
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,084
Just look at the cover.
It's filled with violence, I'm sure!

26
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,628
You haven't even read that?

27
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,798
Didn't waste my time. It's garbage!

28
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:34,344
Are you kidding me?
The '30s were a fabulous era, okay?

29
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,930
Drama, passion, intrigue...

30
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,934
Excuse me, Paige, sorry.
Could I talk to you a minute?

31
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,061
Just a minute.

32
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,900
Professor, the next time
you attempt to ban books,

33
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,986
how about you attempt reading some?

34
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,721
Thank you for saving me from that
gnome. I was about to strangle him.

35
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,681
You're welcome.

36
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,602
How'd you like to return the favour,
by, say, babysitting tonight?

37
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,149
No. That's all I do here, Leo.
I babysit students,

38
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,319
- I babysit teachers, I babysit.
- Come on, Paige, please?

39
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:36,073
Piper will go out with me if I can
get somebody to watch the kids.

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,283
You asked Piper out, and she said yes?

41
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,203
Well, I haven't actually
asked her out yet.

42
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,039
She's been a little
unapproachable lately.

43
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:48,043
Maybe it's because you've
done this miraculous turnaround?

44
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,879
- You should ease into things.
- That's why the date.

45
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,715
Phoebe's helping me plan it out,
given me some tips.

46
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,968
- Come on, please?
- I don't want to.

47
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,470
- I just don't. I...
- Thanks, you're the best.

48
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:02,224
Leo!

49
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,892
What is it?

50
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,436
What's going on?

51
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,607
What happened?

52
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,693
I don't know.

53
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,921
Miss Donovan,

54
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,257
are you sure you didn't
hear anything, see anything?

55
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:21,553
No. When I came in,
he was lying there... dead.

56
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,432
Okay. What is so strange about this

57
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,227
is that Magic School
is meant to be protected.

58
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,522
Nobody can get killed here,
let alone with bullets.

59
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,983
Well, it did happen before, once.

60
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,401
What? What happened?

61
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,905
Well, about 20 years ago,
there were two students, brothers.

62
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,574
One of them killed the other.
Maybe it's him.

63
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,579
Okay, let's make this fast.
I got a city of lonely people,

64
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:48,997
and I'm playing Cupid.

65
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,667
Oh, Miss Donovan, why are you crying?

66
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:55,504
- It's one of our teachers. He...
- Oh, did he break your heart?

67
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,340
You called the right person.
I can handle this.

68
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,925
No.

69
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,052
Cupid works alone.

70
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,471
Now, did he hurt you?

71
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,850
I know, I know, it hurts.
But you can't give up on love.

72
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,435
It could be the biggest mistake
you ever make.

73
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,688
I could fix you up
with one of my readers,

74
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:16,775
because I'm doing a series in my
newspaper where I'm playing matchmaker.

75
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,152
- I actually have one in mind for you.
- Wait!

76
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,697
He didn't break her heart.
He was murdered!

77
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,452
- It was awful.
- Why didn't you tell me that?

78
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,914
I tried to, but Cupid shushed me.

79
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:35,836
Miss Donovan, until we figure out
what is going on here, who did this,

80
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,797
- nobody can leave the school.
- I didn't kill him.

81
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:42,634
Then I'm sure you won't mind staying
until we figure out who did.

82
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,803
Crystal circle.

83
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,150
- Let's go talk in the other room.
- Okay.

84
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,487
So, what do you think, Nancy Drew?
A lover's quarrel?

85
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,907
Hardly, she hated him. Everybody did.

86
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,118
That means the entire school is suspect.

87
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,915
Wait, a gnome was shot?

88
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,542
That seems awfully human, doesn't it?

89
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,629
Yeah. I'd say we're definitely
out of our league.

90
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,757
We don't do bullets.
We need to call the police.

91
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:25,260
- Did you try Darryl?
- I tried, he hung up on me again.

92
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,305
The way he feels about magic,
he's not coming soon.

93
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,516
So I guess we're on our own.

94
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,602
- We could try Kyle?
- What, Brody?

95
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,396
You want to tell Brody
about the Magic School now?

96
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,691
There isn't gonna be a Magic School
if the Elders find out

97
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,986
there was a murder on my watch,
so we need to solve this fast.

98
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,113
- Yeah, but Brody?
- Kyle!

99
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,326
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
I really am. And I tried, I did.

100
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,205
But I don't trust him. Therefore I'm
gonna continue calling him Brody.

101
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,124
You can call him Kyle
because you have a crush on him.

102
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,544
I do not have a crush on him.

103
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,797
My interest is strictly professional.

104
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,091
Right.

105
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,344
Listen, I'm the headmistress
of this school, okay,

106
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,221
so I decide and I trust him.

107
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,932
I need him to do the CSI part of this.

108
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,894
Can you please get Piper, check the
Book, and you do the magical part.

109
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:19,273
What about the whole date
I planned for Piper?

110
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,441
Did Leo tell you about the roses?

111
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,068
The roses are great.

112
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,654
- Home!
- It's a great idea. She's...

113
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,594
All right, what's going on?

114
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,845
Do you like them?

115
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,433
Leo, what if somebody saw this?

116
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,851
I sensed.

117
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,271
There's nobody here.

118
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,274
Nobody except the most
beautiful woman in the world.

119
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,196
You been on top
of the bridge again lately?

120
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,407
'Cause there's
not enough oxygen up there.

121
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,242
It's not that.

122
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,747
I just... Starting to see things
more clearly now.

123
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,084
And the thing I see most clear is you.

124
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,422
I want us to start over again.

125
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,720
Like... right now?

126
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,181
- As in today?
- Well, why wait?

127
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:39,102
Look, I'm not asking for much,
just have dinner with me tonight.

128
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,188
I can't. Who's gonna watch the kids?

129
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,900
Paige. Don't worry about the club.
Rex said he can handle it.

130
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,653
You talked to my manager
before you talked to me?

131
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,323
- I wanted your mind to be at ease.
- Yeah, that's not really working.

132
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,788
Don't you want to be with me again?

133
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,748
No...

134
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:01,750
Look, of course, I do, it's just...

135
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:05,212
- It's just what?
- It's just different, you know.

136
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:09,383
I've spent months trying to keep you
from falling into this psychotic abyss

137
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,970
and now that you're fine, I can't
flip a switch and be lovey-dovey.

138
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,972
It doesn't work that way.

139
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,395
Hello?

140
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,189
Yeah, okay. I'm on my way.

141
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,441
What?

142
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,445
They're beautiful, Phoebe.
Now stay out of it.

143
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,949
- She's just trying to help.
- Yeah, I know.

144
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,619
Look, Leo, I appreciate the gesture.

145
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,955
I do. And I'm not saying no.

146
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:44,001
I'm just saying... I need some time.

147
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,545
I understand.

148
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,765
The roses are lovely.

149
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,229
But you could do so much more
with our collective powers.

150
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,732
What's the point,
if I don't get Piper back?

151
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,652
I thought we had
shown you the point, Leo.

152
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,489
A world beyond good and evil.

153
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,118
A world without conflict.

154
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,246
- Without Piper.
- In time, she may return.

155
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,876
But for now, you must embrace
your new life as an Avatar.

156
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,004
Help the sisters into the fold.

157
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,634
Come on in.

158
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,264
Wow, obsess much about the Avatars?

159
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,434
Yeah, it's pretty much
all I've been able to think about

160
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:47,231
since I found out what they were called.
I've been waiting for a break like this.

161
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:51,401
- You find out anything new about them?
- No, not really.

162
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,987
Just, you know, pieces.

163
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,116
Not enough to figure out how
to find them, or what they want.

164
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:04,248
- When's the last time you got out?
- I don't know, a couple of days.

165
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,918
Well, how about coming out with me
and getting some nice fresh air?

166
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,128
No, thanks. I really think I should...

167
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:15,217
I think that you should come with me and
focus on something equally mysterious.

168
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,970
- Yeah, like what?
- Like a murder mystery?

169
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,472
We could really use your help.

170
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,559
Paige, come on.
I mean, I didn't come here for that.

171
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,478
I know. But if you help us,

172
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,565
I can let you take a little peek
at Magic School.

173
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,528
All right, talk to me.

174
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:38,240
Okay, well, just so you know,
the flowers were totally Leo's idea.

175
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,534
It was just my idea
to get a lot of them...

176
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,911
The gnome, not the husband.

177
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,538
Oh, right, of course.

178
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,708
According to the Book,
they don't have natural enemies,

179
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,419
but as a species,
they tend to piss people off.

180
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,337
But you said he was shot.

181
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:56,091
Who would shoot a gnome?
And why is the G silent?

182
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,510
That's a really good question.

183
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:01,513
I think the fact that he was shot
in Magic School

184
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,433
- is what worries Paige the most.
- I don't blame her.

185
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,562
- The boys aren't still there, are they?
- No. She brought them back.

186
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,023
I'm just getting really tired of this.

187
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,400
We'll figure out who killed him.

188
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,069
No, not the gnome, the husband.

189
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,863
I can't keep up.

190
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,200
He's trying to re-connect with you,
you know that?

191
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,954
No, I know. I do.
And I would like to do that as well.

192
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,123
Just...

193
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,334
I don't know, I can't help but think...

194
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,710
Your guard's up.

195
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,379
Yeah, and...

196
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,757
You want to lower it, you just can't.

197
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,760
- And still I...
- Feel vulnerable.

198
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,845
And you don't want to get hurt again.

199
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,725
Could I possibly have a chance
to express my feelings?

200
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,602
Oh, yeah, sure, go ahead.

201
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,604
I don't know what to do.

202
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,315
I mean, he's been great,
he's been really great,

203
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,859
and he's totally changed, but...

204
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,781
...I can't help but feel
that something's just not right.

205
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,408
It's too good to be true.

206
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:08,914
But then I can't just shut up
and be happy, right?

207
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,964
Well, it's about time.

208
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,882
Sorry. Sorry we took so long.

209
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,093
Who's this?

210
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,095
Agent Brody, Homeland Security.

211
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,935
Sorry, forgot to warn you about that.

212
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,145
- You okay?
- No, I'm not.

213
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:37,901
So, what is she,
like a demon, warlock, what?

214
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,571
No, I'm a librarian.

215
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,782
And a suspect,
unless you say otherwise.

216
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,162
All clear.

217
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,002
Yeah, just checking.

218
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,504
All right.

219
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,592
If you could hold out your hands
for me, please.

220
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,510
Why? What are you gonna do?

221
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,264
Well, if you fired a gun recently,
this'll show the residue.

222
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,102
I'm telling you,
it had to be the Mullen boy.

223
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,312
Who?

224
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,647
Eddie Mullen,
I remembered his name now,

225
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,567
the kid who shot his brother
20 years ago here.

226
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:22,321
Okay, but how and why
would this person come back?

227
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,947
I don't know.

228
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,283
Well, she's...

229
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,577
She's clean. She couldn't have done it.

230
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,370
- Thank you.
- Sorry about that.

231
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,415
Can you do me a huge favour?
Find out everything you can

232
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,126
about the Mullen brothers
and keep it quiet.

233
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,795
I really don't want
the Elders to find out.

234
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,048
- Very well.
- Thanks.

235
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,345
Where's the body?

236
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,558
Whoa, all these books on magic?

237
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,560
Yes, they are.

238
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,270
Any of them on the Avatars?

239
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,399
I don't know,
but I'll let you look at all of them

240
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,652
if you can help me out with this.

241
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,155
What is he?

242
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,450
He's a gnome and one of my teachers.

243
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,203
A gnome, great.
Now I suppose you're gonna tell me

244
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,539
leprechauns and fairies exist now too?

245
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,250
- Well, actually, yeah.
- Never mind.

246
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,210
I can only take so much at a time.

247
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:28,345
Well... the body was moved.
He wasn't shot here.

248
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,723
- How do you know?
- There's no blood spatter on the floor.

249
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,562
"Crossed, Double Crossed.

250
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:41,358
By the Mullen... the Mullen Brothers."

251
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,277
Mullen Brothers?

252
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,782
It's not finished.

253
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:56,456
"The streets were quiet
after Shorty died. Too quiet."

254
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,793
Shorty?

255
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,840
- Close the book!
- What? Why?

256
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,976
What happened? Where are we?

257
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,108
I think we got sucked
into the book just like the gnome.

258
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,651
Sucked into the book?

259
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,696
Don't worry. Magical things
happen to us all the time,

260
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:30,199
but this is the first time
in black and white.

261
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,825
Yeah, black and whi...

262
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:36,246
How are we in black and white?
Paige, what the hell is going on?

263
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:39,166
Well, what do we have here?
A couple o' newcomers.

264
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,169
- You gotta be kidding me.
- You pals of Shorty's?

265
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,963
Oh, the gnome, let me handle this.

266
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,382
Yeah, maybe we are. What's it to you?

267
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:51,678
Don't get wise with me, Legs. You're
here for the same reason Shorty was.

268
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,641
Looking for the Falcon, ain't ya?
Well, it belongs to Johnny.

269
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,727
Look, I think you got us
confused with somebody else.

270
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,979
Nah, I don't think so.

271
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,195
- Orb us out of here, Paige!
- I can't! My powers don't work!

272
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,113
Just run! Come on!

273
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:29,132
You turned me into a felon,
you know that, right?

274
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,052
Breaking and entering,
vandalism, theft...

275
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,888
It's a fictional store
in a fictional world.

276
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,432
I highly doubt we're breaking any laws.

277
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,936
May be fictional but those bullets
seemed pretty damn real.

278
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:45,274
Yeah, well, that's precisely
why we need to blend in

279
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,610
before those goons come to get us again.

280
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,780
- Are you peeking?
- No!

281
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,323
Are you?

282
00:17:55,951 --> 00:18:00,038
Look, do we have a chance of getting out
of here like the gnome did, only alive?

283
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:03,542
I don't know. I think the book
expelled him after he was killed.

284
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,336
Same thing must have happened
to the Mullen boy.

285
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,548
Wait, I thought... I thought
he was killed by his brother.

286
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:13,886
I think everybody thought that, 'cause
they disappeared at the same exact time.

287
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,846
Maybe he's still here.

288
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:18,140
Well, we gotta find him then.

289
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,976
If he wrote the thing,
he's gotta know how to get out.

290
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:25,063
Although if he does know, why wouldn't
he have left? It's been 20 years.

291
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,609
I don't know. I don't know.
But if we find him,

292
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,652
maybe he can, you know, he can...

293
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:34,489
We can...

294
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,494
Wow, you look great.

295
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,953
Thank you.

296
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,372
Do I look like Lana Turner?

297
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,168
Right out of The Postman Always
Rings Twice, the good version.

298
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,051
You know...

299
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:58,555
...you may not blend in very well
in that outfit there, Lana.

300
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:03,018
Well, I'm thinking as long as we're down
here we might as well have some fun.

301
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:06,355
Yeah, well, you have fun.
I want to just survive.

302
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,649
Here it is, Mullen.

303
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,277
- Think they're coming after us?
- Don't think we should stick around.

304
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:16,073
Out the window. I got it.

305
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,830
Go around back, try and pinch 'em.

306
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,834
- Think they're after the Falcon?
- Isn't everybody?

307
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,003
But if they think they're
gonna get it before we do...

308
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,798
...they got another thing comin'.

309
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,597
I'm telling you,
I don't know where Paige is.

310
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,642
I haven't seen her since
she sent me to get these files.

311
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,395
You were her prime suspect.
How did you get out?

312
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:49,231
She let me out after her
cop friend exonerated me.

313
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,483
- Darryl?
- Brody.

314
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,943
She brought him here?

315
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,154
He wanted to see the body,
that's why they came this way.

316
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,950
- That's odd.
- What's odd?

317
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,244
That book, it's been moved.

318
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,799
What? What did you see?

319
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,719
I saw Paige on the bestseller list.

320
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,180
She's in this book, they both are.

321
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:24,057
Well, what do you mean?
Open it up, get 'em out!

322
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,603
No, I can't!
What if it sucks us in there too?

323
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,439
- Oh, God, we need Leo.
- Leo?

324
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,902
Look, Piper, I know you need time,
but I don't think we have it.

325
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:38,113
Leo will be able to sense them
and make sure they're okay.

326
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,284
- All right, all right.
- Okay. We should do this at home

327
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:45,162
in case we need the Book of Shadows
to get them out.

328
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:48,957
- Can you watch Wyatt and Chris?
- Oh, sure, of course. But take these.

329
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,585
They're the Mullen brothers'
school records.

330
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,921
The Mullen brothers?
Who are they?

331
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:57,466
- They're dicks!
- Dicks.

332
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,635
Like private eyes, detectives.

333
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,888
They wrote themselves in
as the heroes of their own book,

334
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,682
like Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe.

335
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:12,564
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

336
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,608
The newcomers?

337
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:18,278
Eddie, I thought you said
you didn't know 'em.

338
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:22,074
I don't, I never seen 'em
before in my life.

339
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:25,369
- Wait a minute, you're Eddie?
- You got a problem with that?

340
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,998
No, we were just
expecting somebody older.

341
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,875
You like older, toots?

342
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,545
You oughta take a gander my way.

343
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,506
Why don't you gander
somewhere else, buddy!

344
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,299
Who are you?

345
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:43,512
My name's Johnny.
Johnny the Gent.

346
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,682
I think you made the acquaintance
of a few of my boys.

347
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:49,643
Johnny, right.
Yeah, I think they dropped your name

348
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,478
in between Tommy gun blasts.

349
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,648
A simple misunderstanding.

350
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:57,401
Everyone's on edge,
on account of the Falcon.

351
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,279
The Falcon, as in the Maltese Falcon?

352
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,282
No, everyone knows
the Maltese was a fake.

353
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,869
This one's the real deal,
the Burmese Falcon.

354
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:10,539
Burmese? You can't be serious.
That's a total rip-off.

355
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:13,959
Well, rip-off or no,
I figure that's why you're here.

356
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:16,461
You wouldn't happen
to know where it is?

357
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:17,880
Maybe we do.

358
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,591
But that's between us and Eddie.

359
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:24,803
We have business to discuss. Alone.

360
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,638
Thanks, I got enough business.

361
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,892
No, please. You're the
only one who can help us.

362
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:33,604
See, we... we came from your school.

363
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:36,899
We just can't seem to find our way back.

364
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,069
Be polite, Eddie.

365
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,572
Hear 'em out.

366
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:47,910
Besides, it might be lucrative.

367
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,251
I'll be in touch.

368
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:04,176
Of all the books in all the libraries
in all the world,

369
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:06,386
you gotta get sucked into this one?

370
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:18,774
You don't seem too happy to see us.

371
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,567
Should I be?

372
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:24,863
What are you doing? Don't you
know those things will kill you?

373
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,741
Well, if the smokes don't get me,
the bullets will.

374
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:30,702
Just like they got your brother?

375
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:34,164
Look, what happened, Eddie?
Who killed him?

376
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:40,671
It was a couple of corrupt cops.

377
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:44,174
They tried to stop him from
getting to the Falcon before they did.

378
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:47,553
What is it with this Falcon?
Why does everyone want it so badly?

379
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:51,723
'Cause we wrote 'em that way.
That's why. It's their whole motivation.

380
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,853
Very impressive. Quite a magical world
you boys have concocted here.

381
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:58,355
You must have been
very advanced students.

382
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,024
Nah, Dan was the creative one.

383
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,861
It was his idea,
I was just along for the ride.

384
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:08,156
- It was supposed to be fun.
- So, why haven't you left yet?

385
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,995
I can't. The only way out
is to end the story.

386
00:24:13,162 --> 00:24:15,205
Can't do that until the Falcon's found.

387
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:17,124
You don't know where it is?

388
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:21,336
No. Dan and I laid down
the fundamentals, the beginning.

389
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,839
The story's got a life of its own now.

390
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:27,301
What have you been doing
the last 20 years, sitting on your ass?

391
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,927
Twenty years?

392
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,722
No, Dan just died yesterday.

393
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,807
No, not on the outside he didn't.

394
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:37,019
You guys have created some sort
of different time in here,

395
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:39,855
one where no one ages, apparently.

396
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:41,940
No.

397
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:44,651
They just get killed, thanks to me.

398
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:48,155
All right, this is ridiculous,
all right? Look, kid...

399
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,910
This is Eddie. Hold the line, please.

400
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,787
Now, would you all mind?

401
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:57,414
Yeah, no problem.

402
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,336
All right, go ahead, Johnny.

403
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:06,798
Nah, they don't know anything
about the Falcon.

404
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:09,343
But I think they're
gonna be trouble anyways.

405
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:13,514
I'm telling you, he knows more than
he's letting on. He's hiding something.

406
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,349
He's hiding pain, real pain.

407
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:18,310
I don't think that's supposed
to be part of the story.

408
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:22,940
So what? Doesn't mean he didn't
kill his brother. We could be next.

409
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,984
Look, I know an innocent, okay?

410
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,612
I think the only way
for us to get out of this

411
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,948
is to figure out how to help him first.

412
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:37,830
Good news. That was an anonymous
source, gave me a lead on the Falcon.

413
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,790
Oh, that's great, that's great.

414
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:42,918
So, what, you just happened
to get this tip just now?

415
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:46,547
You guys coming here must have
triggered the story to move forward.

416
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,591
We find the Falcon, we get out.
Isn't that what you want?

417
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,135
Of course. Isn't that what you want?

418
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,390
Yeah. Sure. I'll go get my car.

419
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:00,060
I hope you know what you're doing.

420
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,856
What? What is it?

421
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:08,110
It's strange, I almost feel
as if someone's calling to me.

422
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,989
Paige is still alive in there.
I don't know about Kyle.

423
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:15,784
- You're calling him Kyle now too?
- That's his name, isn't it?

424
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,829
I knew she should not have
gotten him involved in this.

425
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:21,415
This is a bad idea.
I'm sure it's his fault.

426
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,250
Forget about whose fault it is.

427
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:27,004
We need to get them out of there
without getting trapped ourselves.

428
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:29,298
- Maybe I can help.
- What are you doing?

429
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,258
It's all right, I'll be okay.

430
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:36,471
Leo!

431
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:52,738
He must have shorted it out.
How did you do that?

432
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:55,574
I guess I'm just
a little more focused now.

433
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,410
What is it doing?

434
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:01,330
It looks like it's writing itself,

435
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:04,249
as if it were unfolding right now.

436
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:08,337
Is that Paige and Brody?

437
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,255
But who's driving?

438
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,341
Eddie Mullen, I think. Listen.

439
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:14,843
"Riding in Eddie's car,
Lana and the Fed..."

440
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,345
"Lana and the Fed"?

441
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:19,348
At least he's not calling him Kyle.
Know what I mean?

442
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:23,894
"Lana and the Fed had no idea they
were being driven straight into a trap."

443
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:26,396
- He's setting them up.
- What do you expect?

444
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:28,774
It's called Crossed, Double-Crossed.

445
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:31,485
What are you doing?

446
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,820
I am trying my hand at being a novelist,

447
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:37,199
see if I can write in
a little twist to help Paige out.

448
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:41,036
Then suddenly...

449
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:43,413
...they got a flat tyre.

450
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,587
What the hell was that?

451
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:54,132
It's a flat tyre, but I don't
understand. That's impossible.

452
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,552
Why, you can't get
a flat tyre in your book?

453
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,178
No.

454
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,388
It's too cliché.

455
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:01,348
Okay, who put it in there?

456
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,977
Whoa, where are you going?

457
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:08,021
It's just up around the corner.
We can get there on foot.

458
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:10,148
- Come on, you're lying!
- Ease up.

459
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:13,193
Eddie, I want some answers
and I want 'em now!

460
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:18,240
I think you got your answer.

461
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:26,915
We were wondering what's taking
so long, Eddie. We've been waitin'.

462
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,625
Eddie, what's going on?

463
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:33,672
I'm sorry to do this to you.
Really, I am.

464
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,800
But, you see, this story can never end.

465
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:41,513
"The couple knew
they'd been double-crossed,

466
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,098
and there was no way out."

467
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,489
- Nope, this one's not working either.
- Try this one.

468
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:01,158
The book's not
letting you write them out of it.

469
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:05,204
- Yeah, but why not?
- Maybe it's against the rules.

470
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,539
I don't know,
the book is writing itself.

471
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,125
Maybe they have to save themselves.

472
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:13,128
Then why was I able
to write in the flat tyre?

473
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:16,798
It was just another plot twist,
which we could add...

474
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,468
...but we can't bail them out.

475
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:21,011
Heroes have to be heroes.

476
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:24,306
- I read a lot.
- Yeah, I know you do.

477
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:27,351
- Maybe you should get out more.
- Easy, Cupid.

478
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:30,604
Maybe there's something
in the prose that can help.

479
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:33,899
In the prose, yes.
Let me check the prose, Leo.

480
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:38,445
Actually, there is something
in chapter ten.

481
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:42,407
Eddie says the only way out
is to find the Falcon.

482
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:44,660
So all we have to do
is find the Falcon?

483
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:48,455
Yeah, before the book
spits out two more corpses.

484
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:51,917
Let's go talk to the parents
and see if they know about the book.

485
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:55,212
You be creative
and just keep Paige and Brody alive.

486
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,341
Oh, okay, right. No pressure.

487
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:10,894
Tell me all you know about the Falcon.

488
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:13,939
I told you, I don't know anything.

489
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:16,817
No? Gee, why don't I believe you?

490
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:19,611
Kyle!

491
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:22,114
You're not going anywhere, sweetheart.

492
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:25,659
Not unless you want him to end up
with a bullet in his ear.

493
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:28,328
You'll tell us where the Falcon is...

494
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:30,289
...understand?

495
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:32,624
Get your paws off of me!

496
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:35,836
So, tell me,

497
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,963
what's a cute little package like you

498
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,632
doing mixed up
with that no-good Fed in there?

499
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:47,931
Femme fatale.

500
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:51,059
Flirt with him, Paige, flirt with him.

501
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:59,318
Come on, sister, don't you
know how to play the game?

502
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,111
Sister?

503
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,865
You're my little heartbreaker,
aren't you?

504
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,284
A regular femme fatale.

505
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:12,581
Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.

506
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:15,751
Maybe I'm just crazy, crazy for cops.

507
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:18,962
Tough cops. The kind of cops
that'll arrest your heart

508
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:21,798
and make you long
for a life sentence with 'em.

509
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,053
You know any cops like that?

510
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,849
We can keep this up
all night if you like.

511
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:34,353
Or you can tell me where the Falcon is,
and I'll end it but quick.

512
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,898
- Is that supposed to be a choice?
- Yeah.

513
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:40,275
Either you die fast
or you beg for death.

514
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:43,153
Either way,
I'm getting the Falcon out of you first.

515
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,905
Kyle!

516
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:55,791
You all right?

517
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,210
I'll live. How'd you get in here?

518
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:02,464
Well, I seduced a cop, grabbed his gun,
knocked him out, all thanks to Phoebe.

519
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:03,757
Phoebe?

520
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:06,635
I'm getting a little magical help
from my sisters.

521
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:10,138
The whole flat tyre thing,
they were warning us about the trap.

522
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:13,433
Doesn't matter, you're right.
Eddie's not an innocent.

523
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,603
Actually, I think that you were right.
I think that he is.

524
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,690
Come on, I'll explain on the way.
We've got to find him.

525
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:22,985
Mrs Mullen, if this is too difficult...

526
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:26,905
No, no, no, I'm all right.
I wanted to meet here.

527
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:28,240
I miss coming here.

528
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:32,494
So, you said something
about another shooting?

529
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:34,121
Yes.

530
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:37,583
- Well, you don't think Eddie...
- No, of course not.

531
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:39,042
Well, good.

532
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:42,004
Because he didn't kill
his brother either,

533
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:43,755
no matter what anybody says.

534
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:46,258
He'd never do that. He loved Danny.

535
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:48,510
And you haven't heard from Eddie in...

536
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:50,971
In over 20 years, no.

537
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:55,559
But believe it or not,
his father and I still have hopes

538
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:59,146
that someday, somehow,

539
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:01,148
he'll come back to us.

540
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:04,860
Sometimes it's the only thing
that keeps us from falling apart.

541
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:06,945
Crazy, huh?

542
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,866
Do you have any children?

543
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,411
Yeah, we have two boys too.

544
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:18,957
Well, you treasure
every moment together.

545
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:22,586
We were just wondering,

546
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:25,547
did the boys ever mention
writing a book together?

547
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:27,674
What does that have to do with anything?

548
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:31,470
We're not sure yet.
Do you know anything about the book?

549
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:34,431
Well, not much.
They never let us see anything.

550
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:38,560
But I know it was Dan's idea.

551
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:42,731
Yeah, I know he wanted
to help Eddie with it.

552
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:44,191
Help him how?

553
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:45,984
To believe in himself.

554
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:49,696
To feel... confident.

555
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:52,032
To be a hero?

556
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:55,202
Yes, probably.

557
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:57,996
Then he has to finish the story,

558
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:02,000
which means we need
to help Paige help him.

559
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:06,713
This is ridiculous. I don't know
why we're going to get Eddie.

560
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,591
- He's beyond hope.
- Didn't you hear him apologise?

561
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:11,593
Criminals don't say they're sorry.

562
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,846
Innocents don't try to get you killed.

563
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:17,766
Paige, I know that kid. I was that kid.

564
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:20,978
After my parents died,
I fell in with the wrong crowd too.

565
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:24,064
I was scared. I thought I was
to blame for what happened.

566
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:27,234
I felt that way too,
but I didn't try to hurt anybody.

567
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:32,364
I did. Relatives, social workers, cops.
I'd do anything to push them away,

568
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:35,284
because I didn't think
I was worthy of being helped.

569
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,077
Maybe Eddie feels the same way.

570
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:40,330
- Maybe. He crossed the line.
- Not necessarily.

571
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:43,417
Johnny the Gent got him
to set us up. He's playing Eddie.

572
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,628
Eddie doesn't know
Johnny killed his brother.

573
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:50,424
- I thought cops killed him.
- No. It's classic noir. A red herring.

574
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:54,887
They would've beaten Eddie till he told
where the Falcon was. They're looking.

575
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:57,764
- So the gangsters killed Dan?
- Who else would it be?

576
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:02,352
Then maybe we need to end the story
by collaring the gangsters.

577
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,855
All right, let's go.
They're back this way.

578
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:06,440
Hold on. What about Eddie?

579
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:09,985
Eddie's the hero of the story.
He must know where the Falcon is.

580
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:12,488
But he blames himself
for what happened.

581
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:14,990
Paige has to get him
to see it's not his fault.

582
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:17,451
So he has the confidence
to finish the story.

583
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:19,244
You guys are a great team.

584
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:22,247
Match-make later. Save sister now.

585
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:25,250
You need to get Paige to Eddie.

586
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,794
I can't. She's going
after the gangsters.

587
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,005
What? She's gonna get herself killed.

588
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:33,217
Kyle is trying to stop her,
but she won't listen to him.

589
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,177
Wait, when did I take his side?

590
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:38,347
Probably around the time
you started calling him Kyle.

591
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:41,058
Try and block her path.

592
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:47,022
You were saying?

593
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:49,483
Thanks, guys,
could you be any less subtle?

594
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,693
Looks like your sisters agree with me.

595
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,988
Don't gloat. Let's go get Eddie.

596
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:01,119
Eddie?

597
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:03,997
Sorry to disappoint you.

598
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:06,291
Drop it.

599
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,005
Where's Eddie?

600
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:14,258
I sent him out to look
for the two of you.

601
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:17,219
I heard you got away from the cops.

602
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:20,264
Too bad you're not
gonna get away from me.

603
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:22,891
Kyle!

604
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:26,186
Forget about him, sweetheart.
His number's up.

605
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,655
Please, we just want to get out of here.

606
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:38,949
That's all, I swear! Help?

607
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:43,662
Well, I'm sorry, but if I want
to get the Falcon out of Eddie,

608
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:46,081
I can't leave
any loose ends hanging about.

609
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,835
Now listen,

610
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:53,964
in a couple minutes it's gonna
be over for your friend there.

611
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:57,593
But you, you're a knockout.

612
00:36:58,594 --> 00:37:01,722
Please, don't make me
waste a bullet on you.

613
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:09,021
What's going on here?

614
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:11,148
Eddie, I didn't expect you so soon.

615
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:14,776
They came looking to get even,
for you settin' 'em up.

616
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:16,153
That s not true.

617
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,948
He killed my friend in cold blood
just like he killed your brother.

618
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:23,535
- What are you talking about?
- Don't listen to her, Eddie.

619
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:26,079
The cops killed your brother,
you know that.

620
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,499
That's not true.
You didn't see it, did you?

621
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,126
It's just the story
Johnny's been telling you.

622
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:33,337
Don't you see, he's been playing you.

623
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:36,882
He tried to force Dan into giving him
the Falcon, but he wouldn't.

624
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:41,428
- He's trying to charm you out of it.
- That's it. Say goodnight, Gracie.

625
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:45,807
- What the hell?
- Thank you.

626
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:48,060
I could use a flashback right now.

627
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:51,688
- Flashback. She wants a flashback.
- Why?

628
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:54,066
To prove Johnny killed Eddie's brother.

629
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:57,611
But we don't know that. We can't
make it up, the book won't let us.

630
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:59,530
It will if it's true.

631
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:02,908
Then Eddie found out
how Dan really died.

632
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:05,994
It was as if it was
happening all over again.

633
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:17,923
- I know you found the Falcon, Danny.
- What the hell?

634
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,759
And you better tell me where it is.

635
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:23,262
No, you can't kill me. I made you.

636
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:30,644
Never mind. I'll get it from
your brother one way or the other.

637
00:38:33,397 --> 00:38:34,523
Sucker.

638
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,610
You're not gonna believe that.

639
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:42,614
It's some kind of smoke and mirrors
trick. It's a picture show!

640
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:45,742
Paige, save your innocent.

641
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:49,746
Eddie, you have
to stop punishing yourself.

642
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,957
This is not your fault.

643
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:56,712
Your brother would not want you to live
as if you were in some kind of prison.

644
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:58,630
He would want you to grow up,

645
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:02,426
to live your life,
to become part of the real world.

646
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:06,138
Cops.

647
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:10,851
That's it, give me the Falcon now
or I will break her neck!

648
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:13,520
- Don't. It's your only way out.
- I'll do it!

649
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:17,107
All right, don't hurt her.
I'll give it to you.

650
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:20,277
- This better not be a trick, kid.
- It's not.

651
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:22,696
I should have done this a long time ago.

652
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:46,762
- Where did you find it?
- Doesn't matter.

653
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:52,059
All that matters is no one else
dies because of it. Let her go.

654
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,269
- Give it to me! I gotta go.
- You can't!

655
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:57,773
- This isn't the way the story ends.
- Trust me, it is.

656
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,566
Give it to me!

657
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,819
No, no, no, no, no!

658
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:06,657
Wow, wow.

659
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:08,700
Okay, we did it. We did it.

660
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:14,164
- We did it.
- Leo!

661
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:15,374
I got him.

662
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:32,641
Hey.

663
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:36,728
- You're in colour.
- We all are.

664
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:38,647
So, are we having fun yet?

665
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:40,941
Hey, where are we?

666
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,902
The story's over. You're a hero.

667
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:46,738
Your brother would be
very proud of you.

668
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:52,619
- Well, what do I do now?
- You go home.

669
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:54,955
Your parents
will be thrilled to see you.

670
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:57,708
- They never gave up on you.
- Or each other.

671
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:02,171
Don't forget this.

672
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:08,677
Hey, look, we're novelists.

673
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:10,888
No, you know what, you keep it.

674
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:13,599
No one else will get sucked inside it.

675
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,520
I think it belongs
in the library at Magic School.

676
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:21,732
Speaking of Magic School,
after you drop off Eddie,

677
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:24,860
pick up the kids
and we can have a late dinner talk.

678
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:27,613
I'd like that.

679
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:33,869
I guess this is it then.

680
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:37,247
Thank you.

681
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:40,542
- Stay out of trouble, man, will you?
- Bye.

682
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:46,298
Are you hungry?

683
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:50,636
Starving.

684
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:53,764
I think we should go then.

685
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:57,935
All right, then, you all go.
See you later.

686
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:59,770
Lana and the Fed.

687
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:01,605
Sounds like a thriller to me.

688
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:05,275
More like a romance novel,
whether we like it or not.

689
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:11,490
Remember our deal, right?

690
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:14,076
I remember there being talk of a deal.

691
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:18,121
So I suppose that you'll find time
to help me with the Avatars?

692
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:21,416
I suppose you'll want to look
at the books in Magic School.

693
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:25,671
Suppose I'm not thinking
about those books right now.

694
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:29,174
Suppose I'm hoping you're
not thinking of those books.

695
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:32,094
I wonder if I know what you mean.

696
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:34,346
I wonder if I...

697
00:42:34,513 --> 00:42:37,015
Oh, shut up and kiss me.
