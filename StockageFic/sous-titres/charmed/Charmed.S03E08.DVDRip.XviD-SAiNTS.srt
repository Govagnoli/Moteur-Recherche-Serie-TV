0
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:12,006
Okay, even if this works,
we still have to find Belthazor.

1
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:15,445
Well, I have an idea how to do that.
But first things first. Cockles.

2
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,765
- Cockles?
- They're over by the crickets.

3
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:21,359
- And what exactly are they?
- Small, leaping insects that chirp.

4
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:23,804
That's funny. I meant
the cockle shells, not the crickets.

5
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:26,199
I'm not sure, but as long
as they help vanquish Belthazor,

6
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:27,563
that's all I really care about.

7
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:29,999
It would be nice to get back
to our lives as they were.

8
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:31,483
Pig's feet.

9
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:33,247
- Yuck.
- Yuck?

10
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:34,438
Yuck.

11
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:37,282
You can slice a chunk of demon flesh,
but can't touch a pig's foot?

12
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:39,241
- I'm a vegetarian.
- Since when?

13
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:41,041
Since now.

14
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,359
Now is not the time
to get squeamish, okay?

15
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:46,402
This recipe is very important.
We have to follow it to a T.

16
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:49,478
Poor piggy.

17
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,644
Everything's in there, we just need
to get the slice of Belthazor flesh,

18
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:56,118
and we're good to go. Let's test it.
Pheebs?

19
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,598
Something tells me
she's not in the vanquishing mood.

20
00:00:58,769 --> 00:00:59,804
Why not?

21
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,603
She's worried about Cole. She hasn't
heard from him in over a week.

22
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:04,407
- And that's a bad thing?
- Prue.

23
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,480
Know what? I don't like him
and I don't trust him.

24
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,322
And it has nothing to do with him
being a greasy lawyer either.

25
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:10,798
Greasy what?

26
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:12,840
A greasy layer.

27
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:14,727
There's a greasy layer
on this potion.

28
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:16,408
Too much mandrake.

29
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:20,962
Okay. What do you say
we do this incantation?

30
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,447
Anything to get rid of Belthazor
before Cole gets back.

31
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:26,128
And he is coming back.

32
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:28,558
Okay.

33
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:32,318
Spirits of air, forest and sea
Set us of this demon free

34
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:35,760
Beasts of hoof and beasts of shell
Drive this evil back to hell

35
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,287
It didn't work.

36
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:45,080
- No, you forgot the Belthazor flesh.
- Oh, yes.

37
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:47,925
How can we forget
the Belthazor flesh?

38
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:51,519
- Such a slacker.
- Just give me a second, lady.

39
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,645
All right. Ready?

40
00:01:57,089 --> 00:01:58,966
Piper.

41
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:03,164
- Are you all right?
- Attack of the killer pig's feet.

42
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,923
Remind me to step back next time.

43
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,768
"Fret not thyself because of evil.

44
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:13,841
Neither be envious of wrongdoers.

45
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,246
For they shall soon
be cut down like the grass,

46
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:19,804
and wither as the green earth.

47
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:22,244
Trust in the Lord and do good,

48
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:26,925
so shalt thou dwell in the land
and verily thou shalt be fed.

49
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:31,919
Delight thyself also in the Lord,
and he shall give thee..."

50
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:15,602
You know what I am, Belthazor.

51
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:20,041
You know you can't escape from me
now that you can't shimmer anymore.

52
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:22,562
You'll be pleased.

53
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:26,324
The bounty on you was determined
by The Source himself.

54
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:32,803
A reflection, no doubt,
of your triumphs and your betrayal.

55
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:35,162
You're wounded,

56
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:36,728
powerless.

57
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:40,600
Think of your legacy, Belthazor.

58
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:43,283
Die as a legend,

59
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:45,087
not a coward.

60
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:36,445
Mind if I hitch a ride?

61
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,281
You going to the wake?

62
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:42,044
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Come on.

63
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:50,243
- Hey, I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

64
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:53,765
I am going to school and then...

65
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,042
...I'm going to Cole's.

66
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:59,201
Okay, aren't you forgetting a little
something like vanquishing Belthazor?

67
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:03,078
Wait, I thought you had to write
a spell to summon him first.

68
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:04,278
Yes, and it's done.

69
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,758
I'm using the one that we called
Melinda from the past with.

70
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:09,483
- Just rewrote it a bit.
- Really? You think it'll work?

71
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,964
Well, yeah. I mean, it should.
It's magic calling magic.

72
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:14,364
Although, in this case, dark magic.

73
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:17,282
Phoebe, why are you going
to Cole's again?

74
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:19,121
I mean, what do you
really expect to find?

75
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:21,687
Actually, I was gonna go
to his office.

76
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,521
How do you know
I've already been to Cole's?

77
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:27,085
Well, you got a parking ticket there
yesterday when you borrowed my car.

78
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:30,486
- Sorry. I'll pay for it.
- Phoebe, that's not the point.

79
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:34,358
Look, please don't take this out on me,
all right? I'm not the bad guy.

80
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:36,161
I know. I'd just like
some understanding.

81
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,523
You know, some support here.

82
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:41,244
Look, I can't support you when I think
you're setting yourself up to get hurt.

83
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,966
And I have to be honest with you.
We have to be honest with each other.

84
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,118
That's a promise we made

85
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:48,519
when Belthazor tried
to split us apart, remember?

86
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:52,199
Yeah. It just doesn't help that you
never liked Cole from the beginning.

87
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:55,406
Yeah, well... I mean, you never really
liked any of my boyfriends either.

88
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:57,440
That's very true.

89
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:01,759
I'm sorry, all right?
This is your call, not mine.

90
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:03,243
Thank you.

91
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:07,967
- Okay, are we gonna do this or what?
- We are. Phoebe's not.

92
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:11,559
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah. Go to Cole's.

93
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:15,364
It's fine. We don't need the power
of three to vanquish, just the potion.

94
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:19,837
Okay, well, why don't you
take this in case.

95
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:23,086
Okay, just... You guys,
no more whispering, okay?

96
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:25,922
It's hard enough for me to know
that Cole's keeping secrets from me.

97
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,165
I can't take it from you too.

98
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:55,522
- This is gonna be messy.
- That's why we Scotchgard.

99
00:08:56,489 --> 00:08:58,366
- You ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

100
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:00,326
All right.

101
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:04,283
Magic forces, black and white
Reaching out through space and light

102
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:08,687
Be he far or be he near
Bring us the demon Belthazor here

103
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:13,684
- It's working.
- All right, you ready?

104
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,642
- On three. One. Two. Three.
- One. Two. Three.

105
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:21,998
There's no boom.

106
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,200
- Why is there no boom?
- I don't know.

107
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:28,525
- Stupid witches.
- He's not...

108
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,485
You know what? That is an antique.

109
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:38,800
Stop! Not the clock.

110
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:41,648
We can't afford
to keep fixing that thing.

111
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:49,324
Unless Belthazor can morph,
that is definitely not him.

112
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,639
That doesn't make sense.
How did we get the wrong demon?

113
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:55,649
Hey, do you think that you
could just unfreeze his head?

114
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:57,959
- That way we could ask.
- His head?

115
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:00,125
- Yeah, his head.
- Why not?

116
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:06,439
- That's different.
- That's cool.

117
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,082
What did you do to me?

118
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:10,359
Hi. You know what,
you're sort of frozen in midair.

119
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:13,566
Therefore, we'll be asking
the questions, okay? Who are you?

120
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:17,318
Someone who's going to butcher you
if you don't unfreeze me right now.

121
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:18,798
Okay.

122
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,323
What? It was worth it.

123
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:34,838
All right, you start talking,
or we start the bonus round.

124
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:37,165
I am Krell, a Zotar.

125
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:40,042
Hi, I'm Prue, a Scorpio.
Where is Belthazor?

126
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:43,602
Wait.

127
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,043
Don't.

128
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,086
I won't attack if you don't.

129
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:50,720
I'm a bounty hunter.

130
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,528
I track fugitive demons.

131
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:56,687
And it looks like
we're after the same one.

132
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:21,642
Cole? Oh, I'm so sorry.
I was just looking for Cole Turner.

133
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:24,881
That's all right. So am I.

134
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:28,837
Reece Davidson,
DA Bureau of Investigations.

135
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:30,926
- And you are?
- Phoebe.

136
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:32,118
Phoebe?

137
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:35,087
Is that like Cher or Madonna,
or do you have a last name?

138
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,521
No, of course.

139
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:40,442
Halliwell. Phoebe Halliwell.

140
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:42,600
- Is Cole okay?
- How do you know him?

141
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:45,960
- You didn't answer my question.
- I know.

142
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,689
Look, I have no idea
if he's all right or not.

143
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:50,805
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

144
00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:52,766
Nobody's heard from him
since Monday.

145
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:58,045
- You his girl?
- Yeah, I'm his girl.

146
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:00,638
Well, did he mention anything to you
about what he was doing?

147
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:02,288
- Where he was going?
- No.

148
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:04,485
A couple of weeks ago
he had a suitcase packed,

149
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:06,924
- but he said his plans had changed.
- What plans?

150
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:09,081
I don't know.

151
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:12,606
Something about a big case
that he was working on?

152
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:15,402
Couldn't have been.

153
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:19,323
No. According to his file, he hasn't
been working on a case, big or small,

154
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:24,205
not for a couple of months.
All he's done is file extensions.

155
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,398
Makes you wonder
what he's been doing with himself.

156
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:30,918
Well,

157
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:33,927
if you happen to hear from him,

158
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,758
or if you think of anything
that might help, call me. Okay?

159
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:40,963
Okay?

160
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:43,838
Yeah.

161
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:57,361
I should've known better
than to underestimate him.

162
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:59,485
I thought because Belthazor
couldn't shimmer,

163
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:01,367
his other powers
were useless as well.

164
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:03,645
So you don't have the power
to vanquish him.

165
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:04,958
Obviously not.

166
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:08,519
Otherwise, I wouldn't have needed
to intercept your calling card, would I?

167
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:11,203
Hey, you know what? How about
next time I just freeze your head

168
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:14,207
- and then maybe I can kick you in...
- All right.

169
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:16,599
So Belthazor was sent
by the Triad to kill us.

170
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,919
How do we know that you
weren't sent by them too?

171
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:20,278
You're joking, right?

172
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:25,846
I don't believe this.
You really don't know?

173
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:29,645
Your whitelighter must really
be sleeping on the job.

174
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:31,805
- Hey. Now wait a minute, pal.
- Piper.

175
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:35,807
- What don't we know?
- Belthazor killed the Triad.

176
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:39,048
That's why he's on the run.
That's why I'm here.

177
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:40,477
Why would he do that?

178
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,123
Probably because
they were going to kill him

179
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:45,718
for failing to kill you.

180
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,799
Ironically, his inability to shimmer
saved him from you killing him.

181
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:53,001
So instead we got you.

182
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:57,162
Believe me, just the thought of working
with you turns my stomachs.

183
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:59,925
- Stomachs?
- But...

184
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:05,165
...right now, I'm more interested
in killing Belthazor than witches.

185
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:09,288
Like it or not, we need each other.

186
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:11,002
You can't find him without me,

187
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:13,598
I can't vanquish him
without your potion.

188
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,487
So then you know where he is?

189
00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:18,604
Prue, you can't be
seriously considering this.

190
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:21,687
- Answer the question.
- I can track his scent, his blood,

191
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:24,204
when he's in his demonic form,
not his human one.

192
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:27,765
Fortunately, he can't maintain
his human self for long,

193
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:30,238
especially wounded. It drains him.

194
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:33,088
Hi. Could you come here?
Over here. Please?

195
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,126
We've tried working
with demons before.

196
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:38,725
It was a bad idea then,
and it's definitely a bad idea now.

197
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:41,801
- We'll let you know.
- No, you'll let me know now.

198
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:46,278
Think fast.

199
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:50,206
Belthazor won't stop
trying to kill you.

200
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:53,645
Only the heads
of the Charmed Ones

201
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:57,683
will convince The Source
to spare him.

202
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:02,759
- Leo.
- Leo.

203
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:06,881
Cole?

204
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:09,244
Cole, are you in there?

205
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:13,606
Sorry.

206
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:47,882
Cole?

207
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:51,247
Hello?

208
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:28,046
Cole?

209
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:51,279
- Cole.
- You really shouldn't be here.

210
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,445
Okay, Cole, come on. Lay down.

211
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:03,327
Lay down. Easy.

212
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,320
Easy.

213
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:07,957
Are you okay?

214
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:11,724
- Do I look okay?
- I'm sorry.

215
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:14,119
- Okay, let's see how bad this is.
- No, no. No, don't.

216
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,639
- Believe me, I've seen worse, Cole.
- I said, don't.

217
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:20,198
Please.

218
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:27,522
- We gotta get you to the hospital.
- It's not safe there, they'll find me.

219
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:28,798
Who will find you?

220
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:31,727
What's going on? Who's after you?

221
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:39,605
There was somebody looking
for you today at your office.

222
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,722
- An investigator.
- You didn't tell him anything, did you?

223
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,963
I don't know anything.

224
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:48,046
What did he look like?
You sure he wasn't a D...?

225
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,404
- A?

226
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:55,364
He said that he was,
and he also said that he needed to...

227
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,761
Okay, come on.
Back down, back down.

228
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:02,647
I'm gonna go get some help, okay?

229
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,958
- Leo?
- Phoebe, come on.

230
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,922
Cole, I am not gonna just sit back
and watch you die, okay?

231
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:12,726
Leo?

232
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:16,086
Okay.

233
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:19,087
I am gonna go back to the house,
okay? And I'm gonna get Leo.

234
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,760
He's a doctor, he can heal you.

235
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:24,967
Okay.

236
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:26,801
Are you sure it's safe for you here?

237
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:29,728
They've already looked for me here,
they won't be back.

238
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:32,357
Not for a while anyway.

239
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:43,480
You better be here when I get back.

240
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:08,598
I don't understand. How can you
not know that the Triad is dead?

241
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:10,407
Don't you think
that's kind of important?

242
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:12,161
Especially since, I don't know,

243
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:14,445
they've been trying to kill us
for the past two years?

244
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:17,646
We've heard rumours, talk,
but that's it. Nothing substantiated.

245
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:20,448
Well, I guess you can
substantiate it now, can't you?

246
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:22,884
Jeez, have you been
sleeping on the job or what?

247
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:26,007
So, Leo, don't mind her.
She's just a little cranky.

248
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:29,002
Well, you know what? I get that way
when demons are trying to kill us.

249
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,325
Piper, I don't think that Krell
was trying to kill us,

250
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:33,923
otherwise, he probably
would have tried by now.

251
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,045
Oh, yeah? Tell that
to the dining room table.

252
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,120
Is there anything in there on Zotars?

253
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:39,881
Yeah, everything
that he said about them,

254
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:42,927
which makes me think that everything
else he has said might be true too.

255
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:45,404
Including the part about
how he likes to kill witches?

256
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:47,565
Including the part about
us working together.

257
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,327
Are you willing to bet our lives on it?

258
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:51,683
Are you willing not to?

259
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:56,005
Look, Piper, if we do nothing

260
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:58,080
and Belthazor somehow
gets all of his powers back,

261
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:02,003
then we are going to be looking
back over our shoulders again.

262
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:04,439
Personally, I'm tired of that.

263
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:09,643
I know. I know, okay? I know.
You think she's right and...

264
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:12,647
If you don't vanquish him now,
you may not get another chance.

265
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:20,201
Magic forces, black and white
Reaching out through space and light

266
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:24,885
Be he far or be he near
Bring us the demon Belthazor here

267
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:29,678
Demon!

268
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:32,197
Phoebe! No, no. Phoebe!

269
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:39,397
What? What is going on?
Who is that?

270
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:42,601
He's a demonic bounty hunter
who is here to help us find Belthazor.

271
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:45,319
Why don't you go sniff something
while we fill her in.

272
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:48,646
There's no time. I just picked up
Belthazor's scent again.

273
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:51,363
All right, give us a minute.
Come here.

274
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:54,005
All right, listen, here's the deal.

275
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,444
Belthazor killed the Triad,
now The Source wants him dead.

276
00:20:56,649 --> 00:20:58,844
Krell is trying to suck up
to The Source,

277
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,198
so he wants to kill Belthazor.

278
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:02,644
Belthazor wants to kill us
so The Source won't kill him.

279
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:05,602
If you work with Krell, you can
vanquish Belthazor before he kills you.

280
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:08,044
Works for me. Leo,
I have to talk to you for a minute.

281
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:10,040
How do you witches
ever get anything done?

282
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:12,922
If we're working together,
we need to move now.

283
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:15,563
- All right, we're ready.
- Do you have the potion?

284
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:18,841
- Do you have the scent?
- I said I did, didn't I?

285
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:22,479
You two come with me. The other
should go to the old cemetery.

286
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:23,917
Wait. Split up? Why?

287
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:26,359
Because he might
be hiding there, that's why.

288
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:28,687
Evil frequent cemeteries.

289
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:31,119
Makes it difficult for me
to track a demon's scent there.

290
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,722
Belthazor knows that.

291
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:35,767
Okay, so why don't
Leo and I go to the cemetery

292
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:37,362
and you guys go with him.

293
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:40,003
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

294
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:43,283
All right, let's go. We're ready.

295
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:46,725
Oh, hey, I almost forgot to ask.
Did you find out anything about Cole?

296
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,965
No, nothing at all about Cole.

297
00:21:52,969 --> 00:21:54,561
We need to go.

298
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:00,641
Phoebe, we shouldn't
even be here. Belthazor...

299
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:04,802
Can wait. Cole can't.
Leo, he will die without your help.

300
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:07,000
- Then he should be in a hospital.
- He won't go.

301
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:09,245
Phoebe, I cannot heal mortals,
you know that.

302
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:11,877
Not unless they were hurt by evil.
It's against the rules.

303
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:14,603
So break the rules.
You've done it before.

304
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:19,408
I'm sorry.

305
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:23,367
That wasn't fair.

306
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:25,921
I just...

307
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:28,201
I can't let him die, Leo.

308
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:32,047
You shouldn't be asking me
to do this.

309
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:33,841
I know.

310
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:36,203
But I am.

311
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:43,006
Cole.

312
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:46,807
Cole, come here.

313
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:16,968
- Leo, what's the matter?
- Something's not right.

314
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:23,565
Leo, are you okay?

315
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:26,168
Yeah, I think so.

316
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:30,488
Cole.

317
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:33,726
- Phoebe.
- It's okay.

318
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:35,004
You're okay now.

319
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:54,487
Here you go, baby.

320
00:23:57,529 --> 00:23:58,882
Thanks.

321
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:00,528
I feel like I've been hit by a truck.

322
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:03,004
You're lucky to be feeling
anything right now.

323
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,245
Yeah, I know.

324
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,687
You must be one hell of a doctor.

325
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:13,805
He is. He's the best.

326
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:17,960
- I owe you one.
- Forget it.

327
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:22,007
Phoebe, can I talk to you out here?

328
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:26,964
- Go ahead, I'm fine.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

329
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:37,398
What's the matter?

330
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:39,799
Phoebe, listen to me.
I think we should get out of here.

331
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:42,045
I agree. Whoever's after him
could come back.

332
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:44,763
That is not what I'm talking about.
You saw what happened.

333
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:46,123
Yeah, you healed him.

334
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:49,526
No, Phoebe, I only healed part of him.
That has never happened before.

335
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,281
Well, maybe it's just
because he's weak.

336
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:54,640
That is not the reason.
I can heal mortals completely.

337
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:59,922
There is no other explanation.
He is not who you think he is.

338
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:02,125
No.

339
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:04,843
- I don't understand.
- He is a demon, Phoebe.

340
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:08,081
For all we know, he could be the
demon you were trying to vanquish.

341
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:10,644
- That's ridiculous.
- Think about it, okay?

342
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,720
They're both hurt,
they're both on the run.

343
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,203
You saw where Cole's wound is.

344
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:16,837
It is the same place where Piper
cut the flesh from Belthazor.

345
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:20,081
- No. I don't believe it.
- You have to believe it.

346
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:22,200
No, I don't, Leo.

347
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't.

348
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:29,243
Maybe you should just go.

349
00:25:29,449 --> 00:25:31,724
No way I'm leaving
you here alone with him.

350
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:33,487
I have the potion, don't I?

351
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:36,884
Just go.

352
00:25:57,969 --> 00:25:59,880
Everything all right?

353
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:01,488
Yeah.

354
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:03,562
Everything's fine.

355
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:13,279
I can smell his blood. He's close.

356
00:26:13,449 --> 00:26:14,802
Where?

357
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:17,964
Get your potions.

358
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:20,798
You know, it's too bad
that he's such a bad guy

359
00:26:20,969 --> 00:26:22,448
because he could
really come in handy.

360
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:24,486
Don't push it.

361
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:37,487
Vanquish him.

362
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:41,207
Hey, what's going on?
Who are you?

363
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:43,758
It's a trick. He's in his human form.

364
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:46,602
- Throw the potion.
- I don't know, Krell.

365
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:48,919
Don't you think he would've
picked a better human?

366
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:51,398
- No offence, honey.
- None taken.

367
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:55,284
- Here. Give me that.
- Hey. Easy.

368
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,517
And you call yourself a Zotar.

369
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:09,362
- Where did you get this coat?
- I didn't do anything.

370
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,165
- Tell me.
- I just found it.

371
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:15,320
Leave him alone.
He doesn't know anything.

372
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:17,167
Yeah.

373
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,765
Thanks, lady.

374
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:28,523
Touch me again, witch,
and I'll kill you.

375
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,008
You had no reason
to hurt that man.

376
00:27:30,209 --> 00:27:32,677
I'm a demon.
It's my nature to hurt people.

377
00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:34,959
Yeah. It's in our nature
to protect them.

378
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:37,848
He's a pathetic wretch.
His life means nothing.

379
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:41,325
If you'd let me torture him,
we'd know where he found the coat.

380
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:44,045
- Whatever it takes?
- That's right.

381
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:47,082
Well, from here on out,
it's gonna take doing things our way.

382
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:50,520
Then we will fail,

383
00:27:50,689 --> 00:27:52,680
because your morality cripples you.

384
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:56,123
It blinds you from doing
what must be done.

385
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:59,804
There are better ways of getting
answers out of people, Krell.

386
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:04,527
Maybe Phoebe can get
a premonition off this thing.

387
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:08,119
Well, at least we know Belthazor
has very expensive taste.

388
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:11,444
What? What is it?

389
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:15,080
How long ago
did the Triad send Belthazor?

390
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:16,438
Two months ago. Why?

391
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:20,237
Does this look familiar to you?

392
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,759
- I don't know, why?
- Because Cole has one exactly like it.

393
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,800
Cole?

394
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:28,284
- You think Cole is...?
- Belthazor's human form.

395
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:33,559
Too bad Leo had to leave like that.

396
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:36,243
I didn't really get a chance
to thank him properly.

397
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:38,206
He knows.

398
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:42,959
He knows what?

399
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:45,321
He knows how grateful you are.

400
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:48,802
Good.

401
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:52,563
Still,

402
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:55,289
I don't know how he did it.
Sure like to know what his secret is.

403
00:28:55,489 --> 00:28:58,128
- Yeah, I'll bet.
- Sorry?

404
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:02,966
Nothing. Never mind.

405
00:29:03,129 --> 00:29:06,644
Hey, don't you think
you should lay down and rest?

406
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:09,687
I mean, you are still hurt.

407
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:12,608
I can't. I've still got those people
who did this to me to deal with.

408
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:16,362
Yeah, and you won't tell me
who they are, huh?

409
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:19,565
I really can't.

410
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:23,039
They don't have anything to do
with that case you're working on?

411
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:27,122
The reason I ask is because when
that DA investigator came by today,

412
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:31,567
he was asking me about it, and
I realized I really didn't know anything.

413
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,441
Looking for something?

414
00:29:37,449 --> 00:29:39,405
A piece of paper.

415
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,322
I wanted to write myself a little note.

416
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:45,160
It's right in front of you,
by the phone.

417
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:52,047
Thanks.

418
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:08,243
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna vanquish him.

419
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:10,206
We're gonna vanquish
Phoebe's boyfriend?

420
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:13,327
- That's gonna cause some problems.
- If you hesitate, he'll kill us all.

421
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:15,684
Excuse me, I'm having
a private conversation over here.

422
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:18,886
You know, I can't believe I let him out
of that demon trap when I caught him.

423
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:21,961
- What was I thinking?
- We don't know anything for sure yet.

424
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:26,241
- Leo, what are you doing here?
- I didn't wanna get in between,

425
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,206
- but I didn't know what to do.
- About what?

426
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,445
- I think Cole is...
- Belthazor's human form.

427
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:32,361
- That's why we're here.
- How did you know?

428
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:33,558
Where's Phoebe?

429
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:35,441
She's upstairs with Cole,
apartment seven.

430
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:37,799
- Tell me you didn't heal him?
- Well, not completely.

431
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:40,728
- You idiot.
- Leo.

432
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:42,567
Phoebe begged me.
I didn't know what to do.

433
00:30:42,729 --> 00:30:44,685
You stay here, we'll fix it.

434
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:50,518
Is there something wrong, Phoebe?
Something you're not telling me?

435
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,567
Don't you think
you have that backwards?

436
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:54,526
Meaning?

437
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:56,759
You're the one
with all the secrets, right?

438
00:30:56,929 --> 00:30:59,443
Am I? Are you sure about that?

439
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:02,365
I don't really know
what I'm sure about anymore.

440
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,997
Yeah. I know how you feel.

441
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:07,568
I doubt that.

442
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:13,366
I think I know what's going on here,
Phoebe, and I'm sorry it's come to this.

443
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:18,162
But I'm not sorry about us.
You need to know that.

444
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:22,680
You never told me
where you were from.

445
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:25,804
- You never asked.
- I'm asking now.

446
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:30,767
Why don't you ask me what
you really want to know, Phoebe?

447
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:32,078
I won't lie to you.

448
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:36,204
Who are you?

449
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:41,841
Krell.

450
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:48,357
No.

451
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:54,607
Phoebe.

452
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:04,437
- You let Belthazor escape.
- You almost killed our sister.

453
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:08,682
Your sister is dead anyway.
He only needed her to get away.

454
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:14,646
- I don't think Cole will hurt Phoebe.
- No, but maybe Belthazor would.

455
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,885
Then why hasn't he?
He's had so many chances.

456
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:21,088
He just used her
until he could get all three of you.

457
00:32:21,729 --> 00:32:23,606
The Charmed Ones.

458
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:27,242
Why he couldn't follow through,
I'll never understand.

459
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:30,566
- Maybe he fell in love.
- Yeah, or maybe that was just a trick.

460
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:32,720
I mean, demons will do
whatever it takes, remember?

461
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:34,999
Glad to see I've had
a positive influence on you.

462
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:39,764
I can save your sister,
if it's not too late.

463
00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:42,199
- Why would you want to?
- I wouldn't.

464
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:45,884
But I'll do it if it's the only way
to kill Belthazor.

465
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,323
Give me the potion.

466
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:49,645
I can find him
and get to him faster alone.

467
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:50,838
Nice try, forget it.

468
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:53,398
You already said that you can't
track him if he can shimmer.

469
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:56,282
But he can't shimmer well.

470
00:32:56,449 --> 00:32:57,882
He needs time to recharge.

471
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:00,279
Your whitelighter
only healed his human half.

472
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:04,846
- I'm sorry, his human half?
- That's why the Triad sent him.

473
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:07,318
He understands you.
He can blend in.

474
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,168
A full-blooded demon
could never have gotten so close.

475
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,008
Give me the potion.

476
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:17,606
If you hurt her

477
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:19,521
we'll track you down.

478
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:28,839
- Do you really trust him?
- No. Come on.

479
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,439
- Where are we going?
- Oh, to where demons hide.

480
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:39,000
Can we stop with the shimmering
all over the place? I'm gonna vomit.

481
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:40,921
I had to lose Krell.

482
00:33:48,969 --> 00:33:51,244
Now it's time to vanquish you.

483
00:33:56,449 --> 00:33:58,041
Don't even think
that's gonna save you.

484
00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:01,002
I don't. I just wanted you to see
who I really am, Phoebe.

485
00:34:01,209 --> 00:34:04,281
I've seen who you really are,
Belthazor.

486
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:08,077
Wait. Wait.

487
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:11,446
- I won't hurt you.
- No?

488
00:34:12,769 --> 00:34:14,680
It's a little too late for that,
don't you think?

489
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:17,966
Why?

490
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,766
Why didn't you just kill me?

491
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:23,201
Why did you have to put me
through all this?

492
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:26,725
Was it some sick, twisted,
demonic thrill?

493
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:29,323
- Was that what it was?
- No. That's not it.

494
00:34:29,529 --> 00:34:31,759
- Then what was it?
- I couldn't kill you.

495
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:35,161
I tried. I was supposed to.

496
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:38,241
I mean, at first, you and your sisters
thwarted my attempts,

497
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,969
even when I went back in time
to destroy your line

498
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:42,687
on All Hallow's Eve.

499
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:46,125
- That was you?
- Then Troxa. Andras.

500
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:50,322
I got him to strip your powers,
to make you vulnerable.

501
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:53,885
I had you too,
right where I wanted you.

502
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:56,808
All I had to do was finish the job.

503
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:00,127
But I couldn't...

504
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:03,002
...because I realized I loved you.

505
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:07,802
- You bastard.
- That's the truth, Phoebe.

506
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:12,324
I admit, everything else is a lie.

507
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:13,524
But not that.

508
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:16,366
I know you know that too...

509
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,643
...in your heart.

510
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:22,685
This isn't a mask, Phoebe.

511
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:24,726
It's who I am.

512
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,117
Who I really am.

513
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:31,280
I'm half human.
My father was mortal.

514
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:35,084
- You're lying.
- How else would I bleed red?

515
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:38,958
Even as my demon self.
You have to believe me, Phoebe.

516
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:42,845
I forgot what it was like
to be human, to feel, to care.

517
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:47,119
Then I met you.

518
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:51,720
That doesn't change anything,
because you're still a demon.

519
00:35:51,929 --> 00:35:54,159
One who's done
unspeakable things.

520
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:00,488
But you've awakened
something in me, Phoebe.

521
00:36:00,689 --> 00:36:03,681
Something I thought had died
a long time ago.

522
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,367
My humanity.

523
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:08,248
My ability to love.

524
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:12,366
- I wanna believe you.
- Then let me prove it to you.

525
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:16,724
Vanquish me.

526
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:25,687
Cole.

527
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:30,286
Cole, you gotta get up.
Cole, get up! Come on. Come on.

528
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:45,289
Cole. No, don't do this. Come on.

529
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:47,004
Come on.

530
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:49,046
You're fine.

531
00:36:55,649 --> 00:36:58,038
I should've known
you'd come back here.

532
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,602
Don't hurt her.

533
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:02,164
You disappoint, Belthazor.

534
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:04,240
You've changed.

535
00:37:04,449 --> 00:37:08,681
You let your weaker human side
affect your better judgement.

536
00:37:08,889 --> 00:37:10,766
It's going to cost you your life.

537
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:28,768
Witch.

538
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:31,441
No.

539
00:37:43,649 --> 00:37:44,923
Do you believe me now?

540
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:57,363
- Phoebe.
- Phoebe.

541
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,366
Phoebe.

542
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:04,687
I better go.

543
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:06,959
They'll keep looking for you
until they find you.

544
00:38:07,169 --> 00:38:09,000
Your sisters?

545
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:12,123
- Them too.
- Phoebe?

546
00:38:15,729 --> 00:38:17,640
Give me your shirt.

547
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:19,242
- My shirt?
- Hurry up.

548
00:38:27,169 --> 00:38:29,160
Give me your hand.

549
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:32,405
Trust me.

550
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:57,404
- Phoebe.
- There.

551
00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:00,203
Nobody will look for you anymore.

552
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:02,362
You're dead.

553
00:39:05,249 --> 00:39:06,887
Phoebe?

554
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:11,317
Down here. You have to go. Please.

555
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:27,766
Pheebs?

556
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:31,163
Phoebe, thank God you're okay.

557
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:34,684
He killed Krell.

558
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,841
And you did what you had to do.

559
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:44,726
I know.

560
00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:16,687
- We brought you some comfort food.
- Thanks. I'm not really that hungry.

561
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:19,720
You wanna talk?

562
00:40:21,729 --> 00:40:24,323
I don't know
what there is to talk about.

563
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:29,246
- You were right as usual.
- I didn't want to be right.

564
00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:31,246
I know.

565
00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:34,603
Believe me, Prue,
you have nothing to apologize for.

566
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:38,002
But I do.

567
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,966
I don't...

568
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:42,481
What I did was...

569
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:44,680
Phoebe, he fooled us all,
not just you.

570
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:47,084
That's not what I mean.

571
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:49,644
I don't know, I just... I feel so...

572
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:55,082
...ashamed.
- You can't be so hard on yourself.

573
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,800
You didn't do anything wrong,
you know.

574
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:02,038
Didn't I?

575
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:09,081
Well, the important thing
is that it's over.

576
00:41:09,929 --> 00:41:11,647
And we can get on
with our lives now.

577
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:15,281
At least until the next
Belthazor attacks.

578
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:18,483
We'll leave you alone.

579
00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:21,997
Let us know if you need anything.

580
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:24,006
Thanks.
