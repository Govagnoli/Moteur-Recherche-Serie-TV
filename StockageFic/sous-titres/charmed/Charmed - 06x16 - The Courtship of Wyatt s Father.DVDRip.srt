1
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,340
- Here you go, thanks for coming.
- Thanks.

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:10,135
Thanks for inviting us,
it was a fun party.

3
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,638
Oh, I still can't believe
that Wyatt is 1 already.

4
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,474
Oh, I know. You can't.

5
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,810
- Nice to finally meet you, Leo.
- Yeah, you too.

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,479
Frank and some of the other dads

7
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,981
get the kids together on Saturdays,
if you're interested.

8
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,777
- Yeah, thanks.
- Excellent.

9
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:28,737
- Thank you.
- Bye.

10
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,822
- I'll call you.
- Okay, great.

11
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,706
I am exhausted.

12
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,542
Did you have fun?

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,087
- Did you like it?
- Yeah, he was a really good boy

14
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,589
and only made
Mommy freeze the room once.

15
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,384
He was excited, it's his birthday.

16
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,470
He was excited to see you.
He misses you.

17
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,099
I know. I miss him too.

18
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,435
Hey, you guys want
any more champagne?

19
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,189
Come on, we don't want it
to go to waste.

20
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,442
- How about it, Dad?
- Elders aren't allowed to drink.

21
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,154
Oh, come on, when on Earth,
you should do as earthlings do.

22
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,616
- Sorry.
- Not that I'm complaining or anything,

23
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,952
because you guys
did such great work,

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,373
but champagne, chocolate-covered
strawberries, oysters?

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,792
Aren't the kids a little young
for the aphrodisiacs?

26
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,961
They're aphrodisiacs?

27
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,005
Who knew?

28
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,339
Bubbly?

29
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,300
- Paige?
- What?

30
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,427
Come on, there were
milk and cookies here too.

31
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:39,183
You know, maybe if there were
more kids living in this house

32
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:43,020
I would know what to get.
Did you ever stop to think about that?

33
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,938
Excuse me.

34
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,652
She's been weird
since she changed her hair colour.

35
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,988
She'll probably change it back.

36
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,741
Okay, forget about the strawberries,
she's on to us.

37
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,035
What do you mean?
She knows about Chris?

38
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:01,371
No, she knows we're up
to something.

39
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,333
I can't believe how hard it is
to get two people laid.

40
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,668
Paige, that is disgusting.

41
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,213
Well, it's what
we're trying to do, right?

42
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,299
No, we are trying to romance
Piper and Leo together

43
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,010
so they can conceive Chris,
our nephew.

44
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,553
And that's different how?

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,848
Well, because what you said is very
Springer, what I said is very Oprah.

46
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,812
Well, whatever show we're watching,
we're running out of time.

47
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,565
At least Chris is.
We should probably tell him.

48
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,068
Yes. Chris.

49
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,156
Hey. So how's it going?

50
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,992
- Not so good.
- Well, what do you mean?

51
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,578
- What does she mean?
- We're running out of ideas.

52
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,915
Well, that's too bad, because it has
to happen today or I don't happen.

53
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,668
- Wait, today?
- Yeah, I did the math.

54
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,712
And if I'm not conceived
by midnight tonight, that's it.

55
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,007
I won't be born. Which means
I won't be coming back from the future

56
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:58,178
- to warn you about Wyatt turning evil.
- Yeah, see, that time-travel thing...

57
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,306
What about making a love potion
and just, like, slipping it to them?

58
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,059
No, we're not tricking your parents.

59
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,019
Why not? I'm desperate.

60
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,438
Hey, look, I have an idea.

61
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,400
Call me crazy, but why don't
we just tell them the truth?

62
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,029
Sure, let's give them a massive case
of performance anxiety.

63
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,699
- We're running out of options.
- And time.

64
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,082
Wyatt!

65
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,599
Arrow!

66
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,063
I got you. I got you, I got you.

67
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,320
You're okay. You're okay.

68
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,990
Thanks for saving my life.

69
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,491
Hope it wasn't for nothing.

70
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,982
- Is that enough to scry with?
- Only one way to find out.

71
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,611
At least he waited till after the party
to attack, that was nice of him.

72
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,198
What I don't understand is,
why would the darklighter attack at all?

73
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,950
I mean, with all of us here
at the same time, it's suicide.

74
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,954
All the more reason to find him
and stop him before he tries again.

75
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,541
I don't think he was after a
whitelighter, I think he was after me.

76
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:16,877
Or Wyatt.

77
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,004
Well, then why don't you
take Piper up there

78
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,298
- and take Wyatt too?
- Yeah, I'll go with you.

79
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,967
But you're not allowed.

80
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,513
All right, so then we'll go
to the magic school.

81
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,015
You'll be safe there.
You can't be hurt, right?

82
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,476
That's great. One big happy family.

83
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,062
You change him, I'll pack him.

84
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,774
Come on.

85
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,151
Think now is a good time
to tell them?

86
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,820
No. The sooner we take care
of the darklighter,

87
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,614
the sooner we make you.

88
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:50,661
- I'm gonna start scrying.
- And I will go start the love potion.

89
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,497
Wait. I thought you were
against making the love potion.

90
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,667
Not if it's gonna save one of
my two favourite nephews.

91
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,812
- Nice play, my friend.
- It worked, didn't it?

92
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,773
Not yet it hasn't.
Not until the witches come after you.

93
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,400
They'll come.

94
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,653
- They always do.
- But will the Elder?

95
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:28,365
I mean, now that he knows you're after
him, won't he think it's too dangerous?

96
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,450
Not this Elder.

97
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,578
He's blinded by fatherhood...

98
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,998
...by his unwavering desire
to protect his son.

99
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,834
He can't be sure I'm not
after the boy too.

100
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,462
He'll come.

101
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,215
But...

102
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,093
...he won't be immune
to the poison.

103
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,639
- I'll need a dozen more for later.
- They're being forged as we speak.

104
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,685
You're all right to go through
with this, Damien?

105
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:00,355
A deal was struck, I was chosen.

106
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,401
Besides, he deserves to get
what he paid for, doesn't he?

107
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,570
Leo out of the way.

108
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,991
Just make sure the code's
properly prepared.

109
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,077
We only get one shot at this.

110
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,623
All right, arm up.

111
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,960
But remember, we're only supposed
to distract the witches, not harm them.

112
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,879
They're not the target this time...

113
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,673
...the Elder is.

114
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:40,187
These aren't just books, Sara,
they're legacies.

115
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:46,443
Handed down over the ages
by other magical beings.

116
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,154
And worthy of your great care.

117
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,202
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

118
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,703
- Good.
- Gideon.

119
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,789
Leo. What a pleasant surprise.

120
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,250
- How are you, my boy?
- I've been better.

121
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,211
A darklighter attacked,
I think he's after me.

122
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,216
- Are you certain?
- I don't know.

123
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,177
He may be trying to get me
out of the way to get to Wyatt.

124
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,305
I dropped Piper and Wyatt off at
the nursery. I hope that's all right.

125
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,682
Of course. Absolutely.

126
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,434
I better get back to Phoebe and Paige,
see if I can help.

127
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:20,686
No, you shouldn't.

128
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,480
You should go up with the other
Elders, where you'll be safe.

129
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,817
- What about the darklighter?
- It's not your responsibility.

130
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,736
That's for the sisters to handle.
It's what they do.

131
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,321
Well, I can't just sit around

132
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,407
while someone is after my son.
I'm a father now.

133
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,827
No, you're an Elder now,
and it's time to start acting like one.

134
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,704
Don't you see?

135
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,415
You don't just put yourself at risk
by staying here on Earth,

136
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,292
you put all Elders at risk too.

137
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,669
If they get you,
they get access to us all.

138
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,380
- I know, but...
- You can't justify staying here

139
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,884
any longer, not with this,
not anymore.

140
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,178
It's time to fully accept
your calling...

141
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,890
...one that necessarily transcends
the sins of the flesh,

142
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,392
family, even fatherhood.

143
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:06,190
One that requires you to cut the ties
that bind for everyone's sake.

144
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,234
I can't.

145
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,822
At least not until I know
my son is safe. I'm sorry.

146
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,173
What are you still doing here?

147
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,093
Thought you'd be out and about
by now.

148
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,346
Clarence, hey.

149
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,432
- Didn't hear you come up.
- You mind?

150
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,520
Please, go ahead.

151
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,730
Beautiful day outside, isn't it?

152
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:50,734
Is it? I haven't really noticed.
I've been too busy...

153
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,611
...rechecking something.

154
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:55,322
Whole world seems to be
too busy nowadays.

155
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:59,660
Nobody's got time to just
enjoy their day anymore.

156
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,287
Well, it doesn't get any better
in the future either.

157
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,206
I mean...

158
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:07,584
- I'd imagine.
- Future don't mean squat to me.

159
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,628
I'm too old to worry about it.

160
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:13,006
Shouldn't to you either.
You're too young.

161
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,385
Well, unfortunately...

162
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:20,180
...l'm kind of obsessed with it.

163
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,393
- You all right?
- Yeah.

164
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,520
Yeah, I just...

165
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,188
I just probably need to eat.

166
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,774
What you need is to get out
of this hole.

167
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,903
Get some sun. Live a little.

168
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,321
Believe me...

169
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,657
...l'm trying.

170
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,285
Do that.

171
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,386
I thought you were making
a love potion.

172
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,264
- I am.
- Then why did it blow up?

173
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,934
- Maybe I'm trying too hard?
- Or maybe it just wasn't meant to be.

174
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,312
- Phoebe!
- Come on, you weren't thinking

175
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,689
- the exact same thing?
- No.

176
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:14,610
Okay, fine. But for, like, a second.
The point is, Chris is meant to be.

177
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,154
But not if he changed too much
by coming here.

178
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,198
You know, messed up
his own time line.

179
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,658
We're talking about
his very existence.

180
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,536
Paige, I know, but there's only
so much we can do.

181
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,664
Especially now,
with that darklighter out there.

182
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:31,960
I just think that we have to face
the reality that Chris' destiny

183
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,755
might have been just to come here
and warn us about Wyatt,

184
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,590
and that's all.

185
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,968
Hey.

186
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,513
Oh, my God, Chris, I'm so sorry.

187
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:46,391
No, it's okay. I've actually
been wondering the same thing.

188
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,061
You have?

189
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:50,938
Yeah.

190
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,233
I kind of have
the strangest feeling, like...

191
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,487
I don't know, it's really hard to explain,
but it feels like I'm...

192
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:02,157
I'm floating.
Like I'm not really here, you know?

193
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,034
That doesn't sound good.

194
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,286
Well, you have to fight it.
We still have time.

195
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:07,996
Not much.

196
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,086
I've never seen it do that before.

197
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:17,714
Maybe that means
there's more than one?

198
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:19,883
I'll go get Piper.

199
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,763
- I'll go too.
- No, you stay here.

200
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,306
Okay, finish the potion.

201
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,725
When we come back,
your parents will be in the mood.

202
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,103
Okay.

203
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,371
- Are you sure this is the place?
- Yeah, down that alley.

204
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,415
Thank God we didn't orb in.

205
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,458
We couldn't, they'd have known
we were coming.

206
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,252
Well, maybe they know already.

207
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,045
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

208
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,840
since when do darklighters hang out
in broad daylight like this?

209
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,925
It could be a trap.
Maybe you should stay here.

210
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,344
No, I'm the bait, remember?

211
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,431
Besides, if it is a trap, you might
need me to help you orb back.

212
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:11,602
Well, I got Phoebe, you get Piper out
of here for Chris'... For Wyatt's sake.

213
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,146
Let's just do this.

214
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,615
I don't see anything.

215
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,455
You take Piper.

216
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,671
Phoebe, watch out!

217
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,848
Behind you!

218
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,605
Piper!

219
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,444
Phoebe.

220
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,696
- Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
- Yeah.

221
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,573
Maybe we should get me
to the hospital.

222
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,326
Yeah. I got you.

223
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,640
Hey! Hey!

224
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,899
Phoebe? Paige?

225
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,235
Where's my car?

226
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,696
What's going on?
Where did everybody go?

227
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,197
That's a good question.

228
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,075
Well, they've gotta be here
somewhere.

229
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:53,328
- I think we should get out of here.
- No, not without Phoebe. She's hurt.

230
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,789
- Didn't you see her fall?
- But at least she's alive.

231
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,499
- What does that mean?
- I don't know,

232
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,544
but I think we need to get off the street
while we figure this out.

233
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,130
The hospital.
If Paige couldn't get to you,

234
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,883
she'd take Phoebe to the hospital.
Memorial's down the street.

235
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,384
Piper, you don't understand.

236
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:10,512
We can't worry about them right now.
We need to worry about us.

237
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,682
- Leo.
- Piper.

238
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,560
You're not supposed to be here.

239
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,229
Yeah, well, you're not supposed
to be here either.

240
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,939
At least not in one piece.

241
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:24,943
Come on.

242
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,489
- What's wrong with your powers?
- I don't know. Run.

243
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,533
Go, go, go!

244
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,788
You can run, but you can't hide.

245
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,500
You're in my world now!

246
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,799
What part of "don't hurt the witches"
didn't you understand?

247
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,969
What was I supposed to do?
They'd already killed three of us.

248
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:55,015
So what? You're expendable.
We all are for this.

249
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,726
It's bad enough one's wounded now,

250
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,187
but none of them were supposed
to end up there.

251
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,647
None of them!

252
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,483
We were only meant to separate
the Elder from his protectors.

253
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,861
To make the witches fear he died
so they wouldn't try to look for him.

254
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,406
Still, just because she's with him
doesn't mean she can protect him.

255
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,200
No one has powers
in the ghostly plane.

256
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,035
That's why Damien wanted him
sent there.

257
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,454
But that's not the point, now, is it?

258
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,332
Damien may be forced
to kill her now too.

259
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:23,418
And that was specifically
not what he was hired to do.

260
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,297
Worse, the other witches
may be less inclined

261
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,008
to accept the death of a sister
than of a brother-in-law,

262
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,760
especially with their history.

263
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:35,764
All the more reason for us
to keep them distracted...

264
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,308
...at all costs now.

265
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:49,152
No broken bones,
no internal bleeding.

266
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,239
Other than a mild concussion,
I'd say you're a very lucky woman.

267
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,157
Great. Does that mean
I can go home now?

268
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,619
No. Actually, I think I'd like to keep
you here overnight for observation.

269
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,246
Oh, no, that's not possible.

270
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:02,958
Miss Halliwell, I don't have
to remind you, you took quite a fall.

271
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,586
It's possible you might have more
than just a concussion.

272
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,130
And sometimes other symptoms
don't develop for 24 hours.

273
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,425
Yeah, well, I don't have 24 hours.
I gotta go. Gotta go.

274
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,304
- You'll have to sign a release.
- That's fine.

275
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,182
If you feel any dizziness
or light-headedness, call me.

276
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,726
Otherwise, I'll see you in a week
to remove the stitches.

277
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,936
Thanks.

278
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,065
- All right, come on.
- This way.

279
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,652
- Let's go. Get him in three.
- All right, got it.

280
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:36,116
Hey. What did he say?
Are you all right?

281
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:39,119
Yeah. Well, he's releasing me,
isn't he?

282
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:44,541
Okay, don't worry about this, Paige.
We're gonna figure something out.

283
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,668
Okay, but what about Chris?

284
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,671
- What about Chris?
- What if he doesn't exist anymore

285
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,216
because his mom and dad
don't exist anymore?

286
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,551
No, if Piper were gone,

287
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,846
I would sense it. I know it.

288
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:07,564
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- A truck hit a bus.

289
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,788
- Phoebe? Paige?
- They're not here, I'm telling you.

290
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:26,583
- They have to be here. Phoebe's hurt.
- Not in this plane she's not.

291
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,044
The blast, when you blew up
the darklighter,

292
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,129
it must have knocked us
into this other place.

293
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:34,132
One that coexists with our world,
but not with our lives.

294
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,884
What are you talking about?
What world?

295
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,386
I don't know.

296
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,681
I don't think we're here by accident.
I think it's the darklighter's plan,

297
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:44,434
to have us here without our powers
and without your sisters.

298
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,603
Phoebe?

299
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,355
- Excuse us.
- Coming though.

300
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:49,940
Phoebe?

301
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,401
- What?
- Do you hear something?

302
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:53,986
Hear what?

303
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,405
I could have sworn I heard someone
call out my name.

304
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,574
BP's dropping. We're losing him.

305
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,410
Two hundred fifty cc's of lido.
He's flatlining.

306
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:06,206
Come on, come on.
Did anyone call the driver's family?

307
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:09,209
- We still got no pulse. Paddles.
- Paddles.

308
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:12,713
- Two hundred joules.
- Charging.

309
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,423
Clear.

310
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,511
Piper, we gotta keep moving.
We can't stay here.

311
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:23,348
Damn it, Piper,
I don't want you to get hurt too.

312
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,392
Okay.

313
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,401
Am I dead?

314
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,945
Leo, what's going on?

315
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,655
Leo.

316
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,617
Are you an angel?

317
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,586
I know what plane we're on.

318
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,380
The ghostly plane.

319
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:00,093
He's back.

320
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,595
He's stabilizing.

321
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:07,434
Sir, do you know where you are?

322
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,937
- Do you know your name?
- Let's go.

323
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:11,355
Leo.

324
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,107
Leo.

325
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,277
- You must be an angel.
- Leo?

326
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:21,156
What? What's wrong?

327
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:22,825
Piper.

328
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,883
Come on.

329
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,816
I'm telling you, I felt Piper, as if
she were standing right next to me.

330
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,401
- But she wasn't.
- I know.

331
00:21:57,568 --> 00:22:00,988
- I'm still trying to figure that part out.
- Phoebe, Paige.

332
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,408
Chris, you're okay.

333
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:05,993
Which means Piper and Leo
are okay.

334
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,662
Well, I don't know about them,
but I'm...

335
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,915
I'm definitely running out
of time here.

336
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,138
- What?
- I don't know what else to try.

337
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:27,931
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

338
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,474
There's nothing else to try.

339
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:33,103
Oh, great. Why don't you try telling that
to Chris as he fades away.

340
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:34,813
No, I can't.

341
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:38,358
Right. Well, here's the deal.
You felt Piper.

342
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,861
That means she's gotta be
out there somewhere.

343
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:42,946
And if we can figure out where,

344
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,824
then maybe we can figure out
how to bring them back.

345
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:48,368
You said we weren't gonna lose her.

346
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:51,955
- The bus driver.
- The bus driver what?

347
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:54,750
Well, he was dead.
I mean, at least for a little bit.

348
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,335
So maybe that wasn't a coincidence.

349
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:59,213
Maybe he actually did see Leo,
in limbo.

350
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,048
That's good.

351
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,635
No, that's bad, because that would
make them dead.

352
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:08,180
Not if someone put them there,
like the darklighter.

353
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:11,350
- The one Piper vanquished?
- Unless it wasn't really a vanquish.

354
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,644
It was just made to look like
a vanquish.

355
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,980
Okay, ghost. Ghost, ghost, ghost...

356
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:26,949
Sorry.

357
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,870
Good thing you're immune
to the poison.

358
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:34,081
Yeah, too bad you're not.

359
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,999
My, my.

360
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,460
Impressed?

361
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:40,337
Very.

362
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,639
- That should stop the bleeding.
- Thanks.

363
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:56,854
You know, I rather imagined meadows,
waterfalls, maybe even a harp.

364
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,024
Well, this isn't the afterlife.

365
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:02,943
It's...

366
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,904
...a place before that,
to ease the transition.

367
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:08,615
And lucky us, we're stuck here.

368
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:13,328
That is, until our friendly darklighter
helps us move on permanently.

369
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,080
No, we're not gonna let that happen.

370
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,374
We've been through a lot more
than this.

371
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,293
- Have we?
- Are you kidding?

372
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,004
Ever since we met,
it's been one ordeal after the other.

373
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:26,091
Wow, you make it sound so romantic.

374
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:29,928
That's not what I meant.
I mean, look at...

375
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:31,972
...everything we've been through...

376
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,558
...everything we've overcome.

377
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,227
This is just one more thing.

378
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:40,814
This isn't where it ends.

379
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:42,691
I promise.

380
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:46,236
All right, so how
do we get out of here?

381
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:51,074
I don't know. I gotta figure the
darklighter has a way, maybe a portal.

382
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:54,286
- Masked by the explosion?
- Maybe.

383
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,246
Although somebody's gotta be
helping him

384
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,582
with a hell of a lot more powers
than a darklighter.

385
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:01,001
Do you think the portal's still there?

386
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:05,631
Probably. The question is, how do
we access it without our powers?

387
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:08,133
We make Phoebe and Paige
use theirs.

388
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,261
I'm serious.
We're on the ghostly plane,

389
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:13,263
so why can't we, you know,
haunt them?

390
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,766
Make contact
like other normal ghosts do.

391
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:21,063
Because not all other ghosts do. It...

392
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,023
It takes years to learn how
to cross over.

393
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,778
- Besides, you need a connection.
- A bond? You mean, like sisters?

394
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,198
Come on, I know them.
I know they're looking for us,

395
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:32,866
and I know they were at the hospital.

396
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:36,703
- I felt them. I can't explain exactly...
- You don't have to.

397
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:40,290
Far be it for me to question the power
of three after all these years.

398
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:43,335
Okay, so let's go. They'll be
at the house, at the Book of Shadows.

399
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:48,048
That's probably where the darklighter
will be waiting for us. He knows us.

400
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:50,092
He studied us.

401
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:21,123
Not good.

402
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,584
It's almost time, Chris.

403
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:28,630
Clarence. What are you doing here?

404
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:31,592
Actually, I've come for you.

405
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:35,888
It's okay, son, I know.

406
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:41,602
Who are you?

407
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:45,898
Someone who was sent
to make this easier for you.

408
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:49,568
"This"? What do you mean, "this"?

409
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,528
I think you know.

410
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,783
You're an angel of death.

411
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,454
Yours is a unique situation, Chris...

412
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,541
...one which requires special handling.

413
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,961
That's why I wanted
to meet you early.

414
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,297
Ss you could get to know me,

415
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,882
trust me.

416
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:15,427
There's really nothing to be afraid of.

417
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:18,931
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
- Don't fight it, Chris.

418
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,728
- It'll only make it more difficult for you.
- No. Forget that.

419
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:28,357
All right, I still got time.
You stay away from me.

420
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:38,200
You sure a séance is the right move?

421
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:43,121
Well, if they are stuck in the spirit
realm, then they're ghosts, right?

422
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,415
- Hopefully.
- What, now you're a pessimist?

423
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:50,254
Hey, a girl's allowed to vacillate. It's
not like this is an exact science, right?

424
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,881
Okay, the spell is done.

425
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:54,675
Okay, let's do this.

426
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,135
Sorry, I don't mean to be pushy, but...

427
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:59,888
Yeah, we're working on it.
We're working on it.

428
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,473
You don't look so good.

429
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:04,226
Okay.

430
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:07,145
Sister spirit, we call to thee

431
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:10,023
Cross on over, so we may see

432
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:15,362
Wait, that wasn't supposed to happen,
was it?

433
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,531
I'm thinking no.

434
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,748
Okay, now what?

435
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,502
I don't know,
I guess we try to make contact.

436
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:38,844
Chris?

437
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:43,849
Not exactly who I was going for,
but I guess it'll work.

438
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:45,350
What are you doing here?

439
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,979
Ceasing to exist, I think.

440
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,153
- What happened, where did you go?
- I just saw Piper and Leo.

441
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,365
Where did he go?

442
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:02,493
I don't know.

443
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,497
Ask him.

444
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:09,041
What are you talking about?
"Ceasing to exist"?

445
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,502
No time to explain.
I'm a connection to your sisters,

446
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:14,338
and they wanna know how
to get you guys back.

447
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,342
They think somebody made a portal

448
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:21,011
- for the darklighter to pass through.
- Somebody who?

449
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,597
Darklighters!

450
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,809
Chris, where are you?

451
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:30,729
Not so loud.

452
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:48,580
Leo.

453
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,834
Come on. Come on.

454
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:01,760
Piper's not here anymore.
I can't sense her.

455
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:04,137
It's too late.

456
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,474
And not just for Piper and Leo.

457
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,018
Take care.

458
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:16,733
Chris?

459
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:21,655
But if there is a portal,
it's gotta be nearby.

460
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:24,074
Leo, what are you doing?

461
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:25,951
Trying to save you.

462
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:29,997
You... You mean you're trying
to save us, don't you?

463
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:34,877
Look, you need to sit down.

464
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,925
Maybe since the arrow
went straight through...

465
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:45,304
It'll just take longer.

466
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:50,350
- They'll find a way.
- How?

467
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:53,228
We never even had a chance
to tell them where to meet us.

468
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:55,230
They'll figure it out.

469
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:56,899
I know them.

470
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:58,984
In time?

471
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:00,819
Look, Piper, no matter
what happens...

472
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:03,238
- No.
- Keep trying to make contact.

473
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:06,033
- I don't wanna hear it.
- He's not after you, he's after me.

474
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:09,786
Would you please stop trying
to save me?

475
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,335
I'm sorry I got you into this.

476
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:19,213
Yeah, just one ordeal
after another, right?

477
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:33,101
I never stopped loving you.

478
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,124
Phoebe. Paige.

479
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:59,211
- Gideon, we need your help.
- What's wrong?

480
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:02,464
- We think we may have lost Chris.
- What?

481
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:05,634
And Piper and Leo and us too,
if we're not careful.

482
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:07,761
Somebody's got a bunch
of darklighters after us.

483
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:09,471
And one's got Piper and Leo
trapped.

484
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:11,390
- In the ghostly plane.
- The spirit realm.

485
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,600
- Same thing.
- Right.

486
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,561
We made contact,
but then we lost them.

487
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:17,896
And we lost Chris too.
Although we're not sure why,

488
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:20,732
- because she can tell if Piper's dead.
- Yeah, and I can't.

489
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:23,569
She must be still around somewhere,
we just don't know where.

490
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:27,114
So we need to figure out how to use
the darklighter's portal to get them out.

491
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:30,242
And if you follow all that,
you're really a very powerful Elder.

492
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,495
But darklighters don't have the power
to make portals, let alone use them.

493
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:35,789
Right, we have to figure out
who can.

494
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,458
I warned Leo.

495
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,211
I told him something like this
might happen.

496
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,256
What do you need?

497
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:47,759
Well, we know where to find the portal,
we just don't know how to reverse it.

498
00:33:00,606 --> 00:33:02,065
There.

499
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,484
Handy.

500
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,239
Leo?

501
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:13,577
Morning.

502
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:15,662
What are you doing?

503
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:17,956
Just trying to sense them.

504
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,293
Any luck?

505
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:27,925
You don't look so good.

506
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,676
I know.

507
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:33,639
Listen, about last night...

508
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:36,975
I don't have any regrets,
if that's where this is going.

509
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:39,520
It's not.

510
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:42,231
But I'm glad you said that.

511
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:46,527
Because I don't either.

512
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:52,282
I just want you to know that
I don't have any expectations.

513
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:57,412
Because I know everything that you
went through when I became an Elder.

514
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:00,207
And it just...

515
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,002
It wouldn't be fair to put you
through that again.

516
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,338
I'm not sure I understand.

517
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:10,300
Well, neither one of us wanted me
to become an Elder.

518
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,846
But I did anyway.

519
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,934
I was supposed to go up there
right away, but I didn't.

520
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:25,816
Because you wanted to find out
who Chris was and to protect Wyatt.

521
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:29,403
Those aren't the only reasons
I didn't go up there, Piper.

522
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:34,950
I was holding on to you.

523
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:40,122
And because of that,
I've put you at risk,

524
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:43,125
and I've put my son at risk.

525
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:46,753
I can't let that happen anymore.

526
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:49,965
I won't let that happen.

527
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:53,594
Well, fortunately you won't have
to worry about that for much longer.

528
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:57,931
I'm a little surprised, actually.

529
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:00,601
I didn't really think
you'd come back here.

530
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:03,478
I thought I knew you better than that.

531
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:06,356
Oh, well.

532
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:08,233
Let her go.

533
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,943
You don't want her.

534
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,197
No.

535
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:17,743
But I can't pass up my opportunity,
can I? It's in my nature.

536
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:20,204
Besides, I wouldn't want
a Charmed One

537
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,080
coming after me when this is over.

538
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:30,464
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

539
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:33,842
Because this time,
I'll vanquish you for real.

540
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:37,596
Well, it's about time.

541
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:40,265
Who sent you?

542
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:56,698
Yes!

543
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,617
I'm back.

544
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:01,161
Wait. What...? How is that possible?

545
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,455
Don't ask me, ask...

546
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:06,458
...them.

547
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,837
Paige, come on, quick.
We gotta get him to Gideon.

548
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,440
I thought I'd find you here.

549
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:33,944
How are you doing?

550
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:38,198
The wound is healed,
if that's what you mean.

551
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:42,161
- No, it's not.
- You were right. I know that now.

552
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:48,917
- I can't justify staying here any longer.
- Good.

553
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:51,587
Still, it's not easy.

554
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:55,174
And not just as a father.

555
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:57,134
- I know.
- Do you?

556
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:01,388
Does any Elder? Sometimes I wish
you wouldn't have

557
00:37:01,597 --> 00:37:04,224
let us break the rules, you wouldn't
have let us get married.

558
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:05,726
No, you don't.

559
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:10,272
Love and loss forms you, Leo.

560
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:13,233
It's who you are
and who you always will be.

561
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:18,614
It's a life you'll treasure,
and an experience you will share.

562
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,700
One that helps us better appreciate

563
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:25,287
those that we are entrusted
to watch over.

564
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:27,247
It's not fair.

565
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:30,959
Sacrifice never is.

566
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:35,506
It's time.

567
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,941
- Looking good.
- Whoa.

568
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:58,654
- Wait, what are you still doing here?
- Don't worry, you're fine.

569
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,782
I just wanted to say...

570
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:04,034
...good luck.

571
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,161
Thanks.

572
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:11,625
Hey. Just out of curiosity,

573
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:16,797
why did you tell me all that stuff about
living life and enjoying my day

574
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,632
if you were coming for me
all along?

575
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:22,052
Just in case I wasn't leaving with you.

576
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,556
You've been given
a second chance, Chris.

577
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:29,101
Don't waste it.

578
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,230
Hi.

579
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:17,566
- Hi.
- What's going on?

580
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:20,402
Maybe you should sit down
for a second.

581
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:22,237
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

582
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:26,742
No, no. No, it's good. It's good.
I mean, it's... You know, it's not bad.

583
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,536
It's a really good thing.
It's not a bad thing.

584
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:31,747
I think it's a really good thing,
don't you think?

585
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:35,501
Yeah. I mean, it depends,
you know.

586
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:41,381
- That sounds worse.
- No, it's just complicated.

587
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:47,012
Okay, so why don't you guys
just tell me what's going on.

588
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,389
All right.

589
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,727
Paige and I...

590
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:57,689
...know what happened
between you and Leo last night.

591
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:03,445
Well... Excuse me?

592
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:08,367
Not because anybody told us
or anything. It's just...

593
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:10,536
...because of Chris.

594
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,916
Chris? Why...? Why would Chris
know what happened last night?

595
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:18,919
Well, because he wouldn't be here
if it didn't.

596
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:21,630
Yeah, see, we've known for a while.

597
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:24,091
We just didn't know how to talk
to you and Leo about it.

598
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:26,301
Talk to us about what?

599
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:29,012
- Is this my turn?
- Yeah.

600
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,681
Yeah.

601
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,810
Chris is your son.

602
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:39,064
Wyatt's brother.
Look, I know this is huge...

603
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:43,735
No, it's... It's not huge,
because it's not possible.

604
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:46,446
It's crazy, because I'm not pregnant.

605
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:49,324
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

606
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,451
No, I'm not.
I mean, how could that happen?

607
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:55,622
I mean... I know how that
could happen, but it...

608
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,501
What am I gonna do?

609
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,212
Maybe you should talk to Leo
about it.

610
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:03,964
No, I can't.

611
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:07,634
- Why?
- Well, because... Because I can't.

612
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:12,973
This a bad time?

613
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:28,822
I'm still not quite sure
what this was all about.

614
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:31,575
Why so many of my kind had to die.

615
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:36,246
- Why my friend had to die.
- All in good time.

616
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:39,917
We still didn't even accomplish what
you wanted. We didn't get the Elder.

617
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:42,461
But in a way, you did.

618
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:44,630
Leo's gone, isn't he?

619
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:50,552
Perhaps not in the way I had originally
intended, but gone nonetheless.

620
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:53,388
Well, wasn't he your friend too?

621
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:55,682
Yes, he was.

622
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,810
We all have to make sacrifices
for the greater good.

623
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:02,189
I'm evil. What do I care
about the greater good?

624
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:05,984
Leo's son is just as much a threat
to your kind as he is to mine.

625
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:10,322
We made a mistake
in allowing Wyatt to be born...

626
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:13,784
...in allowing such
a concentration of power

627
00:42:13,951 --> 00:42:16,537
to be brought into this world
in one being.

628
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:22,125
But now that Leo is gone
and the Charmed Ones are unaware,

629
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:25,671
I'm one step closer to being able
to correct that mistake...

630
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,591
...for good.
