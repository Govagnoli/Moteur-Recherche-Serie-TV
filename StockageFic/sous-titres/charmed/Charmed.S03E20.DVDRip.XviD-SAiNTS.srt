0
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:11,166
Phoebe?

1
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:16,964
Phoebe, you in here?

2
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:25,599
- Hey, sweetie. Wake up.
- Cole?

3
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,805
No. It's just me.

4
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,047
- Come on, let's go home.
- No, I have to wait here for Cole.

5
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:35,525
Phoebe, you can't just wait here,
all right?

6
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:37,998
He will know where to find you.

7
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:39,807
Come on.

8
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:43,439
I don't understand.
He was supposed to go back under

9
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:46,726
so that they wouldn't be suspicious
of him. But it's been over a week.

10
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:49,921
He probably just hasn't found
a safe way out yet, that's all.

11
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,518
But what if he can't?

12
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:54,680
What if the Brotherhood
found him out?

13
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:58,364
Look, even if they did,
he would put some sort of a spin on it.

14
00:00:58,529 --> 00:01:01,965
You know, get out of it.
Hey, come on, you know Cole.

15
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,438
He knows what he's doing.

16
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:06,042
You don't make
demon of the century

17
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:08,723
without having a few tricks
up your sleeve.

18
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:10,726
I just hope he's okay, Prue.

19
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:27,367
It seems our brother's suspicions
were well founded.

20
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:29,167
- Why, what do you see?
- Sickness.

21
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:32,480
The kind that only comes from being
in the world of light too long.

22
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,157
It's contaminated him.

23
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,797
How is that possible, Raynor?
A demon as great as Belthazor?

24
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:43,281
It's not his demon half that's
been infected. It's his human half.

25
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,883
He's in love.

26
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,519
- The witch.
- Not just any witch.

27
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:52,328
One of the Charmed Ones.
But she's not only loved him,

28
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:55,083
she's turned him against us,
sent him here to destroy us.

29
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,086
Well, then we must destroy him.

30
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:59,479
You still have
so much to learn, Tarkin.

31
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,605
You don't just kill a demon
like Belthazor.

32
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:03,839
- But he betrayed us.
- And in so doing,

33
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:06,364
he's acquired the knowledge
of how to kill the Charmed Ones,

34
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:08,400
something no demon's been able
to accomplish.

35
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,367
That, with his power, makes him
a very precious commodity for us,

36
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:13,485
one worthy of saving.

37
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:16,920
- But how can you save...?
- How can we save him? Simple.

38
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:21,078
We remove the only thing
that's reawakened his human half,

39
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:23,922
his only foothold to good:

40
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:26,523
The witch's love for him.

41
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:28,007
Okay.

42
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,320
Ou est la Tour Eiffel?

43
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:34,606
That is "Where is the Eiffel Tower?"

44
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:37,004
In my dreams,
if we don't get you a passport.

45
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,928
Honey, we don't need a passport
to honeymoon in Paris.

46
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:42,205
With the blink of an orb,
we can be sipping champagne

47
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:43,961
at the Champs Élysées.

48
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,919
Yes, as romantic
as you make that sound,

49
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:50,239
I would rather fly Air France
than Air Leo,

50
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:52,286
just like every other
normal newlywed.

51
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,366
Well, great, except that we're not.

52
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:57,447
Well, a passport for you
could change all that.

53
00:03:57,609 --> 00:03:59,964
If I could just find...

54
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,565
Voila. Birth certificate.

55
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,646
- Where did you get that?
- From Dan's old file,

56
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:09,404
the one that he put together
when he was suspicious of you.

57
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:10,797
You remember him, don't you?

58
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:13,802
Let's see, perfect hair, cleft chin,
tried to steal you away from me?

59
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:15,322
Vaguely. Vaguely.

60
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:19,003
This isn't gonna work.
I was born in 1924.

61
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,359
No, you weren't.

62
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:27,006
Okay. Off-white background,
black ink.

63
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,881
Little trick I learned in high school.

64
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:31,319
- You're forging my birth certificate?
- No.

65
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:34,845
Just going to change
one little number,

66
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,759
so 1924 becomes 1974.

67
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:42,568
And just like that,
you are 50 years younger.

68
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:47,522
Wait a minute. That makes you 27.

69
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:50,567
That's younger than me. Maybe
I should change another number.

70
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,602
- Piper, this is completely illegal.
- Yeah?

71
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,963
Well, so is marrying
a dead guy, okay?

72
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,721
Let's not get technical now.

73
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:01,205
Morning. What's up?

74
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:03,678
Oh, probably three to five years in jail
if we're lucky.

75
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:07,241
Never mind.

76
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:11,004
- Were you up late working again?
- No, I was up looking for Phoebe.

77
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:13,080
Three guesses where she was.

78
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:14,728
- The mausoleum?
- Yeah.

79
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:17,727
- It's become like her second home.
- Still no word from Cole?

80
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:19,328
No, and you know what?

81
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:22,242
You would think that he could take
three lousy seconds

82
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:27,278
just to shimmer and let all of us
know that he's okay.

83
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:29,605
Maybe he can't.
Maybe he's afraid he'll get caught.

84
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:32,166
Maybe he already has.

85
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:40,319
Just follow my lead.

86
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:48,567
Raynor.

87
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:50,799
Good to see you're still
with us, Belthazor.

88
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:53,398
- What happened?
- I tried to kill you.

89
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:57,208
Accidentally, of course. I didn't
recognise you in your human form.

90
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:58,563
My mistake.

91
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:01,488
Not many are strong enough
to survive an energy ball, Belthazor.

92
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:03,202
You're lucky.

93
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:04,683
Forgive me.

94
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,120
How could I not? After all,
you taught me everything I know.

95
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:22,684
Well, not everything.

96
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,197
How long was I out?

97
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:29,121
Long enough for us
to investigate reports

98
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,484
that you'd crossed over
to the other side.

99
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:35,523
- Rumours, not reports.
- Don't worry.

100
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,038
We don't blame you
for the failed hit last week,

101
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:41,326
even if you were seduced by one
of the witches that thwarted our plan.

102
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:45,606
I've already explained to you
that I was over her.

103
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:50,240
Yeah, but you didn't explain that
she was one of the Charmed Ones.

104
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,605
It doesn't matter that you stray,
Belthazor, as long as you come back.

105
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:57,044
To that end,
I have an assignment for you,

106
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,962
something that only your powers
can achieve.

107
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,761
I need you to get me
a magical amulet,

108
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:04,204
one that's hanging from
the neck of a witch.

109
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,688
Problem?

110
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:10,761
Just that it's a little bit risky,
don't you think?

111
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:13,204
Sending me after a witch
with the Charmed Ones on my trail?

112
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:14,728
Tarkin will provide backup.

113
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:17,364
That way, if they show up,
you can catch them by surprise.

114
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:20,766
That should take care of all
of our problems, now shouldn't it?

115
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:23,206
Where do I get the amulet?

116
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:29,519
This shouldn't take long.

117
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:33,642
Think he'll actually get the amulet?

118
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:37,597
Yes, but not before he tells his
beloved witch what he's about to do.

119
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:41,648
And that should plant the first seed
of suspicion in her heart.

120
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:53,809
Promise me when I turn around,
you'll still be there.

121
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:04,044
- I thought...
- I know.

122
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,605
I missed you so much.

123
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:11,638
I missed you too.

124
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,441
Hi.

125
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,799
They've given me an assignment,
one that if I turn down...

126
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:28,482
What do you mean, an assignment?

127
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,080
What kind of assignment?

128
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,964
I can't tell you.

129
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,562
They've asked me to steal
an amulet from a witch.

130
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:44,841
- A witch?
- Don't worry, I won't hurt her.

131
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:48,121
Oh, well, that's good news, Cole.
You can't do this!

132
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:49,842
You think I want to, damn it?!

133
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:53,242
Phoebe, I just have to buy some time
so I can figure a way out.

134
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,559
In the meantime,
I have to at least pretend I'm evil.

135
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,728
Yeah, but don't you see? If you turn
into Belthazor, then you will be evil.

136
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:04,366
- What makes you think I'll have to?
- Well, because an amulet protects.

137
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:08,408
It takes someone of great strength
to overcome that.

138
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,685
- Why do you think they chose you?
- To set me up, perhaps.

139
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:18,641
- Raynor may be on to me.
- Who's Raynor?

140
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:21,799
He's the head of the Brotherhood,
and my old mentor.

141
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:26,440
He has the power to read thoughts.
And if he's read mine...

142
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:29,728
Prue and I will come with you
and watch your back.

143
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,521
No, no, no, you can't.

144
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:33,520
That could be exactly
what Raynor is expecting.

145
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:38,080
He could be setting me up to get
to you. I have to do this alone.

146
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:40,007
Cole, I...

147
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:47,919
Trust me, okay?

148
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,642
I know what I'm doing.

149
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:54,602
Just concentrate
on finishing the potion.

150
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:59,365
If it works, Belthazor will disappear,
and Raynor won't be able to track me.

151
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:01,002
Then...

152
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,239
...we can be together.

153
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:26,447
Prue!

154
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:28,802
Prue!

155
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:31,039
- What's wrong?
- Cole's in trouble. I need your help.

156
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:33,279
- Okay, anything.
- We need to scry for a witch. Fast.

157
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:34,768
All right.

158
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:42,880
Who are you?

159
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:44,597
How did you get in here?

160
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:48,119
Just do exactly as I say,
and I won't hurt you.

161
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:50,484
Just take off the amulet
and put it down.

162
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:55,319
- I've been sworn to protect it.
- And I've been ordered to steal it.

163
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:00,123
Don't fight me. I beg you.

164
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:09,845
You can't take it from me.

165
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:11,847
Maybe I can't.

166
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:18,598
But I can.

167
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:44,438
Tell no one about the amulet,
not even your whitelighter.

168
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:58,279
Whitelighter. Is that my occupation,
or should I just put "guardian angel"?

169
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:00,599
Hi, how you doing?

170
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:04,199
What's the matter with you?

171
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:07,247
We shouldn't be here, Piper.
This is wrong.

172
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:09,639
Wanting a normal life
is not wrong, okay?

173
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:11,925
In fact, it couldn't be any more right.

174
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:15,963
For crying out loud,
stop being so good all the time.

175
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,648
Newlyweds. First fight.

176
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:21,841
- Eyes front.
- Piper.

177
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:25,639
Leo, look, I love you,
but I'm getting a migraine here, okay?

178
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:28,243
Just... Look, we're not hurting anyone.

179
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:30,639
We're not breaking
any commandments, okay?

180
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:33,243
We just changed
a lousy two to a lousy seven.

181
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:36,287
- Next person in line, please.
- So let go before I blow!

182
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:40,126
Okay, we're almost there.

183
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:47,407
What?

184
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:50,163
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! No!

185
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:54,083
You cannot leave right now, okay?
Pretend you're... Pretend you're out.

186
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:57,679
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can. Come on!

187
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,483
- I gotta go.
- Leo, you can't go right now, okay?

188
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,447
We've been waiting in this line
for two and a half freaking hours.

189
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:26,003
Who are you?

190
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,245
If you've come for the amulet,
it's gone.

191
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:32,558
And yet you're still here.

192
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:35,841
Living proof that Belthazor
has indeed gone soft.

193
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,448
Belthazor?

194
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,765
The demon who'll be blamed
for your death.

195
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:02,081
Anything?

196
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:04,446
No.

197
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:07,159
Do you think maybe we scried
for the wrong witch?

198
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:09,960
I don't think so.

199
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:17,167
Scorch marks.

200
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,401
Oh, my God,
do you think she's dead?

201
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:22,208
Unfortunately, I don't know
what else to think.

202
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:25,361
That doesn't make any sense.
Cole said she wouldn't get hurt.

203
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah, well, somebody sure fired
an energy ball in here.

204
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:31,484
Somebody like Cole, you mean?

205
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:34,726
Phoebe, I am not saying
that it was Cole, okay?

206
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,564
All that I'm telling you
is what I see, what we both see.

207
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:43,242
For what it's worth,
I don't think it was Cole.

208
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:45,043
Thank you.

209
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:47,841
All right. But if he didn't do it,
who did?

210
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:51,604
Well, Cole said that he thought
he was being set up by his mentor.

211
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:54,283
So maybe he is.
Maybe they're trying to frame him.

212
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:55,882
- Why?
- I don't know.

213
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:58,404
But if it's true, that means
his cover's blown.

214
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:00,685
- And we gotta get him out of there.
- Yeah.

215
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:03,727
Leo.

216
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:06,361
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

217
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:09,089
The Elders called me because
a powerful amulet has been stolen.

218
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:10,802
- Yeah, we know.
- You do?

219
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,284
Yes, and the witch that had it
has been killed.

220
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:15,599
It was supposed to protect her.
That's why they gave it to her.

221
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:18,243
Only the most evil of demons
could've had the power to take it.

222
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:20,365
Why would a demon want
that amulet so bad?

223
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:23,037
Because it's one half
of an ancient charm.

224
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:25,165
Whoever connects
the two amulets together

225
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:27,684
more than doubles
the protection power.

226
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:29,760
With it, they become invincible.

227
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:33,279
Well, that certainly explains why
the Brotherhood wanted Cole to get it.

228
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:35,002
- Cole?
- Forget it.

229
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:37,205
- Who's got the other half?
- Another witch.

230
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,406
The amulets were divided between
two local covens for safekeeping,

231
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:44,118
but the bearers have always been
kept secret, guarded even from them.

232
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:46,968
Well, obviously that's why
the Brotherhood wants them both.

233
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:49,637
Only to destroy them
so good can never use them.

234
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:51,925
The amulet won't protect
anyone evil.

235
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,438
All right, we need to find
that other witch before they do.

236
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:56,839
Will you go with Piper
so I can work on Cole's potion?

237
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:59,728
Yeah. Speaking of,
where is Piper?

238
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:04,567
She's at the manor
recovering from a little problem

239
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:06,526
we had at the passport office.

240
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:12,249
- What problem?
- Well, she sort of blew some of it up.

241
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:25,280
- Nervous?
- Impatient.

242
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:27,121
Something you're not telling me,
brother?

243
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:32,158
Actually, I was about to ask you
the same question, brother.

244
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,559
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I had business to attend to.

245
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,447
The amulet?

246
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:42,607
Must feel good to be back in the game.
Was it a beautiful death?

247
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:45,962
- What do you mean?
- The witch. How did you kill her?

248
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:49,568
I didn't. I'd never risk alerting
the Charmed Ones

249
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:51,606
just for the thrill
of offing a low-level witch.

250
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:53,527
Too bad. I would and did.

251
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:57,562
Don't make me clean up
after you again.

252
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:59,248
You shouldn't have killed her,
Raynor.

253
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,320
You're right. You should have.

254
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,963
You told me to get the amulet,
you didn't say kill the witch.

255
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:06,160
Some things go without saying.

256
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,887
You want me to get
the second amulet?

257
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,802
No, I want Belthazor to.

258
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:14,160
Let Tarkin. My strength isn't back yet.

259
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,479
I barely fought through the magic
to get the first one.

260
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:18,719
You can do it. I know you.
You're the great Belthazor.

261
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:22,120
You can do anything you want.
You seem to have forgotten that.

262
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:25,607
Find the witch.

263
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:30,405
But this time, show no mercy.

264
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:37,123
You think he'll do it?

265
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,927
We keep putting the bottle
in front of him,

266
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:40,568
sooner or later, he'll take a drink.

267
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:43,448
- What if he doesn't?
- Don't worry.

268
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:47,559
I have insurance.

269
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:53,522
All right, I'll start scrying.

270
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:56,522
I don't think it'll work.
The amulet wards off magic, all magic.

271
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:58,879
That must be why we didn't find
the first witch in time.

272
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:01,478
We didn't get a read on her
until after the amulet was stolen.

273
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:04,322
Okay, but what happens
if we don't find her before?

274
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:11,048
Piper?

275
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:17,244
- Okay, was it a demon?
- No, it was watermelon!

276
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:19,963
Honey, why did you vanquish
watermelon?

277
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:21,926
I didn't vanquish watermelon.

278
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:25,684
I threw it up in the air, and I tried
to freeze it, and it exploded.

279
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:33,645
This is the little problem
I was telling you about.

280
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:38,957
Okay, Piper, slowly put your hands
down, and no one will get hurt.

281
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:42,763
Honey!

282
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,238
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.
We're gonna figure it out.

283
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:48,003
No, no, no, don't come near me.
I don't want anybody to get hurt.

284
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:51,167
Okay, put these on.
Maybe this will help.

285
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:52,722
Put these on and...

286
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:55,119
Okay, now try the teapot.

287
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:56,847
Try the teapot.

288
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,800
Okay, okay. That wasn't that bad. It's...

289
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:07,846
All right, just relax, okay?

290
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:11,200
Just calm down. Because I think
your emotions are making this worse.

291
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:13,718
I'll check with the Elders,
see if they know what happened.

292
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:15,044
Hurry!

293
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:19,407
Hey, and ask them how we're
supposed to find the second witch.

294
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:23,848
- I know where to find her.
- Cole.

295
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:26,287
I didn't kill her, Phoebe.

296
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:29,128
- I swear.
- It's okay.

297
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:31,325
I know. We believe you.

298
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:34,807
You don't look so good.
Are you okay?

299
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,806
I'm not sure.

300
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:42,603
Come on.

301
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:49,767
What about the potion?
How close are you?

302
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:53,285
We're just missing one ingredient,
billings root, whatever that is.

303
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:55,679
But as soon as I find it,
then I can finish it.

304
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:59,643
I don't have much time. I'm kind of
hanging on by my fingertips as it is.

305
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:02,317
Well, you have to hold on
a little longer.

306
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:05,126
You can do it, Cole. I know you.

307
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:08,239
Raynor says he knows me too.

308
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:12,280
Cole, look at me. Look at me.

309
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:14,646
You have to keep fighting it.

310
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:17,323
You have to keep fighting him.
You cannot let him win.

311
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:19,645
But me fighting is how he does win.

312
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:22,687
Raynor's just waiting for me to slip
so he can drag me back into the fold.

313
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:24,168
I know that's what he's doing.

314
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:29,280
He can't have you.

315
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:31,720
I won't let him.

316
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,486
Then save me, Phoebe.

317
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,646
I've been ordered to kill
the next witch.

318
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:40,164
Now, you have to get there first
and stop me.

319
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,724
Otherwise, Raynor will...

320
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:44,083
...win.

321
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:54,157
The birth and rebirth of all nature

322
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:57,321
The passing of winter and spring

323
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,367
We share in the life universal

324
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:04,238
Rejoice in the magical ring

325
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:10,281
I'll see you all next week. Blessed be.

326
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:12,719
Blessed be.

327
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:25,919
What are you doing here?

328
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:28,201
- Just watching your back.
- Yeah?

329
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:30,837
Well, watching it's one thing.
Stabbing it's another.

330
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:32,442
What's the matter,
don't you trust me?

331
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:34,520
- I don't trust anyone.
- You never did.

332
00:21:34,689 --> 00:21:36,407
That's part of what made you
so great.

333
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:40,562
No allegiances, no conscience,
no hesitation.

334
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:44,197
You know what Raynor wants.
Just give it to him.

335
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,758
You'll feel better
after you kill the witch.

336
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:56,560
Who's there?

337
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:04,006
You can't hurt me.

338
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:13,487
- Cole, don't!
- Piper, freeze him!

339
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:15,719
I might blow him up.

340
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:21,601
It's okay. We're witches too.

341
00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:24,121
Piper!

342
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:29,641
Okay, that was good.
That... That was fine.

343
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:32,807
Kill them.

344
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:40,048
Phoebe!

345
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:03,763
Leo!

346
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:05,840
- He's our whitelighter.
- And our brother-in-law.

347
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:09,763
I don't know what is up with me.
Every time I try to freeze, I flame.

348
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:13,241
- Leo?
- I'm fine. Really, it's no big deal.

349
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:15,877
Phoebe, it's a huge deal.
Cole tried to kill you.

350
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:18,802
- He's the demon.
- And her boyfriend.

351
00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:21,688
We have very complicated lives.

352
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:24,044
I'm just thrilled to meet you.

353
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:26,638
I mean, I've heard of
the Charmed Ones, of course. I just...

354
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:29,522
- I never dreamed I'd...
- Nearly die with us?

355
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:34,365
- Yes, well, welcome to our lives.
- You saved me and the amulet.

356
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:36,727
That's enough.

357
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:39,127
May I?

358
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:41,207
Well, the wound isn't deep.

359
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:44,999
A salve would cleanse it
and ease the pain.

360
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:47,725
Would you allow me entrance
to your herb cupboard?

361
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:50,998
- Kitchen. She means kitchen.
- Oh, right.

362
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:54,605
- Sure. Follow me.
- Hands down. Hands down!

363
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:57,806
Come on. Sit down. Take it easy.

364
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:01,518
I'm fine, Prue. Really.
And Cole did not try to kill me.

365
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:03,964
He knew that the amulet
would protect me.

366
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,364
He could've fired at you or Piper,
but he didn't.

367
00:24:07,249 --> 00:24:09,809
With the other demon there,
he made the only choice he could.

368
00:24:09,969 --> 00:24:13,120
- And you really believe that, right?
- Yeah, I know it.

369
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:18,727
I saw his eyes.
They were filled with pain, not evil.

370
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:22,168
Prue, we gotta get him out of there
before it's too late.

371
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,360
Right. Then we better figure out a way
to finish

372
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,839
that power-stripping potion, fast.
Come on.

373
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:37,159
Check her out. Whipping it up
like it's Toll House cookies.

374
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:39,678
Maybe after she fixes Phoebe,
she could fix me.

375
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:41,362
Piper, you don't need fixing.

376
00:24:41,969 --> 00:24:44,688
If it's taking the Elders this long
to tell Leo what is wrong with me,

377
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:46,840
then I definitely need fixing.

378
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:50,043
This will feel a little warm.

379
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:54,406
That is amazing.

380
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:58,278
It doesn't hurt at all.
Hey, how are you at making potions?

381
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:01,642
- Well, what do you need?
- We need to detox a demon.

382
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:04,409
Yeah, and we need something
called billings root.

383
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:07,926
Well, you have that. It's on...

384
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:10,725
...the bottom shelf.

385
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,399
- No, that's ginger.
- Now that's what it's called.

386
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:17,720
In the old covens,
they called it billings root.

387
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:20,881
Janna, you have healed me twice.

388
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:24,358
Piper, do you think you could help
Janna with the potion?

389
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,326
Just not point at anything.

390
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:27,888
Only one way to find out.

391
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:30,964
Hey, where are you going?

392
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,642
To get Cole back here.

393
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:36,279
If I'm right about what I saw in
his eyes, he'll go to the mausoleum.

394
00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:38,320
And what if you're wrong?

395
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:41,680
Well, then he'll be back here
with his buddy to get the amulet.

396
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:44,729
I'm not wrong.
Cole's not the enemy.

397
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:47,085
He's the victim.

398
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:49,365
And I'm gonna save him.

399
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:57,003
How could you have failed?
It was just one little witch.

400
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:58,761
No, it wasn't.
The Charmed Ones were there

401
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:01,642
- just like I warned you they might be.
- We could've taken them.

402
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:03,879
We would've died.

403
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:07,086
- The amulet protected them.
- Which is exactly why I wanted it!

404
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:09,080
What has happened to you, Belthazor?

405
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:12,878
The witches' magic never stopped you
before. You never would've given up.

406
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:14,323
What's changed?

407
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:17,204
You know what, let's just drop
the pretences, okay?

408
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:20,247
I'm tired of playing games.
We both know what you're trying to do.

409
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:22,604
- It's not gonna work.
- No?

410
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:24,845
You don't care about the amulet.

411
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:26,761
You only care about turning me
against Phoebe.

412
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:30,120
How smart. And yet foolish enough
to fall in love.

413
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:32,524
Loving her is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

414
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:34,839
You can destroy me,
but you can't change that.

415
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:37,324
After all that I've taught you
and all that I've given you,

416
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:40,003
you're willing to give it all up
for a witch?

417
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:44,044
I'm not gonna kill for you, Raynor.
Not anymore.

418
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:46,763
Not even for your father's soul?

419
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:55,437
- Settle, brother.
- How did you get that? The Source?

420
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:59,079
Promised to free him if you fulfilled
your end of the bargain.

421
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,845
You kill the witch, come back
and finish your obligations,

422
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:07,008
and you and your father
will both be free.

423
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:17,686
All that separates us
from getting him back

424
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:20,568
are a few drops of innocent blood.

425
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:23,125
And they're about to be spilled.

426
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:31,966
Cole.

427
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,167
Surprised to see me?

428
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:38,841
I hoped, but why did you come
after what I did?

429
00:27:39,009 --> 00:27:41,045
Because you need me.

430
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:45,045
Besides, it's not like you haven't
tried to kill me before.

431
00:27:45,209 --> 00:27:47,928
A little energy ball
isn't gonna stop me.

432
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:51,885
You know, I didn't have a choice.

433
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:55,644
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- I know, I know, I know. It's okay.

434
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,686
We just need to get you back
to the house.

435
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:01,086
Get that potion in you,
and you will be safe.

436
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:03,809
It's too late for that now.

437
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:05,527
What do you mean?

438
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:16,046
- We have to hurry.
- Maybe I should shimmer us there.

439
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:20,003
You can't use your demonic powers,
it's too much temptation.

440
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:21,841
We'll just drive. Come on.

441
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:28,598
"Shake water vigorously
for 200 heartbeats.

442
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:34,480
Then add a pinch of dandelion
and a dash of chickweed."

443
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:38,608
- You're using bottled water?
- For Cole, the purer the better.

444
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:42,208
- I got it.
- Okay.

445
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:44,525
Time me. I got it.

446
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:46,082
Leo should've been back by now.

447
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:48,683
It must mean my powers
are screwed forever.

448
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:50,441
They're punishing me.

449
00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:53,881
You're a fulfilment
of a great prophecy. Why punish you?

450
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:57,519
Oh, forgery.
Wanting to have a normal life.

451
00:28:57,689 --> 00:28:59,008
Getting pissed off.

452
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:02,798
By next week, I'll be walking around
like Carrie at the prom.

453
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:05,569
I think that's enough shaking.

454
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:12,608
- Leo, where the hell have you been?
- Hi. Easy, remember:

455
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:14,361
Breathe, okay? Hi.

456
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:17,089
Leo, Janna, the innocent.
Janna, Leo, the whitelighter.

457
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:21,248
- Leo, why are my powers so wonky?
- They're not. They're advancing.

458
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,881
Turns out your powers work
by slowing down molecules.

459
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:27,483
And apparently, now
you can speed them up as well.

460
00:29:27,689 --> 00:29:30,442
Okay, but why now? Couldn't
they have picked a better time?

461
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:33,038
Hey, okay, don't look
a gift power in the mouth.

462
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:35,200
That one kicks ass,
and we may need it

463
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:37,439
- sooner than you think.
- Why?

464
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,520
Because when the two amulets
are joined together,

465
00:29:39,689 --> 00:29:42,157
only a spell can activate their power.
This spell.

466
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:44,559
- What does that mean?
- It means that if the Brotherhood

467
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:46,048
wants to actually use the amulets,

468
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:48,040
they're gonna have to come here
for the spell.

469
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,280
But I was told that evil
couldn't use the amulets.

470
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:52,725
Maybe they've figured out a way.

471
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,642
Hey.

472
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:01,765
You look like hell.

473
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:05,400
You have no idea.

474
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:11,244
- Is the potion done?
- It still has to cool and turn blood red.

475
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,445
I'll get some ice.

476
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:16,601
I'll help you so you don't melt it.

477
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:22,000
Well, look on the bright side.
You got a new power.

478
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:24,046
You've been bitching about it
long enough.

479
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:26,359
Yeah, well, careful what you bitch for.

480
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:44,603
Try again!

481
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:54,042
Phoebe, help!

482
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:56,400
Phoebe!

483
00:30:57,849 --> 00:30:59,646
Phoebe, help!

484
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:03,478
Watch out!

485
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:10,362
Oh, please, please, please.

486
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:18,445
I did it!

487
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:20,768
- I did it!
- Very good.

488
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:23,045
Of course, I meant to freeze him.
Are you all right?

489
00:31:23,209 --> 00:31:24,927
I am, thanks to you.

490
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:27,365
I don't think Prue is gonna be
quite as grateful.

491
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:30,043
Wake her up.
I gotta get back to Cole.

492
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:39,007
It's ready.

493
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:53,886
Leave her out of this, Raynor.

494
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:58,602
I serve with every breath,
even my last.

495
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:00,128
Love to take you up on that.

496
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:02,524
But I think I'll save that pleasure
for my brother.

497
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,248
Cole!

498
00:32:19,889 --> 00:32:21,322
I've come to take you home.

499
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:22,848
- I am home.
- Cole!

500
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:25,688
You will be when you kill the witch.

501
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:27,885
Stop fighting it, Belthazor!

502
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:29,641
You're a demon.

503
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:33,802
Embrace it. Let evil make you
strong again. Give in to it.

504
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:37,399
Cole? Leo!

505
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:41,478
The rage in you is building,
but it's not me that you want to kill.

506
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:42,968
It's her.

507
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:46,762
Do it. Free yourself.

508
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:49,802
No.

509
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,763
Cole, open up the door
and let me in!

510
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:59,445
Is she really worth sacrificing
your father's soul for?

511
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:02,447
Cole. No, don't do it.

512
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:18,281
Cole.

513
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,045
Phoebe.

514
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:35,640
What did you do to him?

515
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:49,646
I saw what you did.

516
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:52,480
It's not what it looks like.
It wasn't...

517
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:55,959
Janna is dead and Leo is unconscious.
What else could it be?

518
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:59,479
Raynor forced me.
I had no choice.

519
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:02,328
There's always a choice, Cole!

520
00:34:07,449 --> 00:34:08,928
The potion.

521
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:15,320
- Before it's too late.
- It's already too late.

522
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:19,721
You killed an innocent woman.
There is no turning back from that.

523
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:23,001
I didn't wanna kill her.

524
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:26,605
You gotta understand that.
I can still be good.

525
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:29,245
There's nothing good in you anymore.

526
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:31,883
Maybe there never was.

527
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:34,762
You have to read the spell
to activate the amulets, right?

528
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:39,562
I mean, Cole, maybe that was
your plan all along, to get the Book.

529
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:42,163
But evil can't use the amulets
or the Book.

530
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:44,200
He could have if we'd
stripped his powers.

531
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:46,321
Is that why you wanted
the potion, Cole?

532
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:50,522
So you could get to the spell
and use the amulets against us?

533
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:53,205
Oh, Phoebe.

534
00:34:57,809 --> 00:34:59,322
You gotta believe me.

535
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:01,525
I think she's believed you
one too many times.

536
00:35:01,729 --> 00:35:03,606
Stay out of this!

537
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:06,204
This is between me...

538
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:07,722
...and her.

539
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:10,489
There's nothing between us
anymore.

540
00:35:11,129 --> 00:35:12,642
Phoebe.

541
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:16,287
Don't let Raynor take this away
from us. Don't let him win.

542
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:19,122
Raynor didn't set you up.

543
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:20,842
You set me up.

544
00:35:22,649 --> 00:35:23,923
What am I supposed to do?

545
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:26,324
Please...

546
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:29,806
...save me.

547
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:33,125
Save yourself.

548
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:02,324
Sorry about knocking you out,
nothing personal.

549
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:04,719
Yeah, well, at least
you didn't blow me up.

550
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,647
Yeah, I was kind of relieved too.

551
00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:11,559
- Piper, the control will come.
- Yeah, tell that to the ficus.

552
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:15,239
- Well, you sure told it to Tarkin.
- That was kind of cool.

553
00:36:15,969 --> 00:36:18,244
So see, we can celebrate.

554
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,321
You know, I mean, you got a new
power and you beat a demon with it.

555
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:24,720
I wish I could've done more
for Janna and Cole.

556
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:27,722
I mean, vanquishing one bad guy
and losing three good guys

557
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:29,641
is not exactly a winning score.

558
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:33,522
Okay, so we are still counting
Cole as good, right?

559
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:38,359
Yeah. I mean, I actually
finally understand how he feels.

560
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,760
Having something inside of you
that you can't control

561
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:45,968
which is capable of hurting the people
you love even if you don't want it to.

562
00:36:46,689 --> 00:36:47,804
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.

563
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:51,245
I didn't mean to stick you
with the morning-after cleanup.

564
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,400
How you doing?

565
00:36:54,209 --> 00:36:55,881
I'm not sure.

566
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:58,279
Well, you have a lot to sort out.

567
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:00,366
No, not really.

568
00:37:00,529 --> 00:37:04,204
I lost my soul mate to evil.
End of story.

569
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:07,765
- Pheebs, I think he really tried, but...
- It wasn't enough.

570
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:09,647
I wasn't enough.

571
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:15,843
I thought we could do a blessing
for our two fallen witches...

572
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:17,727
...and for Cole.

573
00:37:20,649 --> 00:37:26,519
For Leeza, a lost sister.
May her spirit soar.

574
00:37:28,009 --> 00:37:32,799
For Janna, our lost friend.
May we meet again.

575
00:37:35,009 --> 00:37:36,761
For Cole...

576
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:38,683
...a lost love.

577
00:37:43,689 --> 00:37:45,839
May you find peace.

578
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:50,687
Piper, we're going to have...

579
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:54,603
- Plenty of time to talk later.
- No, it's okay, Leo.

580
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:56,686
We could actually use
some good news.

581
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,441
And it seems like you have some.

582
00:37:58,649 --> 00:38:04,087
Well, I don't have news,
but I do have a passport.

583
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:07,078
You went back?

584
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:10,122
Yeah, well, I was thinking,
with everything that's happened,

585
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:14,202
and your new power making life
a little crazy... All right, crazier,

586
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:17,805
I figured that the least I could do
is make it somewhat normal.

587
00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:20,204
- Are you sure?
- Anything that it takes to get you

588
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:21,802
on a plane to Paris.

589
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,842
You know what?
I think we should wait on that.

590
00:38:26,049 --> 00:38:28,085
I wouldn't wanna, like,
sneeze at 40,000 feet

591
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:31,486
and have a whole bunch of people
explode. That would be bad.

592
00:38:47,129 --> 00:38:50,246
I knew you'd come back.
I've been waiting for you.

593
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:53,646
My father's soul, where is it?

594
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:10,362
Or course, now that you're evil,
what can you do with it?

595
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:14,363
- That's not your concern.
- True. You were my only concern.

596
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:17,846
- How'd you get me to do it, a spell?
- Does it really matter?

597
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:20,802
Part of you enjoyed it,
didn't you? Killing the witch?

598
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:23,682
Not as much as I'm gonna enjoy this.

599
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:31,643
You killed Phoebe's love for me.

600
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:34,448
Now I'm gonna watch you die.

601
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:37,162
I can feel your heart.

602
00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:42,167
It's racing even as mine slows.
You're enjoying this.

603
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:43,603
I can feel it.

604
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:47,839
This is what I hoped for.
Your inner demonic nature

605
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:51,240
finally showing itself in all its glory.

606
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:04,402
You're truly evil now, Belthazor.

607
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:08,639
Welcome home.
