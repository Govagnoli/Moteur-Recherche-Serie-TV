1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,713
She's supposed to be here by now.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,341
- So she's a little late.
- No, she's a lot late.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,260
Paige used to be the first one
to a vanquish. What's wrong with her?

4
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,930
She's in love. That's hardly wrong.

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,891
It is when it interferes with
her responsibilities as a Charmed One.

6
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,018
Why don't you just let me
handle this one alone.

7
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,354
Because you've handled
the last four vanquishes alone.

8
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,356
You should have
never let them move out.

9
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,691
Hey, you don't see me complaining,
I'm happy for them.

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,401
And you should be too.

11
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,071
So where is this demon
and what's its name?

12
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,280
No one knows its name.

13
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,242
And it's too strong
for one witch to handle alone.

14
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,953
How much longer
is this gonna take?

15
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,622
Go see what Phoebe's doing.

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,625
- Where'd he go?
- Hong Kong.

17
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:46,255
Hong Kong? This is the last time
I work crowd control for you guys.

18
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,886
Hi.

19
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,681
Oh, how's Wyatt?
I miss him so much.

20
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,808
He misses you too.
Is this a bad time?

21
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,185
No, this is a great time.
Jason's away at a conference.

22
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:04,731
I was just practicing my origami.
This is a tiger. You can have that.

23
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,611
- I'm sorry I didn't visit.
- No, no, don't be silly.

24
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,573
You've obviously been
really busy folding.

25
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,908
I'm sorry I have to
ask for your help, but...

26
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,451
No, it's okay.

27
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,829
I mean, if you don't
enter the tiger's cave,

28
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,956
you may never get the cub, right?

29
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,250
- Come again?
- Ancient Chinese proverb.

30
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,295
Means "nothing ventured,
nothing gained," you know?

31
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,422
- Can we get the show on the road?
- Sure.

32
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,841
- Okay.
- Keep that.

33
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,303
Look, when the safety hazard's clear,
you can go to work.

34
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,638
- Just be patient, okay?
- Yeah, easy for you to say.

35
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,474
- I got four mouths to feed.
- Yeah, me too.

36
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,934
- Got that right.
- Yeah.

37
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,644
Okay, what do you
want me to do?

38
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,189
You're the bait.
All you gotta do is levitate into the air.

39
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,857
And when this demon
senses your magic,

40
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,442
it's gonna come fast and hard.

41
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:49,943
Okay.

42
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,114
Be careful of my origami.
That tiger took two fricking hours.

43
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,782
Okay, let's do it.

44
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,049
- What was that?
- What was that?

45
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,599
All clear.

46
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:23,370
Maybe you should just take me
out back and hose me down.

47
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,123
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry I'm late.
Did I miss the vanquish?

48
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,000
- Ask her.
- Hi, hi, hi.

49
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,418
Hey.

50
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,545
- Oh, my God, Phoebe, how are you?
- Great.

51
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,714
- How's Jason?
- He's great. How's Richard?

52
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:37,593
He's fabulous. He was taking his time
getting out of the house this morning.

53
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,844
That's why I couldn't orb.

54
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,679
Wait, you don't orb
with him in the house?

55
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,140
She's asked Richard
to not use his magic.

56
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,142
So I'm trying to be supportive
and, you know,

57
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,311
not use my magic in front of him.

58
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,565
A magic-free life. You're the last witch
in the world I'd expect that from.

59
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,943
It's not magic-free,
it's just magic-light.

60
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,487
Yeah, it's still a lot to give up.

61
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:02,618
What I get from him kind of
more than makes up for it, I think.

62
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,163
- How's Hong Kong?
- It's fascinating.

63
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,625
I'm studying numerology
and the Chinese zodiac.

64
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,879
But, you know, distant waters
doesn't quench the immediate thirst.

65
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,800
- Ancient Chinese proverb.
- It just means that I miss my family.

66
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,136
Well, that's good,
because your family misses you too.

67
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,472
I mean, I don't have a lot of people
to hang out with,

68
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,849
aside from my baby,
who doesn't really say much,

69
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,352
and then
one really neurotic whitelighter.

70
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,979
Yeah, how is my little buddy Chris?

71
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,315
Last time I saw him,
he wasn't in such good shape.

72
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,527
He's trying his best to hide it,
but he's still really shaken up.

73
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,155
Well, he lost his fiancÃ©e, you know?
I don't blame him, it's huge.

74
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,658
There's something in the future
that's freaking him out.

75
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,661
Yeah, he's more determined than ever
to protect Wyatt from evil,

76
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,829
which means there's
a new demon hunt every day.

77
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,082
I feel like such a bad sister,

78
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,626
leaving you guys alone
to handle all this.

79
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,628
No, no. We're fine.

80
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,589
Wyatt and I actually enjoy
having the manor to ourselves.

81
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,591
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean,

82
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,470
we have room to spread out,
and life is very quiet and calm,

83
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,598
and, best of all,
everything stays clean.

84
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,649
If I'm gonna hang out,
I better change my clothes.

85
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,777
- I think I left some here.
- I'll go with you.

86
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,456
You know, being born under
the Year of the Ox is a good thing.

87
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,626
It means you're
a natural-born leader.

88
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,920
- What happened to my room?
- Holy...

89
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,883
I guess when Piper said she was
gonna spread out, she wasn't kidding.

90
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,926
But where's all my stuff?

91
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:46,680
I mean, I have stuff, you know.
Lots and lots of stuff.

92
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,682
Well, being an Ox,
I can take charge of this.

93
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,519
You can borrow something from
my room until we straighten this out.

94
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,441
Oh, hi, baby.

95
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,943
This one too?

96
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,862
Yeah, you move,
you lose it in this family.

97
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,864
You could lose a lot more
than a bedroom.

98
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,241
Hi, Chris, I'm fine,
thank you. And you?

99
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,535
It's his job to offer his opinion.

100
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,788
You know, the only reason she's even
here is Paige missed the vanquish.

101
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,540
- Another one?
- Yeah.

102
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,334
That makes, what,
five in a row now?

103
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,503
You guys are such nags.

104
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,046
When did you two
become so chummy?

105
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,255
We're not chummy.

106
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,090
He's gone through
a lot protecting Wyatt,

107
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:25,552
and I figure, instead of doubting him,
I should help him a little.

108
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,931
So, what do you guys think?
You like Wyatt's new room?

109
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,935
I like it. I just like my room too.

110
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,562
And I like it, I just like my room too.

111
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,524
Well, you guys were the ones
that moved out, not me.

112
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,319
So where are my clothes?

113
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:50,160
Oh, God. This is really
kind of hitting home.

114
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,372
- What's that?
- Well, that I don't live here anymore.

115
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,290
I know what you mean.

116
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:59,545
At Richard's, it just doesn't
feel like home yet, you know?

117
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,256
I don't know, I guess
I just had more fun here.

118
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,633
Yeah, because this place is a riot.

119
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:11,265
No, I just... I don't know, I guess
I'm more free here. "Free to be me."

120
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,561
Oh, wow, Phoebe,
these are some boots.

121
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,064
No, they're not mine, but I wish
they were, because they're hot.

122
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,733
The box says "Penny."
Penny, as in "Grams" Penny?

123
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,943
No way.

124
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,737
I refuse to believe that Grams
ever wore anything this hot.

125
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,699
Yeah, I figured her
more for steel-toed orthopaedics.

126
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,285
You know, the better
to kick your ass with.

127
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,245
They're your size, Paige.
Try them on.

128
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,874
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on, just do it.

129
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,543
They're kind of '60s.

130
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,086
So, what's wrong with the '60s?

131
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:45,591
The '60s was, like,
the worst fashion era. Hello.

132
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,468
Bad clothing, bad hair,

133
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:52,097
and extremely questionable
personal hygiene.

134
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,642
Hey, they fit.

135
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,188
Hey, where'd she go?

136
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:08,989
Pardon me...

137
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,201
Hold on, I'm adjusting my aura.

138
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,578
You know how those
blocked chakras can get.

139
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,457
There.

140
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,212
You brought my go-go boots.
Right on.

141
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,547
Actually, they brought me.

142
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,758
That's because I cast
a return-to-owner spell

143
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,468
on all my favourite stuff.

144
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,011
I'm always taking my clothes off

145
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,305
and forgetting them somewhere
these days.

146
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:37,476
- Excuse me, who are you?
- Penny.

147
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,728
Penny.

148
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,855
As in...

149
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,276
..."Penny Halliwell" Penny?
- Yeah.

150
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,404
- Who are you?
- I'm Paige. I'm your gr...

151
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,076
I'm your grandest fan.

152
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,371
I've heard so much about you.

153
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,540
Far out.

154
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,125
Far out.

155
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,546
You have no idea how far out.

156
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,882
The whitelighters
are putting on a light show.

157
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:13,262
Come on, Paige,
you don't wanna miss this.

158
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,222
What do you mean, you lost Paige?

159
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,682
Well, it was really weird.

160
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:20,894
I mean, one second she was here,
and the next second:

161
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,273
It kind of happened after she
put on a pair of Grams' boots.

162
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,733
Grams cast spells on her clothes
when she was young.

163
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,610
Wait, you knew Grams
when she was young?

164
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,281
Yeah, we crossed paths once or twice
when I was a young whitelighter.

165
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,493
Well, I barely remember it.

166
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,205
Well, if the boots did belong
to your grandmother,

167
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:43,292
we better summon her from the dead.
Maybe she can tell us what happened.

168
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,044
- Okay, let's get the candles.
- But you...

169
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,462
Yeah.

170
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,923
- Really groovy.
- Pretty groovy.

171
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,217
Out of sight.

172
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,181
I'm Robin, by the way.

173
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,682
So, what do you think?

174
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:03,312
Oh, my God, is that Leo?

175
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:09,318
- You know him?
- I thought I did.

176
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,119
- Yeah.
- Yeah, man.

177
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,039
What are all these people
doing here?

178
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:25,501
Oh, they're not just people.
They're witches.

179
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,711
With a few whitelighters thrown in.

180
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:31,256
I don't suppose any of them know
how to open a time portal, do they?

181
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,967
Anything's possible
when you free your minds.

182
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,845
That's why we're gathering
here tonight, for a magical be-in.

183
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,764
Oh, like a human be-in.

184
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:42,142
When Timothy Leary said,
"Tune in, turn on, drop out"?

185
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,811
No, there's no acid allowed
in the manor, Paige.

186
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,980
We're all on a contact high.

187
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,774
I'm not on drugs.

188
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:51,610
I'm just having a bad trip.

189
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,738
How do you know what's
gonna happen at the Human Be-ln?

190
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,907
It's tomorrow at Golden Gate Park.

191
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,868
I just kind of know things.

192
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,454
Like I know I wanna go home.

193
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:06,708
- Do you have an active power?
- Yeah, I can orb.

194
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,919
Groovy.

195
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,630
Hey, everyone, we have
a witch here who can orb.

196
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,590
- Groovy.
- Right on.

197
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,718
Lay some orbs on us, sister.

198
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,140
Fine, if it'll help me
get out of here.

199
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,018
Big, fat tape thingy.

200
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:31,817
Oh, my powers must be down.
Must be the past.

201
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,865
Past few minutes. This patchouli oil,
it's really making me light-headed.

202
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,700
Performance anxiety.

203
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,869
Listen, if you want
some private coaching,

204
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,996
there's an empty room upstairs,
you dig?

205
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:47,082
No, I don't dig.

206
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,837
- You okay, honey?
- Yeah.

207
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,548
I don't know how I'm gonna
get home without my magic.

208
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,764
I've never seen so many witches

209
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,392
just hanging out.

210
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,352
Wait till the magical be-in.

211
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,605
This house was built
on a spiritual nexus.

212
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:14,401
We're gonna tap into its power tonight
and ride the magic wave.

213
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,571
Are you sure
you're Penny Halliwell?

214
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,743
Everything on schedule for tonight?

215
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,871
They're lining up
like lambs to the slaughter.

216
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:27,623
Oh, it's gonna be a massacre.

217
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,962
I wish we could take them out now.
I can't stand these peace-lovers.

218
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,881
Just keep it together
a little while longer.

219
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,383
We want this place packed.

220
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,762
And I see a few new arrivals
since my last visit.

221
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,432
This one's dressed a little strange,
don't you think?

222
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,185
- Where's she from?
- I don't know.

223
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,562
- She just got here.
- Well, keep an eye on her.

224
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,399
The attack takes place
on schedule tonight.

225
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:59,321
And if you need anything,
I'll be close by.

226
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,868
So, what do you say, Paige?
Join us tonight?

227
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:07,704
You know, as much as I
consider myself a free spirit,

228
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,623
I really can't.
I need to go home.

229
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,043
If there's any way that you can help
me write a spell so I can find my way...

230
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,420
Oh, Allen's back.

231
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,265
- Hi.
- Hey.

232
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,230
Where's Patty?

233
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:36,608
I dropped her off at my sister's.
She's gonna crash there tonight.

234
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:37,818
Patty, like "Mom" Patty?

235
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,321
I mean, you're a mom.

236
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,784
- Janice?
- Excuse me?

237
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,452
I just came back
from my sister's pad,

238
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,164
and for a second I thought
I was looking at her again.

239
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,500
Paige, this is my old man, Allen.

240
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,878
He's not a witch,
but he's cool with it.

241
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,089
- Allen, your first husband.
- My first and only.

242
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,841
I'm not that into free love.

243
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,635
Listen up, I passed this groovy
drum circle on my way here.

244
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,054
- Who wants to check it out?
- Count me in.

245
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,806
I think I'm gonna
do some light reading.

246
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,142
Is your Book of Shadows
in the attic?

247
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,644
I swear, it's like you could
be my sister.

248
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,479
Or your granddaughter.

249
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:20,694
If you had a granddaughter, that is,
which you won't unless I get home.

250
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,321
You can't leave now.

251
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,323
We need as many witches
as possible tonight.

252
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,992
She's right, Paige, come with us.

253
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,536
Who wants a ride
on the rainbow bus?

254
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,216
You know, if I hadn't
taken over Paige's room,

255
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,760
this never would've happened.
This is all my fault.

256
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,887
- What's done is done.
- What's done is done.

257
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,265
Okay, you two really need
to get a room.

258
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,475
Yeah.

259
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,603
Hear these words, hear my cry
Spirit from the other side

260
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,190
Come to thee, I summon thee
Cross now the great divide

261
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,702
Well, it's about time
you called to say hello.

262
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,413
Oh, how are my darlings?

263
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,375
We got a problem.

264
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,253
Well, you're not the only one.

265
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,588
- Orb out.
- No, magic makes it grow.

266
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,549
Summoning her spirit
already gave it power.

267
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,261
Oh, you must be Chris,
the new whitelighter.

268
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,057
You know, he doesn't look
very qualified for the job.

269
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:34,726
- Chris, just let me blast it.
- She's right. Orb.

270
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,311
For heavens' sakes, listen to them.

271
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,565
We'll find a way
to vanquish the foul thing later.

272
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:41,900
Now.

273
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:57,166
You and Paige moved out?

274
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,335
- When?
- A few weeks ago.

275
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,879
But we're handling everything.

276
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,632
Dear, you have Paige
stuck in the past

277
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,885
and a demonic blob
roaming the manor.

278
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,929
Exactly how are you
handling things?

279
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,599
We're still in an adjustment period.

280
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:17,811
There would be no adjustment period
if you were living under one roof.

281
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,856
Why in heaven's name
did you move out?

282
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,691
To be with Jason.

283
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,862
You said it yourself,
"never give up on love." Remember?

284
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,614
I didn't say give up on your sisters.

285
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,075
And you. You're the oldest,
how could you let them move out?

286
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,703
You know, it really wasn't that hard,

287
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,915
because they deserve a shot
at a normal life.

288
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,208
They're not normal, Piper.

289
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,752
And neither are you.
When are you going to learn that?

290
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,712
Well, I guess never.

291
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:48,550
All this over men.

292
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,720
How many times have I told you,
men are utensils.

293
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:52,930
You use them, wash them,

294
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,307
and throw them in a drawer
until you need them again.

295
00:16:58,602 --> 00:16:59,811
Everyone, quiet.

296
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,735
I can hear it.

297
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,448
I think it's in the wall.

298
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:16,286
Yeah, it's in the wall.

299
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,498
We need Paige. It took the power
of three to vanquish it in the future.

300
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,291
What?

301
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,795
If you knew that, why didn't
you tell me that in the first place?

302
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,464
I could barely get two of you
together, let alone three.

303
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,425
Besides, it's not that big right now.
I thought two could handle it.

304
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,010
Leo, you take point.

305
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,805
Chris here is much too green
to guide my girls.

306
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,432
What? You know what,
you can just stop that right...

307
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,642
Quiet.

308
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,812
It's time to give
this floundering ship a rudder.

309
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:44,857
Now, which boots did Paige put on?

310
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,817
Red. Go-go boots.

311
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,610
We've got a problem.

312
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,321
Those boots took Paige back
to the Summer of Love,

313
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,157
which was one of the most
crucial times of my life.

314
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,617
What do you mean, crucial?

315
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,287
Your grandfather Allen, rest his soul,
was a sweet man,

316
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:01,039
but he led me straight down
the hippie-dippie trail.

317
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,126
- You were a flower child?
- Yeah, well, don't rub it in.

318
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:07,796
What's important is that
Allen was killed by my best friend.

319
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:10,174
I didn't know it then,
but she was evil.

320
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,050
And I walked in
right after it happened.

321
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,385
What did you do?

322
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:17,890
Well, let's just say that
my peacenik days ended fast.

323
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,058
Along with that bitch Robin.

324
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,729
- If she hadn't killed Allen...
- You'd still be a flower child.

325
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,315
And the Charmed Ones
would be dead.

326
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,193
I know I'm a ball-buster.

327
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,069
But it kept me alive
to protect my girls

328
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:34,781
from all the demons
that came after them as kids.

329
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,745
I cast my return-to-owner spell
on a lot of clothes that summer.

330
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,538
- So...
- So we get to go back there?

331
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,499
And we get to meet
our grandfather?

332
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,126
Don't make too much out of it,
because whatever you do,

333
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:50,005
you can't change the past
or tell anyone you're from the future.

334
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,925
- Well, why does he get to?
- Because I know what I'm doing.

335
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:55,761
Not from where I'm standing.

336
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:58,764
I'll stay here with Leo and the newbie
to contain the slime

337
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:01,475
until you can bring Paige back
to vanquish it, okay?

338
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:06,438
Okay, girls, get dressed.
You are going to the Summer of Love.

339
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,818
Hear the drums.

340
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:17,115
Liquid beats crashing down
On parched shores

341
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:23,956
Pounding like the feet of 10,000
soldiers Whispering "why?"

342
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,584
- Why?
- Right on.

343
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:39,805
Sorry, I just got a little carried away.

344
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,099
Don't be sorry, that was gone.

345
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,600
- Gone, that's right.
- Hey, Robin!

346
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,269
That's exactly
what I should be, gone,

347
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:49,898
because I'm actually
starting to dig... Like this.

348
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:53,193
It's kind of cool,
everybody being so free.

349
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,486
Robin, come here.

350
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:58,407
You are exactly
what we're all about, Paige.

351
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:00,117
Do you wanna hear my dream?

352
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:04,872
I dream of a crusade
to rid the world of evil.

353
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,126
Not through fighting or the inner anger
that makes us wanna fight,

354
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:12,254
but through the magic power of love.

355
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,549
Are you sure you're Penny Halliwell?

356
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,969
- How long have you felt this way?
- Ever since I met Allen.

357
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,847
It must be so great
to share this together.

358
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,766
Your old man's not into magic?

359
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,436
He's not so old,

360
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:29,938
but no, not so into it either.

361
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,611
Hey, groovy girl,
we've been looking for you.

362
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,821
Welcome. I'm Penny.

363
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,199
Any friends of Paige's
are friends of ours.

364
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,826
But you shouldn't
use magic so openly.

365
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,369
That's Grams.

366
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,538
I'm Allen. Peace and love.

367
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:50,459
Oh, yes, love. Lots and lots of love.

368
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,378
I have so much love for you, man,
you have no idea.

369
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,547
You here for the happening
at the manor tonight?

370
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,926
No, we were just looking
for our friend Paige, actually.

371
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,469
Excuse us.

372
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:03,847
- So glad you guys found me.
- We need to get out of here.

373
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,020
It's the pigs.

374
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,940
Okay, everybody, let's break it up.

375
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,150
Let's go, everybody out. Move it.

376
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:18,737
This is a park, man.
You can't control God's green earth.

377
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:21,240
It's the taxpayers' green dollars
that pay for this park.

378
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,326
And you're loitering, so move it.

379
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:27,746
Hell, no, we won't go
Hell, no, we won't go

380
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:31,083
Hell, no, we won't go
Hell, no, we won't go

381
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,920
They have no right
They have no power

382
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:38,882
Turn their hate sticks into flowers

383
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,681
Let's jam. If the cops catch us,
we'll miss tonight.

384
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:49,393
- Piper, freeze them.
- I can't.

385
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,521
- Come on, let's go.
- Paige, come on. Come on.

386
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,232
No way, man.

387
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,361
If what's happening tonight
at the manor is what I think it is,

388
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:01,405
this might be the night
that Grandpa dies.

389
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:04,074
Let's just hope that Paige
tries to get us out of here first.

390
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,827
I don't wanna be raised by
that flower child we saw in the park.

391
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,163
- We'd never make it to puberty.
- You don't own me!

392
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,875
You think you own me, but the Man
will never own Luther Morris.

393
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:17,087
- I said, keep it down.
- No.

394
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:22,467
What are you two looking at?

395
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,846
Please, there's gotta be a way
to get my friends out of jail.

396
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:32,144
Stay cool, Paige.
We've all been hassled by the pigs.

397
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,729
It's a rite of passage.

398
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,900
They'll let your friends go...

399
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,651
...after a night in jail.

400
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,654
Okay, everybody,
time to prepare for the party.

401
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:46,617
Take a crystal, bless it
and hide it outside the manor.

402
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,411
- We wanna form a perimeter.
- What are those?

403
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:50,787
Those are pyrite crystals.

404
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:53,665
They resonate a harmonic tone
when exposed to evil.

405
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,627
Kind of like
a demonic alarm system.

406
00:22:57,085 --> 00:23:00,631
- How did you know?
- I was taught by the best.

407
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:04,009
I thought our gathering tonight
was a peaceful one.

408
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:08,472
I wanna give peace a chance as much
as anyone, Robin, but I'm not dumb.

409
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:11,016
You know how many covens
are coming tonight?

410
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:14,686
- We'll be sitting ducks.
- Right.

411
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:21,026
I would really love it
if my friends could come tonight.

412
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:24,613
If there's anything
that we can do to help them...

413
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,284
Tell you what, I got a friend
who's an ACLU lawyer.

414
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,245
I'll call him...

415
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,664
...right after we set the crystals.

416
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,208
Thank you.

417
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,462
The way I see it,
we're all targets for the slime.

418
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:43,507
We need a plan to control it
until the girls get back.

419
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:46,677
In the future, everyone tried
to control the demon with no name.

420
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:50,138
- But it can't be done.
- That's hardly a winning attitude.

421
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,641
And why in heaven's name
couldn't the people in the future

422
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,017
find some name for that thing?

423
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,812
Speaking of the future, what's
so awful that happens to Wyatt?

424
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:58,981
- I can't tell you that.
- Come on, I'm an Elder.

425
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:02,401
Excuse me, back on point.
The slime?

426
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:06,280
- I'm taking suggestions.
- We could orb it to an ice drift.

427
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,575
- No, that's bad.
- It's not bad, it's awful.

428
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:12,161
You can't orb that thing,
it feeds on magic.

429
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,581
- So, what's your great idea?
- Are you giving me lip?

430
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,541
No.

431
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,084
No!

432
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,429
Hold on.

433
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:34,016
I think it stopped.

434
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:38,729
Get Wyatt out of the house.

435
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:42,941
If it tries to follow, I'll fire off
an orb or two to distract it.

436
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:46,111
- You okay with that?
- Yeah, it's just what I had in mind.

437
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:47,946
Okay.

438
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:08,800
- Any sign of Paige?
- Nope.

439
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:12,596
We're not gonna reach her
before Grandpa's attacked.

440
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,976
- Should we try a spell?
- Why not? Let's try a spell.

441
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:21,230
Leave it to the Man to lock
the brother up with the crazies.

442
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:28,904
Come to me and be seduced
I have a girl to introduce

443
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:34,660
Fall for her, you can't resist her
Trust me, mister, she's my sister

444
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:36,829
- Why me?
- Because he's not my type.

445
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:42,501
- Hi.
- Hi.

446
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:45,170
You know what I think is really hot?

447
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:47,506
A guy in a cage.

448
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:50,926
Yeah. Why don't you
come in here with me.

449
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:53,595
All right.

450
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,103
Take off your shirt.

451
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,605
Hey, hey, hey.

452
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:05,649
Luther don't wanna see this.

453
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:10,696
Put this on. You're gonna
lead us to freedom, Luther.

454
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:12,698
A brother could get used to this.

455
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,701
So could a brother's son.

456
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:19,413
There's my little
psychedelic sunshine.

457
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,874
Are you ready
for your private session?

458
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,502
Yeah. Real soon.
Have you seen Allen?

459
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,338
He was supposed to call
his lawyer friends for me.

460
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:32,551
My name is Leo.
Like the zodiac sign.

461
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:35,888
Astrologically speaking,
Leo represents the sun.

462
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:40,142
Constantly burning
and highly energetic.

463
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:43,687
Okay, starshine.

464
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:45,731
Could you just please
point me in the direction

465
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:48,025
where I might find Allen?

466
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,529
Thank you.

467
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,909
And so I call upon the Crone

468
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:01,663
Let evil roam inside this home

469
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,916
I thought you were acting strange.

470
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,754
Allen.

471
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:12,716
- Are you spying on me?
- How could you, Robin?

472
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,801
What about our dream?

473
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,846
My only dream
is helping my warlock friend

474
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:21,266
put all of you weak creatures
out of your misery tonight.

475
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,061
Robin.

476
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,066
Violence isn't the answer, Robin.

477
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:32,945
Let love replace your fear.
I know you've felt our love.

478
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:37,658
Yeah, and I still got
the stink of it all over me.

479
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,660
Over here!

480
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,795
Allen.

481
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,090
All right.

482
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:56,468
- What did I just do?
- Oh, nothing much.

483
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:59,012
Just changed our entire future.

484
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:00,264
Or erased it.

485
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:04,434
What did it do, split in half?

486
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,645
- How do we get out?
- I don't know.

487
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:08,939
Orb?

488
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:12,401
The last time I orbed,
that thing almost swallowed me whole.

489
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,197
- What do you think, Penny?
- I think love conquers all.

490
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:22,995
I think that we should take the demon
into our arms and make it feel safe.

491
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:34,089
Leo, can I talk to you
for a second, please?

492
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:37,217
Do you mind holding him
for a second?

493
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:40,721
Of course. Come here, moonbeam.

494
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:44,683
Wyatt. His name is Wyatt.

495
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,687
One of the sisters
must have changed the past,

496
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:50,939
because Penny clearly
never made the change

497
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:54,443
from flower child to demon hunter.

498
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:59,865
We shall not
We shall not be moved

499
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:03,702
Clearly. Think the girls can
fix the timeline and get back here?

500
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:11,835
I don't know.

501
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:14,129
But this thing's
trying to back us into a corner.

502
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:19,843
Take Wyatt and Joan Baez here
into the conservatory.

503
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,387
I'll gather what we need
to fight it off.

504
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:31,313
Has anyone seen Robin?
We got a lot of...

505
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:35,025
- What happened?
- Robin, she attacked.

506
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:38,070
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right.

507
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:41,031
She said something about
a warlock attacking tonight.

508
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:43,784
So? That's no problem,
you have a house full of witches.

509
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:47,371
Piper's right. You could all take on the
warlocks. All you have to do is fight.

510
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:50,791
That's not who we are.
We don't believe in murder.

511
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,167
No, neither do we.

512
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:54,169
But we do believe
in vanquishing evil.

513
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:58,590
I'm sorry, I don't see violence
as a solution to anything.

514
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:00,300
I thought
you understood that, Paige.

515
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:03,595
- I thought you were one of us.
- Let's go. Let's send everyone home.

516
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:06,515
I don't want anyone else
getting hurt.

517
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,394
Oh, she is driving me nuts.

518
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,646
That is not the Grams we all know.

519
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:15,691
The Grams we know
found her husband dead tonight.

520
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:19,194
I know we're supposed to turn her
into a bit of a killer or whatever,

521
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:23,991
but what if this happens to be
her new destiny? With Grandpa.

522
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:27,202
If Grandpa was supposed to die tonight,
death will come after him again.

523
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:32,082
The first thing we have to remember
is we're not here to change anything.

524
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:33,584
We just need to keep Grams alive,

525
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,544
and unfortunately,
we don't have our powers.

526
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:38,172
Well, it's a lot thinner
than we're used to,

527
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:42,759
but I'm sure we could find something
in here to help us make a potion.

528
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:45,387
- Will you help me?
- Yeah.

529
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:47,931
I'll be downstairs
on warlock watch.

530
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:49,600
Why isn't it attacking?

531
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:52,603
It's like it cornered us
and now it's just waiting.

532
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,022
I think we need the toaster oven.

533
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:00,694
You know, that's a disaster
waiting to happen.

534
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:02,029
That's the idea.

535
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,406
You saw how the slime
reacted to the electricity.

536
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:08,535
Well, if we can get it to attack this pile,
maybe we can get it to zap it.

537
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:10,579
If I could find a place to plug it in.

538
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:12,998
No offence, but, you know,
my dear Allen

539
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:15,417
would have taken the path
of peaceful resistance.

540
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,754
Have you tried talking to the slime?

541
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:21,715
No, I haven't,
and you shouldn't either.

542
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:23,717
But if you're up
for some conversation,

543
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:26,303
maybe you wanna tell me
what happens to Wyatt in the future.

544
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,638
Nice try.

545
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:30,349
Got it.

546
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,311
Damn it.

547
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:38,232
I told you boys,
violence is not the answer to anything.

548
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,193
- Where's the fuse box?
- It's in the basement.

549
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,570
You'll find a flashlight
in the laundry room.

550
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:55,833
Leo.

551
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,503
What is it? What is it?

552
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,256
The slime, in the basement,
feeding on nexus.

553
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,049
How big was it?

554
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:15,602
- Big.
- Yeah. Big.

555
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,817
- We were going to make history.
- I know, honey.

556
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:28,448
- We need to talk.
- I agree.

557
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,284
We need to talk with the warlock

558
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,581
and find a path of peaceful resistance
to resolve this situation.

559
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:39,126
The first thing my Grams taught me
was not to reason with demons.

560
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:44,214
- Your grandmother fought demons?
- Yeah, she was a great woman.

561
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:48,385
And she knew that you can't
reason or negotiate with demons.

562
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:53,140
They kill. And they keep killing
until a force of good stops them.

563
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:55,684
If your grandmother
hurt other living creatures,

564
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:58,812
she doesn't sound so great to me.
I'm sorry.

565
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,314
Penny's right.

566
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,025
You can't be a saviour
and a murderer at the same time.

567
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:07,196
Really? What if a demon
attacked somebody you loved?

568
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,740
Like your daughter?

569
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:11,825
Would you fight then?

570
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,413
Where are all the witches?

571
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,916
Where in the hell
are all the witches?

572
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,335
Where are they?

573
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:24,671
Well, that depends on
who you're looking for.

574
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:28,383
- Everybody.
- We sent them home.

575
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:31,887
The manor's yours.
We won't fight you.

576
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,100
Do something.

577
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:40,771
May peace and love
From the moon above

578
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:44,191
Flow through your heart
On the wings of a dove

579
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:49,738
Did you just try
and cast a love spell on me?

580
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,742
I'm a warlock.

581
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:55,619
What is this world coming to?

582
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,708
No!

583
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,424
No.

584
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:14,805
- Allen.
- Your turn to join him, sweetheart.

585
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,057
Hey.

586
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,651
- I think he's gone.
- For now.

587
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:32,573
- This isn't right.
- What do you mean?

588
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,868
Grams flew into a rage
when she found Grandpa dead.

589
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,619
It made her what she was.

590
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:40,247
Does that look like
a demon killer to you?

591
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:47,212
If the demon comes at us,
I'll try to hold it off with this.

592
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:54,803
Don't be afraid of us.
We won't hurt you.

593
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,013
Penny, get back.

594
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:06,023
How are you so calm right now?

595
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,484
It's okay for you to be angry.
That warlock killed your husband.

596
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:11,612
I am angry.

597
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,072
At myself.

598
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:17,493
That's why I'm mixing
a binding potion.

599
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,244
Binding your magic
is not the answer.

600
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:23,582
It is for me.
I tried to save Allen and I failed.

601
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:26,627
What good is my magic
if it can't save my family?

602
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:29,838
It's a lot of good.
Remember your dream?

603
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:33,008
You can't turn your back on it now.
What would Allen think?

604
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:34,801
Doesn't matter, he's dead.

605
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:36,512
No one will ever compare to him.

606
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:41,016
I'll probably end up hating men
for the rest of my life.

607
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:43,519
- Well, she's got us there.
- Magic can save your family.

608
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:45,437
I mean, my sisters have saved...

609
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:51,401
You said these were your friends.
What's going on? Who are you?

610
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:57,324
- Don't. Can't change history.
- It's a little late now, isn't it?

611
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:00,828
We're your granddaughters.

612
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,916
- Hi, Grams.
- I'm your Grams?

613
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,584
The demon hunter?

614
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:11,922
Yeah, and these fancy boots
brought me from the future.

615
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:15,008
- And these earrings.
- And this ring.

616
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:18,554
- No, you're trying to trick me.
- No, afraid not, Grams.

617
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,265
Look, it's payback time.
You need to get your act together.

618
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:23,976
We love you, but if you don't
start fighting now,

619
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:25,978
all the people we're meant to save...

620
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,275
You didn't think I forgot about you?

621
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:33,902
Those were our potions.

622
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:43,287
Wyatt's in the living room. No sign
of the demon in the rest of the house.

623
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:46,290
I think it was distracting us before
so it could feed on nexus.

624
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:48,292
- What about Penny? Is she?
- I don't know.

625
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:57,467
I can't keep up with it,
we gotta get out.

626
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,261
No, we have to keep fighting.

627
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:01,847
That's what Penny
would want us to do.

628
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:10,606
Not quite the slaughter I expected.

629
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:13,692
But it'll have to do for a night's work.

630
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,652
Stop.

631
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:20,324
What are you gonna do?
Cast another love spell?

632
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,330
Well, it's about time.

633
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:31,084
Like you said, Piper, it's okay to fight
for someone you love, right?

634
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:37,758
Welcome back
to your destiny, Grams.

635
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,721
Now she's just showing off.

636
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:45,599
Okay, the grandfather clock.

637
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:53,941
What do I usually do at this point?

638
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:57,110
You usually do something very final,
if you catch my drift.

639
00:38:00,322 --> 00:38:03,283
Snuff this warlock
His days are done

640
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:07,704
But make him good
For the ecosystem

641
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:13,669
Now, that's what you call
flower power.

642
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:20,467
Not exactly ruthless, but a fine start.

643
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:22,052
That was for Allen.

644
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:25,180
So now what?

645
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:27,140
Now we gotta get home fast

646
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:30,185
because we have a slimy demon
of our own to deal with.

647
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:33,689
- How are we gonna do that?
- Grams just has to reverse the spell.

648
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:37,568
Glad to know
I have groovy grandkids.

649
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:42,489
Just the same, I think I'm gonna work
on a forgetting spell for after you go.

650
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:46,577
- You know, keep the cosmic order.
- Oh, I like this Grams.

651
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:49,163
I don't want to forget you.

652
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:57,087
- Get out of here, go.
- No, not without you.

653
00:38:57,254 --> 00:39:00,257
- This thing's gonna swallow you whole.
- Most likely.

654
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:03,385
Stand back, fellas.

655
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:07,389
Drawing on the power of three
Destroy this evil entity

656
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:22,196
- Where's Wyatt?
- He's in the living room.

657
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,655
What about Grams?

658
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:29,912
She didn't make it.

659
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:38,962
Nonsense. You can't damage
an old warhorse like me.

660
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:41,006
I'm already dead.

661
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:44,551
Yay, Grams.
I'm so glad you're back.

662
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,766
Hey there, sun god.

663
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:54,978
Hey, that was a long time ago.
Let's just keep that between us, okay?

664
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:59,483
Hey, I wanna thank you two
for not giving up the fight.

665
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,236
I'm really proud of you boys.

666
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,655
You did good.

667
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:13,038
Grams gone?

668
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:16,250
Yes, but not before
yelling at us for moving out.

669
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:19,628
It was good to hear her
yell at us for a change.

670
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:21,588
So did she convince you
to move back in?

671
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:25,926
No, but she did give us her blessing
after she was done yelling.

672
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:28,887
- Really?
- Well, she gave up a lot to be a witch.

673
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:31,807
- You know, she lost Grandpa.
- And her dreams.

674
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:34,142
I don't think she wants that
to happen to us.

675
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:37,354
But she did make me promise
that I would keep in touch more.

676
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:41,149
And I have to promise
to keep using my magic.

677
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:45,154
I guess Grams really is
a softie underneath it all.

678
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,782
- So you guys going home?
- Home is a relative term.

679
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,450
But, yeah, we're heading out.

680
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:53,537
No, I should get back
and finish my origami dragon.

681
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:55,664
Yeah, I understand.

682
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,626
Well, you guys know
you always have a home here.

683
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:05,007
And a room when you want it back.
I mean, if you want it back.

684
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:32,367
Everything all right?

685
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:34,578
No, it's not.

686
00:41:34,745 --> 00:41:38,165
I mean, I know it seems to them
that I'm moving on with my life

687
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:42,586
and everything's fine,
but it's not true.

688
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:44,505
I wish they were still here.

689
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:48,884
- You should tell them that.
- No. I shouldn't.

690
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:52,429
I should just go to bed.
Good night.

691
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:54,181
Good night.

692
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:01,021
Good night, moonbeam.
