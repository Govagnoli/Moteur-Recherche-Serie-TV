1
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,478
Ow!

2
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,938
Are you okay?

3
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:26,276
Yeah, nothing a little sleep can't fix.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,695
- Let me heal that.
- No.

5
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,322
- Come on!
- I said no.

6
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,866
We have to talk about this.

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,411
What we need to do is find
where the next attack is gonna be.

8
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,539
And I think I just did.

9
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,875
Pentagram. Naturally.

10
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,335
What do you want from me?

11
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,547
What do I have to do to prove
that I've changed, that I'm okay?

12
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,471
- Did Phoebe and Paige finish the dye?
- You didn't answer my question!

13
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,891
- You don't have to answer mine?
- What questions?

14
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:01,895
The question I've been asking you for
days now. What aren't you telling me?

15
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,147
I don't know what you're talking about.

16
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,900
Oh, right. Excuse me.

17
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,321
I can't get into this
with you right now, okay?

18
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,991
I've got an invisible demon
killing innocents.

19
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,077
For all we know, they could
be working with the Avatars.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,246
They're not working with the Avatars!

21
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,664
How do you know?

22
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,668
I don't! I don't think they're the
threat everyone thinks they are.

23
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,504
- Why?
- Wouldn't they have attacked?

24
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,465
Sending a demon to possess you
doesn't count?

25
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:35,220
Still, I think that was their way of
communicating with me... with us.

26
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,308
Why didn't they just
try calling you, Leo?

27
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,851
Are you hiding something?

28
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,728
- No.
- Yes.

29
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,440
Are you sure those are gonna work?

30
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,817
Yeah, as sure as I can be at five a.m.

31
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,695
- Before...
- Know where the demon's gonna attack?

32
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:56,200
They're making a pentagram.
We need to get there before sunrise.

33
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,618
You can't walk out!

34
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,412
You're right, we should orb.

35
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,581
- Sixteenth and Mission.
- Got it.

36
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,378
Damn it! I said no!

37
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,931
- Ow!
- What happened?

38
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,392
Nothing a little sleep won't fix.
It's fine.

39
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,853
- Didn't you just say that?
- What?

40
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,314
Nothing.

41
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,234
I think I found where
the next demon attack is gonna be.

42
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,154
A pentagram. Naturally.

43
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,867
Did Phoebe and Paige
finish that dye yet?

44
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,827
I don't know.

45
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,497
Excuse me.

46
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,297
Why did you do this?

47
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,716
We didn't, you did.

48
00:02:55,843 --> 00:03:00,639
You need to be more careful
about your new powers, Leo.

49
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,267
Reversing time can be...

50
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,936
...very dangerous.

51
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:42,866
Our powers are not meant to be
used for personal reasons, Leo.

52
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,660
You know that.

53
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:49,206
I know. I didn't mean to,
it just happened.

54
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,751
Yes, because you wanted it to happen.

55
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:55,963
You must be more careful in the future.

56
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,048
Learn to control your emotions.

57
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,177
Control is the first discipline
of an Avatar.

58
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:06,932
Otherwise our powers
can become dangerous to others...

59
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,768
...as well as to ourselves.
- What do you mean?

60
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,771
Reversing time the way you did
requires great power.

61
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,691
It drains the collective
and it puts us at risk.

62
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,193
And we must remain at full strength

63
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,446
if we are to defeat the forces of evil.

64
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,117
If we are to implement... the change.

65
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,203
I get that.
But Piper's my wife.

66
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:31,081
She knows something's up.
I can't keep lying to her.

67
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,126
We understand your position, Leo.

68
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,296
But to tell her outright
might cause her to overreact,

69
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,339
and mistakenly view us as a threat.

70
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,633
As might her sisters as well.

71
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:45,721
They must come to the truth
in their own time and in their own way.

72
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,306
Just as you did.

73
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,849
What if they don't?

74
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,103
What if Piper never
sees the future you promised?

75
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:57,858
You must help her to see it, Leo.
You must gently guide her to it.

76
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,570
This is the burden that you took
upon becoming an Avatar.

77
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,739
I'm not just an Avatar.

78
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:08,535
I'm a husband, and I'm a father,
and I joined you to get that back.

79
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,705
And you will get it back, Leo.

80
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,915
You will!

81
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:17,669
Once we have ended this perpetual
battle between good and evil.

82
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,255
Once we have brought forth...

83
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,299
...a better way.

84
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,023
Okay, it's almost dawn
and nothing's happening.

85
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,692
Can we go home
and go to sleep now?

86
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,819
Just stay focused.

87
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,197
Right, focused.

88
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,241
Maybe you drew the pentagram wrong.

89
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,952
I know how to draw a pentagram,
thank you.

90
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,745
But did you use a felt marker?

91
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:56,625
'Cause maybe the thickness of the tip
led us astray a couple of blocks, huh?

92
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,420
What's the matter with you guys?
Do you want to save an innocent or not?

93
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,715
Of course we do, it's just...

94
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,926
What? It's just what?

95
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,972
Now you're not telling me something?

96
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,807
- Leo's what.
- What?

97
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,143
We just think that you may have been
so eager to avoid Leo

98
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,729
that you miscalculated the demon attack.

99
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:18,981
What she said.

100
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,149
All right, fine, I admit it,

101
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,736
I may be avoiding Leo, but that
does not mean I am wrong about this.

102
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,532
Why? Why are you so upset with him?
He's been an angel lately.

103
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,492
Yeah, well that's the problem.

104
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,911
He's been too perfect, even for him.

105
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,831
And I just keep waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

106
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,500
Why don't you just talk to him about it?

107
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:42,379
I have about a dozen times and he
just thinks I'm crazy or something.

108
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,508
Which is why I am channelling
my frustration into something useful.

109
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,136
I just want this demon to attack soon,

110
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,471
so I can make
my breakfast date with Kyle.

111
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,473
Yeah, see breakfast is not a date.

112
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,894
Dinner's a date.
Lunch is definitely maybe a date.

113
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,021
Breakfast is always just breakfast.

114
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:04,401
As long as he doesn't talk about
the Avatars, I will consider it a date.

115
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,821
Who is calling you at this hour?

116
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,324
No one.

117
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,700
Avoiding someone?

118
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,537
Is that our innocent?

119
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:18,999
We're about to find out.
Get the dye.

120
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,962
He'll have to become visible
to attack, let's go.

121
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,716
Who the hell are you?

122
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,843
It won't matter.

123
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,473
Hey!

124
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,563
Kill them.

125
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,483
Throw the dye!

126
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,030
Energy ball!

127
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,533
Heads up, guys.

128
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:02,334
That didn't go too well. They're a lot
more powerful than I thought.

129
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,877
He's still alive.

130
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,880
Let's get him to Magic School
and find out who they are.

131
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,257
And make more potions.

132
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,346
The innocent has been marked,

133
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,224
the territory staked.

134
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,394
Soon, every mortal within the pentagram

135
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,355
will be ours alone to prey upon.

136
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,899
But the innocent lives.
Our rivals...

137
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,610
Can no more easily kill than we can.

138
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,282
Now that the Charmed Ones
are protecting him.

139
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,950
Then how is the territory staked?

140
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,912
As long as he lives, the Sokols could
still try to claim it for themselves.

141
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,914
And we want them to try.

142
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,167
Or at least make it look like they did.

143
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,212
Witches don't know who we are, right?

144
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,714
Right.

145
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,675
So we put them on our rival's trail

146
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:55,137
by making them think
the Sokols attacked them.

147
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,563
Excuse me, there you are.

148
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,816
Thank you.

149
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,986
So, this place is great.

150
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,072
Yeah? Are you sure?
I mean you do like the place?

151
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:18,410
Well, I've never had breakfast here,
but I'm sure it's terrific.

152
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,998
I guess I should have
asked you out to dinner.

153
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,667
It's fine, I'm up this early anyway.

154
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:29,463
I figured since we got the first kiss
out of the way and everything.

155
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,465
Out of the way?

156
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,841
Sorry.

157
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:37,763
I didn't mean that. I did not mean that.
I just, you know, I'm rusty.

158
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,098
All Avatars, all the time?

159
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,892
Yeah, something like that.

160
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,061
I've been chasing them for so long.

161
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,563
It hasn't left much time
for a social life.

162
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:50,108
Then maybe it's time you start
changing that, don't you think?

163
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,277
Yes, I think.

164
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,406
It's just that they're so close, Paige.

165
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,200
I mean I know it, I can feel...

166
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,786
But... you promised.

167
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,580
You're right. You're right, that's it.

168
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:07,209
No more Avatar talk, I swear.

169
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,557
Good. It's a good start.

170
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,019
What?

171
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:30,065
It's... it's vibrating, it just
tickles a little bit, that's all.

172
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,653
It's off. I promise.

173
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,196
No more distractions.

174
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:44,204
That's my emergency line,
I gotta take this. Sorry.

175
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,706
Brody.

176
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,168
What?

177
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,712
As soon as you get
those numbers, call me.

178
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:58,385
Intel just detected another
unusual power spike in the area.

179
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,430
This could mean
some serious Avatar activity!

180
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,892
You know what this means?

181
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:09,688
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
It means that you eat alone.

182
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,356
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,110
Paige, come on.

184
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:20,908
Idiot.

185
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:28,081
The good thing about getting up
so early is how much you can get done.

186
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,418
Already today, I've made demon dye,
I've saved an innocent,

187
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,879
I e-mailed in my column,
plucked my eyebrows.

188
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,757
If it wasn't for sleep deprivation,
I would be okay.

189
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,175
What about the demons?

190
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,470
I couldn't find anything in the Book
to help identify them.

191
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,764
I did get to read up
on the family history.

192
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:47,100
Did you know that Beatrice Warren
only had one leg?

193
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,728
You're making spaghetti sauce?

194
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,605
No, that's demon blood.

195
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,775
I got it from the salvage yard.

196
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,487
I was gonna use it to scry for them
after I make the vanquishing potion.

197
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,323
Wow, jacklebeet.

198
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:05,244
So exactly which state
are you trying to blow off the map?

199
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,120
I don't want to take any chances.

200
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,413
We need two kitchens.

201
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,749
Do you know where the beetle toe is?

202
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,918
I think it's in the attic.

203
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,297
When you're avoiding something,
you really do a number.

204
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:22,052
I seem to remember someone
doing some avoiding a little while back.

205
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,597
Yeah, if you're talking about Leslie,
you're absolutely right.

206
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:29,226
But my big sister gave me some advice
that I'm gonna give back to you.

207
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,104
Stop dodging. Just talk to Leo.

208
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,982
On the subject of dodging,
who called this morning?

209
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:39,194
Yeah, your
"I'm covering something" look

210
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,322
hasn't worked since the 6th grade,
so spill.

211
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:46,034
Okay. But you can't tell Paige.
I don't want her to get paranoid.

212
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:47,661
Why would she get paranoid?

213
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:52,040
Darryl thinks Brody had something
to do with Sheridan's disappearance.

214
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:54,251
That's why I'm keeping it low key.

215
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,921
Darryl's on his way over. We're
gonna talk while Paige is on her date.

216
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,464
He's talking to us again?

217
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,342
Kinda. Baby steps.

218
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,389
Hi.

219
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,433
Hi.

220
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,395
I'll be in the attic.

221
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,150
Well, go talk to her, would you!

222
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,319
Hurry up, go!

223
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,244
- Hey.
- Hey.

224
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:30,829
Is this a good time to talk?

225
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,624
Well, actually yeah,
Paige is out on a date.

226
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,584
- What did you find out?
- Nothing.

227
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,962
Nothing? Okay, well,
nothing is good, right?

228
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,173
No. I mean I can't find anything.

229
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,426
It's like Sheridan's disappeared
off the face of the earth.

230
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,677
What are you saying?

231
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:49,515
I think that maybe Brody did something
to make Sheridan disappear.

232
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,226
Something bad maybe.

233
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,019
No, I don't believe that.

234
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,771
You don't want to believe that.

235
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:59,816
Brody may have saved your butts,
I get that.

236
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,737
But if he did something to hurt
Sheridan... wrong is wrong.

237
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,282
Okay, well maybe I can get
a premonition and see where she is.

238
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,952
No. No magic.

239
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,830
I've done some soul-searching.

240
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,958
I want to help again,
but I don't want to go there any more.

241
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,085
Darryl, you gotta get over this.

242
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,421
I mean really,
one bad experience with magic

243
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,550
can't outweigh six years of good,
can it?

244
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,386
Hey.

245
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,720
Hi, Paige.

246
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,097
Hey, Darryl.

247
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,058
- I thought you were on your date.
- Yeah, so did I.

248
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,353
Look, tell Piper I said hello, okay?

249
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,231
Take care.

250
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,399
Take care.

251
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,572
We're friends again?

252
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,157
Yeah. Weird.

253
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,826
Bygones.

254
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,499
Leo, please,
this is not the time or place.

255
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,752
I just want my family back, Piper.
I just want you back.

256
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,755
- I don't want to talk about this now.
- Why not?

257
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,465
This is a little dicey here.

258
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,552
- That's why we need to talk.
- No, not that, this.

259
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,597
If I make one mistake,
I can blow up the entire house.

260
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,765
Okay, so this is a bad time.

261
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,018
I just wish you'd trust me.

262
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,896
Yeah, well maybe you should
try telling me the truth.

263
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,689
This is so frustrating.

264
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,282
This can't keep happening, Leo.

265
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,701
We've had this conversation!

266
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,287
I can't help it,
I can't keep doing this.

267
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,040
You must keep up pretenses,
there's no other way.

268
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,667
There is another way.
I could tell her the truth.

269
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,793
Leo.

270
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:45,339
I know Piper. She doesn't want
to live like this any more than I do.

271
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,549
She hates hunting demons all the time.

272
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:51,762
She wants nothing but the best
for herself, her family, for all of us.

273
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,014
She can handle the truth,
I know she can.

274
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:57,976
But if she can't,
if she's not open to our way...

275
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:02,898
...it would risk everything we hope
to achieve, everything we covet.

276
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,859
And cause her to lose perspective
in the process.

277
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,861
Ignore what shouldn't be ignored.

278
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,863
Which would put her at risk as well.

279
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,741
There's too much at stake, Leo.

280
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,535
She can handle it.

281
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,002
He needs to see for himself.

282
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,462
But what of the risk?

283
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,673
It's no greater than that of him

284
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:31,718
tapping into the collective...
without intending to.

285
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:32,886
Very well.

286
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,390
But if anything goes wrong,
everything may be lost.

287
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,433
Our powers are not inexhaustible.

288
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,568
What is the matter?

289
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:51,446
I... I need to tell you something.

290
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,657
I'm listening.

291
00:17:56,285 --> 00:18:00,247
Well, the reason I know the demons
aren't working with the Avatars...

292
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,875
...is because I'm an Avatar.

293
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,835
What?

294
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,464
Oh my God!

295
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,555
Piper!

296
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,974
No! You stay away from me!

297
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,819
What happened?

298
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:32,237
- Let me help.
- Don't!

299
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:33,447
Piper, please!

300
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,991
Could someone please
tell us what happened?

301
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:39,661
The potion blew up and...
Leo's an Avatar.

302
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:42,372
- What?
- What?

303
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:46,335
Oh, you know, the gathering storm,
looming threat, that would be Leo.

304
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,712
We're trying to save the world
from itself.

305
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,923
Wait.

306
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,509
Did he just say we?
I think he just said we.

307
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:57,721
They said you had to come to it
on your own, I said you could handle it.

308
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,058
That you're what everybody's
afraid of? Even the Elders?

309
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,645
They're afraid because
they don't understand.

310
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:08,857
The Avatars are beyond good and evil,
everything we've been searching for.

311
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:17,407
- Okay, he's cracked.
- Absolutely.

312
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:21,245
I have never been more clear. Piper,
I beg you not to be closed to this.

313
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:24,665
It's everything we've been
searching for, I promise.

314
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,501
I think you need to take
the boys to Magic School.

315
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,212
- But...
- I need time to think about this.

316
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,090
Are you sure you can trust him?

317
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,385
I can trust my husband
with our children, now please go.

318
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,060
Do you think he's telling the truth?

319
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,605
It would be a really stupid lie
if he wasn't, don't you think?

320
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,067
Sorry.

321
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,902
It's okay.

322
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,446
What are you gonna do?

323
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,449
I don't know, but we have
a demon to vanquish first,

324
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,410
and an innocent to protect, so...

325
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:02,661
Yeah, but...

326
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:06,206
Just re-make the potion for me
and I'll go get cleaned up and...

327
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,125
...be careful of the beetle toe.

328
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:14,256
Okay, we have bigger things
to worry about than potions.

329
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,800
I agree. We have to save Leo.

330
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,887
Then we're gonna have
to ask for Kyle's help.

331
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:32,983
Now what?

332
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,152
- Put them on.
- Why?

333
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,613
We're going to attack
the Charmed Ones next.

334
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,157
Malvoc, that's suicide.

335
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,242
Only if we die.

336
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:46,747
But I only plan to fight long enough
for them to identify us... as Sokols.

337
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,416
Then our enemies
become their enemies.

338
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,253
They'll vanquish them. Others
will challenge us for the territory.

339
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:56,006
They won't be able to
after we kill the innocent.

340
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,259
Those ancient rules are etched in...

341
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:00,969
...brimstone.

342
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:06,016
After, they'll think the threat
to the innocent is passed.

343
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,851
And then return him.

344
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,106
We'll need more of these.

345
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,738
Something's happened, Leo.

346
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,532
I have to get back to Piper.

347
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,909
We've detected a power surge,
a time shift.

348
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,704
That could only mean one thing.
The Avatars are making their move.

349
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,331
How do you know it's them?

350
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:32,459
No demon has this kind of power,
not since the Source.

351
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:35,462
So, what do you want from me?

352
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:37,714
We want you to alert the Charmed Ones.

353
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,843
We expect that the Avatars
will come after them first.

354
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:44,721
What is it?

355
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:48,642
- I don't know how much we know.
- We know they're a threat.

356
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,686
- Because they have power?
- Yes.

357
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,147
The kind of power that in the wrong
hands could be a danger to us.

358
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:55,649
Okay, so are we a threat?

359
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,151
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:02,072
Elders, I mean we have a great power.
But we're only a threat to demons.

361
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,740
And your point is?

362
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:06,577
We don't know enough about them
to fear them.

363
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,954
How do we know
they're not benevolent?

364
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,206
I mean, who are we to judge them?

365
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,001
If they were,
they wouldn't lurk insidiously,

366
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:16,211
they would show themselves.

367
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:22,843
This is no time to lose your faith
in all that we're about, Leo,

368
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:26,096
despite all that's happened in the past.

369
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,515
We need you on our side.

370
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,577
Have you seen Phoebe and Paige?

371
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,954
Aren't they upstairs making potions?

372
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:53,749
No. How are the boys?

373
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,461
They're fine.
Miss Donovan's with 'em.

374
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,129
And the innocent?

375
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:02,257
Sleeping. Still under
the effects of the potions.

376
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:06,261
How are you?

377
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,680
- How am I?
- I mean with all this.

378
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:12,226
I don't know. I have questions.

379
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:15,521
Well, you can ask me.
I can answer them now.

380
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:20,567
What are they exactly?
Or should I say what are you exactly?

381
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,945
I'm the same man you married, Piper.

382
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:27,199
Someone who wants nothing
but the best for his family.

383
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:29,827
And the Avatars
are gonna give us that how?

384
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,579
By using their powers, our powers,

385
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:36,625
to change what has always been,
to re-make what is.

386
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,502
That sounds like a lot of crap.

387
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:40,337
I know it does, but it's not.

388
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,841
For all we know, they're like
everything else we're fighting.

389
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:47,553
They want to end everything we're
fighting against, once and for all.

390
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:48,804
That's impossible.

391
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,681
I know, I used to think it was too.

392
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,976
Now I know it's not. They want
to make the world better.

393
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,688
Those floating heads that
tormented you made your life better?

394
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:02,734
That was just a way to get my attention.

395
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:04,319
Make me open to a new idea.

396
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:05,612
Leo.

397
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:07,281
Piper, think about it.

398
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:10,075
A demon-free world.

399
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,786
It's everything we've
always dreamed about.

400
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,623
We should consider that after
everything we've been through?

401
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:43,066
It's just a graze.

402
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:08,425
They really want that innocent.
I just wish I knew why.

403
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,552
There'll be more of them.

404
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:14,056
Well, at least we have a way
to find 'em now.

405
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:16,517
I don't mean just them, Piper.
I mean demons.

406
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,353
They'll keep coming back,
like they always have,

407
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:23,732
unless we let the Avatars
stop 'em, forever.

408
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,822
Oh, Paige! I was...

409
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,699
Hey.

410
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:36,036
Okay. I'm sorry about breakfast.
I didn't handle it well.

411
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,374
And look,
I'm obsessed about the Avatars, I know.

412
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,125
That's not it, it's just...

413
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:45,587
It's not gonna happen again.
All right? I promise.

414
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,089
Leo's an Avatar!

415
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,050
He told us this morning.

416
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,553
What? How?

417
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:56,223
We don't know. He didn't say.
He dropped the bomb on us this morning.

418
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,976
We don't know exactly what it means.

419
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,272
Where are you going?

420
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,943
Parking sucks in this city.
How's he taking it?

421
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:18,412
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Darryl.

422
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,080
I'm stumped.

423
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:24,168
Maybe you could use hocus pocus to
find out what Brody did with Sheridan.

424
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:26,128
Okay, but now's not a good time.

425
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,255
So can I call you back in a little bit?

426
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:30,257
All right, bye.

427
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:36,263
- What are you looking for?
- This.

428
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,807
- Does he know where the others are?
- Who?

429
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:39,933
The other Avatars!

430
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:43,645
No, he didn't say. Why?

431
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:45,522
What is that?

432
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:48,150
That's a potion.

433
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,484
For what?

434
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,529
For killing Avatars.

435
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:02,664
Where is he?

436
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:06,293
- Kyle, would you stop please?
- We're not gonna let you kill Leo.

437
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,712
You don't understand.
He's an Avatar now.

438
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,839
No, he's actually our brother in law.

439
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:13,675
How can you be so sure
the potion's gonna work?

440
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,511
They killed my parents over it.

441
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:18,472
One potion. You cannot
get even with them all.

442
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:21,517
The hell I can't. Their powers
are all tied together.

443
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,144
You kill one of them,
it weakens them all.

444
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:27,189
This is ridiculous!
Leo did not kill your parents!

445
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:28,649
If he's one, he did.

446
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,692
He just became one of them.

447
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:33,111
We didn't come to you
so you could kill Leo.

448
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,322
We came to you
to help us get rid of them.

449
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,116
This is the only way
to get rid of them.

450
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,745
When my parents uncovered this,
they didn't discover a potion,

451
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:46,375
they discovered a battle that happened
5000 years ago over our future.

452
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,545
They fought the Avatars then
and we gotta fight 'em now.

453
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:55,676
What happened in here?

454
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,679
- Piper!
- Upstairs!

455
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,639
At least we know she's okay.

456
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:04,685
Looks like the demons didn't wait for
us to go after them, they came first.

457
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:07,020
How do you know
the Avatars didn't do it?

458
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:10,732
He'll kill you first, you won't
get that bottle out of your hand.

459
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:12,192
We'll see.

460
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:14,278
I get that this is about your parents.

461
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,864
Yes, it is about my parents.
No, you don't get it.

462
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:20,117
The hell I don't.
My parents were killed too, remember?

463
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,369
Paige, my parents were murdered.

464
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:25,455
Look, Leo is not the bad guy here.

465
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:28,959
For all we know, he was brainwashed
or possessed or something.

466
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,044
Just... please.

467
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:33,297
Give us a minute, just wait down here.

468
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,718
Please?

469
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,928
Just don't let him go, all right?

470
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:44,224
I spent 20 years looking for the
Avatars, I'm not about to lose 'em now.

471
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:52,232
Piper, what happened?
Are you okay?

472
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:53,775
No thanks to you.

473
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:55,569
What is that supposed to mean?

474
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,447
It would have been nice
to have a vanquishing potion

475
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:02,534
when we were ambushed, a potion that
you were supposed to make, by the way.

476
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:04,912
- Oops.
- Yeah, oops. Where the hell were you?

477
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,455
I was at Kyle's.

478
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:09,333
- What were you doing there?
- Trying to save you.

479
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,753
Trying to save me? I don't need saving,
I know what I'm doing.

480
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:15,297
Kyle's parents were killed
by the Avatars?

481
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,841
It goes against everything
they believe in.

482
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:22,012
You have to come up with a better
argument than that if you go downstairs.

483
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,347
Why is that?

484
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,723
He's downstairs?

485
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:27,267
- Why is he downstairs?
- You don't wanna know.

486
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,771
He thinks you're a threat, Leo,
to all of us.

487
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:32,856
- Well, he's wrong.
- How do you know?

488
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,026
Because! Look, I know
this is a shock to everyone,

489
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:40,155
but he didn't have to tell us the truth,
he wouldn't have if it was a bad thing.

490
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:44,785
Piper, everything points to them
being bad. Even the Elders think so.

491
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,662
Because they don't understand.

492
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:49,122
We're just supposed
to take your word for it?

493
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:51,708
How do we know
you're not possessed right now?

494
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:52,960
Come on.

495
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:55,170
No, Leo, I'm serious!
How do we know?

496
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:57,965
They haven't threatened
anything we believe in.

497
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:00,175
It's all good.

498
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,886
We at least need to think about it.

499
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,348
Since when did you jump
on his Avatar train?

500
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,809
When I started thinking
about my kids,

501
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:11,979
fighting battles we've
been fighting our entire lives.

502
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:14,147
That's what we were born to do.

503
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:16,483
That does not mean
we have to die doing it.

504
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:19,403
You should talk to Kyle,
hear his side of the story.

505
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:22,573
I don't need to,
I need to vanquish demons again!

506
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,745
Now what?

507
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:34,418
How is it you're the only one
who still lives?

508
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:38,589
I wasn't with them. I swear!
I don't know what happened to them!

509
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:48,557
Something is not right!

510
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,603
Why would Malvoc attack only
to retreat? How would that help him?

511
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:54,730
Lose something?

512
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:08,785
What was that?

513
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:11,246
All part of the package.

514
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,957
That was a lot of power.

515
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,293
Yeah, but it's used wisely.

516
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:22,216
See, the Avatars could destroy us
or force us to change. But they don't.

517
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:24,843
Isn't that enough reason to trust them?

518
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:31,141
How could you let him go?
How could you let the Avatar go?

519
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:35,437
Okay, he's still Leo. So would you stop
referring to him as the Avatar, please?

520
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:38,732
We gotta fix this and we gotta
fix it fast. Now where did he go?

521
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,692
He orbed out with Piper.

522
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:43,403
How do you know
he didn't go to alert the others?

523
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:45,155
- He didn't.
- How do you know?

524
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:48,492
How can you be so sure?
I cannot believe you let him get away!

525
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:52,955
Something is wrong,
he's not acting like himself.

526
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,333
Orb that potion away from him
before he does something stupid.

527
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,837
- What if he flipped out?
- I think he already has flipped out...

528
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:05,634
What did you do?

529
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:10,681
It's just a tranq. She'll be fine.

530
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,307
What are you doing?

531
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:15,352
I'm killing an Avatar.

532
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,855
And nobody's gonna stop me.

533
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:27,739
He should wake up
in a couple of minutes.

534
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:29,324
Thanks, Piper.

535
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:30,450
For?

536
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:32,161
For believing in me.

537
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,999
I always have.
I always will, it's the only way.

538
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,125
I know.

539
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:49,178
Thanks for helping.

540
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:52,139
What happened?
We vanquished them.

541
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:53,765
- No, we didn't.
- Yeah, we did.

542
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:56,894
We vanquished the wrong ones,
he had different markings.

543
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:58,020
What do you mean?

544
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:00,647
We were tricked.

545
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:03,650
We wouldn't have been
if Paige and Phoebe

546
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:06,820
weren't off chasing Avatars
instead of helping me!

547
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:14,578
Paige!

548
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:16,246
She's fine.

549
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:20,751
You and I are gonna have a little chat.

550
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:29,885
All right, let's just take a deep breath
here, we can talk this out.

551
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:31,011
Leo.

552
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,931
I don't want to hurt her
but I will if I have to.

553
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:37,601
Your kind is responsible
for a nightmare that won't go away.

554
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,604
For all those nights,
waking up in a sweat,

555
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,273
begging that the flashbacks
were just a dream.

556
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:44,566
Kyle, please.

557
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,276
It's not a dream though, is it?

558
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,114
You Avatars are as real as the air that
we breathe and just as vacant!

559
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:53,242
My parents were murdered by them.

560
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:56,912
So if I were you Leo,
I'd do what I say.

561
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:59,581
The Avatars couldn't
have killed your parents.

562
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:01,542
They believe in peace.

563
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,670
I'll give you three seconds
to summon one of your buddies,

564
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,213
so I can kill him.

565
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:08,465
If you don't, I'm gonna kill you.

566
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,301
- I can't do that.
- One...

567
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,387
- Avatars aren't the enemy.
- Two...

568
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,638
- Leo.
- Three!

569
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:15,973
No!

570
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,952
Oh! Leo?

571
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:40,455
Piper, it wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

572
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,792
No, it's okay. It's okay.

573
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:47,754
Oh, God! Not now! Please!

574
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:57,931
Leo, Leo, come on!

575
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,820
How did this happen?

576
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:14,031
The potion is real, Leo.

577
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,453
It kills Avatars.

578
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:24,208
The collective weakens
with every last breath you take.

579
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:30,464
We told you, the truth must come
to them in their own time, not yours.

580
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:31,798
But Piper, she...

581
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:34,134
Understood, yes.

582
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:37,971
But the others were not able to.

583
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,558
And so we became the enemy,

584
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:44,603
out of fear, and ignorance.

585
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:47,356
And an innocent was lost because of it.

586
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:48,941
Everything was lost.

587
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,401
I was trying to make things right
with Piper.

588
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:53,111
Of course.

589
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:56,824
But you've learned
and now you can save yourself.

590
00:35:56,907 --> 00:36:01,829
You have it in you to rewind time
to just before you told Piper the truth.

591
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:03,247
If you hurry.

592
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,998
If we all hurry.

593
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:26,979
It worked.

594
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:29,106
Yes.

595
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,149
But at a price.

596
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:36,071
All that's happened has
taken a great toll on our power.

597
00:36:36,155 --> 00:36:39,783
As it is, we may not have
enough to implement our plan.

598
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:44,705
To rid the world of demons, to end
the duality requires all that we had.

599
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:47,749
Won't the sister's powers
add to the collective?

600
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:51,837
Yes. But it may not be enough.

601
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,548
You must not try this ever again, Leo.

602
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:57,593
You can never tell Piper about us.

603
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:00,304
Not until she's truly ready.

604
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,938
Leo, this is not
the time or place, okay?

605
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:13,066
I don't want to get into this now.
This is a little dicey.

606
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,611
- Okay.
- Thank you.

607
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:17,779
You're distracted.

608
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:20,282
Please, don't tell me how to demon hunt.

609
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:25,162
I'm not. I didn't mean to. But just
focus on getting the demons.

610
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,207
Not too much beetle toe.

611
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,459
- You don't want to blow up the place.
- No.

612
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:33,086
Why are you being so nice
all of a sudden?

613
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:35,589
I don't know.

614
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:39,593
I guess I just realise
I can't force things on you.

615
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:43,096
If you're gonna trust me, you're
gonna come to it in your own time.

616
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:46,475
There may be hope for you yet.

617
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:51,939
Bottle up the potions, I think I know
where the demons are gonna attack next.

618
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:00,948
Now!

619
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:05,536
That was easy.

620
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:07,204
Wait.

621
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:14,711
Hi.

622
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:22,219
All right, now all we have to do
is get rid of the other gang

623
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:24,680
and we can bring the innocent back.

624
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:27,516
All right, I give up.
How did you figure all this out?

625
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,394
You don't want to know.
Believe me.

626
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:55,794
What?

627
00:38:57,713 --> 00:38:59,131
Nothing.

628
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:03,510
Just glad you gave me
another shot, that's all.

629
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:05,846
You didn't think I would?

630
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:09,224
Well, I didn't hear from you
after I botched breakfast.

631
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:13,312
Well, breakfast isn't
really a date anyway, right?

632
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:15,564
A dinner, much better.

633
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:16,899
And dessert?

634
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:20,736
Dessert too. Dessert is good.

635
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:23,822
Now Agent Brody,
you are a damn fine cook.

636
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:26,200
Any other secrets
I should know about you?

637
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:30,078
Other than my crazed obsession
with Avatars...

638
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:32,414
Nah, you're not so crazed.

639
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:35,667
No? Wait till I meet one.

640
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:41,215
Forget that.

641
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:43,133
Let's... rewind,

642
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:47,804
and you can ask me
the secrets question again, okay?

643
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:49,640
Do you...

644
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:53,685
...Kyle Brody, have any secrets?

645
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:58,607
No.

646
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:31,306
Are they asleep?

647
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,851
Yeah. Finally.

648
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:35,519
Piper?

649
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:40,524
I know you think there's something
I haven't been telling you.

650
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:42,151
Leo, not now.

651
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:43,861
Just hear me out.

652
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:49,032
There is something I'm not telling you
but not because I don't want to.

653
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:50,701
It's because I can't.

654
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:54,788
What do you mean you can't?
The Elders won't let you?

655
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:57,082
Oh, I can't even tell you that.

656
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:02,796
I can tell you
you're gonna find out soon.

657
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,050
- And you're gonna be okay with it.
- Oh yeah? How do you know?

658
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,845
I know you.
