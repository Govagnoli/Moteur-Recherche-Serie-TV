1
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:07,082
Okay, turn left up here.

2
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:09,558
And can you step on the gas a little?

3
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:16,043
Off the gas. Off the gas.

4
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:17,483
Does somebody else
wanna drive here?

5
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:19,560
Phoebe, the demon is not
waiting around for us

6
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:20,923
to come and vanquish him.

7
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:23,239
We don't even know if we have
the power to vanquish him.

8
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:25,047
Scrying for random evil
tells us nothing.

9
00:00:25,209 --> 00:00:26,483
It tells us where the demons are,

10
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:28,446
and since we vanquished
two already this week,

11
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:30,281
- I'd say it's working pretty well.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,007
Thanks to Cole
for saving our butts.

13
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:35,680
Two witches and a half a demon
does not the power of three make.

14
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:37,123
So, what are we supposed to do?

15
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:39,166
Sit around and wait for them
to pick us all off?

16
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,604
If we weren't going after them,
they'd be coming after us.

17
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:43,248
They're coming after you
anyway, Piper.

18
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:45,969
- The Source is coming after you.
- And we won't be ready for him

19
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,484
because instead of teaching Paige
how to be a witch,

20
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:53,325
we are out hunting for every Tom,
Dick and Beelzebub in San Francisco.

21
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:54,962
Speaking of,
do we have a plan, or--?

22
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:56,687
- The plan is vanquish the demon.
- Great.

23
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,646
Have you mastered your powers,
or are you still freezing

24
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,003
- and exploding at random?
- Random.

25
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:02,444
But you know what they say,
there's nothing like field practice.

26
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:03,724
Turn here.

27
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:14,246
Stop.

28
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:19,329
Hey. Big, scary demon.

29
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:26,601
He's gonna blow.

30
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:36,041
Next?

31
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:59,799
"Throughout history,
witches have been misunderstood,

32
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:01,368
persecuted and destroyed.

33
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,759
The public hanging, drowning
and burning of women

34
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:06,124
suspected of witchcraft
is a far more recent chapter

35
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:07,881
of our history
than most people realize. "

36
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:09,198
Paige.

37
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,888
Yeah?

38
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:15,166
What's the hold-up
on the O' Brien application?

39
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:19,081
Well, at the moment, the only hold-up
is my boss, who's standing over me,

40
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,558
distracting me from my work.

41
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,718
Nice teeth.

42
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:25,527
Have it on my desk by noon.

43
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:29,123
Lila.

44
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:30,802
What's the O'Brien application?

45
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:33,921
Adam O'Brien? The foster kid we're
trying to get into the boarding school?

46
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:36,088
Oh, my God.

47
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,598
The scholarship application
is due, like, today.

48
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,646
I'm so lame.

49
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,799
Oh, Billy, I thought I told you to throw
anything from creditors in the trash.

50
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:49,600
Hi, pizza-face.

51
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:53,518
Look, I understand how difficult
it is to tear yourself away

52
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:55,168
from the cleavage in this section,

53
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,805
but I'm gonna need my mail
sometime today, okay?

54
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:00,163
No problem.

55
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:02,363
Go, go.

56
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:09,527
Nice rug.

57
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,242
What the hell?

58
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:18,321
Look at him.
What happened to his hair?

59
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:20,919
I didn't know he was bald!

60
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:28,682
Oh, I know that you're happy
that we got him, Piper,

61
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:31,522
but is it entirely necessary
to disfigure the Book?

62
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:34,726
This one could incinerate
human flesh with his eyes.

63
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:36,800
That must sting.

64
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,681
You think that's funny?

65
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:43,243
You could've gotten yourself killed.
Do you understand that?

66
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,400
Yes, Cole, I understand "killed"
very well.

67
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:47,958
Then why would you wanna keep
risking your life and Phoebe's?

68
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:49,244
Not to mention mine.

69
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:51,161
There's a legion
of bounty hunters on my ass.

70
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:54,321
I'm supposed to be laying low, but
instead I'm out protecting you guys.

71
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,407
You know what, Cole?
Next time you can stay home.

72
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:00,767
If you insist on taking these suicide
missions, you force me to be there,

73
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:03,727
because there's no way in hell I'm
gonna let Phoebe lose another sister.

74
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:06,244
Why don't you go see
who's at the door for us, okay?

75
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:07,728
Sure.

76
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,926
If it's The Source,
I'll just ask him to come back later.

77
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:12,886
We need to talk.

78
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:20,562
Piper, Cole's right. We have
a system for fighting demons,

79
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:22,560
and it's worked pretty well
the last three years.

80
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:27,519
I think Prue being killed counts
as a pretty big glitch in the system.

81
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:30,044
I know that you're angry.
I am angry too.

82
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,642
Then why are you fighting me
on this?

83
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:34,243
What's--? What is the problem
with getting a little proactive?

84
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,243
Because we're not ready
to get proactive.

85
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:38,922
That's what's wrong with it.

86
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,886
We're barely ready for anything
right now.

87
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:44,684
Just dealing with our everyday
normal lives is hard enough.

88
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:46,248
That is precisely the point.

89
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:47,842
The faster we get rid
of these demons,

90
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,159
the faster we can get back
to our everyday normal lives,

91
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:51,603
or at least what is left of them.

92
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:53,678
Knock-knock.

93
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,168
I--

94
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:59,837
I'm sorry to just drop by
without calling.

95
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:02,520
It's okay, don't worry about it.

96
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:06,602
I don't know exactly why I'm here.
I'm just kind of having a hard time

97
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:08,919
being surrounded by people, and--

98
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:11,922
And not be able to tell them that you
can move things with your mind?

99
00:06:13,049 --> 00:06:16,086
It does not exactly
roll off the tongue.

100
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:18,519
Yeah. Well, being a witch
is tough on friendships.

101
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:20,725
That's why the whole sister thing
comes in so handy.

102
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,481
What are you doing?

103
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:27,322
It's a little chatty up here, so I'm
gonna go scry for evil in my room.

104
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,487
Scry?

105
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:30,798
Yeah.

106
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,168
Phoebe will explain.

107
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,967
I'll see you later.

108
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:42,161
It's kind of like
a supernatural LoJack.

109
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:45,239
Well, why don't you just use
that big book?

110
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:48,446
I mean, it is a book of spells, right?

111
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:50,208
Oh, it's a lot more than that.

112
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,728
It's kind of hard to explain.

113
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:55,922
It looks so old.

114
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,962
Yeah. It has survived a lot.

115
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,924
Fortunately, it protects
itself from evil.

116
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:04,126
It protects itself? How?

117
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:05,718
Magic.

118
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:09,323
May l?

119
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,278
Yeah. Technically, it's yours too.

120
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:16,007
I would walk you through it
right now,

121
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,887
but I have to go talk to Cole.

122
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,440
Well, maybe I can just
take it back to my office.

123
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,605
Oh, no, no. No.

124
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:24,122
It doesn't leave the house.

125
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:26,127
But just feel free
to thumb through it.

126
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:28,405
And then I'll be back
in a few minutes.

127
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:40,038
This could solve a lot of problems.

128
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,681
- What? What is it? What's wrong?
- You've got to talk to your wife.

129
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:54,965
Okay, Cole. Remember what I said
about being gentle?

130
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:57,880
- What about my wife?
- She's out of control.

131
00:07:58,169 --> 00:07:59,363
Cole.

132
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:00,843
What?

133
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:03,205
It's just we're very worried
about her.

134
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:04,878
What happened?

135
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,243
She's very, very angry.

136
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:08,360
Well, of course she's angry.
She's grieving.

137
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,121
Right. And if she were
punching walls,

138
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,722
I would happily call a repairman.

139
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,766
The problem is she prefers
to punch demons.

140
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:18,328
- Well, I'll talk to her.
- She has no regard for her own life.

141
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:20,719
Or anyone else's.
She's Charles Bronson, cubed.

142
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:22,726
I said I'd talk to her.

143
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,000
Guys. Guys.

144
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:27,528
Who is Charles Bronson?

145
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:32,728
Never mind. We--

146
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:34,686
Can we please just have
a minute alone?

147
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,001
- Sure.
- Thank you.

148
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:45,321
It's not just that she's violent, Leo,
she's acting nothing like herself.

149
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:49,164
She's completely
dismissive of Paige, and...

150
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:51,928
I don't know what to do anymore.

151
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:54,247
Strange, isn't it?

152
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,560
Now on top of everything else,
you have to play the middle sister.

153
00:08:57,729 --> 00:08:59,799
When you've always been the...

154
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:01,920
Screwup?

155
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:03,761
The youngest.

156
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,239
Yeah, I look at Paige and Piper,

157
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,240
and it makes me think back
to all those times

158
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:11,367
that Piper had to play mediator
between me and Prue.

159
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:13,528
Not a lot of fun, huh?

160
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:16,006
It's not a job I would've asked for.

161
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:20,845
And I'm not sure it's a job
I'm gonna be any good at, but...

162
00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:24,640
I just-- I don't have time
to really worry about it right now.

163
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:27,486
I'll talk to her.

164
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:30,041
Thanks, Leo.

165
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:33,646
Not to rush this tender moment,
but she's already started scrying.

166
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:40,448
I didn't mean
you couldn't use the stairs.

167
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:00,009
Okay, book. Protect yourself.

168
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,123
Paige? I'll be right up.

169
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:15,680
- Where's the fire?
- Oh, you know, work.

170
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,487
Lunch break's over. Gotta go.

171
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,207
But we didn't even get to talk.

172
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,246
Oh, yeah. It's all right. Don't worry.

173
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:22,728
Will you come by later?

174
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,641
Sure. Yeah, absolutely.

175
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:26,322
Bye.

176
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:29,968
Bye.

177
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:35,244
Look, honey...

178
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:37,879
...it isn't just that it's dangerous.

179
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:41,007
Leo, whitelighters are supposed
to guide, not judge.

180
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:43,239
Just because I'm doing things
a little bit differently

181
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,842
doesn't mean
that there is a problem.

182
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,488
Piper, I'm your husband...

183
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:47,877
...not just your whitelighter.

184
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:50,438
And when you speak to me like that,
there is a problem.

185
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,357
I can't help you
unless you talk to me.

186
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,168
It hurts to talk, Leo.

187
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:59,559
It hurts to breathe.

188
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:03,525
So unless you have some idea
of how to bring Prue back,

189
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:05,520
I don't wanna talk right now.

190
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:09,641
Is that what you don't wanna say?

191
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:12,277
Is that you still blame me
for not being able to bring her back?

192
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:15,009
No, Leo. I don't blame you.

193
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:16,363
I blame evil.

194
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:19,089
Why--? Why do you think
I am doing all of this?

195
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:20,648
- For kicks?
- Honestly?

196
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:22,487
I think you're doing it
because it's easier

197
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,083
than confronting
what you're really feeling.

198
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:32,757
- Demon.
- What?

199
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:34,163
I have work to do.

200
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:38,769
Cole, Phoebe, let's go.

201
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,799
Nothing like a copy room
with a view.

202
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:55,767
Hey, Clearasil.

203
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:57,601
What's popping?

204
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:04,163
Don't worry about him, Billy.
He's a jerk to everybody.

205
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:05,682
Yeah, I know.

206
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:07,680
That's why his mail gets lost.

207
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:09,487
Frequently.

208
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:13,357
Hey, is there something wrong
with this copier?

209
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,281
The copier? I don't think so.

210
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:17,041
I just ran off a whole bunch.

211
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:18,967
Everything keeps coming up blank.

212
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,089
Are you trying to copy a book?

213
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:24,325
No. It's nothing. It's cool.

214
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:27,925
Well, if you need me to do it for you,
just say the word.

215
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:29,687
Thanks. You're sweet.

216
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:47,042
Let the object of objection
Become but a dream

217
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,928
As I cause the seen
To be unseen

218
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:54,962
- You okay, Billy?
- Yeah.

219
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:58,201
I just-- I got a little head rush.

220
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:05,526
Oh, my God. It worked.

221
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:11,325
Oh, my God.

222
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:16,162
Paige? Is everything okay?

223
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,959
It will be from now on.

224
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:28,003
Piper, Cole and I do not
support you in this.

225
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:30,319
If you insist on doing it,
you're going in alone.

226
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:32,008
Okay, I'll see you at home.

227
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:33,363
I told you that wouldn't work.

228
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:35,087
- It was worth a shot.
- Wait a minute.

229
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,080
Do you smell smoke?

230
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:39,563
It's in there.

231
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:45,726
Stop. Stop. No--

232
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:53,564
Get back, I'll blow it up.

233
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:54,878
Go on.

234
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:01,367
- Piper?
- Yeah, yeah.

235
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:02,803
Crap.

236
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:05,327
Okay.

237
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:12,121
Piper.

238
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:14,041
- What?
- Cole.

239
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:24,762
Piper, let them go.

240
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,839
They're-- They're immune
to my powers.

241
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:39,847
Unfortunately, Cole isn't.

242
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,442
- Piper, unfreeze him.
- What if I blow him up?

243
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:00,167
Cole.

244
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:20,079
I'm gonna take out those
chain-smoking bitches

245
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:22,126
if it's the last thing I do.

246
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,961
It might be the last thing you do.

247
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:26,848
That's very supportive, Cole.
Whose side are you on?

248
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,442
At the moment,
I'm on Phoebe's side.

249
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,881
Well, the last time I checked,
Phoebe was still my sister,

250
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,528
which technically puts her
on my side.

251
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:35,407
- Why are we arguing?
- We're not arguing.

252
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:37,685
We're discussing, Piper.
You are arguing.

253
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:39,805
- And look, you're already hurt.
- I'm fine.

254
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:42,358
- You can't stop coughing.
- And your control over your powers

255
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,008
seems to be getting worse,
not better.

256
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:46,205
Well, our powers
are tied to our emotions,

257
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:48,929
so it makes sense that they
would be a little off right now.

258
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:52,286
All the more reason to lay low.
These demons are dangerous.

259
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:54,838
All the more reason
to vanquish them, okay?

260
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:56,761
That is what we do. Eliminate evil.

261
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:59,238
Regardless of the consequences.
Now you sound like Prue.

262
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:03,159
Okay, Cole, I'm going to vanquish
the cancer girls

263
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:04,643
with or without your help.

264
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:07,004
So either tell me what you know,
or get out of the way.

265
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,806
They're called Furies.

266
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:16,002
- Like from mythology?
- The dog-faced women from hell?

267
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:18,603
They're modern knockoffs.
Their m.o. is the same, though.

268
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,487
- They punish evildoers?
- Exactly.

269
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:21,968
Wait. Wouldn't that
make them good?

270
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:23,602
Well, these Furies
have no temperance.

271
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:25,760
They'll go after a shoplifter
as soon as a murderer,

272
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:27,567
and they take
great pleasure in the kill.

273
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:30,608
Great. Then we'll take
great pleasure in the vanquish.

274
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,520
What aren't you telling us?

275
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:42,925
So they go after evildoers.
Have they attacked you before?

276
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:47,368
When they focus
their thoughts on you,

277
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:50,999
they force you to hear the cries
of all your former victims.

278
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:53,478
You're not the demon
who did those things anymore.

279
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:06,604
Evil got the Book of Shadows.

280
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:08,202
How did evil
get the Book of Shadows?

281
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:10,166
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no, Phoebe?

282
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,728
A demon has
the Book of Shadows.

283
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:13,288
"Oh, no" doesn't quite cover it.

284
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:15,719
- Let me go see what I can find out.
- No, wait.

285
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:17,322
Piper?

286
00:17:17,489 --> 00:17:19,081
Promise me you're not
gonna overreact.

287
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:21,201
Is that even possible?

288
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:24,561
I think that maybe...

289
00:17:24,729 --> 00:17:28,927
Well, it might--
Might be feasible that...

290
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:32,559
...Paige borrowed the Book.

291
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,164
What? Why--? Why--?

292
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:38,047
Why would you think that?

293
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:40,643
See, now, this is what I meant
about overreacting.

294
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:42,362
- It's just that l--
- You let Paige

295
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,121
take the Book of Shadows
out of the manor?

296
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:47,679
Well, no, I did not let her.
It's just, she left pretty quick...

297
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:53,247
-...and it looks like she might have--
- Out of the window?

298
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:54,922
- Piper, I am--
- Phoebe, why would you

299
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:56,647
even leave her alone with it?

300
00:17:57,329 --> 00:17:58,762
Well, because she's our sister.

301
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,517
Not for long.

302
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:14,727
- Are you coming?
- To vanquish your sister?

303
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:16,447
I think I'll sit this one out.

304
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:24,958
It's unbelievable.

305
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:26,926
Maybe it was the light
from the copy machine.

306
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:28,522
God, this day is amazing.

307
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:30,884
- I mean, you went and got cute.
- You think?

308
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,280
Totally. And then my car loan comes
through, like, out of nowhere.

309
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:36,201
My credit is worse than Paige's.

310
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:39,486
- You know, I still can't believe all this.
- This is amazing.

311
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:42,641
Sir, I am taking full responsibility
for being late with the application.

312
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:44,765
I'm simply asking
for a deadline extension.

313
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:46,282
Well, I can't give you a deadline--

314
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:48,440
Well, I'm asking that you
not punish Adam O'Brien,

315
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,679
who's already had
a tough enough life, for my mistake.

316
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:52,646
Someone has to straighten
this thing out.

317
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:53,958
Sir, all I'm saying is--

318
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:58,281
These words will travel
Through the minds

319
00:18:58,449 --> 00:18:59,768
Of stubborn parties and unbind

320
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:03,245
The thoughts too rigid to be kind
A compromise they'll disentwine

321
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:05,762
How does 6;00 on Friday sound?

322
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:07,965
Six o'clock Friday is perfect.

323
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:10,120
Thank you so much.

324
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:12,685
- Victory.
- You got the extension?

325
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:15,079
- Yeah.
- Unbelievable.

326
00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:17,285
You're into all that
witchy stuff, right?

327
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:19,408
- Excuse me?
- Well, I'm just thinking

328
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:21,400
that there must be something
in the stars today.

329
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:23,804
I mean, Billy's face,
my car, now this.

330
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:25,965
Is there a full moon or something?

331
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:28,283
I don't know, but whatever it is,

332
00:19:28,449 --> 00:19:31,088
I'm gonna call my student-loan sharks
and take full advantage of it.

333
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:33,525
Oh, good. Me too.

334
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:39,443
You know, Paige, as a lawyer,

335
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:43,602
I could get those nasty creditors
off your back so easily.

336
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:45,805
And if you can't afford to pay me,

337
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:48,847
I could always
just take it out in trade.

338
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:51,159
Or I could just sue your ass
for sexual harassment.

339
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:54,366
And pay you with my big fat
punitive settlement.

340
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,361
The way you dress?

341
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,724
The judge would admire
my restraint.

342
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,325
That's it.

343
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:08,805
Perfect. I'll just change "demon"
to "dirtbag."

344
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:12,647
I don't understand
how someone can be that stupid.

345
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,765
I don't understand why
you haven't stopped ranting

346
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:16,123
since we left the house.

347
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:18,280
You're right. You're right. I'm sorry.

348
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:20,804
- Yes, Paige made a mistake.
- A mistake?

349
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,278
- She stole from us.
- She borrowed. Borrowed.

350
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:27,681
She-- She threw our family heritage
out of the window.

351
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:31,728
Well, that's because we never took
the time to explain its significance.

352
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:33,117
It was just a book to her.

353
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:34,881
Okay, Phoebe, it is not just a book.

354
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:38,837
It's like-- It is like part of our family.

355
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:43,083
Paige is not a killer.
She didn't kill anyone.

356
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:45,444
And she's not a demon
that we're on our way to vanquish.

357
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:46,803
- I get that, Phoebe.
- Do you?

358
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:48,687
Because I don't think that you do.

359
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,043
- You all right--?
- Hey.

360
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,200
Get away from me. Hey.

361
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:56,159
- What the hell is going on?
- This is not funny.

362
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:59,321
Oh, Donnie. Give mama some sugar.

363
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:03,323
Who's the man? You are.

364
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,289
You are so...

365
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:10,766
...busted?

366
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:12,683
Hello.

367
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:14,965
You stole our sacred book

368
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:17,882
so you could perform magical
plastic surgery on yourself?

369
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:19,323
You think I did this on purpose?

370
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:21,798
My body was perfectly fine
just as it was, thank you.

371
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:24,483
I mean it. Get away from me!

372
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:30,166
Piper, you could've just blown up
a dozen innocent people.

373
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:32,797
- I took a chance.
- See? Are you listening to yourself?

374
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:36,200
- What happened?
- I don't know. They just grew.

375
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,918
Oh, right. And you had
nothing to do with that.

376
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:40,847
Did you cast any spells?

377
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:43,801
One.

378
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:46,362
- Five.
- Five?

379
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:50,442
Okay, what did you do just before
you turned into Betty Boop?

380
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:54,001
Well, I cast a spell on the slimeball
I work with

381
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:56,444
so I could give him a taste
of his own medicine.

382
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,526
That the slimeball?

383
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:03,162
And that's the backfire.

384
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:05,687
- Backfire?
- You misused magic

385
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:07,567
to make him the object of ogling,

386
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:10,038
and the spell backfired
and did the same thing to you.

387
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:12,319
Which you would've learned
if you had bothered to ask,

388
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:14,002
but now, instead
of vanquishing demons,

389
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,201
we're gonna have to spend
the afternoon fixing your mess.

390
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:22,321
Okay, Piper, call Leo and get him
to orb this slimeball back home.

391
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:25,646
We have to protect him until we can
figure out a way to reverse the spell.

392
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:28,443
Paige and I will grab the Book
and meet you there.

393
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,004
Are my boobs gonna stay
this way forever?

394
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:42,406
Not if I can ever find the spell.

395
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,162
What about Piper?

396
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,887
She gonna stay mad at me forever?

397
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:49,287
No. It's just...

398
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:51,565
...she hasn't really
been herself lately.

399
00:22:51,729 --> 00:22:54,402
You know, a lot of ups and downs...

400
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:57,242
...since Prue...
You know? Like us all.

401
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,684
The last thing I wanted to do
was add to your guys' stress.

402
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:02,568
I just wanted to get back at Donnie.

403
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:05,329
Yeah, and I understand
the temptation, Paige. I really do.

404
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:07,684
But I told you, the Book
does not leave the house.

405
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:09,800
Right. Sorry.

406
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:13,365
My boobs are in the way.

407
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:15,605
Can you put it into third for me?

408
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,283
All right. Ready? Here we go.

409
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:20,722
All right.

410
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:22,238
Did you find the spell yet?

411
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:25,646
No, but I found the demons.

412
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,328
- Oh, my God.
- What?

413
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,049
You can't say "demons" followed
by "Oh, my God." I'm new at this,

414
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,677
- I'm likely to panic.
- Okay.

415
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:34,807
Fury smoke kills bad guys, right?

416
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:39,087
But in good people, it looks
for a portal of unexpressed fury.

417
00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:42,207
- And?
- It builds until it consumes

418
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:45,486
your humanity,
and it turns you into a Fury.

419
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:47,446
We fought the Furies today.

420
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,122
Piper got smoked.

421
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,397
Wait. Are you saying
that Piper is turning into a demon?

422
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:54,641
It wouldn't be the first time.

423
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:57,798
Step on it and hit the clutch.
I'm going into fourth. Ready?

424
00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:59,806
On three. One, two, three.

425
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,127
Easy, Piper.

426
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:06,847
What, are you protecting him now?

427
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:08,528
What the hell's going on?

428
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:10,680
And what's with the chicks?
They've gone crazy.

429
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:14,239
This chick just saved your ass,
you snivelling ingrate.

430
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:18,563
- Do you see what I mean?
- Who said you could get up?

431
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:23,685
- What's the matter with you?
- Oh, my God.

432
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:25,726
Okay, honey, look.
I don't know what's going on,

433
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:27,208
but we really need to talk.

434
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,880
Leo, you know what?

435
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:31,528
I'm sick of talking.

436
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:38,121
Now we really need to talk.

437
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:42,208
Piper, you do not use your powers
on a mortal, do you hear me?

438
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:44,957
Back away slowly, Leo.

439
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:47,768
What?

440
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:50,439
She's becoming a Fury.

441
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:53,968
There's no reasoning with her now.

442
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:58,644
Piper, you're a good witch.
Do you hear me? Fight this.

443
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:08,288
Oh, God, help.

444
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:12,001
No!

445
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:17,448
Cole.

446
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:19,888
I-- Well...

447
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:23,889
That wasn't very nice.

448
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,087
Cole hit her with an energy ball.

449
00:25:36,249 --> 00:25:37,682
Leo, it was low voltage.

450
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:39,885
Would you prefer
he'd let her kill an innocent?

451
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:42,517
I'd prefer that he wouldn't use
his demonic powers on my wife.

452
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:44,845
I can't believe that you let him
go look for her.

453
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:48,166
This is all my fault. I shouldn't have
stolen the Book of Shadows.

454
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:49,808
- You stole the Book of Shadows?
- Leo.

455
00:25:49,969 --> 00:25:52,039
Leo, concentrate, please.

456
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:53,643
I just hope he finds her fast,

457
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:56,403
because if this is anything
like the time I turned into a banshee,

458
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:59,129
- she's gonna be hungry for a kill.
- I'm sorry. A banshee?

459
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:02,167
Yeah, a demonic screamer.
Kind of trampy, feeds on pain.

460
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:04,839
I think I need to sit down.

461
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:15,038
- Paige.
- What?

462
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:17,120
You only said I couldn't use magic
to punish him.

463
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:18,483
Okay, Leo.

464
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:20,685
You orb Donnie back to his office.

465
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:23,682
Heal him there, then make sure he
doesn't narc us out for being witches.

466
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,805
- How?
- I don't know. Be creative.

467
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:27,237
What about Piper?

468
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:30,122
You have to do your job,
and let us do ours.

469
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,119
We'll get your wife back.
I promise.

470
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:45,282
I hate to ask, but how are we
going to get his wife back?

471
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:47,838
I mean, she's kind of
a full-on demon.

472
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:50,443
No, she's not full-on.
She doesn't have the talons yet.

473
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,565
That probably comes
with the first kill.

474
00:26:53,449 --> 00:26:56,805
Besides, if we were able to save her
when she turned into a Wendigo...

475
00:26:56,969 --> 00:26:58,288
A Wendi-what?

476
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:00,283
A Wendigo.

477
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:04,567
It's kind of like a werewolf,
only meaner.

478
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:08,599
Is this the spell that you used?

479
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,838
Is there some sort of spell I could do,
you know, in advance

480
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:16,284
so I could not become,
maybe, a banshee or--

481
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:18,207
What word did you
sub "demon" with?

482
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:19,838
"Dirtbag."

483
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:22,922
"Dirtbag."

484
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,407
Okay.

485
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:33,922
Hand.

486
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:38,208
Guided spirits, hear our plea

487
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:42,288
Annul this magic, let it be

488
00:27:42,449 --> 00:27:43,928
Please let it be.

489
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:53,527
Do you think it worked
a little too well?

490
00:27:57,329 --> 00:27:59,399
- Leave me--
- Shut up!

491
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:34,720
I've been looking for you.

492
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:41,643
- Damn it.
- Why isn't it working?

493
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:43,487
Because Piper
isn't a witch anymore.

494
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,486
Well, can't you just
scry for evil then?

495
00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:49,847
Do you have any idea how much evil
is running around San Francisco?

496
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:52,928
Damn it, Piper.

497
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,045
Cole. Thank God.

498
00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:00,524
- Don't thank him yet.
- You didn't find her?

499
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:03,283
I didn't get a chance to look.
Every time I used my sensing powers,

500
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:07,237
a bounty hunter sensed me.
I fought off three of them.

501
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:10,159
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's-- It's okay.

502
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:12,998
Somehow everything's
gonna be okay.

503
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:18,118
I don't have even a little idea
how everything's gonna be okay.

504
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:20,126
- Phoebe.
- You know why? Because nothing

505
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:21,642
- is okay.
- Phoebe?

506
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:24,283
My sister is a Fury,
my boyfriend is a demon--

507
00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:25,922
- Oh, baby. You're bleeding.
- Phoebe.

508
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:31,246
Didn't you say you found me because
Piper cast a spell to find a lost witch?

509
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:35,402
Yes, but I also said
that Piper's not a witch anymore.

510
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:38,840
Yes, but if I could substitute
the word "dirtbag" for "demon,"

511
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:41,125
why can't we substitute
the word "sister" for "witch"?

512
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:42,848
Would that work?

513
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:46,968
Well, no. Not if she's
already looking for a kill.

514
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:48,881
- The call won't be strong enough.
- Why not?

515
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:50,402
Because of the pull of evil.

516
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,799
When I was possessed
by the Woogie,

517
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:54,800
- the blood lust was so strong.
- Woogie?

518
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:57,887
- Don't ask.
- The point is...

519
00:29:58,049 --> 00:29:59,641
... I don't think she'll answer the call.

520
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:05,606
Then we'll add bait.

521
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:14,605
No. No, are you kidding me? No.

522
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:16,527
The Furies go after evildoers, right?

523
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:21,325
Paige, we are not using
the love of my life as bait.

524
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,884
Yes, we are. It's perfect.

525
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:27,603
Cole, you have been a demon
for over a century.

526
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:31,165
That is a lot of victims. The pain
of their cries alone can kill you.

527
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:33,644
But as you said, I'm not the demon
who did those things anymore.

528
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:36,846
And if facing my crimes
helps save your sister--

529
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:38,687
- Cole, l--
- Phoebe...

530
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:46,160
I would do almost anything
for you, you know that.

531
00:30:47,449 --> 00:30:50,566
But I will not be a coward for you.
Please don't ask me to be.

532
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,686
We'll need some of your blood.

533
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:00,603
Right.

534
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:03,203
Knife.

535
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:12,398
- Power of the sisters rise
- Power of the sisters rise

536
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:15,129
- Course unseen across the skies
- Course unseen across the skies

537
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:17,484
- Come to us who call you near
- Come to us who call you near

538
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:19,879
- Come to us and settle here
- Come to us and settle here

539
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:22,483
- Blood to blood, I summon thee
- Blood to blood, I summon thee

540
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:25,209
- Blood to blood, return to me
- Blood to blood, return to me

541
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:32,162
I know where evil dwells.

542
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:38,877
You sure about this?

543
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:41,722
I'm good at a lot of things.
Waiting is not one of them.

544
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:46,448
Honey, what are you doing?

545
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:48,008
I'm trying to do that orb thingy.

546
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:49,921
I can't seem to get
the hang of it, though.

547
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:56,242
- What happened?
- You orbed.

548
00:31:56,609 --> 00:31:58,520
- I did?
- It's a fear response.

549
00:31:58,689 --> 00:32:01,078
So until you learn how to control it,
you just have to--

550
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:03,245
- Get scared?
- Pretty much.

551
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:05,927
All right.

552
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:08,364
- Well, that shouldn't be too difficult.
- Good.

553
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:10,326
Then we will orb, we will levitate,

554
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:11,968
we will juggle knives if we have to,

555
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:13,881
just to keep the Furies
distracted from Cole.

556
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:17,161
Okay, but what I don't get is how we
un-demon Piper once she gets here.

557
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:20,039
Well, we have to close the portal
of unexpressed fury.

558
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:22,723
Unexpressed? I think
she's been raging for days.

559
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:24,800
That's because there's something
she's not saying.

560
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:27,358
- Which is?
- I don't know.

561
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:28,882
But I think I have an idea.

562
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:35,923
They're close.

563
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:39,523
Paige.

564
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:42,762
I did it again.

565
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:45,124
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

566
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:56,482
Phoebe.

567
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:00,843
Nice decoy, Piper. Two points.

568
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:09,202
Cole.

569
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:10,882
Cole.

570
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:12,801
Come on.

571
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:15,608
Lamp.

572
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:20,521
Sorry.

573
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:23,161
Really sorry.

574
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:35,525
Cole is not your problem, Piper,
and you know it.

575
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:44,203
Book.

576
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:48,280
Please let there be
something in here.

577
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:51,962
Cole, don't.

578
00:33:53,689 --> 00:33:54,917
You think I abandoned you.

579
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,879
You think it's my fault
that Prue died.

580
00:33:58,049 --> 00:33:59,721
You blame me. So just admit it.

581
00:34:04,449 --> 00:34:06,679
You don't wanna kill me, Piper.
You don't even know me.

582
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:08,363
You okay?

583
00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:09,797
It's not about me.
It's not about Phoebe.

584
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:11,408
Leo.

585
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:19,761
Phoebe's not the sister
who abandoned you.

586
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,079
- It's Prue.
- Leo, do something.

587
00:34:27,729 --> 00:34:29,447
Where did he take them?

588
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:32,203
To what Piper's really angry at.

589
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:46,001
Tell her, Piper.
It's all right to hate her.

590
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:51,439
You should hate her.

591
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:54,601
When my parents died,
I hated them for it.

592
00:34:54,769 --> 00:34:57,158
I was alone, and I hated them.

593
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:00,405
It is okay to hate Prue.

594
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:08,044
How dare you!

595
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,884
How dare you leave me?

596
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,446
How could you go and die
and leave me here all alone?

597
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:17,203
Please come back.

598
00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:21,078
I need you. Please come back.

599
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:34,639
It's okay. It's okay, honey.

600
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:36,686
It's not okay.

601
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,885
She risked her life every day.

602
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:41,721
She never thought about
what would happen

603
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,959
to me and Phoebe
if she was gone.

604
00:35:44,169 --> 00:35:45,318
I know.

605
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:49,960
How could she think
that I could live without her?

606
00:36:18,169 --> 00:36:20,364
Did you sleep?

607
00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:23,760
Yeah. Actually,
better than I have in a while.

608
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:27,283
It's quiet, isn't it?

609
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:29,448
Early and late.

610
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:32,764
It's just really, really quiet.

611
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:36,164
Prue was always the first one up,

612
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:38,559
and the last one down.

613
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:42,404
It's strange,
the things that you miss.

614
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:46,843
So...

615
00:36:47,009 --> 00:36:49,079
...how scary was l?

616
00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:52,885
Heck, I've seen worse.

617
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:54,687
I've been worse.

618
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:56,802
But...

619
00:36:57,369 --> 00:36:59,246
...about Paige.

620
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:03,761
- She completely freaked.
- No. She handled it.

621
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,807
Better than most people would,
I think.

622
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:08,518
She saved your life.

623
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:12,365
She definitely is a Halliwell.

624
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:14,281
Last name or no.

625
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:19,924
I know I haven't been
the most welcoming.

626
00:37:21,169 --> 00:37:22,807
I just--

627
00:37:23,649 --> 00:37:25,162
I miss Prue so much.

628
00:37:26,049 --> 00:37:29,086
It's hard to imagine opening up
to someone else.

629
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:32,128
With everything that happens
in our lives,

630
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:35,087
Iove just feels like an invitation
for more pain.

631
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:44,201
So maybe...

632
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:47,127
...maybe you don't start with love.

633
00:37:48,729 --> 00:37:51,038
Maybe you just start with "Thanks."

634
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:00,360
South Bay Social Services.

635
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:20,037
Muffins.

636
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:21,801
Thanks.

637
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,880
Busywork. I'm best in the kitchen.

638
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:27,405
Prue was the one
that liked to chase demons.

639
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:35,081
Man, he's like a whole new Donnie.

640
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:37,604
What did Leo say to him?

641
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:45,166
I don't know.

642
00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:48,484
He's a miracle worker,
that husband of mine.

643
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,720
So how are you?

644
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:58,683
I've had bad hours,

645
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:02,285
and hours that aren't quite so bad.

646
00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:06,077
I guess you know how it is.

647
00:39:07,689 --> 00:39:08,838
Yeah.

648
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:11,887
When my parents died,
there were some days

649
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,926
I didn't think I'd survive the sadness.

650
00:39:16,249 --> 00:39:19,286
It'll never be okay
that she's gone, Piper.

651
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:21,322
But I promise it will get better.

652
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:27,640
You know, Leo could fix that for you.

653
00:39:29,169 --> 00:39:31,808
It's my first war wound.
I think I'll wear it with pride.

654
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:35,602
Unfortunately, in this family,
it will not be the last.

655
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:39,763
Well, every family
has its pros and its cons.

656
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:42,727
A couple of demon battles
in exchange for the power

657
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:45,483
to clear up my friend's skin,
I'd say it's worth it.

658
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,401
The power to what?

659
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:52,088
He's cute, isn't he?

660
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,166
You should've seen him yesterday.

661
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:58,325
Okay, you saved my life.

662
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:00,957
So I guess we're even on
the Book of Shadows swipe.

663
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:04,923
But, Paige, there are rules
to being a witch.

664
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:08,480
Rules that you will have to
learn and follow.

665
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:13,205
Well, not to be difficult,
but you're married to our whitelighter,

666
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,566
and Phoebe's shacking up
with a demon,

667
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:19,721
so on balance,
maybe my friend could stay cute?

668
00:40:21,249 --> 00:40:23,001
Okay.

669
00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:25,078
My, my, my.

670
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:29,163
That pile looks about the same size
as it did about an hour ago.

671
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:30,762
Oh, that was my fault.

672
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,159
I distracted her with muffins.

673
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:34,887
And you are...?

674
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:40,521
I'm her sister.
