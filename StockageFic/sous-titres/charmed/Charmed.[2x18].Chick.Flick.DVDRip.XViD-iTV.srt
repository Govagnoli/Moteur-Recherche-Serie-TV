1
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,880
So I think I'll call this

2
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:11,165
Woman Pretending Not
to Look Out the Window.

3
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:16,727
How about Girl About to Pour Hot Tea
On Sister's Head? Let me see.

4
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,917
Either I'm that transparent,
or you're that good.

5
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:24,201
Well, I don't think I'll comment, since
you do have hot liquid over my head.

6
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:27,719
I'm sorry, I just...
I was watching Dan come home alone,

7
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,318
and I think a more appropriate title
for that photo would be

8
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,320
Witch With a Severe Case
of the Guilts.

9
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:35,646
I mean, he was a nice guy
who did nothing wrong and...

10
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,886
Piper, you had to end the relationship,
all right? Your heart wasn't in it.

11
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:40,681
And it was the only way
not to break his.

12
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:43,317
I know, I just feel like Dan
got the short end of the stick.

13
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,439
There are so many ways that
I can go with that, but I think I'll just...

14
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:48,962
Thank you.

15
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:51,484
Besides, you shouldn't be worried
about your past

16
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:54,561
when your future is in town tonight
for dinner and a movie.

17
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:56,043
I know, I know, I know.

18
00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:59,281
My first real date with Leo
as a normal couple.

19
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:02,566
And normal couples usually shower
before their dates, so I'll see you later.

20
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,527
Okay.

21
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,485
- Hi, doody.
- Hi, doody.

22
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:09,407
Hey.

23
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,321
Someone's in a good mood.

24
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,599
- What's his name?
- Billy.

25
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:16,168
- Phoebe, you didn't.
- What?

26
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:18,206
You went to go see
Kill It Before It Dies

27
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,848
at the revival house, didn't you?

28
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,965
No. Why would you think that l...?

29
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:25,718
Okay, I did. But you know what?
It was research.

30
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,642
What kind of class
sends you to movies?

31
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:29,606
No, not for school, for me.

32
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:31,999
If I'm supposed to figure out
what I want from a guy,

33
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:34,888
I might as well start with the first guy
I fell for, don't you think?

34
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:36,960
Billy is the ideal man.

35
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:39,161
He's a character in a movie.

36
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,724
One that, I might add,
you weren't even supposed to watch.

37
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:43,244
When I was 12.

38
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,479
I think after a year and a half
of battling monsters,

39
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:47,526
I can handle a scary movie.

40
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,321
Did I mention Billy
is the perfect man?

41
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,567
Once or twice.

42
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:55,206
I will get that.

43
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:01,768
- Can I help you?
- Pheebs, who is it?

44
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:06,359
- Get up, you miserable witch.
- Hey.

45
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:08,799
If you don't have anything
nice to say...

46
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:14,841
And then there were two.

47
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,887
- You okay?
- Oh, sure.

48
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,761
Come on, come on, come on.

49
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:26,237
All right, who took my loofa?

50
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:38,767
Billy? Billy?

51
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:41,921
I cannot believe
that they made us pay.

52
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:44,125
Sorry.

53
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:46,047
He's gotta be hiding
in here somewhere.

54
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,922
Do you think you might keep it down?
This is my favourite part.

55
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:52,087
Oh, mine too. This is when
Billy comes on, and then they're...

56
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:53,523
Pheebs, we need a spell.

57
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:55,088
But we know nothing
about this guy.

58
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:56,728
I can't just whip one up...

59
00:02:56,889 --> 00:02:58,925
Oh, he's making a break for it.

60
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:02,126
Evil that has travelled near
I call on you to disappear

61
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:03,444
Elementals hear my call

62
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:06,561
Remove this creature
From these walls

63
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:10,525
That was the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

64
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,165
It's all part of the show, sir.

65
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:16,486
I cannot believe that that just worked.
It seemed too easy.

66
00:03:16,649 --> 00:03:19,482
Wow, we are getting way too tough
for these guys.

67
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:26,442
No, no. No.

68
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:07,559
How am I supposed to know
what his deal is?

69
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:11,404
He likes moonlit walks,
thinks holding hands is underrated

70
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:14,208
and enjoys, in his spare time,
killing witches.

71
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:16,121
It was a question for the room,
Pheebs.

72
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:19,440
When a demon makes a house call,
my curiosity gets piqued.

73
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:21,526
Yeah, well,
the house is a mess again.

74
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:24,442
I mean, how come we can't
fight the demon of cleanliness

75
00:05:24,609 --> 00:05:26,042
or the demon of housekeeping

76
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,006
or even that really big bald guy,
Mr Clean?

77
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:30,160
I would so totally take him on.

78
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:31,961
What I don't get
is the order of things.

79
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:34,484
I mean, don't we usually start
someplace dark and dreary

80
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:36,839
and then end up at the manor
for the big old vanquish?

81
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:39,927
Wait a minute.
He followed me home.

82
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:41,687
I knew I recognized him
from somewhere.

83
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:44,198
He was at the movies,
and then he followed me home.

84
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:46,201
Yeah, well, he had a reason
to attack us,

85
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:48,007
so he would have found us
sooner or later.

86
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:51,087
But the question is, why? I mean,
we usually don't vanquish someone

87
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:52,841
without knowing who,
what, where, when...

88
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:55,923
Well, what about the how? How did
you know how to vanquish him?

89
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:59,246
Well, remember the spell
that we used for the bunyip?

90
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:02,282
Well, I just combined that with
the one for the demon with the horn

91
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,768
- coming out of his...
- Forehead?

92
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:06,799
Nice work.
I wish they all went this smoothly.

93
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:12,040
- You have one message, 8:23 p.m.
- Oh, my God, I'm late.

94
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,518
I'm so late. I have to get ready.
Here, take this.

95
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:17,362
- I'll help when I come back, but Leo...
- Go.

96
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:29,522
- How's the date so far?
- Oh, it just got better.

97
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,440
You can do your homework,
pick the right restaurant,

98
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:37,807
the perfect wine, waiting and chilled,
but it helps if you show up. I'm sorry.

99
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:39,288
It's all right, you're here now.

100
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:45,317
- What?
- Nothing.

101
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:49,319
It's just this guy,
a warlock or demon or something,

102
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:52,322
burst into the house, and somehow
Phoebe managed to vanquish him,

103
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:56,528
but we still don't know who he was.
Something just feels off.

104
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:58,447
I'm sorry. No work talk, we promised.

105
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,206
It's all right. You're the one who
wanted to keep tonight magic-free.

106
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:05,202
- I'm okay with it.
- Wanna start over?

107
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:07,364
Okay.

108
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,522
Pardon me?

109
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,919
Oh, I hope you don't mind.
I got the munchies.

110
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:16,966
- No, not at all.
- And for you.

111
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,241
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

112
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,519
There's no salt.
Could you ask that table for theirs?

113
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:25,045
Sure. Excuse me,
may we borrow your salt?

114
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:28,481
Leo.

115
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:30,758
Piper.

116
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:34,727
Hi, Dan and Dan's date.

117
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:37,041
Amelia, this is Leo and...

118
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,444
And Piper.

119
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:43,839
Amelia, as in
someone-l-just-work-with Amelia?

120
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,402
Here's your salt.

121
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:53,640
Thanks.

122
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,999
Well, at least he's not pining away.

123
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:00,241
No.

124
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:11,038
Is this some kind of a test?

125
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:14,567
Okay, so I'd like everything
to be normal,

126
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:17,402
but there's only so much
a girl can take.

127
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:19,241
Here's to our first real date.

128
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:24,207
What are you doing? They need you?

129
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:26,879
Okay. Well, I guess it would be
the same thing

130
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,528
if I was dating a doctor, right?

131
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:31,880
I just wanted tonight to be perfect.

132
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:34,078
Well, it was.

133
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:37,403
I was with you.

134
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:42,520
- Wait a minute.
- What's wrong?

135
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,405
If we can't have a normal date,
can we at least have a normal exit?

136
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,804
Enough with
the disappearing guy stuff.

137
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:52,005
- Okay.
- Okay.

138
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,084
Check!

139
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:07,520
Talk to anyone who was in
the movie theatre at the time.

140
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:10,408
Well, find out what happened
before the fight broke out.

141
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:14,482
No, but I got a location, which is where
you should've been 15 minutes ago.

142
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:16,924
Are you talking about
the revival house on Larkin?

143
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,478
Not unless you know something
I don't. Do you?

144
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:22,447
Well, maybe not about this.

145
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:24,918
Okay, you're gonna be working
with one of our staff writers.

146
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:27,887
Finley's running late to the interview,
so you have to shoot him before.

147
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:31,598
Finley? Finley? As in Finley Beck?

148
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:33,928
Finley Beck?

149
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:36,887
You know him. And here I thought
you were just a beginner.

150
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:40,439
Okay, he is the whole reason
why this beginner got started.

151
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:42,281
He is amazing. Have you met him?

152
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:44,919
Not in person.
I just know him through his press.

153
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:48,206
Okay, well, I mean, the prose in this
is mediocre at best.

154
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:50,445
They didn't even cover
his period in Germany.

155
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:54,445
Not only is he a gifted photographer,
but he just seems

156
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:57,362
- so giving and warm.
- A fan?

157
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,679
- Lazy excuses,
and you can tell him I said so.

158
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,838
Yes, Mr Beck.

159
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:04,006
Can we get started?
I'm on a schedule.

160
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:08,639
Hi. Mr Beck, I'm Prue Halliwell.

161
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:11,522
So when is this photographer
blessing us with his presence?

162
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:13,128
That would be me.

163
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,166
- You're 12.
- Oh, I'm good.

164
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:17,484
I'll decide that.

165
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:20,563
Tell me you're not planning
on shooting me in digital.

166
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:23,522
Oh, no, no, no.
Not now, not tomorrow, not ever.

167
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:25,720
Digital is for amateurs.

168
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:27,720
Careful, dear,
your true colours are showing.

169
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:32,607
Why don't you do something useful
and get me some tea.

170
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:40,648
Hi, honey, how was school?

171
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:43,118
Will someone please tell me
what is up with guys?

172
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:46,287
You don't really expect me
to have an answer for that, do you?

173
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:50,840
Okay, so I have lunch
with this guy from lab, right?

174
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:54,160
- He is totally melatonin boy.
- That bad?

175
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:57,002
I'm keeping his number
in case I have trouble sleeping.

176
00:10:57,369 --> 00:10:58,768
That bad.

177
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:01,284
So I'm sitting there
trying desperately not to fall asleep,

178
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:05,920
and all I keep thinking about
was yesterday.

179
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:09,281
I know, we still have no idea who
he was or how you vanquished him.

180
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:11,959
No, not that.

181
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,484
Billy. The guy from the movie.

182
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:16,361
And I know that this is reality,

183
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:19,043
but why can't a guy like that
exist in my reality?

184
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:26,687
Here I am talking about the shortage
of perfect men, and in orbs yours.

185
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:28,407
I found one of the good guys.

186
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,408
Unfortunately,
I'm here to talk about the bad guys.

187
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:35,685
- No shortage of those.
- Yeah.

188
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:37,965
They sent for me last night
so I could warn you.

189
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:40,927
Okay, fill in a blank.
It's the demon of...

190
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:46,447
Illusion. Apparently he uses magic
somehow to create violence in society.

191
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:48,918
They told me that he's here
to make San Francisco his treat.

192
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:53,037
- He's got a scar below his eye.
- And a goatee?

193
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:56,559
Not a problem,
we vanquished him last night.

194
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,567
Are you sure?

195
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,126
- Because they wouldn't send me...
- Unless the demon isn't gone.

196
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:06,522
Okay, you call Prue,
I'll go to the Book of Shadows.

197
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:08,645
We gotta get back
to that revival house.

198
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,484
- Billy? Billy?
- Pardon me.

199
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:19,846
- Oh, Billy. Billy?
- All right, now what?

200
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:23,285
Well, when we last saw the demon,
we vanquished him in aisle six.

201
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:27,283
And now he's in act three,
up on the screen.

202
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:29,246
Actually, I was just leaving.

203
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:31,445
I should have known
the disappearing-demon routine

204
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:32,724
wouldn't fool you for long.

205
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,125
Yeah, all you really did
was piss us off.

206
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:40,368
- Silly Wiccan, tricks are for kids.
- Piper.

207
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,922
This is the world of illusion,
and you girls are reality.

208
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:48,768
Your powers, unlike mine,
cannot cross between the two.

209
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:53,207
Sally Mae? Sally Mae, where are you?
It's getting dark and...

210
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:57,404
- You said you weren't gonna cause...
- Shut up.

211
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:58,724
Hey!

212
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:05,924
Oh, my God.
I think he's looking at me.

213
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,838
- Hi.
- Hi.

214
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:12,887
Okay, I hate to put a damper
on your little love connection here, sis,

215
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:15,762
- but we need to kick some ass.
- Oh, is that what you're gonna do?

216
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:18,403
How cute. How clever of you.

217
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:20,959
Any idea on how you intend
to do that?

218
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:25,287
Or are you just gonna flirt me
to death like your little tarty sister?

219
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:28,367
Watch your language
in front of the ladies.

220
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:30,238
Consider that a warning.

221
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,885
I'm sorry, was it the word "sister"
that bothered you?

222
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:36,001
How about "bitch"?
Does that go down easier?

223
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:41,448
Prue, stop him!

224
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:50,322
You're off the screen.
How did you...?

225
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,804
Thanks for the inspiration, sport.

226
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,085
So what does he want?

227
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:09,685
Well, it doesn't matter, right?
Let's just get rid of him.

228
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,807
I don't mean to interrupt,
but is there a point in this scene

229
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:15,767
where someone explains
my part to me?

230
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:19,638
Phoebe, you brought the character
back for a play date, you tell him.

231
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:21,879
You're right, we should've left him
at the theatre.

232
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:24,005
He would have
really blended in there.

233
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:27,199
Billy, this isn't a movie.

234
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:32,244
This is reality,
as in we're all real and you...

235
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:36,604
I haven't quite figured
that part out yet.

236
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,048
- But you...
- They're the good guys.

237
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:43,638
Right. Okay, we know
that the demon can go

238
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:45,845
from the real world
to the world of illusion,

239
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:47,880
and now he can bring a buddy
along for the ride.

240
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:49,448
The question is, what does he want?

241
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:53,438
Leo, they told you that his goal
was to create violence in society?

242
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:56,482
Yeah, but they left out the how part.

243
00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:00,322
He goes into movies.
That's where he does it.

244
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:04,563
- Does what?
- Well, first he...

245
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:08,000
- Where's the music?
- Music? What music?

246
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,042
This is around the second act, right,
when everything's explained?

247
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:13,485
Where's the music
we're supposed to talk over

248
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,402
to build suspense
and hide the exposition?

249
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:19,879
- Don't you just hate exposition?
- Don't even get me started.

250
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,479
All right, you said that he does
something in the movie.

251
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:26,209
- Like what, to the story?
- No, to the audience.

252
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:30,158
When they leave,
they're different, angry.

253
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:33,327
So that's his shtick?
He casts a spell in movies?

254
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,839
Must be how this demon spreads
his particular brand of violence.

255
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:38,448
That's why he looked so familiar.

256
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:41,679
He wasn't at the movie,
he was in the movie.

257
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:44,727
So if he can use Billy's movie,
then he can use other movies.

258
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:47,642
If he's gonna spread violence,
he'll prey on people who are open to it.

259
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:50,165
All right, so he'll be in horror movies.

260
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,082
I'll grab a paper, head out
to the theatres that are playing those.

261
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:56,565
- Okay, Leo and I will go with you.
- I'll call Morris, give him a heads-up.

262
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,604
Phoebe, maybe you should
do something with Billy.

263
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,839
You know,
add a little Technicolor to him.

264
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:10,922
- Hello?
- Miss Halliwell.

265
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:15,207
- Mr Beck. How did you get...?
- You realize I have photo approval?

266
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:17,758
Yes, I'm totally aware
that you have photo approval...

267
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:19,567
- I want to see them.
- Now?

268
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,959
- Yes.
- Well, no. See, actually,

269
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:25,405
I'm not at home right now,
so maybe we can meet

270
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,924
- at the magazine later...
- That won't work for me.

271
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,808
- Later's not good for you?
- No.

272
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,005
Well, when would
be good for you, exactly?

273
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:35,046
Now.

274
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:38,327
What do we do?

275
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:41,518
Little late, don't you think?

276
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:44,249
I can see you moving.

277
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:46,445
Oh, I just...

278
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:52,159
Darkroom would be where?

279
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:56,004
- So that's Finley.
- My hero.

280
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:58,444
Yeah, well, I guess the plans
have sort of changed.

281
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:01,043
All right, we'll call you later.

282
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:06,442
Don't mind me, I'm just wandering
through your house.

283
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,087
How'd you like to do that
for real?

284
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:46,564
- Who is this guy?
- I can get you out of here,

285
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:49,004
take you to a place
where the movie never ends.

286
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:52,958
Simmer down.

287
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:56,927
I'll be back to you in a moment.

288
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:03,085
So. Interested?

289
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,922
As with most things,
there is one catch.

290
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:09,683
I get to pick three victims.

291
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:12,647
They're choice little morsels,
and I think you'll find them

292
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:15,004
quite powerless
against your charms.

293
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:17,729
Feel free to kill anyone you like
along the way.

294
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,449
Just get me those girls.

295
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:31,483
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
let's make your PG lives rated R.

296
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:35,446
Who needs violence
when you can make it yourself?

297
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:39,079
Don't say that to me.

298
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:41,727
- Hello?
- Hey, this isn't your living room.

299
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:43,157
You want a piece of me?

300
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:53,517
And then that part when Sally Mae
gets her hair caught in the car door

301
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:57,728
right when the monster's
about to get her? I love that part.

302
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:04,044
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean, not only
have you seen it, you've lived it.

303
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:06,285
It's all right.
I like to hear what you think.

304
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,879
Okay, now, you have to be careful
not to say that,

305
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:11,279
because every girl will know
that you're not for real.

306
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,249
You make me feel like a kid again.

307
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:24,682
I mean, I must've seen you...

308
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:29,844
Well, the movie a thousand times.

309
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,287
I'm glad you liked it.

310
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:34,919
Yeah, and even with that
ridiculous dialogue

311
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:38,161
and that predictable story, you just...

312
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:43,079
You made your character
seem really real, you know?

313
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:45,245
Phoebe, I am those lines.

314
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:50,279
That's how I was written.
I don't exist outside that movie.

315
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:52,842
Until now.

316
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:56,762
You know, I never minded.

317
00:19:56,969 --> 00:20:00,723
I always knew what scenes
to show up for and what to say.

318
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:06,846
But then he comes into the movie,
and I'm getting to write my own lines,

319
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:08,442
be more like you.

320
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:14,005
I think you're swell, Phoebe.

321
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:18,361
Thank you, Billy.

322
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:21,484
But I don't know how this happened.

323
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:23,560
Or how I'm supposed to be.

324
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:26,637
Everything I've ever known...

325
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:29,086
...understood...

326
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:31,927
...touched...

327
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:34,280
...it's all been scripted.

328
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:37,681
I had no choice,
but here you have options.

329
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:40,357
Where to go, what to say.

330
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:42,521
What to do.

331
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:48,603
Well, you're in my world now.

332
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:50,646
What do you wanna do?

333
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,406
I almost forgot.

334
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:36,447
- Hello.
- Hi, Phoebe.

335
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:38,765
Thanks for the heads-up
on the movie theatre thing.

336
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:41,358
- What happened?
- Mission multiplex.

337
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:45,244
One dead, four injured,
six in custody.

338
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,122
You believe that?

339
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:52,120
You know what? At this point,
I think I would believe anything.

340
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:55,247
Okay, thank you for calling,
but keep your eyes open.

341
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:58,327
I think this day's gonna get worse
before it gets better, okay?

342
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:00,366
- Okay, bye.
- All right, bye.

343
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:07,481
Piper, we found our demon.

344
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:16,369
You know, maybe you'd like
to take those home.

345
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,685
Relax, ponder,
choose which one you'd like.

346
00:22:19,449 --> 00:22:23,158
Maybe you'd like to be quiet
while I see if I can save these things.

347
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:28,039
- Prue, is it okay to come down?
- Not really a good time.

348
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:32,919
Okay, well, I really need
to demon-strate something for you.

349
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:34,602
Okay, what is it?

350
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:36,839
Once you finish your thing
and I finish my thing,

351
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:39,125
then we really need to
go meet Piper and Leo

352
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:41,797
- to fix the thing that we saw at the...
- Thing.

353
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:46,161
- Exac... I love you. I'll be back upstairs.
- Okay.

354
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:49,847
Sisters.

355
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:53,085
Here, print this one again.

356
00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:55,524
But you need to flag a gradual fade
on the wall behind me

357
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:57,088
and burn in the key under my chin.

358
00:22:58,209 --> 00:22:59,961
Would you like me
to hold your hand this time?

359
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:10,363
I figured out what's wrong
with your photos, Miss Halliwell.

360
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:12,247
Absolutely no depth.

361
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:14,522
Really?

362
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:18,284
Now, would that be the technique
or the subject?

363
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:22,647
- Excuse me?
- I wish I could.

364
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:27,402
Your work meant more to me
than you will ever know.

365
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:29,918
And because of that,
I have carried around this illusion

366
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:32,882
of what it would mean to me
to meet you and to learn from you,

367
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:35,961
and how that would make me
appreciate your work even more.

368
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:38,927
But now it is so hard for me
to even look at your pictures,

369
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:41,404
because I think of the man
who took them.

370
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:44,806
And it is devastating to me to realize
that the brilliance of your eye

371
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:47,881
is completely destroyed
by the ignorance of your mouth.

372
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:55,398
See, that's the thing
about art, Miss Halliwell.

373
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:59,284
If you leave your subject
under the light too long, they burn.

374
00:24:04,889 --> 00:24:06,368
Mr Beck.

375
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:10,519
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

376
00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:22,448
Wasn't much of a date last night.

377
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:26,124
You wanna find seats in the back
and make out before demon hunting?

378
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:39,399
Okay, well, I'm okay, you're okay.
Magic perk.

379
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:42,681
Didn't you hear the management?
Please refrain from talking.

380
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,838
Oh, well, I guess I'll have to kill you.

381
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:49,000
Better yet... Mary?

382
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:51,764
Oh, Bloody Mary?

383
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:56,917
There's one of the girls
who's been getting in my way.

384
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,768
Don't stab her all in one place.

385
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,205
Okay, that didn't work,
but my legs still do.

386
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:07,643
Okay, let's go.

387
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:20,726
I'll be right there, Pheebs.

388
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:44,121
Phoebe!

389
00:25:48,689 --> 00:25:51,726
- Hello? Privacy.
- Hello? Axe murderer.

390
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:04,886
Let's go this way.

391
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:12,679
Oh, that was an antique,
you assho...

392
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:15,323
He's very, very sensitive
about the language.

393
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:22,881
Okay, dead woman with a knife
on her way.

394
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:26,359
Leo stayed behind
to calm down the...

395
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:28,884
Where is everybody?

396
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:51,327
Pretty sneaky, sis.

397
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:55,849
Phoebe, does this guy
look familiar to you?

398
00:26:57,889 --> 00:26:59,208
Yeah, kind of.

399
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:00,802
When Leo and I
tracked down the demon,

400
00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:04,848
he sent some white, pasty hag
literally off of the screen to kill us.

401
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:06,567
I think he called her Bloody Mary.

402
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:08,999
Wait a minute,
this Paul Bunyan with a lobotomy,

403
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,319
he's from Axe Husband.
I saw that last week.

404
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,680
We so have to monitor
your viewing habits.

405
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:24,799
We can't kill them.
They're not real, they're fiction.

406
00:27:24,969 --> 00:27:27,563
We can't kill something
that doesn't exist.

407
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:32,322
- Billy!
- I have something in common

408
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:34,684
with the bad guys. Run!

409
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:50,083
I'm being stalked by psycho killers
and I hide in the shower?

410
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:14,042
Okay, okay.

411
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:17,360
At least they're not
in the bathroom with us.

412
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,997
That's kind of good.

413
00:28:20,969 --> 00:28:22,243
Pretty little girls.

414
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:33,247
- Okay.
- Okay.

415
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:35,606
I think I figured out
how to kill these guys.

416
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:39,204
Phoebe.

417
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:44,641
- Billy!
- He can't hurt me.

418
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:49,207
You run!
I'll see if I can hold this one off!

419
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:56,247
Okay, okay.

420
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:59,446
Billy said the only thing he knows is
what's written for him in those movies.

421
00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:01,401
Maybe the only way
the psychos know to die

422
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:04,208
- is how they were killed on-screen.
- How am I supposed to know?

423
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:07,441
I'm a romantic-comedy girl. Why go to
horror movies when they come to us?

424
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:09,685
All right, that leaves you, Pheebs.

425
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:13,881
- Miss me?
- Okay, that's Bloody Mary,

426
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:17,161
and she was thrown out
of a window.

427
00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:20,685
And that axe guy,
he was electrocuted.

428
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:21,918
So go tell Billy and...

429
00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:24,557
And see if the slasher will stick
his finger in a socket, sure.

430
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:27,326
- Hi, hi.
- Hi.

431
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:29,565
- Hi.
- Okay, get her. Get her.

432
00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:33,438
We have got to do something
about that complexion.

433
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:48,119
- One down...
- And one to go.

434
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:51,887
- Prue.
- Hi.

435
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:55,325
He wasn't real receptive to the plan.

436
00:29:55,529 --> 00:30:00,762
Does anybody else get tired
of cleaning up after these guys?

437
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:03,685
Okay.

438
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:05,248
Hi. Hi.

439
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:09,366
Take it.

440
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:17,846
It's okay, the man is here
to save the day.

441
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:22,965
Billy, it's the 21 st century.
It's the woman's job to save the day.

442
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:39,806
- It's over.
- Don't ever say that.

443
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:42,802
Every time someone says that
in the movie, something always...

444
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:01,119
It's Darryl.

445
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:12,201
Hi. Serious face. It's okay, we're
too tired for pleasantries. Just tell us.

446
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,006
He's okay.

447
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:23,006
It wasn't just an outbreak
at one theatre.

448
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:25,558
I got stuff going down
at multiple locations.

449
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:29,284
And on top of that, I got a series
of murders straight out of the movies.

450
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:34,888
- I think we're looking at a copycat.
- Only there's more than one cat.

451
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:40,045
- How much do you want?
- Only what I need.

452
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:43,399
It's not someone imitating
what happens on the screen,

453
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:46,083
it's someone from the screen
doing what comes naturally.

454
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:48,928
Killing without scripts. So we...

455
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:53,365
Well, let's just say
we rewrote them.

456
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:57,243
- So is it over?
- Not even close.

457
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,007
We don't know how many
are out there,

458
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,801
and we have no way
of stopping the demon

459
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:02,687
from tampering
with the audiences, so...

460
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,405
- You used the D word again.
- Sorry.

461
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,607
Damn.

462
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:12,079
Look, I gotta get back to the station.
Call me.

463
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:13,443
Thanks, Darryl.

464
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:17,319
We have to find this guy
before it gets any worse.

465
00:32:17,489 --> 00:32:19,127
Yeah, only we don't know
where he is.

466
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:21,126
I know where he's gonna be tonight.

467
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:23,321
Don't you just love it
when he does that?

468
00:32:23,489 --> 00:32:26,287
The demon didn't just show up at my
movie today. He's been there before.

469
00:32:26,449 --> 00:32:28,644
Every time we leave for a new city,
he goes there too.

470
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:30,840
You mean he's travelling in the print?

471
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,280
And tonight's the last night in this city.
That's where he's gonna be.

472
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:37,680
Right, so the midnight show
will be his final performance.

473
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:41,723
We can't kill him in our world,
so we'll have to do it in his.

474
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:45,677
You mean go into the movie?
Can we even write a spell for that?

475
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:48,445
I could probably whip up a potion
or something.

476
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:50,640
Well, how about two?
One to make sure we can get in,

477
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:52,606
and one to make sure
we can get out.

478
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:54,487
Phoebe's pharmaceuticals.

479
00:32:57,449 --> 00:33:00,282
That means I'm gonna have
to leave you there.

480
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:02,724
So? You'll always know
where to find me.

481
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:07,604
So let's go to the movies.

482
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:15,160
Billy, you're back. Just in time.

483
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,440
This is the part
where we're supposed to be...

484
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:21,885
You brought company.

485
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:26,328
Oh, Billy, how could you?
We were going steady.

486
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:29,522
And you... You pinned me!

487
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:33,488
That's because the writers told me to,
Sally Mae.

488
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:36,925
I mean, you're a nice girl
and all, but...

489
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:40,286
Anyway, these people,
they're here to help us.

490
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:42,719
Phoebe, do you have the potion?

491
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:46,683
Oh, couldn't you at least have made it
look like it tasted good?

492
00:34:05,369 --> 00:34:07,439
Check me out, I'm retro.

493
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:13,682
It tastes like ass...

494
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,408
...phalt.

495
00:34:17,729 --> 00:34:19,048
And now for the violent climax.

496
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,602
- Oh, you need to get a life.
- He's under a spell.

497
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:28,282
Piper, behind you.

498
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:33,559
All right, deep down I know
that you're an innocent,

499
00:34:33,729 --> 00:34:34,878
so I can't really kill you.

500
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:39,282
But I can:

501
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:41,884
Sleep tight, film boy.

502
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:49,402
You're out of your league.
In fact, you're out of your world.

503
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,641
Didn't anybody ever tell you
what happens

504
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:54,881
once the movie ends
if you're still in it? No?

505
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:58,798
Well, I'd love to explain it to you,
but we're out of time.

506
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:02,805
- Prue?
- Piper, Phoebe,

507
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:04,920
get out of there quick.

508
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:10,606
- Prue, why is it getting dark?
- Prue, what's going on?

509
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:17,441
Prue, do something.

510
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:21,881
- Where are you? What can I do?
- Help us.

511
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:31,568
Okay.

512
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:38,082
Where the hell is reverse?

513
00:35:54,649 --> 00:35:56,128
Prue?

514
00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:04,318
Are you guys okay?

515
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,678
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

516
00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:07,437
Get out of there quick.

517
00:36:07,649 --> 00:36:08,638
Okay.

518
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:17,440
Oh, that's right.
Run away, little witches.

519
00:36:17,649 --> 00:36:20,641
So these are the mighty
Charmed Ones.

520
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:22,128
Watch me run in fear.

521
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:24,281
Prue, I don't know
what else we can do.

522
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:25,842
You're supposed to be
the perky one.

523
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:28,165
You should really try
and not be so negative.

524
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:33,359
How does it feel to finally know
someone you can't defeat, huh?

525
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:34,968
I don't know, you tell me.

526
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:42,881
You know, if you leave a subject
under the light for too long, it burns.

527
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,239
No!

528
00:36:55,689 --> 00:36:58,044
Thanks for waking me up to warn me
about the film burning.

529
00:36:58,209 --> 00:37:00,882
I could've lost my job.

530
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:03,722
I guess you learned something
from Finley after all.

531
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,084
Yeah, I guess he did come in handy.

532
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:09,924
You can love the work,
but not the man.

533
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:12,444
What if you love them both?

534
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:19,079
I guess it's only fair.

535
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:23,282
I got my first glimpse of romance
from watching you on the big screen.

536
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,280
Other girls deserve
that same view.

537
00:37:26,169 --> 00:37:30,447
Thank you for restoring my faith
in the male species.

538
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:34,367
Now all you have to do is hold out
for one that's three-dimensional.

539
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:10,401
You've gotta be kidding.
The date was a disaster.

540
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:12,799
And I had a great time.

541
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:14,960
I especially liked
the look on your face

542
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:18,439
when the accordion player
broke out into that song.

543
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:22,318
- You're making fun of me? Yes.
- No.

544
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:26,485
It was our first date.
I wanted it to be...

545
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:28,162
I wanted us to be...

546
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:30,160
- A normal couple?
- Yes.

547
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:32,524
Well, you're a witch,
and I'm a whitelighter.

548
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:35,522
You know, being busy,
being called away

549
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:39,079
are probably the only normal things
about us.

550
00:38:45,729 --> 00:38:46,844
Hello? Door's open.

551
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:51,001
- Is anybody...?
- I...

552
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:57,648
- Never mind.
- Wait. No, Dan, wait.

553
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:05,687
What's this?

554
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:08,205
This is yours.

555
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:12,439
Some of the things that you left
over at my house.

556
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:16,363
I kept them around because
part of me was hoping that maybe...

557
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:20,924
Maybe that you'd come back.

558
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:26,319
And after last night,
I realized that I have to move on too.

559
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:32,199
Thanks.

560
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:35,406
Hey...

561
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:39,687
- Dan. Hi. Are you...?
- Just leaving.

562
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:42,921
I...

563
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:47,286
Yeah.

564
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,802
Does it never get any easier?

565
00:39:55,449 --> 00:39:58,407
Okay, talk to me of something else,
like what happened at the magazine?

566
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:02,318
I had another run-in with Finley.
Hey, you.

567
00:40:02,489 --> 00:40:03,808
Anyway, it all worked out.

568
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:06,039
Did you get to tell off
the demon of crankiness again?

569
00:40:06,249 --> 00:40:07,523
No, once was enough.

570
00:40:07,689 --> 00:40:12,126
But, oh, my editor did love
the shot that I chose of him.

571
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:15,719
Said that it was the first picture
that captured the real man.

572
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:19,484
Speaking of, I will never see
another horror movie again.

573
00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:22,123
But I ran across this and thought:

574
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:28,919
Prue. Oh, Prue. I love it. I love it.
I'm gonna go watch it right now.

575
00:40:29,649 --> 00:40:32,402
Should we worry?

576
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:36,001
I think she's just saying goodbye.

577
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:43,288
- Is it really over?
- Yes, Sally Mae, it is.

578
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:46,885
- Really and truly?
- I'm here now.

579
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:51,327
And as long as I'm with you,
everything's gonna be A-okay.

580
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:53,957
- Promise?
- Promise.

581
00:40:54,169 --> 00:40:56,285
You're my hero, Billy.

582
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:59,566
And I think you're swell, Sally Mae.
