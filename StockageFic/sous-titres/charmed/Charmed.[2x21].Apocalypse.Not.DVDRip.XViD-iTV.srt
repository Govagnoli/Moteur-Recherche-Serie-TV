1
00:00:05,449 --> 00:00:07,724
Any day that brings new shoes
is a good day.

2
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:09,686
Are you kidding?
This was a great day.

3
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:12,926
Yoga, pedicure, shopping, lunch.
When have we had more fun?

4
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:16,718
It's nice to bond through something
other than vanquishing for a change.

5
00:00:16,889 --> 00:00:19,357
Yeah, but I gotta hand it
to those pesky little demons.

6
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,440
They sure have brought us
closer together.

7
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,248
Maybe you should write them
thank-you notes.

8
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:27,081
- Crowds early this morning
when an argument

9
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:29,683
between neighbours at a block party
turned into a street brawl.

10
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,841
Residents of several apartment
buildings poured into the street...

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,445
Some people are just crazy.

12
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:40,079
Doesn't it seem like this kind of stuff
has been happening a lot lately?

13
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:44,162
Random social violence is encouraged
by a general decline in ethical thinking.

14
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:46,764
Well, according to
my sociology professor.

15
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:49,318
He said that we don't think
about the big questions enough.

16
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:52,442
The big question is how did you
stay awake through his class?

17
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,041
Not only did I stay awake,
but I actually enjoyed it.

18
00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:57,642
Which is why I bought this book.

19
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,522
It's filled with really deep,
profound questions.

20
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,566
It would actually make
a good bar game at P3.

21
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:08,806
Oh, great, solve the problems
of the world while doing Jell-O shots.

22
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:12,401
Okay, let's see if I can find
a really good one.

23
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:16,488
Okay, what if a building is on fire.

24
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:19,402
Do you save five strangers
or one sibling?

25
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:22,607
I thought that you said these were
hard questions. That's easy, sibling.

26
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:24,521
- Of course.
- Ditto.

27
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,522
- Okay, my turn, my turn.
- Okay.

28
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:30,518
Okay, don't answer anything
till I answer that.

29
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,203
Okay, faster though, faster.

30
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:41,684
- Hi.
- Hi.

31
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:44,640
Since when do you ring
instead of orb?

32
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:46,765
Well, I'm just trying to respect
everybody's space,

33
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:48,760
since the three of you
have been so...

34
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,803
- Hey, Leo.
...tight these days.

35
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,125
So are you here for all of us?

36
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:56,679
No, this isn't business.
I was just about

37
00:01:56,889 --> 00:02:00,484
to invite Piper to an early dinner
before the Paula Cole show.

38
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:03,841
Do you have other plans?

39
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:07,127
Not exactly, we...
We've just been hanging out all day,

40
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:10,087
spending some quality,
non-magic time and...

41
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:12,441
All right, well, no problem.

42
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:14,122
Rain check?

43
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:17,605
Piper, why don't you go with Leo?
I mean, we're totally cool with it.

44
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:20,960
Pheebs and I will go to the club early,
keep an eye on things.

45
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,881
Oh, yeah, I have
a new assistant manager,

46
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:25,722
and she's all checked out,
so she can take care of things.

47
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:27,880
Still, we'll go and make sure
everything's okay.

48
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:30,366
We'll bring the book,
maybe stir up some trouble.

49
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:32,804
- How about stirring up margaritas?
- That's good too.

50
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:34,647
- What are we gonna wear?
- I don't know.

51
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:37,528
- So it's a date?
- All right.

52
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:45,680
I didn't mean that I didn't enjoy
being with you.

53
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:50,400
All I meant was that Phoebe and Prue
would've enjoyed the restaurant too.

54
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:55,481
Come on.

55
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:00,121
Wish you were normal sisters.
They're never this close.

56
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:01,887
And it's a problem that we are?

57
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:03,647
No.

58
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,039
It just seems that sometimes
I'm breaking up a great party

59
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,801
when I wanna be alone with you.

60
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:13,558
Leo, I have room for all of you
in my life and in my heart.

61
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:20,123
I still need to know
which room's mine because...

62
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:24,045
Why don't you learn to drive!

63
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:26,244
Okay.

64
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:32,164
Oh, no.

65
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,681
- Why'd you take the corner like that?
- Come here.

66
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,363
Hey, get out of there.
What are you doing?

67
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,960
Get off of me.

68
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:47,923
Hey, you...

69
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:53,877
What on earth?

70
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:07,004
- Leo?
- I see him.

71
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:11,963
Wait, Piper,
you don't know what he is.

72
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:58,758
Thank you, P3, you've been great.
Thank you.

73
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:10,998
Hey, I can't believe you guys missed
Paula Cole. She was awesome.

74
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:13,279
We saw a pretty awesome
show ourselves.

75
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:16,322
- I thought you guys went to dinner.
- We did, and then for dessert,

76
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:18,719
- we did a little demon hunting.
- What happened?

77
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:21,568
There was this road-rage thing,
it was completely out of control.

78
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:24,243
So I froze the entire street
except for a guy in a suit.

79
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,524
And he takes off.

80
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:29,086
Your sister doesn't listen to me,
so we chase him down into an alley.

81
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,921
Nothing, he vanished into thin air.

82
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,319
Wait, a demon
that causes road rage?

83
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:35,918
I don't know if he caused it
or was attracted by it.

84
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,279
The kind of creature that
gets off on that would explain

85
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:39,928
why the city's been
such a mess lately.

86
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:43,081
He's probably, what,
some lower-level mischief-maker?

87
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:45,598
Sooner you figure out who he is,
the better for everyone.

88
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:47,845
Except for those of us
who have to get rid of him.

89
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:50,558
Okay, well, we could sit around here
being pessimistic,

90
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,761
or we could go to the house
and check the Book of Shadows.

91
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:02,403
What happened?

92
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,242
First of all, I wanna let you all know
that I was out in the field,

93
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:08,606
and things are looking good.
The public is really responding.

94
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,647
But?

95
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:12,483
We might have a problem.

96
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:15,602
- Did you screw up?
- Now, why would you assume that?

97
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:17,277
Please don't fight.

98
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,248
It's all they know how to do.

99
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:23,322
A freezing witch saw me,
caught me working.

100
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,004
A good witch?

101
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:29,447
I would say so. She chased me.
I think she thought she could stop me.

102
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,843
- That is a problem.
- Fixable.

103
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,563
I think we can still
move forward with our plan

104
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:37,088
and still make our deadline.

105
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,683
But the deadline's 7:00
tomorrow night.

106
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,079
- This horse is gonna...
- Find her and kill her.

107
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,439
- How we gonna find her?
- Set a trap.

108
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:48,009
If she's a good witch,
she'll want to stop us.

109
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:51,042
All we have to do is give her
something she'll want to stop.

110
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:56,123
- Wait, stop right there.
- The Demon of Cruelty?

111
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,480
"Hardens the heart,
corrodes the soul..."

112
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,719
And is a woman.

113
00:09:02,849 --> 00:09:05,317
Hey, so how is it going?

114
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:07,320
In big, fat circles.

115
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:08,763
We've been reading all night,

116
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:11,159
and there's no one in here
who matches the guy I saw.

117
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:13,405
We do have a list
of six potential matches, though.

118
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:16,402
But there's no pictures,
so we're sort of shooting in the dark.

119
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:18,446
My best guess
is the Demon of Anarchy.

120
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:20,201
Hey, you can't just guess.

121
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:21,762
All right? You have to be sure.

122
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,362
It's very dangerous
to engage an enemy

123
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,281
unless you know who he is
and what he wants.

124
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:28,283
Leo, honey, we have
done this a couple times.

125
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:30,081
- No, I didn't mean...
- You know, Leo,

126
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:33,480
it would be great to know every single
thing about our enemies, but we can't.

127
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:35,486
- I know, but...
- If this guy is causing riots,

128
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:38,083
we can't just hang out
and wait for inspiration, you know?

129
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:40,047
Okay. Three against one.

130
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:43,360
All right? I just...
I was worried, that's all.

131
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,766
Okay, so no offence
to the whitelighter,

132
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:48,045
but we're going with
the Demon of Anarchy, right?

133
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:49,722
Yes, the Demon of Anarchy.

134
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:53,406
Okay, so this potion
doesn't even require a double boiler.

135
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:56,242
And it's your basic
iambic pentameter chant.

136
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:57,967
It's a very nice, simple vanquish.

137
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:00,046
Okay, so all we have to do now

138
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:02,046
is figure out where this guy's
gonna show up next.

139
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:04,882
All right, who do we know that
would be keeping track of anarchy?

140
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah, Prue, the department has
noticed an upswing in violence.

141
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:13,605
The captain is calling them
"civil disturbances."

142
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:17,122
In my professional opinion,
the whole city's lost its fricking mind.

143
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,963
We got street brawls,
looting, arson.

144
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:22,882
We're about two problems away
from being placed on tactical alert.

145
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:26,281
You're not calling me
to tell me that

146
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:28,405
this trouble is because of
you-know-what, are you?

147
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:30,968
Yeah, well, possibly.

148
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:33,768
We're actually researching that
right now.

149
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:35,999
We were kind of
calling for your help.

150
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:39,767
Look, I really can't leave right now.

151
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:42,529
No, no, no, I understand,
and we're not quite there yet.

152
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:45,487
But it would really help to know
where the latest hot spot is.

153
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,040
Don't freeze him

154
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:06,160
- and don't let him know we're here.
- All right.

155
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:08,285
What the hell is wrong
with these people?

156
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:13,407
I cannot wait to kick this guy's butt
all the way back to...

157
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,206
All right, all right. This way, this way.

158
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:31,928
- That's him, that's him.
- Well, let's go introduce ourselves.

159
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:33,317
Prue.

160
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,080
There are three of them.

161
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:53,328
There's four of you?

162
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,567
- Prue.
- Stop. Or I'll snap her neck.

163
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:01,122
Start the chant.

164
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:03,958
Start the damn chant.

165
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:10,128
Sower of discord
Your works now must cease

166
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:12,678
I vanquish thee now
With these words of peace

167
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,287
- Prue?
- What the hell?

168
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,960
What just happened?

169
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:38,605
I think we just vanquished our sister.

170
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:47,042
- She's gone.
- We don't know that.

171
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,437
Phoebe, we killed Prue.

172
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:50,520
Piper, stop it, okay?
I don't wanna hear that.

173
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:53,761
You think I wanna say it? I'm the one
who made the potion. It's my fault.

174
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:55,681
Okay, how about having a little faith?

175
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:57,919
All right, our magic has never
let us down before.

176
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,398
Well, there's a first time
for everything, isn't there?

177
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:02,560
- She's not dead.
- How do you know that?

178
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:06,244
Because, Piper,
I have no choice but to believe...

179
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:07,808
...in us.

180
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:09,800
And in our magic.

181
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:12,562
Come here.

182
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:16,768
Okay, look, if she were dead,
we would see her spirit, right?

183
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,001
So maybe because
we brought the wrong spell,

184
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:22,285
something weird happened.

185
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,440
Maybe it just sent them someplace.

186
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:27,203
- Where?
- I don't know.

187
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:30,367
But I believe that we
can figure it out.

188
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,203
And I need you to believe that too.

189
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:37,844
We have Leo,
and we have the book.

190
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:40,080
And we have each other.

191
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:43,639
We can save Prue.

192
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,925
There's gotta be a way.

193
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:55,808
There's no way.
He's dead, and so are we.

194
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,561
He's not dead. He can't be dead.

195
00:13:57,729 --> 00:14:00,243
He maybe shifted to another plane,
but he cannot be dead.

196
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:02,843
Only the Source can kill us.
We are the Anointed Ones,

197
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,442
the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

198
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:07,169
The Source won't hesitate to kill us
if we miss our deadline.

199
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:09,559
We're so close.
How did this happen?

200
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:11,640
Somebody got sloppy
and attracted a witch.

201
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:13,726
We will not fail.

202
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:16,762
Other teams have failed.
They blew it, and they paid the price.

203
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:19,358
We will too, if we miss our deadline.
And then he'll kill us

204
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:22,760
and take four willing souls
from in there and anoint them.

205
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,567
They'll be the next Four Horsemen.

206
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:26,447
Glad to see you two aren't giving up.

207
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:28,486
We need War, he's the big gun.

208
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:30,685
He's the one who was gonna
set nation against nation

209
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,202
and do all the heavy work.

210
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:34,360
- Then we'll get him back.
- By 7:00?

211
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:36,844
We have to.
Now, just listen to me, all right.

212
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,443
Who got vanquished
and left you boss?

213
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:41,327
I have a plan. Do you have a plan?

214
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:44,726
Of course you have a plan. The same
plan you always have: Kill them all.

215
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:47,602
- You looking for a fight?
- It's my specialty.

216
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:50,004
We don't have much time.
Hear him out.

217
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:53,037
All we have to do is find where he is.

218
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:55,717
Let's pull out the old books,
do some research.

219
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,319
All right? He has to be somewhere.
We will bring him back.

220
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:01,480
There's gotta be a way.

221
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:06,168
Peace talks have broken down
for the fourth, and possibly final time.

222
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:08,081
Mortar fire could be heard
throughout the...

223
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:09,887
Police clashed with rioters...

224
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:29,046
Maybe if we break down
the spell and the potion.

225
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:30,688
I am so sorry.

226
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:33,079
- Did you find anything?
- I've been looking.

227
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:35,245
And? Tell us you found something.

228
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:38,207
I've been through the whole book,
and I can't find anything that matches

229
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:39,597
the four beings you described.

230
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:41,646
- What about disappearances?
- Nothing.

231
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:43,959
Okay, we have to look
under "botched vanquishes."

232
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:45,403
I've been through the whole book,

233
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,560
there is no explanation
for what happened to Prue.

234
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:48,957
But you agree she's not dead?

235
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:52,557
I don't understand.

236
00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:55,926
Wait, wait, l... Wait a minute, l...
I can't do this.

237
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,649
Phoebe tells me to have hope,
and you tell me there isn't any?

238
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:00,401
I just need to know.

239
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:11,483
Are you okay?

240
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:14,317
She's here.

241
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:16,757
Who's here?

242
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:19,126
Prue. She went right through me.

243
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:22,048
I felt her presence.
It's hard to describe, but...

244
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:23,767
Didn't you see her? In the wind?

245
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,357
She's in the wind?

246
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:30,205
No, Phoebe, it's like
she spoke to me. She's alive.

247
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:34,325
Are you sure? Because if she's in the
wind, doesn't that mean she's a spirit?

248
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,326
- No.
- No.

249
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:39,526
She could be on another plane,
trying to break through.

250
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:42,363
Okay, well, then we have to help her.

251
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:45,168
Prue?

252
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:47,968
Prue, honey, are you still here?

253
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:51,168
Help us find you, Prue.

254
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,242
H...

255
00:16:58,369 --> 00:16:59,848
...E...

256
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,046
...L...

257
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:08,963
...P.

258
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:12,409
Honey, how can we help you?

259
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:17,679
What was that?
Did she do it to you too?

260
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:20,598
No, it was something else.

261
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:23,482
Or someone else.

262
00:17:23,649 --> 00:17:25,128
Evil.

263
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:27,086
Cold.

264
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:34,926
What is that?

265
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:36,761
Prue?

266
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:01,720
She's alive, but she's in trouble.

267
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:05,001
Okay, so she's alive. And if she can
find us, then we can find her.

268
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,841
It must be the fourth suit
that's after her.

269
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,963
Maybe the combination
of our magic did this to them.

270
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,887
We need to figure out
who those suits are.

271
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:15,759
Okay, Leo, you go ask your bosses,
whoever they are, whatever they are,

272
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,529
who those guys are,
and how we get our sister back. Now.

273
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:20,685
Orb. Faster.

274
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,806
- Wind.
- Wind?

275
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:29,648
- Can you think of anything else?
- Mist.

276
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:31,363
I've checked everywhere.

277
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:34,407
- I can't figure out what happened.
- I'm telling you, it is the witches.

278
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:36,764
- They did this, they must know.
- What?

279
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:39,961
We're losing momentum
across the board, especially in war.

280
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:42,518
Peace has broken out
in several areas this afternoon.

281
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:44,677
Damn it.

282
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:46,487
If we're going down,
we're not going alone.

283
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:48,719
Let's find those damn witches
and take them down too.

284
00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:50,880
Renewed fighting in the war.

285
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:55,126
War drags on.

286
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:01,239
War. It's him, he's alive.

287
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,323
- In the war.

288
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:06,122
- War.
- War.

289
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:08,007
- Help.
- Hang in there, partner.

290
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:10,524
We'll get you back,
then we'll punish those witches.

291
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:13,289
No, cease-fire. Cooperation.

292
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:16,408
Wait, you want us
to work with the witches?

293
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:18,767
Need them to free me.

294
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:22,088
How are we supposed to find them?

295
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:25,685
Ask the Source.

296
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:30,920
I still haven't found
our four adversaries,

297
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:33,080
but I think I have an idea
of where Prue might be.

298
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:36,998
And how to get her back? We have to
do that before this thing hurts her.

299
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,042
Well, remember when Leo said
that Prue might be on another plane?

300
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:42,160
Well, maybe we
banished her somehow.

301
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:44,406
Now, there are 11 planes
of existence...

302
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:47,407
Eleven planes? We don't have time
to search 11 planes.

303
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,278
Prue's been quiet for a really long time.
Maybe we're too late.

304
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,877
Piper, stay with me.

305
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,483
Okay? We cannot give up.

306
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:02,923
Did you find out where she is?

307
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:05,120
No. But I have a message
from them.

308
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,162
- She's not...?
- No, no.

309
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:11,486
While I was there, they were contacted
by their counterparts on the other side.

310
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:14,083
Are you telling me evil called good,
and good answered?

311
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:16,679
Look, these suits that you're
dealing with

312
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:20,637
have the highest possible connections.
Their bosses talked to my bosses.

313
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:23,647
- About Prue?
- About the whole situation.

314
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,328
They wanna have
a meeting with you.

315
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:28,128
What could they want from us?
They already have Prue.

316
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:30,797
Prue and their partner
are trapped in a netherworld

317
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:32,288
between good and evil.

318
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:36,118
And the only way to release them
is for good and evil to cooperate.

319
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:39,327
You have to work with the suits.

320
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,922
Are we allowed to do that?

321
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:43,045
Look, all they told me
was to give you the message,

322
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,564
and to let you decide
whether you wanted to do it.

323
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:49,249
Did they mention what
they think we should do?

324
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,204
Free will, it's a big thing with them.

325
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:55,207
Wonderful. So where's the meeting?

326
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,087
- You're gonna do it?
- Did you show up to the party late?

327
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:00,648
Of course we're gonna do it.

328
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:04,006
You can never get into bed with evil,
you know that. It could be a trap.

329
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:07,484
Leo, thank you for your opinion,
but your bosses did say

330
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:10,925
they were leaving the decision
up to us, so maybe you should too.

331
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:15,002
Look, I can't. The last time that you
went up against this evil, you lost Prue.

332
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:17,677
All right, now, and you're gonna
go up against it again?

333
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:19,481
Both of you could be lost this time.

334
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:23,519
We're not gonna go up against them,
we're gonna work with them, right?

335
00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:25,448
But they'll betray you.

336
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:27,645
All right? This is how evil works.

337
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:30,522
This is why evil
loves free will so much.

338
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,044
Because humans use it
to follow their heart.

339
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,165
And evil takes advantage of that.

340
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:36,882
So, Leo, what are our options?

341
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,398
You have to try
and save her by yourselves.

342
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:42,726
But, Leo, we don't know how.
We have to work with them.

343
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,881
But you don't even know
who they are.

344
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:46,607
We tried, but they
weren't in the book.

345
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:50,079
Which means they probably aren't
even demons or warlocks anyway.

346
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:56,522
Okay, then, what are they?

347
00:21:56,969 --> 00:21:59,642
Look, in the hierarchy of evil,

348
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:02,448
there are several species
greater than demons.

349
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:06,362
Ferocious, impossible to vanquish.

350
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:11,087
And these went to extraordinary
lengths to ask for this meeting.

351
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:13,717
Who knows what will happen
when the four of them are reunited?

352
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:16,238
I don't care what happens,
we just want Prue back.

353
00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:18,280
So do I, but this is not the way.

354
00:22:18,489 --> 00:22:21,162
Leo, it's the only way we know.

355
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:23,808
We have to save Prue.

356
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:34,285
This is where we were
supposed to come, right?

357
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:35,962
- Right.
- And it's not a trap, right?

358
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:38,404
Please tell me
we're doing the right thing.

359
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:42,359
Or we're making
the biggest mistake in the world.

360
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:46,167
Thank you for coming. And you are?

361
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:48,001
Anxious to get this over with.
Let's go.

362
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:49,727
- Are you in a hurry?
- You stalling?

363
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:53,006
- Do you want your sister back?
- Do you want your friend back?

364
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,683
Let's do business.

365
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:22,967
- Hey, hey.
- What are you doing?

366
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:25,086
Just making room.

367
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:27,482
Of course.

368
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:33,477
Taking notes.

369
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:37,318
- Of course.
- Old habits are hard to break.

370
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:41,243
I'm sure we can put that all aside
and get this done.

371
00:23:41,449 --> 00:23:43,804
Or die trying.

372
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:52,878
You know, it's bad enough
working with them,

373
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:54,448
but to bring them here?

374
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:56,725
To the manor where
we're the strongest and the safest?

375
00:23:56,889 --> 00:23:59,449
Or maybe we should've gone
to their place, not that they offered.

376
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,281
And why not?

377
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:03,724
Why give up home-field advantage
unless you're hiding something?

378
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:06,403
Of course they're hiding something,
they're evil.

379
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:10,283
Okay, if we can reconstruct
exactly what happened in the alley,

380
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,567
we might be able to figure out
what sent them away and undo that.

381
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:17,161
I was standing there.

382
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,522
No, actually, I was there.

383
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:21,128
You were here.

384
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:23,768
No, he's right.

385
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:27,249
It was more like... this.

386
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:29,758
Okay, you know what?
If we can't agree on this,

387
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:31,282
we're not gonna get anything done.

388
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,407
Okay, it was more like this.

389
00:24:36,969 --> 00:24:38,960
It was here... here...

390
00:24:40,209 --> 00:24:43,918
...and our missing friends
were here.

391
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:48,488
- Phoebe?
- I see it, Piper.

392
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:50,008
What? What do you see?

393
00:25:00,329 --> 00:25:02,843
A pentagram, our lucky sign.

394
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:06,007
Actually, a pentagram
was a sign of good energy until

395
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:07,921
- your side stole it.
- Okay.

396
00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:10,643
Is it possible that the five of us,
by forming a pentagram,

397
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,528
somehow created
some weird, magical energy field?

398
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:16,163
With Prue and your friend
in the middle.

399
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:17,523
There must've been a vortex.

400
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:20,529
Okay, if we could figure out
how we opened it,

401
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:22,520
maybe we could figure out
how to open it again.

402
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25,278
- And release them.
- And who knows what else.

403
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,088
This is good, keep it up.

404
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:30,967
I'll check things back at the office.

405
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,642
Page me when you have the answer.

406
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:35,201
Ladies.

407
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:40,397
I'm leaving too.

408
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:45,485
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna follow this guy back

409
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:47,401
and find out who he is.

410
00:25:48,969 --> 00:25:50,368
What is he?

411
00:25:51,689 --> 00:25:53,122
He is none of your business.

412
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:56,838
Okay, since this is supposed to be a
joint effort, what is your contribution?

413
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:00,126
Perhaps it was the combination
of our chants that opened this vortex.

414
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:02,120
What language
were you chanting in?

415
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:04,041
Actually, it's a dead language

416
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:06,643
that we sometimes use
for ceremonial purposes.

417
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,798
How festive.

418
00:26:09,449 --> 00:26:11,565
I'll tell you mine, if you tell me yours.

419
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:14,248
Okay, while you two do that,

420
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:16,684
I'll go remake the potion
because we're going to need it.

421
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:19,244
- Mind if I watch?
- Yes, I do.

422
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:28,526
Perhaps the largest peacetime
loss of life...

423
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:33,480
Put the military in control
of the government...

424
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:36,637
Who the hell are you and what...?

425
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:42,637
Sir.

426
00:26:45,489 --> 00:26:50,165
It's your standard chant
to destroy the common witch.

427
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:53,082
Clearly, you're
no common witch, though.

428
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:57,607
Thank you.

429
00:26:58,689 --> 00:27:00,520
Okay, the first line.

430
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:02,407
I'll interpret.

431
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:06,841
"I call you, servants of the unholy,"
and then...

432
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:08,681
Now...

433
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:11,728
...being a bad guy and all,

434
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:13,925
you wouldn't happen to be
lying to me, would you?

435
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:18,562
Well, being a bad guy and all,

436
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:21,766
would you believe me
if I told you no?

437
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:34,278
I don't like these numbers at all. I gave
specific instructions to spread cholera,

438
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,445
especially in Central Asia.
What happened?

439
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:38,203
I'm asking you a question.

440
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:40,803
If somebody is vaccinating
these people, I wanna know about it.

441
00:27:40,969 --> 00:27:42,607
Find out. Now.

442
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:48,160
The smallpox outbreak in Venezuela,
let it spread.

443
00:28:01,969 --> 00:28:05,166
- What is that? Tattoo?
- Yes.

444
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:10,678
- What does it mean?
- Nothing. It goes with the job.

445
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:13,684
What are you doing?

446
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:17,888
I am re-creating the potion I made
for our first meeting.

447
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:20,279
I think it might help get Prue and...

448
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:22,559
- Our friend.
...back.

449
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:25,842
So, what are you four up to?

450
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,761
You really expect me to answer that?

451
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:29,487
We're supposed to be
working together,

452
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:31,645
and we don't know anything
about each other.

453
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,168
I know you're a witch.

454
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:34,643
- And you are?
- Not.

455
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:38,404
Look, we just want our partner back.
That's all you need to know.

456
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:40,446
It's all business, just like it is for you.

457
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:43,563
No, she's our sister,
it's completely personal.

458
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:46,284
Every mortal's weakness.

459
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:48,804
That's why you always lose.

460
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:56,087
So this is great.
We both did spells at the same time,

461
00:28:56,249 --> 00:28:59,559
but we did it on the wrong people.
So I think that we...

462
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:03,397
Am I the only one
that's working here?

463
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:04,968
Have you always been a witch?

464
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,001
What? Why?

465
00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:10,003
I don't know, something about you.

466
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:11,397
You ever been a demon?

467
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:14,440
I think we need to get back
to our chants.

468
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:16,721
Meaning yes?

469
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:19,562
No. I have never been a demon.

470
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:22,081
- You know, we're not that different.
- No.

471
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:26,399
We're both trying
to undo the other side.

472
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:29,087
A worthy challenge.

473
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:33,002
I think I figured out...

474
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:36,277
...how good and evil mix together.

475
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:38,840
To such powerful results.

476
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:41,408
I know how to undo that.

477
00:29:55,969 --> 00:29:57,197
You all right?

478
00:29:57,889 --> 00:29:59,242
No.

479
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:01,163
I'm a bit queasy.

480
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,248
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

481
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:38,398
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything. What did you do?

482
00:30:42,969 --> 00:30:44,641
- What happened?
- Hard to say.

483
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:46,999
- Are you all right?
- I'm not sure.

484
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,487
So do you have an answer yet?

485
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:53,642
Reverse polarity.

486
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:56,643
- In the pentagram.
- And in the chants.

487
00:30:56,849 --> 00:31:00,524
If we stand in the opposite points and
say the opposite words in the chant,

488
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,202
"save" instead of
"vanquish" and so on...

489
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:06,328
That will reopen the vortex,
we will get them back,

490
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,207
then we can get back to business.

491
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:10,602
And we could get on with our lives.

492
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:13,357
It's 6:00 now.

493
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:16,487
So why don't we go back
to the office, get organized,

494
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:18,526
and we can all meet up
at 6:30 sharp?

495
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:24,248
We... We have
an appointment at 7, so...

496
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:28,848
Okay, what really happened?

497
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:30,960
It was Prue. She was trying
to spell something out

498
00:31:31,129 --> 00:31:33,962
on the spirit board,
but all I got was "four, H, O."

499
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:37,599
Four, H, O.

500
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:39,408
Four hours?

501
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:42,563
Maybe she feels that's
all the time she has left.

502
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:52,319
Rescue facilities are
up to capacity,

503
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:55,686
overflow victims
seek shelter in the streets.

504
00:31:55,889 --> 00:31:59,006
Dysentery and diphtheria
take their toll.

505
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:08,243
It can't be.

506
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:12,477
Security breach. Grab him.

507
00:32:19,249 --> 00:32:22,446
Never mind him, keep working.
We're running out of time.

508
00:32:25,249 --> 00:32:28,047
Are you sure they're willing
to do their half?

509
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:31,645
They seem to want this
as badly as we do.

510
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:36,362
Great, you're here.

511
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:38,724
We're done.
We have everything figured out.

512
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:39,958
You sure?

513
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:42,404
Leo, what are you wearing?
Where have you been?

514
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:45,288
I just followed the black tie
back to his office.

515
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:47,242
Leo, they'll think we don't trust them.

516
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:50,402
And you shouldn't trust them, Piper.

517
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,525
You wanna know who they are?

518
00:32:52,689 --> 00:32:55,567
They are the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

519
00:32:56,129 --> 00:32:57,847
The Four Hor...

520
00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:00,604
That's what Prue
was trying to tell us.

521
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:02,842
Don't you understand
what's at stake?

522
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:05,165
If you save Prue, you will release
the fourth Horseman

523
00:33:05,329 --> 00:33:06,887
and bring about the end of the world.

524
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:18,521
I don't believe you.

525
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:19,963
Leo, it doesn't change anything.

526
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:23,405
We would help the Source himself
if we thought we could get Prue back.

527
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:28,199
Listen, they wear the mark
of the Anointed Ones.

528
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:30,837
The omega. It means the end.

529
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,204
- The tattoo on the neck?
- Yes.

530
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:35,240
The missing Horseman is War.

531
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:38,640
You've been dealing with Strife,
Famine and Death.

532
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:41,409
They're gonna begin the apocalypse
as soon as they're reunited.

533
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:44,129
I thought dodging the Y2K bullet
bought us more time

534
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,678
on the whole apocalypse thing.

535
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:49,363
You know why nothing happened
on New Year's Eve?

536
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:51,880
Because it wasn't
the real millennium.

537
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:54,319
The monks who converted
the Julian calendar

538
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:57,128
to the Gregorian calendar
made some critical errors.

539
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:59,320
So when does
the new millennium start?

540
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:01,804
- Tonight, approximately at...
- Seven o'clock.

541
00:34:02,449 --> 00:34:04,758
Which is probably why
they wanna meet us at 6:30.

542
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,962
Right, then all four Horsemen can be
in place to begin the apocalypse.

543
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,926
You cannot let that happen.

544
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:12,563
- Leo, we know what we're doing.
- No, you don't.

545
00:34:12,769 --> 00:34:15,602
You're thinking like sisters,
mortal sisters.

546
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:17,361
Well, what are we
supposed to think like?

547
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:19,640
Like the Charmed Ones.

548
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,317
- You have a duty.
- To save our sister.

549
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:25,362
Look, Leo, we've made up our mind.
We're gonna save Prue.

550
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:27,760
It's not like we could
beat them without her.

551
00:34:28,529 --> 00:34:30,884
Look, only the Source
can vanquish them, Phoebe.

552
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:32,841
For failing.

553
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:35,239
Think of the times the world
has been on the brink.

554
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:38,048
You know, Hitler,
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

555
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:41,800
Each time, a team of Horsemen
has almost succeeded.

556
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:46,087
And then failed and been destroyed
and replaced by a new team.

557
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:49,159
So then we'll make sure
that they fail too.

558
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:51,485
They are closer than any team
has ever been.

559
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:55,884
Then we obviously need Prue
to beat them.

560
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:58,045
Oh, my God. You have not heard
a thing I've said.

561
00:35:00,729 --> 00:35:01,957
Look...

562
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:04,401
...I love Prue too.

563
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,127
You know that.

564
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:08,849
But just like when you went to
the future, you saw that sometimes

565
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:11,569
there are more important things
than saving your sister.

566
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:21,162
Give it up.
If War's not back soon, we're history.

567
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,485
The Source is going to
burn us off the map.

568
00:35:23,649 --> 00:35:25,082
We are not going down alone.

569
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,520
Instead of just standing here, let's go
hunt those witches down and kill them.

570
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:31,886
I told you they'd double-cross us. It's
why they sent their man to spy on us.

571
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,159
We were doing research,
it's just good business.

572
00:35:35,409 --> 00:35:36,728
Let's just kill them now.

573
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:38,163
Oh, but you need us.

574
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:41,278
You can't end the world without us.

575
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,123
So you know who we are.

576
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:44,608
Yeah, and we came anyway.

577
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:46,885
See, on our side of things,
we call that "good faith."

578
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:49,603
Call it whatever you want,
let's just do it. Hurry.

579
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:52,124
- You ready?
- Bring it on.

580
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:01,557
Battle stations.

581
00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:03,403
What did you see?

582
00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:05,844
Let's just get this over with.

583
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:16,163
Sower of discord
Your help we implore

584
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:20,325
- Phoebe.
- Leo's right.

585
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:23,607
I saw what's gonna happen, Piper.
We can't do this. We can't be selfish.

586
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,848
Why aren't you two chanting?

587
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:30,322
You keep going. Why did you stop?

588
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:33,044
We're running out of time.

589
00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:35,723
Do you know what you're doing?
You're killing your own sister.

590
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:39,960
There's more at stake here
than sisterhood.

591
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,127
I'm finished. Did they finish?

592
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:47,757
No, and we're not going to.

593
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:50,881
We had a deal. We shook on it.

594
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:54,600
That was a mistake
in more ways than one.

595
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:56,248
We know what you want,

596
00:36:56,409 --> 00:36:58,639
and we're gonna make sure
you don't get it.

597
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:02,364
Even if that means
losing our sister forever.

598
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:06,646
Look.

599
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,283
They didn't finish their chant.
How can the vortex open?

600
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:11,002
The Source is opening it.

601
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:13,040
No!

602
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:19,125
- What are you doing?
- Well, the vortex is open.

603
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:22,167
If we finish it before they're destroyed,
maybe we could pull Prue out.

604
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,846
Listen to me now
With these words of truce

605
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:51,842
Prue, you all right?

606
00:37:52,009 --> 00:37:55,399
It's okay now,
everything's gonna be okay now.

607
00:37:55,729 --> 00:37:58,084
Thanks for saving my life.

608
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:22,601
Look at them. They'll all live to dance
another day, and what do we get?

609
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:24,168
We saved the whole darn world.

610
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:27,241
The least we could get
is a thank-you, you know.

611
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:29,801
- Ladies.
- Hey, Leo.

612
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:32,679
I know this has been
hard on all of you.

613
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:34,720
Yeah, well, we sort of made it
hard on you too.

614
00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:36,607
- Leo, it's just...
- It's okay, Piper,

615
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:38,885
we were just doing our job.

616
00:38:39,729 --> 00:38:43,358
Okay. The master of understatement.
Is there anything else?

617
00:38:44,009 --> 00:38:46,125
No, I was just at a meeting.

618
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:50,248
And they told me that it was
your act of complete selflessness

619
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:52,798
that stopped the Source's plan
from going forward.

620
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:55,441
So the Four Horsemen
were destroyed

621
00:38:55,609 --> 00:38:58,169
because Piper and Phoebe
were willing to sacrifice me?

622
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:02,039
The Horsemen's bosses
said it was a sign there was still

623
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:05,087
too much good in the world
to make the apocalypse successful.

624
00:39:05,249 --> 00:39:06,523
So are they giving up?

625
00:39:06,729 --> 00:39:09,801
No, in fact, they'll probably
try harder from now on.

626
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:13,645
Do you wanna have
a drink with us, Leo?

627
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,845
No, you need time together.

628
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:17,802
Just you three.

629
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:22,926
I'll see you.

630
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:28,841
You know, you two faced
an incredibly hard thing...

631
00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:32,604
...and you made the right decision,
of your own free will.

632
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:38,118
I am so, so, so sorry, Prue.

633
00:39:38,689 --> 00:39:42,807
- So am I.
- There's no apologies necessary.

634
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:47,884
We were all just doing our jobs.
I just have to deal with it.

635
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:51,008
Everyone has to vote on this.

636
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:52,648
What if the building is on fire.

637
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:55,482
Do you save five strangers
or one sibling?

638
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:57,288
Five strangers.
