1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,960
I think I'm gonna go up to bed.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,679
Oh, well, do you want
some company?

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,633
Well, I'm really tired.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,598
I think I just need to get some sleep.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,029
Good night, little one.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,793
I would be glad
to keep you company.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,953
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,632
I'm...

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,630
...sweeping you off your feet.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,279
No.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,192
I can't.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,710
All I see is you.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,596
No, Ryder, please.
This isn't right. I'm married.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,195
Not in your dreams, you're not.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,594
I could just hold you forever.

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,432
What...?

17
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,996
Where's my baby?

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,237
Where are you?

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,429
But wait, you haven't even
seen the baby yet.

20
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,478
What'd you expect?

21
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,471
They don't care about the kid.

22
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,154
Nobody does.

23
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,110
No, please don't.

24
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,909
Help me.

25
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,874
This is not a dream.

26
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,915
Leo, a hand here?

27
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,349
No, my hands are full.

28
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,589
The shower is in two days.

29
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,274
Your kid's not gonna be
opening cabinets for another year.

30
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,998
Well, tell that to Aunt Phoebe.

31
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,149
She gave me a book:

32
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,675
<i>One Thousand Unexpected
Dangers For Baby.</i>

33
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,075
Easy-opening cabinets, number 32.

34
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,191
All right, you leave me no choice.

35
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,237
Streamer.

36
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,113
Magic for personal gain.

37
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,396
It's not for me, it's for my niece.

38
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,633
Besides, I seem to be the only aunt
who cares about this shower.

39
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,631
Phoebe cares,
she's just preoccupied.

40
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,789
Oh, really?

41
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,872
I'd say she skipped straight from
preoccupied to paranoid.

42
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,029
You're exaggerating.

43
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,236
Am I?
Yesterday, a balloon exploded,

44
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,311
and she stormed down here
with a vanquishing potion.

45
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,914
She almost blew up old Slappy here.

46
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,957
I think it's the recurring nightmare
she's having.

47
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,678
It's just making her a little jumpy.

48
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,269
Really? God, you'd think
with a Cole-free future

49
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,237
she'd be dreaming nothing
but happy, happy.

50
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,589
- You'd think.
- Yeah.

51
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,671
If I let my recurring dreams
affect my waking life,

52
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,355
I'd never get out of bed, much less
throw a fabulous shower like this.

53
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,033
Why not?

54
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,670
I don't know. I've been having
this recurring dream lately,

55
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,559
and I'm at P3,

56
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,632
and as soon as I get up
to the baby,

57
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,560
everybody just disappears.

58
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,790
It sounds like you and me
have baby on the brain.

59
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,076
All I can think of lately
is just holding her.

60
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,676
Where is the man of my dreams?

61
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,000
Speaking of my little one.

62
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,034
Well, all right.

63
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,590
Beth Orton is playing at the club,
I guess I'll get back to work.

64
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,395
Hey, you notice anything?

65
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,989
I have noticed that
subtlety is not your forte.

66
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,151
- You don't like it?
- Well, I liked it.

67
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,880
You know, 15 streamers
and 20 balloons ago.

68
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,310
Nothing is too good
for my future niece.

69
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,357
Clearly.

70
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,591
I am so gonna be a soccer mom.

71
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,711
This kid has one mean kick.

72
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,313
Well, I want to feel it kick.

73
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,914
Well, honey, unless you're
a bladder or kidney,

74
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,992
you're not gonna feel it,
because she's kicking the inside.

75
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,556
- Never get to feel her kick.
- Count your blessings.

76
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,835
I'm being summoned.

77
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,072
- Is it the Elders?
- No, it's not the Elders.

78
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,071
It's Phoebe.

79
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,869
What is it?

80
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,190
Leo, do not
sneak up on me like that.

81
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,510
I wasn't sneaking.
And you called me.

82
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,796
Oh, yeah, right.

83
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,996
Okay, what do you know
about Tracer demons?

84
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,593
Lower level, mercenaries,

85
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,115
able to track magical beings
through different dimensions. Why?

86
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,794
Because one was
in my dream last night, that's why.

87
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,997
- The guy behind the mask?
- No.

88
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,357
This one wasn't the chain-saw guy.
He's still a mystery to me.

89
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,511
It was something weirder.

90
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,193
Different.

91
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,756
I was running away from him
in the basement, right, that same guy,

92
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,115
and then, all of a sudden,
I was in the woods,

93
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,474
where I used to camp.

94
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,552
- You were in the past?
- No, it was the present.

95
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,075
And there was this weird creature
standing there

96
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,912
holding some kind of satchel.

97
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,399
And then the demon killed him.

98
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,755
Sounds like your recurring dream
is getting complicated.

99
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,478
Yeah, except I think it was
a premonition.

100
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,789
A premonition during a dream?

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,230
Yeah, why not?
It's happened before.

102
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,080
Phoebe, you've probably flipped
past this drawing a hundred times,

103
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,595
and you said the camp was from
your childhood, so chances are...

104
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,712
Leo, I know
what a premonition feels like.

105
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,189
Okay, besides, when I woke up,

106
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,032
the creature was standing
in my bedroom,

107
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,349
begging me to help him.

108
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,519
- You sure you weren't still dreaming?
- He said I wasn't.

109
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,591
<i>And then when I found
the Tracer demon in the Book,</i>

110
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,988
I was sure I wasn't either.

111
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,349
What would you like me to do?

112
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,954
Go to the Elders.
Find out if it really was a premonition.

113
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,430
Because if it was,
I have an innocent to save.

114
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,120
A precious night gone by,

115
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,678
and you come back empty-handed.

116
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,909
- Yeah, but don't worry, I'll get him.
- Oh, it's not me that has to worry.

117
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,472
It's you.

118
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,194
You're the only demon
that's failed me.

119
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,998
Everyone else has found their mark.

120
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,558
I'll get him tonight, I promise.

121
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,837
I mean, he's easy to find.

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,150
He watches over
the same people, right?

123
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,989
I'll need proof.

124
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,276
Yeah, sure, I'll get it. Yeah.

125
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,996
Although, just out of curiosity,

126
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,431
what is it you do with that stuff?

127
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,318
Dream?

128
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,789
Demons don't dream.

129
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,433
But with each one of these I collect,

130
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,799
it means more humans won't either.

131
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,749
And without dreams,

132
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,515
humans can't work through
their issues while they sleep.

133
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,069
Which means those issues
spill out into their waking life,

134
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,796
turning them angry, evil.

135
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,076
Still don't understand
what you get out of it.

136
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,990
Not like it's any of my business,
of course, but...

137
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,156
I get respect from the leaders
of the Underworld.

138
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,754
And, hopefully,
rewarded because of it.

139
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,475
But if you fail me,

140
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,948
I fail them.

141
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,911
Understand?

142
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,791
Perfectly.

143
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,958
Okay, people, let's begin.

144
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
Bill, nice job on that
hostage-standoff piece yesterday.

145
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,910
- Thanks.
- There's another one for you today.

146
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,230
State bank in North Beach.
Shots fired. Go.

147
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,799
Wow, that's the third time this week.

148
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,195
Some of you guys
are gonna have to double up.

149
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,955
Angry man ploughs into
farmers' market in his car.

150
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,475
Angry woman attacks
school principal with a knife.

151
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,914
And in sports,

152
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,072
angry coach knocks out umpire
with a baseball bat.

153
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,798
What the hell is going on out there?

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,116
The city is going to pot,
that's what's going on.

155
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,555
Bad news for the city,
good news for circulation.

156
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,035
It's strange,
even my readers seem angrier.

157
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,078
They keep asking for advice
on how to deal with their tempers.

158
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,071
Hey, what are you doing?

159
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,832
That's Metro,
that makes it my story!

160
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,399
It's mine, she gave it to me!

161
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,073
Hey, hey, stop it right now!

162
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,469
Sorry to interrupt...

163
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,474
...but I've got Paige on the phone.
You want me to take a message?

164
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,757
No. No, I want to talk to her.

165
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,632
That's my story.

166
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,435
- Hey.
- Hey, I can't decide on a place setting.

167
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,875
It's either "baby in the clouds,"

168
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,190
<i>which is a little baby
Floating on a cloud,</i>

169
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,638
or "cozy bug,"
a baby bumblebee on a pink flower.

170
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,472
Oh, no, Piper's allergic
to bees, remember?

171
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,789
You're right.
Thank you so much.

172
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,518
<i>Is that the only reason
you were calling?</i>

173
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,194
<i>- Yeah, why?
- Have you been watching the news?</i>

174
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,430
It just seems that everyone's
at each other's throats.

175
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,749
I mean, even here.

176
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,990
<i>Have you noticed anything weird?</i>

177
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,435
Back it up, lady!

178
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,919
You know, now that you mention it,

179
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,789
I have seen my share of a certain
finger while driving over here.

180
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,394
See, I think something's up.
Something evil, maybe.

181
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,790
Phoebe, seriously, I think
you might need to get some help.

182
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,474
You think danger
is lurking around every corner.

183
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,837
- Come on, lady!
- Lady, it's my spot.

184
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,309
Besides, everybody is odd
in San Francisco.

185
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,595
That's why we fit in so well.

186
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,830
Look, I know
I've been jumpy lately,

187
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,877
and I'm really trying to deal with it.

188
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,713
But just because
I've been a bit neurotic maybe,

189
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,279
that doesn't mean that I'm not right.

190
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,359
Hey, move it or lose it, lady!
I want this space!

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,150
Maybe you are right.

192
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,111
<i>I never stopped loving you, Ryder.</i>

193
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,834
<i>You know that, don't you?</i>

194
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,718
<i>I just never thought
I'd see you again, Sienna.</i>

195
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,559
<i>Not after the yacht explosion.</i>

196
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,109
And he's standing over me,
telling me I'm not dreaming.

197
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,352
Well, I think you're crazy.

198
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,511
What, now you think
this is connected to your dream?

199
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,159
Or the premonition in my dream.

200
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,432
It would be a really big coincidence
if it wasn't, don't you think?

201
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,431
I've been waiting for this
for weeks, people.

202
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,510
No, don't do that.
They were just getting to the good part.

203
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,955
Well, rent the video.
We have work that we have to do.

204
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,829
- It is not a video, it is a soap.
- Leo!

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,356
Phoebe thinks that a demon
is causing some anger epidemic.

206
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,549
Give me that remote.

207
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,194
- Give it.
- See?

208
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,839
See, point positive. Here.

209
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,229
- Hey, anything?
- Based on what the Elders said,

210
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,356
I think that your dream premonition
is very real.

211
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,795
- Meaning so is the Tracer demon.
- What Tracer demon?

212
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,269
And what about the creature?
Do they know about the creature?

213
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,429
What creature?

214
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,352
Well, they think
that it's a weird assomnio.

215
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,471
If that's the case,
you definitely need to save him.

216
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,835
- A weirdo what?
- Weird assomnio.

217
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,039
It's the original Latin term
for a sandman.

218
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,188
Wait a minute, like,
"Sandman, bring me a dream"?

219
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,715
One and the same.
Only there isn't just one sandman.

220
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,836
There are many of them, like angels.

221
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,151
They visit good beings
during their sleep,

222
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,039
sprinkle them with dream dust
so they can dream.

223
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,272
I can't believe they exist.

224
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,670
Not that I should be surprised.

225
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,912
Yeah, but they don't know
what we dream about, do they?

226
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,548
I mean that's all confidential,
clearly, isn't it?

227
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,156
I don't know. But I do know
that they exist on a different plane,

228
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,719
which means
the only way to find one...

229
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,713
Would be for a Tracer demon
to bring him into our plane.

230
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,757
- And kill him.
- Great.

231
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,237
I don't get it. Why would a demon be
interested in killing people's dreams?

232
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,273
I mean, they're just
harmless erotic fun.

233
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,476
Did you say "erotic"?

234
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,954
Exotic. I said "exotic."

235
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,990
I don't get exotic dreams.
I just get disturbing ones.

236
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,513
Mine are just scary.

237
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,432
But that's how
you work through stuff, right?

238
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,039
- In your dreams?
- So?

239
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,832
So I think that's why
everyone's been crazy.

240
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,871
They're not dealing with
their subconscious issues

241
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,155
while they're dreaming.

242
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,834
I think I got some issues to work out.

243
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,876
You said your premonition took place
somewhere where you used to camp?

244
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,553
Yeah. North State Campgrounds.

245
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,435
Well, all right, let's go.

246
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,033
And save our dreams.

247
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,430
Oh, Piper, maybe you should
sit this one out.

248
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,631
Why? Don't you need me
to vanquish the demon?

249
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,028
No, I'll make a potion.

250
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,231
It's just you're not moving as swiftly
as you used to,

251
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,630
- and we might have to run.
- But...

252
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,470
Fine. Do it yourself.

253
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,514
<i>It's been so long.</i>

254
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,989
<i>But I never Forgot what it Feels like
to be in your arms.</i>

255
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,833
Oh, I missed it!

256
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,428
Did you really think
I wouldn't come back for you?

257
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,915
Actually, I was counting on it.

258
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,557
Witches.

259
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,913
Who the hell is that?

260
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,917
I'm sorry, I'm just so surprised
that you're real.

261
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,551
Okay, this should keep
our brains going on zero sleep.

262
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,635
Do sandmen even sleep?

263
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,870
Only when our charges
are all awake.

264
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,158
Oh, so basically never.

265
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,639
Okay, can we focus here?

266
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,314
Because we have a demon to
vanquish and a nightmare to deal with.

267
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,436
And a baby shower to get to.

268
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,352
What? I'm just saying.

269
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,080
Any idea how Phoebe's nightmare
came to life?

270
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,708
Well, no.
It's never happened before.

271
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,199
But then, no one's ever been hit with
that much dream dust before either.

272
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,918
So you think,
since she OD'd on the stuff,

273
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,759
he just popped out of her head?

274
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,911
Out of her unconscious.

275
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,873
But now that he's out,
he's obviously very real.

276
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,156
Okay, does that mean
he's gonna keep trying to kill me?

277
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,750
If that's what he tries to do
in your dreams, yes.

278
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,151
Great. That's just great.
I need to think about this.

279
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,999
So we need to hurry up
and find a way to put him back

280
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,913
before any of our other dreams
spring to life, shall we?

281
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,076
- Dreams like what?
- Never mind.

282
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,959
First, though, I think we need
to stop the Tracer demon

283
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,958
before this whole city turns into
one huge nightmare, don't you think?

284
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,919
Yes, but it's more than one Tracer
you have to worry about.

285
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,593
There are others
out there killing us.

286
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,600
Which means it must be
an upper-level demon behind them

287
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,239
orchestrating the attacks.

288
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,913
Okay, so we write
a summoning spell,

289
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,389
and we get the Tracer here,
we freeze him, force him to talk,

290
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,039
we'll vanquish him and his boss,

291
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,636
and then the sandman can go back to
keeping dreams where they belong.

292
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,791
Very impressive, and very fast.

293
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,870
What are we supposed to do
about my chain-saw killer?

294
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,029
Oh, don't worry about him.

295
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,038
We'll blow him up
before he lays a blade on you.

296
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,429
Who is that?

297
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,750
That must be Becca and Wendy
with the hors d'oeuvre trays.

298
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,876
You're not against parsley,
are you?

299
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,110
- Get rid of them?
- No, I will not get rid of them.

300
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,077
If I get rid of them,
I have to stop the shower,

301
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,396
- and I'm not doing that.
- All right, easy, easy.

302
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,595
We'll go take care of them,

303
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,159
you guys go start
the summoning spell.

304
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,673
Go, go.

305
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,271
Oh, thank you, mother.

306
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,029
Come on.

307
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,030
- Witches? You lost him to witches?
- Just let me speak.

308
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,670
- Do they know about me?
- No, I swear.

309
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,349
I can get to the sandman
before they ever do.

310
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,033
I'm listening.

311
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,992
One of the witches,

312
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,390
she got hit
with too much dream dust.

313
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,595
So?

314
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,274
No, wait.

315
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,637
Sorry. I assure you,
he's no threat to us.

316
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,155
Only to the witch
who dreamed him up.

317
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,156
You got his attention.
You can turn that off now.

318
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,474
That right there
is her worst nightmare, literally.

319
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,315
And since she's scared
to death of him, I'm thinking...

320
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,949
...if I could borrow
a few of these satchels here,

321
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,317
I might be able to make the other
witches' dreams come to life too.

322
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,757
And how is this supposed to help you
fulfil your obligation to me?

323
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,230
It'll distract them long enough for me
to kill my mark and collect my bounty.

324
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,551
I better take a couple extra,
just in case.

325
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,592
Excuse me.

326
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,429
This better work.

327
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,794
Otherwise, I'm gonna be
your worst nightmare.

328
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,511
Paige, that's enough.
I want them gone.

329
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,989
Just relax, Piper.

330
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,196
The trunk is officially empty.

331
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,549
Great, so we're done.

332
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,597
No way.
There's the whole back seat.

333
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,789
Oh, you're kidding, right?

334
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,992
Hey, Paige is the one who sent us
around to five different stores.

335
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,273
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, don't look in these bags, Piper.

336
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,954
You're not supposed to see
the door prizes.

337
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,155
Hey, Becca, I thought
we nixed the clown idea.

338
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,995
Oh, no, relax. That's just
one of Paige's old toys, Slappy.

339
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,594
- Good, because clowns are creepy.
- Especially that one.

340
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,074
Don't let Paige hear you say that.

341
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,877
- That's better.
- Okay, well, thanks, guys.

342
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,076
You know, thanks for everything.
You should really go.

343
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,674
And we'll call you
if we need any more stuff.

344
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,434
Go? Paige wanted us to do all of this
before the baby shower.

345
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,589
Yeah, I know.

346
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,394
But I'm the one that's pregnant,
and I think we've reached our limit.

347
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,198
In fact, we've gone over it.
Way over it.

348
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,391
That's all those crazy
hormones talking.

349
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,068
Maybe you should lie down
and let us take over.

350
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,151
No, no, I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

351
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,993
The only crazy thing around here
is the shower mania.

352
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,594
Especially when
we should be focusing on the de...

353
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,153
Details, details.

354
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,912
Like what are we gonna wear
and stuff.

355
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,273
Frankly, Piper,
I'm surprised at your attitude.

356
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,919
This is all for you.

357
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,229
Oh, I know, and I'm thrilled.

358
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,391
But right now,
I just need a little peace and quiet.

359
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,034
You know, pregnant woman's
prerogative and all.

360
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,031
- If you say so.
- I do.

361
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,078
Yeah, okay, thanks.

362
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,359
It's just a stupid summoning spell.

363
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,033
I don't know why
I can't come up with it.

364
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,872
You need to relax.
It'll come to you.

365
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,430
You know, maybe it's because
I'm not so sure this is a good idea.

366
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,592
I mean, what if I bring
the Tracer demon here,

367
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,273
and it just makes matters worse?

368
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,749
I mean, what then?
He has surprised us before.

369
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,672
But that was just luck.

370
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,400
He didn't know
your dream would come to life.

371
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,154
Well, it did. And unfortunately,
that's all I can think about.

372
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,197
Maybe if you can stop
and figure out what it means,

373
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,992
you won't be afraid of it anymore.

374
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,630
Leo, don't you think if I could do that
I would have done it by now?

375
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,833
I vanquish demons every day,
real ones.

376
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,275
So some guy from my dream
should be a piece of cake,

377
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,914
even with power tools.

378
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,479
So why do I run from him?

379
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,273
- Do you know why?
- No.

380
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,473
I may be made of dreams,
but I don't shape them.

381
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,393
Perhaps, if you can figure out
who was behind the mask.

382
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,634
Characters in dreams symbolize
something specific in one's life.

383
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,873
A special person,
a certain feeling or pain.

384
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,077
Unmask that, demystify it,

385
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,629
and the character goes away.

386
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,309
I don't even know
where to begin with that.

387
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,472
My life is so great now.

388
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,074
My marriage from hell is behind me.

389
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,470
I don't know why
I would start having nightmares now.

390
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,076
Only you can answer that, my dear.

391
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,513
In your dreams.

392
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,076
Not to sound unappreciative,
but this is kind of overkill.

393
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,355
No, this is perfect.

394
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,829
Nothing is too good
for my future niece.

395
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,878
Okay, but Paige, this is supposed
to be a shower, not a coronation.

396
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,229
Hey, it is not every day

397
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,675
that a half-whitelighter, half-witch
is born into this world.

398
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,074
We need to celebrate her.

399
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,710
Okay, but "her"
is not even gonna be here.

400
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,197
Except for the occasional
kidney shot.

401
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,273
Which makes me wonder if maybe this
is a little bit more about you than her.

402
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,193
- Where are your friends?
- Gone but not forgotten.

403
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,237
- Are they coming back?
- Not till the shower, why?

404
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,197
Phoebe is almost done
with the summoning spell,

405
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,349
so we need to get ready.

406
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,993
You mean for me?

407
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,630
Oh, no.

408
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,629
My love.

409
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,631
No. How did you get here?

410
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,119
Go away.

411
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,316
No, shoo, go away!

412
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,552
Who are you talking to?

413
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,914
What's the matter?

414
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,316
Don't you recognize me, honey?

415
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,994
It's Slappy!

416
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,317
- Where's my baby?
- Over here.

417
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,475
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

418
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,153
Oh, my God.

419
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,557
- That didn't sound good.
- Paige! Piper!

420
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,319
It's no use.
You can't fight your own dreams.

421
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,754
You wanna bet?

422
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,754
Would Freud
have a field day with this or what?

423
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,717
Phoebe, are you all right?

424
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,069
Sweet dreams.

425
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,029
Phoebe?

426
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,994
- What's taking so long?
- I don't know.

427
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,632
He has the same wound?

428
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,554
What happened?

429
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,274
We're not sure.
Did you cage Chuckles?

430
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,317
Slappy.
And, yeah, your guy too.

431
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,549
About that guy...

432
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,076
A little less bitching,
a little more healing, please.

433
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,438
- Easy. Easy. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

434
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,273
- Holy cow, are you okay?
- Yeah.

435
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,637
We all got hit
by the dream dust, Pheebs.

436
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,995
Hey, where's the sandman?

437
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,509
Oh, no.

438
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,956
- How did he get healed?
- Same way I did, I guess.

439
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,630
- Let's see if he can heal this.
- No, you can't kill him.

440
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,631
You kill him, you kill me.

441
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,195
Run. We'll follow you.
We'll meet in the conservatory.

442
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,994
- Do what?
- She's right, trust her. Come on.

443
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,358
- Who's the clown?
- Who's the fox?

444
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,589
- Don't ask.
- Good question.

445
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,753
I'm Piper's dream lover.

446
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,031
No, listen, listen.
We've never slept together.

447
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,350
I mean, in the dream-world place.

448
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,397
Maybe you guys should take this
in the other room.

449
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,318
Good idea.

450
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,072
Paige.

451
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,511
Pretty lame, don't you think?

452
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,908
All the decorations?

453
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,789
The partygoers will still disappear.

454
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,873
I got her number.

455
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,999
This is all crazy.

456
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,429
What are we gonna do?

457
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,478
Well, I made a promise
to the sandman,

458
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,629
and I'm gonna keep it.

459
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,315
Okay, so we stick to the original plan.
We get the Tracer back here...

460
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,879
Yeah, that's real smart, Piper.

461
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,508
Anything happens to your dream guy
out there, and you're dead.

462
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,274
I realize that.
And ease up, will you?

463
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,793
You're upsetting the baby.

464
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,399
He's right, though.

465
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,192
Which means Tracer demon's
gonna come back.

466
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,999
So we gotta figure out what to do,
quickly. Any ideas?

467
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,317
What if we cast a sleeping spell
and deal with them in our dreams?

468
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,469
Come again?

469
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,154
Well, the sandman said
if we demystify them

470
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,834
and we learn to understand them,
then they'll just go away.

471
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,356
Yeah. It doesn't take a shrink
to figure out Piper's dreams.

472
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,272
You want to screw somebody else.

473
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,194
Well, at least he makes me feel sexy
and not like some walking incubator.

474
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,595
Although I guess that's what
you've been dreaming about.

475
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,352
Hey, guys, maybe not the time.

476
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,239
No, this is good. The more we know,
the better chance we have.

477
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,073
Well, I don't know what in the hell
the clown means.

478
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,998
Well, it's gotta mean something.

479
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,158
Look, all I know is, in my dream
I try to give the clown to the baby,

480
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,356
then everybody at the shower
just walks away,

481
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,830
and I'm just left feeling empty.

482
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,036
Okay, well, you have
to find out what that is.

483
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,599
You know, follow through with it.

484
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,432
Give the baby the clown
and see what happens.

485
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,068
And you, you need
to follow through too, missy.

486
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,077
You've created this dream guy
to satisfy you,

487
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,639
so maybe you should let him.

488
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,358
- What?
- Sorry.

489
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,193
Relax, dude.
Women dream all the time.

490
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,233
Yeah.

491
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,392
Well, Miss Phoebe,
who's the killer behind the mask?

492
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,471
Isn't it obvious? It's gotta be Cole.

493
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,079
Why Cole? You're over him.

494
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,878
Well, in my waking state, yes.

495
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,310
But apparently, not in
my subconscious.

496
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,799
What about me?

497
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,758
Honey, we got our own dreams
to deal with and the Tracer.

498
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,275
We'll deal with
your Mr. Mom issues later.

499
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,357
We need you to protect us
when we go under

500
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,590
in case the Tracer demon attacks.

501
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,273
Will you guys work
on the sleeping spell?

502
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,596
- All over it.
- Okay.

503
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,512
- Where are you going?
- To get some dream dust.

504
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,114
That's what the sandman
was made of.

505
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,109
Come on, sis, let's go.

506
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,478
What are you doing here?

507
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,879
You got your bounty, didn't you?

508
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,031
Yes, I did.

509
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,352
But I've been thinking about your plan
to impress the Underworld leaders.

510
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,314
I think there's a better way to do that.

511
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,670
- Really?
- Yeah.

512
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,154
I mean, killing a sandman is fine,

513
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,869
but wouldn't, say, killing the
Charmed Ones be more impressive?

514
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,910
If it could be done,
it would've been done by now.

515
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,028
I know, that's why I didn't show up
to take out their sandman

516
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,953
until at least one of them
was down.

517
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,237
That started me thinking.

518
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,193
With their dreams out and about,

519
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,874
maybe they're more vulnerable now
than they've ever been.

520
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,394
Maybe it's time to go for it,
really impress the leaders.

521
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,433
All right,
what do you need from me?

522
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,914
I need you out of my way.

523
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,591
Please.

524
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,155
Let me hold you.

525
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,633
I just want to hold you, baby.

526
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,838
There.

527
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,511
I've got you.

528
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,390
Leo, wake up. Snap out of it.

529
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,749
Okay, just don't use too much.

530
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,638
We don't want any more problems
coming to life.

531
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,435
Are you sure it's okay to go to sleep
with the Tracer demon still out there?

532
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,912
Piper, I need you. I want you.

533
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,993
Come on, Paige, let's party!

534
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,037
<i>Come on now, get uptown</i>

535
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,829
Let's get this over with.

536
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,231
Okay, everybody know
what they need to do?

537
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,029
Yep, I need to find out
why I feel so empty.

538
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,760
And I need to give
in to my desire and...

539
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,478
That's enough. Phoebe?

540
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,030
I need to find the courage
to kick my killer's ass.

541
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,832
Ready?

542
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,197
<i>Let we who waken From our sleep
Return at once to slumber deep</i>

543
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,990
I know you're down here.

544
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,230
You always are.

545
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,594
I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid!

546
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,909
But wait, you haven't even
seen the baby yet.

547
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,636
But you should.

548
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,518
That's why you're here, isn't it?

549
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,112
Go ahead, take a peek.

550
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,590
Paige, you okay?

551
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,633
The baby in the cradle was me.

552
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,991
Nobody was allowed
to celebrate my birth

553
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,958
because it had to be kept a secret.

554
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,035
Guess that's why I was trying
to make up for it with your baby.

555
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,156
It'll be different for her.

556
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,353
But first, we need to get
her mommy back.

557
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,634
Ryder, please, this isn't right.
I'm married.

558
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,195
Not in your dreams, you're not.

559
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,555
Don't be afraid.
You know you want to.

560
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,152
- What happened? Where did he go?
- Nowhere.

561
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,030
He was right here all along.

562
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,832
I was dreaming about you.

563
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,355
About us.

564
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,317
The way we used to be.

565
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,879
And I don't want that to change

566
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,510
just because we're married
and having a baby.

567
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,948
It won't.

568
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,797
Guys?

569
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,916
Phoebe's not looking so hot.

570
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,839
Come on, Phoebe.

571
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,389
You can do this. It's now or never.

572
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,793
Phoebe?

573
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,235
Honey, what's happening?

574
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,711
Don't let them in!

575
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,992
This is not gonna hold them off.

576
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,511
Phoebe, will you deal
with your issues already?

577
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,193
Yelling at her
is not gonna help!

578
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,919
All right, that's enough.

579
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,638
Don't. You kill them, you kill Phoebe.

580
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,268
Then what the hell
are we gonna do?

581
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,718
What am I supposed to do
to make them go away?

582
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,794
Unmask them and he goes away.

583
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,119
That's it.

584
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,831
Oh, my God.

585
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,197
Phoebe, hurry up.

586
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,189
Where'd they go?

587
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,069
You did it, you kicked his ass.

588
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,559
No, actually, I didn't.

589
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,430
I just unmasked him,
or me, rather.

590
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,876
You? The killer was you?

591
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,310
Yeah. How narcissistic is that?

592
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,549
That's weird.

593
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,711
I thought my clown was strange.

594
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,440
- What happened in here?
- Nothing much.

595
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,114
We've just been protecting you
from, apparently, you.

596
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,994
Wait a minute, I don't get it.

597
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,355
I thought Cole was involved
in your nightmare.

598
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,795
Yeah, so did I,
until I stopped running scared

599
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,190
and realized
that I was just running from myself.

600
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,393
I don't follow.

601
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,232
It's kind of an old issue for me.

602
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,628
Self-sabotage.

603
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,640
I just kept beating myself up
with the whole Cole thing,

604
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,950
not thinking
that I deserved to move on.

605
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,439
Oh, you deserve it.

606
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,273
Well, the good news is,
is that it's over for all of us.

607
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,755
Maybe not all of us.

608
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,871
She kicked.

609
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,075
I felt the baby kick.

610
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,514
Now, why did that happen?

611
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,910
Well, you said you wanted
to be closer to the baby.

612
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,069
So you were.

613
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,395
Now you're not.

614
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,998
Yeah, well, right now
I want to be closer to my wife.

615
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,951
Prepare to die, witches.

616
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,349
Where are your dreams?

617
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,511
Boy, are you ever late.

618
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,873
Why'd you do that? We needed
to find out who he was working for.

619
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,110
Oh, there is more
where he came from.

620
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,713
Besides, we're saving dreams.

621
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,553
I don't want a lot of cranky women
at my baby shower.

622
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,757
Unless, you know, having one is gonna
bring up some issues for you.

623
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,476
No, no, I'm fine.

624
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,792
You know, I would even be so big
as to consider moving it to P3.

625
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,154
Well, I can't.

626
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,191
I've got Beth Orton
booked for tonight.

627
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,788
What better way to celebrate?

628
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,796
Just hope we can stay awake
long enough to enjoy it.
