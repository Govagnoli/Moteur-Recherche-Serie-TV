1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,836
Damn it, these ones are burnt too.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,274
I'm losing my touch.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,955
Oh, no, it's okay, sweetie,
they're just a little crisp.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,672
You know, personally, I am glad
that you're not a chef anymore.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,115
I'd probably be 300 pounds by now.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,475
Maybe I should make another batch.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,312
Piper, remember when you told me
to tell you when you're obsessing?

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,438
I'm not obsessing. I just want
everything to be perfect, that's all.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,831
Yeah, but Piper, it's a baby shower,
not a royal wedding.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,479
Don't you think you're
doing enough?

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,518
For God sakes, you're hosting it, and
you're not close to Wendy anymore.

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,194
That is precisely why l
am doing all of this.

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,237
I swear to God, in the last
couple of years

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,039
we've vanquished more friendships
than we have demons.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,436
- Got milk?
- Somebody forgot to put it on the list.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,874
Okay, well, we have to be patient.

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,838
You know. It's gonna take Paige more
than a week to adjust to living here.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,829
Still, there are common courtesies,
common sense, rules.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,117
You have to admit it's nice to have the
power of three under the same roof.

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,429
Right.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,238
Grab those.

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,438
So cute.

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,075
Aunt Phoebe sure would like to throw
one of these for you one day.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,949
- Damn it! Paige!
- You're changing the subject.

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,633
No, I'm ignoring you.

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,076
You can't ignore that beautiful little
girl of yours that we saw in the future.

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,870
And if my math is right, you and Leo
better start, you know, right about now.

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,794
Phoebe, we saw a lot of things in the
future that won't be happening now.

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,757
I know, but that doesn't mean
you can't have kids.

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,069
Don't you want little kids?

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,471
Not with demons dropping
in all the time

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,989
- I don't.
- Phoebe?

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,276
Hold that thought. Piper,
generations of Halliwells

34
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,238
have fought demons and had kids.
It didn't stop them, so why you?

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,039
Did it ever occur to you that maybe
this is none of your business?

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,633
- Oh, that's besides the point.
- Phoebe.

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,189
- How does Leo feel about this?
- I haven't talked to Leo about this.

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,032
- Well, don't you think we should?
- We?

39
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,829
- Yes, Cole, what is it?
- Okay.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,991
Freeze the room fast,
then unfreeze only me.

41
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,718
- What? Why?
- Just...

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,678
...do what I say and I'll explain after.

43
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,719
- Oh, please don't blow him up.
- I'll try.

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,788
Rest of the room still frozen?

45
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,598
Cole, we're the only ones
in the room.

46
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,752
You're not actually.
There's a chameleon in the house.

47
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,150
A lizard?
You're worried about a lizard?

48
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,719
This chameleon's a demon,

49
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,634
one who can transform
into any object just to spy on you.

50
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,474
Trying to tell me the manor
is supernaturally bugged?

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,478
Has been for some time, apparently.

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,471
Explains why The Source
hasn't attacked in a while.

53
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,438
He's had chameleons watching your
moves, gathering inside information.

54
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,318
Look around,

55
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,593
what's not supposed to be here?

56
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,518
- Piper, I think that was Paige's chair.
- Yeah, I know, it was ugly.

57
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,673
The room just unfroze.

58
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,355
Where did that lamp come from?

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,668
Cole, get back.

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,311
Damn it, we just got that thing fixed.

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,031
- What the hell happened?
- The freaking furniture just attacked.

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,395
Do you know how long the
chameleon demon was in the house?

63
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,111
I don't know. The lamp has been here
for at least three days, maybe more.

64
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,477
- What do you think he wants?
- I told you, gathering information.

65
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,916
- But for what? For why?
- For The Source's next attack.

66
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,957
Excuse me, is there any way

67
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,078
to claim this kind of damage on
our homeowners' insurance policy?

68
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,832
- Usually not.
- Usually?

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,560
What you do mean, I can expect
my furniture to get blown up again?

70
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,154
Get ready for the unexpected.

71
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,470
That's rule number one
in the Halliwell manor.

72
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,876
Wanna learn the rest?

73
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,554
Maybe now is not the time.

74
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,713
Considering we have to figure
out a way to find this demon.

75
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,515
Well, you could try
scrying using his blood.

76
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,910
And we've got plenty of that.

77
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,196
Although I don't know what good
it would do to find him.

78
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,476
Whatever he's learned,
he's already told The Source.

79
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,438
Except that he might also know
what The Source's plan is.

80
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,752
How he's going to attack. Find him,
we might be able to find that out.

81
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,475
I know, what about pooling
our money into a fund

82
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,552
to cover anybody's damage,
no matter whose it is?

83
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,074
Whoa, scared me!

84
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,071
Hey, Phoebe, it's been a long time.

85
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,151
Hey, sorry I'm late. We should go.

86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,199
- Go?
- To the shower.

87
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,397
Wasn't I supposed to pick you up?
Did I mess up?

88
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,711
No. No, you didn't, Becca.

89
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,519
There's just some stuff going on here.

90
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,558
So, what else is new, huh? You want
some help with the party baskets?

91
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,438
No. No.

92
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,353
It's just, I'm afraid something
came up, and Piper can't--

93
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,431
Oh, no. Don't tell me that
you're not gonna come.

94
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,830
Everyone's so looking forward
to seeing you again.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,389
Oh, really? They are? Well, then--

96
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,118
Then we can't disappoint them.

97
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,714
We'll get some stuff at the
market on the way there.

98
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,632
Will you excuse us for one minute?

99
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,754
What--? Are you out of your mind?
You can't still go.

100
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,273
Piper, we have to scry
for that demon.

101
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,795
Well, it doesn't take
three sisters to scry.

102
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,633
You and Paige can do it, and
then call me when you find him.

103
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,519
- Piper.
- Phoebe. Look, the bottom line is

104
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,114
if I'm ever gonna have kids,
then I need to have a life first.

105
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,396
Which means I need to be a human
first, and a witch later.

106
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,754
Okay? Got it? Good.

107
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,118
Stop it! Out of the way!

108
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,269
- Hi.
- Hi.

109
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,954
- Bye, Leo!
- Bye.

110
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,674
- You have failed me.
- I beg to differ.

111
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,149
Aside from finding Belthazor,
everything I've learned about--

112
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,233
May all be for naught now that
they've exposed you, Alaster.

113
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,552
The element of surprise was critical
to my plan's success.

114
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,712
You can still use the information
to capture one of them.

115
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,350
That's not what I needed
the information for.

116
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,748
Capturing is easy.

117
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,833
Tricking one into giving up all of
their powers was the ultimate goal.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,638
That's why I needed to learn

119
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,191
everything about their hopes, fears,
their dreams.

120
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,999
Then accelerate your plans.

121
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,799
Use me to capture the one you want.

122
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,554
After all, they'll be after me now.

123
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,518
Yes, they will, won't they?

124
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,550
But then, why not cut out
the middleman?

125
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,711
It's time, Oracle.

126
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,552
I must know now

127
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,508
which of the sisters do you foresee
will be most vulnerable to my plan?

128
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,240
Well, each is vulnerable
in their own way.

129
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,075
But the eldest seems to have
the most resistance to the craft.

130
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,030
Her yearnings appear to be
their greatest weakness.

131
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,470
How cute is this.

132
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,871
Oh, Piper, this is adorable.
Where did you get this?

133
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,715
A little shop in the Embarcadero.
They have the cutest things.

134
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,556
- Thank you so much, for everything.
- Oh, you're welcome.

135
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,716
- We have so much to catch up on.
- I know. We will.

136
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,510
Ladies, ladies...

137
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,796
- What?
- Nothing.

138
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,838
It's just good to see you out
and about again, that's all.

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,390
Yeah, after Prue died,
it took some time to...

140
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,913
Yeah, but I mean, even before that.

141
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,550
It's almost like the last three or four
years you've just kind of disappeared.

142
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,551
Yeah.

143
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,475
Oh, no.
Don't tell me you have to go.

144
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,835
No, it can wait.

145
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,237
I'll be right back.

146
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,796
What are you doing here?
No guys allowed.

147
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,949
I tried calling your cell phone,
but it went dead.

148
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,759
Paige and Phoebe think
they've found the demon.

149
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,309
Already? They did? Are you sure?

150
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,311
Yeah, you have to go now.

151
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,072
How are we supposed to have kids

152
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,391
if I can't even be at somebody else's
baby shower?

153
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,472
- What?
- Nothing. Never mind.

154
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,269
Okay, I'll meet you outside.
The least I can do is say goodbye.

155
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,873
Wendy, I'm sorry. I gotta go.
Something's come up.

156
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,156
Now? But we haven't even had
the cake yet.

157
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,151
You're gonna miss the best part.

158
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,551
I know. The story of my life.

159
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,517
I'll see you later.

160
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,190
So we've got a spell
to vanquish the chameleon,

161
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,873
but we're not going to use it.

162
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,951
I don't get it.

163
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,514
Well, you vanquish him
only if you have to.

164
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,150
The goal is to try and interrogate him,
find out what The Source is planning.

165
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,279
Okay, but I'm thinking that this guy's
not gonna be so eager to spill his guts.

166
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,271
He'll spill. I'll see to that.

167
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,635
No, you can't come.
He saw you with us.

168
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,189
Which probably means The Source
has some bounty hunter ready

169
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,191
to attack you or capture you
or something.

170
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,033
- So, what else is new?
- It doesn't make it less dangerous.

171
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,593
So the question still stands, how do we
get a demon to stop and chat with us?

172
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,354
Well, Piper can freeze him

173
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,750
and then unfreeze his head.
She's done that before.

174
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,991
How do you feel about that?

175
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,151
I don't know.

176
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,835
Why? You got a better idea?

177
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,797
Maybe.

178
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,472
We could tell him to offer
The Source a deal instead.

179
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,155
Deal? What kind of a deal?

180
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,598
Well, something like, he stops coming
after us, and we stop going after him.

181
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,478
What?

182
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,912
Of course, that would mean we'd have
to stop going after his demons too,

183
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,390
which would be fine by me.
It would stop all the constant attacks.

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,595
Am I the only one who thinks
she's bumped her head?

185
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,876
You can't be serious, Piper.

186
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,235
Actually I've never been
more serious in my life.

187
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,949
Think about it. This could be
an opportunity for us

188
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,839
to get out of the demon-fighting
business once and for all.

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,993
Wait. What, and just give up
on your destiny?

190
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,230
How do you know we
haven't already fulfilled it?

191
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,518
I mean, God knows we saved
scores of innocents already.

192
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,629
Maybe that's enough. Maybe it's time
for some other witches to take over

193
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,472
and let us get on with our lives.

194
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,470
Isn't it worth a try in exchange
for what we might be getting?

195
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,838
No more putting things on hold.
Vacations, friends, kids.

196
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,876
I can't give up now. We are so close.

197
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,679
We have to take out
The Source if we can.

198
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,037
And if not just for our sake...

199
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,436
...then at least for Prue's.

200
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,078
Fine. I just hope we don't end up
where she did.

201
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,636
Something's not right.
We've checked both alleys twice.

202
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,117
Well, the chameleon's gotta be here
because the crystal never lies.

203
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,750
I don't know about you, but I'm getting
a not-so-good feeling about this.

204
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,718
All right, we'll check one more time,
and then we'll call it quits.

205
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,599
Phoebe, you and Paige check
that alley. I'll go check that alley.

206
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,956
Wait, split up?
Are you sure that's a good idea?

207
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,516
Maybe it'll lure him out. Who knows?

208
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,955
If you get nervous,
say the vanquishing spell.

209
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,829
And keep your eyes peeled.
He could be anything.

210
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,348
Were you expecting me to freeze?

211
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,870
Phoebe, Paige.

212
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,992
Piper.

213
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,079
Piper.

214
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,317
Piper, are you okay?

215
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,793
My head hurts.

216
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,875
I bet it does. You hit it pretty hard.
Are you all right?

217
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,549
I think so. What happened?

218
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,393
What always happens when you
have one of your episodes.

219
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,154
You threw yourself against a wall.

220
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,830
Episodes?

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,389
I didn't throw myself--

222
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,198
What are you wearing?

223
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,237
Before you poison me,
I know about the aliens.

224
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,836
Or the conspiracy,
and I'm gonna tell the world.

225
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,998
It's okay, those are
just the other patients.

226
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,991
What the hell is going on?

227
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,311
It's all right. You're at the sanatorium.

228
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,277
You're home.

229
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,391
Where's all our furniture?

230
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,677
Leo, what are all these people
doing in our house?

231
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,116
Our house? Piper, Halliwell Hospital
is hardly our house.

232
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,713
All these other people live here too.

233
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,759
Halliwell Hospital?
Is that some kind of joke?

234
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,832
- What's wrong with you?
- Please, calm down.

235
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,673
No, Leo, I will not calm down.
Something very strange is going on,

236
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,319
something demonically strange.

237
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,112
The demon must have cast a spell and
changed the house and changed you.

238
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,512
Phoebe. Paige?

239
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,272
Now, easy lady, relax.

240
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,318
Let go of me.
Leo, don't just stand there!

241
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,790
- Problems, Dr. Wyatt?
- That's him. That's the demon.

242
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,038
Demons again?

243
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,191
Piper, we've been through this
thousands of times before.

244
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,873
There are no demons.

245
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,833
They're just figments
of your imagination.

246
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,149
Wanna bet?

247
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,630
Evil hiding in plain sight
I use this spell with all my might

248
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,756
To stop your changing
Form and shape

249
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,911
This vanquish seals your fate

250
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,993
Doesn't really rhyme, does it?
Sorry.

251
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,436
I don't understand.
That spell should have worked.

252
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,751
Piper, why do you insist
on demonizing me

253
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,558
and every psychiatrist
who's tried to help you?

254
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,633
Let go of me. I gotta blow him up.
I'm gonna blow you up.

255
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,597
Her violent impulses are returning.

256
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,591
- Straitjacket.
- Yes, doctor.

257
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,558
Piper, why won't you let
Dr. Alaster help you?

258
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,558
I don't need his help.
I need your help.

259
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,029
Get this guy off of me
so I can use my powers.

260
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,191
Piper, you don't have powers.
You're not a witch.

261
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,749
You don't save innocents.
You never did.

262
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,673
What?

263
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,952
This isn't fair! This is my house too!

264
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,236
I can do anything I want!

265
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,675
- You're hurting me!
- Paige.

266
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,957
Paige, a demon took over the house.
Orb the heck out of here!

267
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,429
Take her to isolation
so she doesn't hurt herself.

268
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,716
Hey, wait a minute.
You don't understand.

269
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,393
Wait. Leo!

270
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,516
It's for your own good.

271
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,477
Wait a minute. Hey.
You're making a big mistake.

272
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,870
Please, listen to me for a second.
He's a demon.

273
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,270
I'm not gonna give up on you, Piper.

274
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,192
We're gonna free you
of these delusions.

275
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,749
Shut up! Phoebe! Phoebe!

276
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,798
I can give you everything you want
if only you'll let me help.

277
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,636
This illness has already consumed
more than three years of your life.

278
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,155
Don't let it rob you of any more.

279
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,438
You're not a witch.
You only think you are.

280
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,829
- What's the matter? What happened?
- It's just

281
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,629
taking more magic than I realized
to project into her mind.

282
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,109
More than you have, perhaps?

283
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,513
I only mean to caution you.

284
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,236
This is weakening you,
making you vulnerable.

285
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,631
But the bounty I seek will make
me more powerful than ever.

286
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,950
If you can get it.

287
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,870
Nobody knows more about
the Charmed Ones than I do.

288
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,076
I know how to break her spirit.

289
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,198
I know her Achilles' heel.

290
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,835
In her deepest heart,
she never wanted to be a witch.

291
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,834
Yet she feels an obligation
to her powers.

292
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,754
Yes, but you said her powers
won't work in our illusion.

293
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,717
They won't.

294
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,314
And once she learns
that painful lesson,

295
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,393
she'll willingly give hers up.

296
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,199
And with them, her sisters too.

297
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,388
Anything?

298
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,551
I can't sense Piper anywhere.

299
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,915
- Does that mean that--?
- No.

300
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,799
He wouldn't have taken her
if he wanted her dead.

301
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,239
- Cole-- Oh, my God.
- I'm all right.

302
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,356
I just found out that Piper's
in the underworld.

303
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,635
I think The Source has her.

304
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,234
The Source? Are you sure?
How do you know?

305
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,029
From another chameleon demon.
I kind of squeezed it out of him.

306
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,111
Well, we gotta find her.

307
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,998
There's gotta be a spell
in here somewhere.

308
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,438
Phoebe?

309
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,912
I saw The Source,
stealing the Book...

310
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,550
...and killing us, with our powers.

311
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,674
Our powers?
How can he get our powers?

312
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,274
Maybe he's figured out a way
to get them from Piper.

313
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,112
Explains why he's keeping her alive.

314
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,679
But she can't give them up
by herself.

315
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,400
Well, she can using
the relinquishing spell in the Book.

316
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,039
But we burned that spell
three years ago.

317
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,633
It doesn't exist anymore.

318
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,950
It does in her mind.

319
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,159
That's crazy. She'd never say it.
She's never give up her powers.

320
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,278
Even though she was
kind of willing to this morning?

321
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,272
I'm just saying...

322
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,159
Look, I know what you're saying,

323
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,914
but you don't know
what you're talking about.

324
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,709
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

325
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,599
Maybe you and I should go down
there, see if I can sense her.

326
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,478
Follow me.

327
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,073
Okay, there's a bunch of summoning
spells we can try. Come on.

328
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,713
I thought you said I wasn't good
enough for your little coven.

329
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,475
Paige, you are under a spell. You
don't know what you're talking about.

330
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,758
I tried to be your friend. I even tried
to play your stupid witchy games.

331
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,229
But all you could do is complain
about me and my stuff

332
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,915
and how we didn't compare
to your beloved Prue.

333
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,878
- I've never said that.
- You don't have to.

334
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,951
It's obvious in the way you treat me.

335
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,712
You don't even like me.

336
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,474
Paige, that's ridiculous!
We're sisters.

337
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,039
You don't have any sisters.

338
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,393
You're an only child, Piper.
You know that.

339
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,235
I'm gonna be so happy when
I vanquish your sorry ass.

340
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,675
You use it to explain things
you can't accept.

341
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,998
Just like your best friend did
before she got well.

342
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,752
Prue?

343
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,388
Don't you dare talk about Prue.

344
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,596
Here we go again. Saint Prue.

345
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,589
You've never forgiven her for
finally accepting she wasn't a witch.

346
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,512
You've convinced yourself
that she's dead.

347
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,148
- She is dead.
- No, she's not.

348
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,358
We released her three months ago.

349
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,154
She's recovered. She's free.

350
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,835
Just like you could be if you'd
stop fighting it, accept your reality.

351
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,549
Let me out of these restraints,
I'll show you some reality.

352
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,319
I'm afraid you'd just hurt yourself
again.

353
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,631
I'm truly sorry.

354
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,031
Leo! Leo!

355
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,156
Would you stop with the "Leo, Leo"?

356
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,311
You're driving me crazier
than I already am.

357
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,552
Phoebe, Phoebe. Untie me.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

358
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,757
All right, all right, stop obsessing.

359
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,753
I'm not obsessing.

360
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,396
- What are you eating?
- Chocolate chip cookie.

361
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,951
- Not your best.
- Got milk? Don't think so.

362
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,476
Okay, just get me out of these things.
We need to reverse this demon spell.

363
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,270
What is it? What did you see?

364
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,237
I saw the back of my eyelids.
What did you think?

365
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,516
Oh, no, Phoebe, not you.
Not you too.

366
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,511
Hurry up, Looney Tunes,
get me out of here.

367
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,915
All right, I don't know
what the hell is going on,

368
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,435
but we gotta get to the Book
of Shadows. And since evil can't

369
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,309
touch it, it's still gotta be in the attic,
right? Right? Right?

370
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,118
Let's go.

371
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,119
All right, the first thing
we gotta do is--

372
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,554
Where's Phoebe?

373
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,551
Who cares?

374
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,111
Sorry, had to grab my broom.

375
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,556
- For what?
- Well, for flying, silly.

376
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,992
- Another innocent to save.
- No, Phoebe, wait!

377
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,319
You can't hurt me.

378
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,199
I'm the mighty Belthazor!

379
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,069
Stop it. He's not evil anymore.
He's good!

380
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,231
Well, he sure flew.

381
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,310
Hi. Stop that.
Has anybody seen the Book?

382
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,596
I know where it is.
I hid it so the doctors--

383
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,832
I mean, the demons wouldn't find it.

384
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,233
What? What is this?

385
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,717
Oh, God.

386
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,314
You are nuts.

387
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,350
Okay, I don't understand how a demon
could take the Book out of the house.

388
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,112
Unless this isn't the house.

389
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,871
Okay, I gotta get you two out of here.
Maybe that'll break the spell.

390
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,553
How come the spell
didn't work on you?

391
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,312
Don't question the rules.

392
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,392
Okay, come on.
We'll go down the trellis.

393
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,996
What about Cole?
I never get to spend any time with him.

394
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,193
We'll come back for him later.
Come on, come on.

395
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,590
It'll be fun. Hurry. Hurry.

396
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,671
Faster.

397
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,548
Piper, don't.

398
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,871
I think we lost them.

399
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,600
Wait a minute,
everything looks normal.

400
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,596
This is wrong. We should go back
and try and get the demon to talk.

401
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,832
I'm thinking he's not gonna be
so eager to spill his guts.

402
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,199
- Hey!
- Stop him!

403
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,595
Piper! No!

404
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,272
I believe she's just learned
her lesson.

405
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,110
Power of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies

406
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,831
Come to us who call you near
Come to us and settle here

407
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,074
Blood to blood, I summon thee
Blood to blood, return to me

408
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,188
Any other spells you can think of?

409
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,194
No. I don't know what else to do.

410
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,079
If Leo and Cole can't find her...

411
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,478
What is it?

412
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,514
Something that Leo said

413
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,240
about the power-relinquishing spell
being in Piper's mind.

414
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,277
I told you she'd never say it.

415
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,954
Paige, you don't know her
as well as I do.

416
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,599
No, but I am getting to know
The Source.

417
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,672
He likes to play tricks in people's
minds. God knows, he did with mine.

418
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,478
He almost had me kill a guy,
remember?

419
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,389
Yeah, go on.

420
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,348
Maybe that's what he's trying to do
to Piper. Get into her mind somehow.

421
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,669
If that's where the spell is.

422
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,680
Then that's probably
where he's looking for it.

423
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,675
And if he can get into her mind,
then why can't we?

424
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,759
Easy. Easy.

425
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,635
You've had a terrible accident.

426
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,557
What did you do to me?

427
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,514
You got hit by a car.

428
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,478
The driver said you didn't even try
to get out of the way.

429
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,394
Piper, this delusion that you
somehow have magical powers

430
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,120
is gonna get you killed some day.

431
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,033
Shove it. Where are my sisters?

432
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,798
You mean your roommates.
They're safe, downstairs.

433
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,394
Piper, how can I save you
if you won't save yourself?

434
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,435
You have to want to.
You have to will it.

435
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,868
Otherwise, you just remain lost
in this fantasy world of yours.

436
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,271
It's real, and you're just trying
to confuse me.

437
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,558
No. No, I'm trying to help you.

438
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,077
Piper, your psychosis is based on
the fervent belief that you're magical.

439
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,117
But you know that's just an escape.

440
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,032
Escape. What escape?

441
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,073
From some deep-seated pain,

442
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,711
some terrible loss, most likely
the death of your grandmother,

443
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,873
which is, after all, when this series
of episodes began.

444
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,589
End your pain. You can do it.

445
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,516
In one of our sessions,
you mentioned a poem,

446
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,477
"a spell," you called it.

447
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,552
One that relinquishes the magical
powers you think you have.

448
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,275
No. Go away.

449
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,148
Say the spell, Piper.

450
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,789
It'll free you, I promise you.

451
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,873
It'll release you from
all the crippling delusions you have.

452
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,670
Get out. Get away from me.
Get out!

453
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,755
You have the power to give yourself
the life you've always wanted.

454
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,515
All you have to do is stop putting the
illusion of being a witch in front of it.

455
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,552
Leo.

456
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,068
Leo, where are you?

457
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,552
Leo.

458
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,669
- She's hurt.
- Where is she?

459
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,434
I don't know.
I can't get an exact reading.

460
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,757
- Well, try harder.
- I can't.

461
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,549
The Source must've learned from
last time. He's blocking Piper's signal.

462
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,632
Well, then we have
to find The Source.

463
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,677
How are we gonna do that?

464
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,274
There's only one way.

465
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,069
Cole.

466
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,712
Hey.

467
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,114
Leo, heal me please.

468
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,315
This ought to help.

469
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,356
No, not with that. With your powers.

470
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,708
If I had powers, honey, I would use
them. You know that I would.

471
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,320
It kills me to see you like this.

472
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,794
What?

473
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,390
White lights.

474
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,994
I see white lights all around you.

475
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,877
That's the painkiller.

476
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,877
No, you're my whitelighter.

477
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,960
Dr. Alaster says there's a way
for you to get better.

478
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,473
Is that true?

479
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,158
I don't...

480
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,838
If it were, then we can be together.

481
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,117
We wouldn't have to keep sneaking
around, breaking the rules.

482
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,120
Rules? But we're married.

483
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,397
No, only in your fantasy world.

484
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,314
But it doesn't have to be that way.

485
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,918
If you were to get better,
then we could be married for real.

486
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,516
And have that little girl that you've
been dreaming about in the future.

487
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,958
Come on, I want to show you
something.

488
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,919
What are you doing here?
Leave now.

489
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,196
I don't think so.

490
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,073
Tell The Source we've
captured Belthazor.

491
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,275
Leave him. I'll make sure
you get the credit.

492
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,194
We're not going without our bounty.

493
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,115
Then you'll wait.

494
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,199
I have a surprise for you, Piper.

495
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,909
One that I think will help you.

496
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,559
You see?
There's magic in the real world too.

497
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,474
Your friends have come to visit you.

498
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,710
Hi, Piper. How are you?

499
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,309
Becca?

500
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,517
It's so good to see you again.
We've missed you.

501
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,632
We've got so much to catch up on.

502
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,270
Wendy, when did you
have your baby?

503
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,318
Just after the shower.
Don't you remember?

504
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,949
How could she forget?

505
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,751
Do you want to hold her?

506
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,278
Here.

507
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,516
Isn't the outfit you bought her
just adorable?

508
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,879
What's the matter, honey?
Why are you crying?

509
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,029
I think it's probably best
if you all go now.

510
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,633
But we just got here.

511
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,950
And everyone's so excited
to finally see her again.

512
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,078
I'm sorry. You understand?

513
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,112
Bye, Piper.

514
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,519
You can have this life, Piper.

515
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,796
We can have it together.

516
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,470
You already know
how to get it for us.

517
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,479
It's the only way you'll ever
get out of here,

518
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,996
to free yourself once and for all,
to free us.

519
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,711
The spell?

520
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,236
Yes, the spell.

521
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,951
Try to remember it...

522
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,991
...exactly.

523
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,352
Are we sure we wanna do this?

524
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,112
This was your idea, remember?

525
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,271
Well, in the abstract, yeah.

526
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,513
But, I have enough trouble being in
my head, let alone someone else's.

527
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,956
Well, our minds won't actually
be in Piper's body.

528
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,792
Just our consciousness.

529
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,190
Kind of like astral projection.

530
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,196
Okay, so the spell gets us
into her head. What about after that?

531
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,195
We use the reversal spell to get us out.
Are you ready?

532
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,831
I'm not about to lose another sister,
and neither are you.

533
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,995
Life to life and mind to mind

534
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,594
Our spirits now will intertwine

535
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,910
We meld our souls and journey to

536
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,356
The one whose thoughts
We wish we knew

537
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,359
I think it worked.

538
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,988
Either that or we're
in Mary Poppins' head.

539
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,116
Piper.

540
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,953
Piper, we're gonna get
you out of here.

541
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,315
- Okay, I have the spell.
- No.

542
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,755
No more spells.

543
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,517
Piper, honey, it's us.
It's your sisters.

544
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,399
I don't have sisters.

545
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,154
Go away! Leave me alone!

546
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,953
You're too late.
Her nightmare's about to end.

547
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,318
Keep them here.

548
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,516
I want them to witness this.

549
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,272
They're no threat.

550
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,718
- Their powers don't work here.
- Oh, yeah? Spell.

551
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,151
No, pain, however, you do feel.

552
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,392
And will, after she recites
the spell thrice.

553
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,313
Once for each of your powers.

554
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,551
Leo. Help Piper. Get her out of here.

555
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,154
Yes, Leo, by all means.

556
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,958
It's okay.

557
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,111
Piper, honey, just say the words,

558
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,194
and everything will be all right.

559
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,274
No!

560
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,237
From whence they came
Return them now

561
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,879
Piper, don't!

562
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,713
- Please, Piper, don't.
- Vanish the words

563
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,154
Vanish our powers

564
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,991
Don't trust them.
They're trying to steal our powers.

565
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,879
- Don't listen to them.
- They're still delusional.

566
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,473
- But you're not.
- Not anymore.

567
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,155
Just two more times,
and you'll set yourself free.

568
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,794
Say the spell, Piper.
You know you want to.

569
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,592
Come on, Cole, wake up.

570
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,038
How you doing?

571
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,429
- Cole, hurry up, wake up.
- Finish this. You're in danger.

572
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,798
Piper.

573
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,958
No!

574
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,069
Vanish our powers

575
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,914
One last time.

576
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,713
Now!

577
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,429
Break the connection,
or he'll kill you!

578
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,794
No.

579
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,909
I told you, you're too late.

580
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,792
No!

581
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,713
Piper, please don't do this.

582
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,795
Our magic is a gift.
You can't just throw it away.

583
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,748
From whence they came
Return them now

584
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,670
Piper, don't.

585
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,037
Listen to your sisters. Trust them.

586
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,471
Trust me. Don't say the spell.

587
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,234
Don't relinquish your powers.

588
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,873
Are you really my husband?

589
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,598
Yes.

590
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,832
And that would make you two
really my sisters.

591
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,353
Whether you like it or not.

592
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,273
And so that demon is gone?

593
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,079
Thank God because that guy
was freaking me out.

594
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,631
What do you say we click our heels
and get out of this crazy joint?

595
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,598
- No offence.
- That's okay.

596
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,912
My life has always been a little crazy.

597
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,471
- Is something wrong?
- No.

598
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,278
Everything is just right.

599
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,954
Except for my chair.

600
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,192
Yeah, which I'll actually
pay to replace.

601
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,193
Oh, God, no. It's not your fault.

602
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,273
Or is it?

603
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,069
Actually, yeah, it was.

604
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,631
I was just upset there was yet another
demon in our house and in our lives.

605
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,315
And I know I should stop fighting it,
and just accept it, but--

606
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,040
It wasn't my favourite chair anyway.

607
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,509
Besides, it's actually good to know
that I'm not the only one

608
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,194
who struggles with the idea
of being a witch.

609
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,828
No, believe me,
you are in good company.

610
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,271
The good news is you won't
deal with The Source

611
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,955
anytime soon,
because Cole hurt him pretty bad.

612
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,997
Not bad enough, though.
He'll be back.

613
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,879
So he's gone for now, isn't he?

614
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,758
First time in a long time?

615
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,592
I think we should
take advantage of that.

616
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,752
Why, Miss Halliwell,
are you trying to seduce me?

617
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,797
Always.

618
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,035
Okay, I'm just gonna...

619
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,113
...go to the store and get some milk
or something.

620
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,638
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

621
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,473
You know, I'm never gonna
stop wanting a normal life.

622
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,950
But you know what? I think that's the
one thing that actually keeps me sane.

623
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,998
Well, you deserve a normal life, Piper.

624
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,354
We both do.

625
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,958
And maybe we'll get that when we
vanquish The Source once and for all.

626
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,511
And who knows? Maybe someday l
could have a baby shower of my own.

627
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,559
What do you think?

628
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,313
Well, in that case,
we need to practice a little.

629
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,550
Leo.
