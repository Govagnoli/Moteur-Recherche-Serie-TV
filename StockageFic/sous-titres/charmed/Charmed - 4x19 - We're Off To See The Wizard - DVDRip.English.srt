1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,119
The elite guard will
take their places along the aisle.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,355
Then precisely at midnight,
we'll begin the ritualistic chant,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,830
and then you will be escorted
in for the ceremony.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,152
It's been a while, hasn't it?

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,391
Five hundred years,
give or take a decade.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,994
Here it is. The oath.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,789
Upon completion of the oath,

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,430
you will be given the full powers
of the underworld.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,113
- Will I feel different? After?
- Perhaps.

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,592
Those who came before you
described a feeling of being...

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,312
...complete.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,838
Have any of them
been half human?

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,915
No, this is a first.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,070
Now it's time for you
to begin your preparations.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,435
Your guards will show you
to the vestibule.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,599
This way.

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,234
Arrest me.

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,279
- What's going on?
- I found him outside.

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,594
A wizard.

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,832
Well, well. Aren't you
supposed to be extinct?

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,278
- One of us is alive and well.
- Not for long.

22
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,953
Did you really think
you could stop

23
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,878
the coronation
all by yourself, wizard?

24
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,635
I didn't come for the coronation.
I came for the revenge.

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,915
What's the matter with you?
Stop him!

26
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,039
It's an illusion.

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,114
What the hell is going on here?

28
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,396
Cole's a demon again.
That is what's going on.

29
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,318
Do you wanna lose us a sister?

30
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,597
Because that's exactly what's gonna
happen if you blurt it out like that.

31
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,069
Besides, we only know that Cole
is dealing with demons...

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,514
...not that he is a demon.

33
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,875
If it looks like a demon
and walks like a demon...

34
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,951
That's ducks.
That's not Phoebe's husband,

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,236
the love of her life, her best friend--

36
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,118
All right, I get your point, woman.

37
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,675
Look, this isn't gonna be easy
for her to hear.

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,394
Especially since she's happier
than she's ever been.

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,919
Or not.

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,757
Hi, come on in.

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,151
Phoebe, what's the matter?
You look--

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,471
Terrible? Yeah, I haven't slept
in a couple of days.

43
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,278
Why? What's the matter?

44
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,635
You guys should probably
sit down. Sit.

45
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,951
That's funny, we were just coming
to ask you to do the same thing.

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,872
Okay, so, what I'm about
to tell you is really big.

47
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,479
We're talking huge.

48
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,513
See, she knows.

49
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,636
Knows what?

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,028
You tell us.

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,797
Okay. I'm...

52
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,754
I'm pregnant.

53
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,758
- You're what?
- Oh, my God. From Cole?

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,273
Find the wizard or you're next.

55
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,995
I don't even understand
how this could've happened.

56
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,270
We were being so careful.

57
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,078
It's the last thing
I expected right now.

58
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,311
Just wait.

59
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,828
Does Cole know?

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,672
No, not yet.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,072
I should've told him, I know,
but I didn't know how to.

62
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,959
Besides, I don't want him to think
that I'm not happy about it.

63
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,792
Are you?

64
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,593
I don't know.

65
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,595
I'm-- You know,
part of me is, obviously.

66
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,829
I love Cole. But then there's another
part of me that's scared to death.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,549
I mean, there's so many changes,
and it's all happening so fast.

68
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,798
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.

69
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,428
Oh, honey, you should've told us
when you found out.

70
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,756
And then you wouldn't have to
go through it alone.

71
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,556
I know. But I wasn't sure
how you would feel about it.

72
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,673
Me, why?

73
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,828
Because I know how hard
you and Leo have been trying.

74
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,480
Honey, this doesn't have anything
to do with me.

75
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,756
It has everything to do with you,

76
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,718
and I'd be thrilled to be an aunt.
Don't worry about me.

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,594
So when are you gonna tell Cole?

78
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,832
I don't know. He's got so much
on his plate right now.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,116
You know, with starting
his new job and everything.

80
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,397
You're gonna have a lot on
your plate too, more than you realise.

81
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,160
Yeah, like how many hours
he's gonna be working

82
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,151
and that he's not
gonna be home a lot.

83
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,515
That's not what
I was talking about, Piper.

84
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,113
- What do you mean, Paige?
- It can wait.

85
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,074
Oh, God, that's Cole.

86
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,077
He can't know I told you
before I told him.

87
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,559
Hurry, out of here. Orb.

88
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,233
I thought Cole
had a "no orbing" policy.

89
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,073
No, he doesn't want you orbing in.
He doesn't mind you orbing out.

90
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,071
Now!

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,274
I thought you were at work.

92
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,829
I thought you were in bed.
Are you feeling better?

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,353
Much, thanks.

94
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,797
Well, I gotta go, baby,
you know, deadlines.

95
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,318
- But I got you something to eat.
- Sorry. I'll call you later.

96
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,876
- Phoebe, what's wrong?
- Why?

97
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,395
What makes you think
there's something wrong?

98
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,153
Because every time you lie,
I can see your wisdom teeth.

99
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,997
- We'll talk tonight.
- Phoebe.

100
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,639
Please, Cole, not now.

101
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,915
- Well, I'm worried.
- Well, don't be.

102
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,872
Well, I am, damn it.
What's the matter?

103
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,154
I'm pregnant.

104
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,190
- You're what?
- We'll talk later.

105
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,751
I'm gonna be a daddy.

106
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,233
What is the emergency?

107
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,833
Phoebe is pregnant.

108
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,795
- What? Really?
- Yeah, I think she deserves to know

109
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,552
she's carrying
a demon child, don't you?

110
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,716
You don't know if Cole is a demon.

111
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,711
- You don't know he's not.
- Well, okay.

112
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,519
We'll do some more digging,
and we'll find some solid proof.

113
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,511
No, I think she deserves
to know it now, Piper.

114
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,194
- She doesn't need the stress, Paige.
- Even if she's in danger?

115
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,554
Cole would never hurt her.

116
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,472
He couldn't even hurt her
when he was a demon.

117
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,914
Are you willing to bet her life on it?

118
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,799
Okay, do you want my advice
or don't you?

119
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,949
Whose side are you on?

120
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,509
If it's hers, it better not be
because you're sleeping with her.

121
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,954
Help!

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,558
Please, you gotta help me.

123
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,119
Help you? Who are you?

124
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,358
No!

125
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,310
What an idiot. Doesn't every demon
know by now whose house this is?

126
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,115
Not every demon, fortunately for me.

127
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,912
But he just vanquished you.

128
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,548
No, not me. An illusion.

129
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,039
One of my little tricks.

130
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,158
Comes in handy.
Saving my life and whatnot.

131
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,309
You're a wizard?

132
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,519
In the flesh.
For lack of a better term.

133
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,831
Wait a minute, you just tricked us
into vanquishing one of your enemies.

134
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,598
My enemies are your enemies.

135
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,795
Says you.

136
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,279
Leo, friend or foe?

137
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,590
I don't know.
I've never met a wizard before.

138
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,877
- Only heard about them.
- Please, give me a little credit.

139
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,349
Why would I seek out
the Charmed Ones if I were evil?

140
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,592
Look, you need to stand still, or you're
gonna go poof like your friend in there.

141
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,672
Oh, you're the touchy one,
aren't you?

142
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,714
I've heard about you. Peeper?

143
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,278
- Piper.
- Whatever.

144
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,918
What do you want?

145
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,714
Revenge.

146
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,315
On The Source.

147
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,519
For slaughtering my kind
centuries ago.

148
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,712
And for that I'll need your help.

149
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,633
Well, maybe you haven't heard.

150
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,836
There's a new Source.
The old one is dead.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,956
Yeah, we already kicked
his sorry ass.

152
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,397
He didn't die.
He was reborn into a new sorry ass.

153
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,351
Wait, that didn't come out right.

154
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,988
Are you kidding me?
After everything we went through,

155
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,156
he found an escape hatch?

156
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,595
Our only chance to stop him
will be tonight,

157
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,314
before he receives his full powers
at the coronation.

158
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,155
Tonight? How do we do such a big job
on such short notice?

159
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,074
We'll steal the Grimoire.

160
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,676
- Oh, what's that?
- Evil Book of Shadows.

161
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,196
The Source has to lay his hand
on the book as he says the oath,

162
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,998
or he doesn't get his powers.

163
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,391
So we steal a little book,
and we stop The Source?

164
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,915
What's the catch?

165
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,878
The catch is it's protected in
a secret chamber by his best guards.

166
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,071
Now, I know how to get there.

167
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,798
But I can't fight them alone.

168
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,078
What do you say? Partners?

169
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,516
I so don't trust him.

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,639
I'll check with the Elders,
see what they know.

171
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,392
You better get Phoebe.
In case he's right,

172
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,993
you're gonna need
the power of three.

173
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,359
- I'll go get her.
- No.

174
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,636
No, you've got the firepower.
You stay here, I'll go.

175
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,315
All right, but no spilling the beans
on Cole, not until we decide to.

176
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,035
Scout's honour.

177
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,959
Just so you know,
one false move, and you're toast.

178
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,509
Got any jam?

179
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,194
- Is the witch home?
- No.

180
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,839
Good. I thought
you'd like an update.

181
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,636
As you ordered, the priests have
stepped up security on the Grimoire.

182
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,310
So far, the wizard
has been our only breach.

183
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,951
- What is that dreadful music?
- Oh, nothing.

184
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,635
Baby shopping, sir?

185
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,077
Yes. As a matter of fact, I was.
Phoebe's pregnant.

186
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,957
An heir, that's wonderful news.
But I don't understand why you're...

187
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,634
Just keeping up appearances,
you know.

188
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,953
Trying to act like
any normal father-to-be.

189
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,833
For Phoebe.

190
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,759
But Phoebe's not here.

191
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,476
Is there anything else
you need to update me on?

192
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,673
May I speak candidly?

193
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,039
I'm worried about you.

194
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,239
Worried that the witch's influence
on you is too great.

195
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,077
That the baby will make
the pull of love even greater.

196
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,675
Oh, if you're worried
about the coronation...

197
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,794
I'm worried about
after the coronation.

198
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,235
The next nine months to be exact...

199
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,919
...when the bond between
you and Phoebe will grow...

200
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,997
...and your hold
on the humanity within will weaken.

201
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,829
Unless...

202
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,589
Unless?

203
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,636
Unless you allow the Seer
to perform her dark magic.

204
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,351
Allow me to carry your baby.

205
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,829
What?

206
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,550
You won't need the witch anymore.

207
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,877
I could be your queen.

208
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,914
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm trying to save you.

209
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,231
The underworld will not tolerate
a leader who's conflicted.

210
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,715
Any sign of weakness,
and you're not gonna survive.

211
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,154
Are you threatening me?

212
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,355
I'm reminding you...

213
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,230
...of your future, your destiny.

214
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,552
Neither of which include the witch.

215
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,715
Yes, of course I am aware
that there's a deadline,

216
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,269
but Elise threw my column out
at the last minute.

217
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,957
Oh, how hard can it be

218
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,439
to write an advice column?

219
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,829
Let me show you how hard!

220
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,558
- Bad time?
- Yes. No.

221
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,155
Whatever. What is it?

222
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,112
Well, we...

223
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,909
We need the power of three.

224
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,429
What?

225
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,874
Now? Can't it wait?

226
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,314
CliffsNotes version:

227
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,994
We didn't kill The Source
like we thought. He was just reborn,

228
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,311
and now if we don't help a wizard stop
him from getting coronated tonight,

229
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,835
he becomes all-powerful.
Shall we?

230
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,513
So let him get coronated.

231
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,349
- Sorry?
- Well, why not?

232
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,919
What's the worst that can happen?

233
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,595
Besides all hell breaking loose
on Earth?

234
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,589
What's wrong with you?

235
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,473
I don't know.

236
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,675
I'm just-- I'm having
a really bad day right now.

237
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,633
Okay, I'll meet you at the manor.

238
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,916
But I have to find Cole first
and fill him in.

239
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,639
No, you don't need to do that.

240
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,155
Besides, he's so busy being
Mr. Hot-Shot-Lawyer-Guy and all.

241
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,393
Okay, Paige, what's your problem
with Cole now, huh? Spill it.

242
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,549
Nothing.

243
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,956
You're lying,
I can see your wisdom teeth.

244
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,712
- I don't have wisdom teeth.
- Paige.

245
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,951
All right, but you're not gonna like it.

246
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,310
All right. Remember the vampire that
attacked me a couple of days ago?

247
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,473
I met him through Cole
at your apartment.

248
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,995
And?

249
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,550
And? Don't you think that's a pretty big
coincidence for an alleged ex-demon?

250
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,154
- Alleged?
- Stop being so naive, Phoebe.

251
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,510
He's been acting strange
ever since he got his new job,

252
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,557
which for all we know,
could be a cover anyway.

253
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,870
- I don't believe this.
- Face the facts, Phoebe.

254
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,357
Cole has gone back to his old ways.

255
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,752
And I am not the only one
who thinks so.

256
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,148
Piper thinks so too.

257
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,630
That's what we were coming
to tell you about this morning.

258
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,949
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,309
Where are you going?

260
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,595
To prove you wrong.

261
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,990
What about The Source,
what about the power of three?

262
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,793
Screw the power of three.

263
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,153
You caught me.

264
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,554
Cole.

265
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,117
I love you.

266
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,629
"Screw the power of three"?

267
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,836
Those were her words exactly.

268
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,992
And then she practically flattened me
while storming out of her office.

269
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,628
Well, that sounds like
more than just hormones.

270
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,119
Yeah, she was a little pissed.

271
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,069
About what?

272
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,996
Oh, Paige, you didn't!
You told her about Cole?

273
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,434
She was gonna find out eventually.

274
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,273
Yeah, when we decided
it was the right time to tell her.

275
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,351
Now she's probably never
gonna speak to us again.

276
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,431
You might as well
crown the new Source yourself.

277
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,352
Oh, God, I think
you're slightly exaggerating.

278
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,717
No, I am not. We need Phoebe
for the plan to work.

279
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,791
- What plan?
- You follow me!

280
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,149
All right.

281
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,109
Piper, I think I like
the other kitchen better.

282
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,710
This is an illusion, right?

283
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,593
Please, tell me she's not
the brains of the family.

284
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,238
Grimoire, Dark Priest, bodyguards,

285
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,356
and this mystery man
over here is The Source.

286
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,476
Oh, first half a face
and now no face.

287
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,914
I didn't get a good look at him.

288
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,878
Well, it doesn't really matter anyway,
because he may not even be here.

289
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,349
- All we want is the Grimoire.
- All right, what's the plan?

290
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,513
- We learn from his mistakes.
- Not mistakes, miscalculations.

291
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,592
You didn't have any backup,

292
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,718
your illusions didn't buy you
enough time, and you got caught.

293
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,279
I'd call those mistakes.

294
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,677
This time we'll go for
a bigger distraction,

295
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,637
and since the bodyguards
are already after you,

296
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,598
you show up,
and they'll chase after you.

297
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,110
Thinning out the demonic ranks,
that sounds good.

298
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,039
Easy for you to say.
You're not the distraction.

299
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,597
You'll orb us in, Phoebe and l
will keep the demons busy,

300
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,597
- and you'll snag the book.
- Sounds simple.

301
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,228
Would I come to you
if it were that simple?

302
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,837
It's like the Book of Shadows,
only it protects itself from good.

303
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,157
So you'll use this sack.

304
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,516
We'll put a spell on it
so it can hold the Grimoire.

305
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,035
- Piper!
- Phoebe, no!

306
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,877
Hello. Confusion.

307
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,473
I can't work like this.

308
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,598
Phoebe, this is the wizard.

309
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,552
And that was one of his illusions.

310
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,234
An illusion?

311
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,755
Like those?

312
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,110
Yeah, don't mind him.
He's been at it all day,

313
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,838
the pig.

314
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,991
Not that I'm not happy
to see you, Phoebe,

315
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,113
but why are we seeing you,
considering how we left it?

316
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,353
I'm not about to shun my Wiccan
duties, Paige, no matter what.

317
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,514
But what about
what we talked about?

318
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,033
I love Cole. And I trust him,
even if you guys don't.

319
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,078
We could discuss our problems later.
I came here to help you with Merlin.

320
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,272
Please. Merlin was
an overrated hack.

321
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,914
Tell me he's not the only wizard
you people have ever heard of.

322
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,354
Well, does Harry Potter count?

323
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,629
All right, enough.

324
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,872
You can live your life of instant
gratification later, after we're done.

325
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,509
- Get rid of them.
- You call this a life?

326
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,071
This is no life.

327
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,559
Illusions are as empty to me
as they are to you.

328
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,595
They're only a reminder of a reality
long since lost,

329
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,076
of a world filled with wizards,
of friends, of family.

330
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,869
It's all an illusion without family.

331
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,917
Help me stop The Source.

332
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,111
Help me right this wrong.

333
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,593
Everything's on schedule.

334
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,832
The other priests are preparing
the sacrifices as we speak.

335
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,035
What about the wizard?

336
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,952
How do we know he won't make
another attempt?

337
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,918
He's the last of his kind, sire.
I doubt if he'll risk oblivion.

338
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,193
He risked it before, didn't he?

339
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,835
Talking about me?

340
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,677
Guards! After him!

341
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,795
Something's not right.

342
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,190
You should leave
for your safety now, sire.

343
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,672
Protect the Grimoire.

344
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,591
Stop. Wait.

345
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,273
But, sire, the wizard.

346
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,714
He's right behind you.

347
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,879
If only you were real...

348
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,075
Piper, now!

349
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,389
Paige, look out!

350
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,668
What was that?

351
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,599
I have no idea.

352
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,509
What are we waiting for?

353
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,228
Grimoire!

354
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,389
Got it.

355
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,999
Let's get out of here.

356
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,759
We did it! We got it.

357
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,558
Yes, and now we're going
to destroy it.

358
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,870
Paige, go get the Book of Shadows.
We need some potions.

359
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,508
- Right.
- Wait. Destroy it?

360
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,113
We might be able to use it.

361
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,032
For what? It's evil.

362
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,395
- Do you wanna sit down?
- I think I just wanna go home.

363
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,993
Well, this is home too.

364
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,639
I don't feel good.

365
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,470
It just didn't feel right.

366
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,759
Well, that's probably
just because

367
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,275
it's new,
and your power is escalating.

368
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,194
How is it escalating?

369
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,149
I levitate, I have premonitions.

370
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,748
Well, you had fire power
in your past life.

371
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,634
I was evil in my past life, remember?

372
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,068
Can we get back to the Grimoire?

373
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,229
No!

374
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,471
Phoebe, wait!

375
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,233
What's the matter?
What happened?

376
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,789
What are you doing here?

377
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,197
I sensed your pain. I was worried.

378
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,356
Yeah, well, you should be worried.
The Grimoire's been stolen.

379
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,509
I know.

380
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,714
You know? How do you know?

381
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,429
Have you been spying on me?

382
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,999
No, of course not.

383
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,869
Then how?

384
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,669
Tell me.

385
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,594
From me.

386
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,832
I told her.

387
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,354
Seer?

388
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,512
If you foresaw the Grimoire
being taken--

389
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,912
Finding the Grimoire
is not your biggest problem.

390
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,391
Suppressing Cole is.

391
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,678
You're changing, my liege.

392
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,879
The human in you grows stronger,
and at the worst possible time.

393
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,073
- I can handle it.
- How?

394
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,880
Your guard is down.
You're vulnerable.

395
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,795
Let me try again.

396
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,149
Try what?

397
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,390
Are you working together
to manipulate me?

398
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,675
No, to save you.

399
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,949
To save us.

400
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,634
Us? There is no us!

401
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,358
But there could be.
And if there were,

402
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,714
the struggle would end.

403
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,351
You'd be free to rule without
the witch's love holding you back.

404
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,353
This is your doing.

405
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,476
Did you really think I'd fall for it?

406
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,189
Leave us.

407
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,351
Now.

408
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,552
I can't believe you tricked me
into hiring a seductress.

409
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,594
I was concerned the baby's
influence on your humanity

410
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,472
might sway you to the other side.

411
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,189
And what?

412
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,672
You hoped if I'd gotten laid--

413
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,593
No, I hoped you'd come
to your senses before it was too late.

414
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,238
But I wasn't relying on it.

415
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,635
This isn't just about you.

416
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,631
I helped put you
in position for greatness,

417
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,796
and I'm not going to let you fail now.

418
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,189
It's only The Source
that protects you from

419
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,709
the Charmed Ones'
powers and premonitions.

420
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,079
If Cole's love becomes any stronger,
it will overpower The Source.

421
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,920
Then you will lose everything.

422
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,914
The throne,

423
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,433
your wife,

424
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,194
your son.

425
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,949
Cole?

426
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,752
Hi, honey. What happened?

427
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,035
There was an accident.

428
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,950
Everything go all right
with whatever you had to do

429
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,429
- with your sisters?
- The good news is we got

430
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,830
- what we were after.
- Good, congratulations.

431
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,469
But...

432
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,196
... I think something really bad
has happened to me.

433
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,598
What, the baby?

434
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,275
No.

435
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,359
The baby's fine.

436
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,438
I threw fire.

437
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,710
I vanquished a demon with it.

438
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,989
And it just felt...

439
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,389
I don't know.

440
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,717
Awful. Almost evil.

441
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,712
That's impossible.

442
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,149
You're the sweetest,
most loving person I've ever known.

443
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,194
You don't have an evil bone
in your body, and you know that.

444
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,239
What? What happened?

445
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,754
Oh, my God.

446
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,877
- Phoebe?
- Stay away from me.

447
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,314
Phoebe.

448
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,871
- Stay away from me.
- What did you see?

449
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,712
Okay.

450
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,311
Oh, that was
the strongest one I had.

451
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,710
- I don't know what else to do.
- I'll tell you what to do.

452
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,869
Keep it.

453
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,720
You know, maybe we should go
see Phoebe. She didn't look so well.

454
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,917
Paige, we'll go over there
after we destroy this book.

455
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,279
I think you're being hasty.

456
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,471
The Grimoire could bring us
great powers.

457
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,995
Listen, we already have powers.
We don't need evil ones too.

458
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,794
- Phoebe?
- I have to talk to you guys.

459
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,473
What is it?

460
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,878
You, you stay where I can see you.

461
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,389
Honey, what is it?

462
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,272
What's the matter?
Whatever it is, it's gonna be all right.

463
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,516
No. It won't.

464
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,872
I had a premonition.
And you were right, Cole is evil.

465
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,670
Oh, honey, I didn't want to be right.

466
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,434
What exactly did you see?

467
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,549
Everything.

468
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,112
Killing, fireball throwing,
working with other demons.

469
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,231
Oh, God, Cole is a demon.

470
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,038
It's okay, Phoebe, just take a breath.

471
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,039
What's taking so long?

472
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,315
Quiet.

473
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,313
I have a baby on the way.

474
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,198
And I have this new power.

475
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,518
I don't know if I can handle this.

476
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,874
It's okay, you're not alone.

477
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,075
You have us.

478
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,597
We got big problems.
Where's the wizard?

479
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,274
He's in there.
We got big problems in here.

480
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,674
Cole. Demon Cole.

481
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,392
What were you gonna say
about the wizard?

482
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,039
Can you handle this right now?

483
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,708
Do I have a choice?

484
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,759
What's taking so long?

485
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,995
Well, according to the Elders,

486
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,113
some wizards are evil,
and if he is, it's not good.

487
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,556
I knew it, and he wants
the Grimoire for himself.

488
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,800
Probably. There's a spell in there
that can consecrate a weapon

489
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,757
and make it strong enough
to kill The Source.

490
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,069
Isn't that a good thing?

491
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,754
No, if he kills The Source,
he becomes The Source.

492
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,354
And he'll have enough magic
to resurrect his people.

493
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,749
What's taking so long?

494
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,879
Wait a minute.

495
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,911
I can't believe we let

496
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,470
that slimy
Lord of the Rings wannabe use us.

497
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,869
- Another illusion?
- On a loop, no less.

498
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,838
He was just waiting
for an opportunity to take the book.

499
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,274
We need to get it back fast.

500
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,193
- How?
- We gotta go back to the underworld.

501
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,029
We couldn't even find
the coronation site without the wizard.

502
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,240
- What about a summoning spell?
- We'd need his blood.

503
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,593
Cole.

504
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,991
I was just thinking
maybe he'd know something.

505
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,390
He is a demon, after all.

506
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,911
I can't even think about Cole
right now,

507
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,274
Iet alone talk to him.

508
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,948
Maybe we could go with you
and watch your back.

509
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,996
That's an awful lot
to ask of her right now.

510
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,593
I know,
but what choice do we have?

511
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,234
There's gonna be a coronation
tonight unless we stop it.

512
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,469
How does it feel?

513
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,395
Heavy.

514
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,315
Focus.

515
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,589
What's the point?

516
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,557
- We don't even have the Grimoire.
- We will.

517
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,873
But in the meantime,
you must keep up appearances.

518
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,600
- But Phoebe--
- Is not your concern at the moment.

519
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,988
She knows I'm a demon,
damn it!

520
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,310
She will come around in time.

521
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,755
I can't do this. I have to find her.

522
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,390
And risk the wizard finding you?

523
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,069
He'll kill you. Take your throne.

524
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,554
He can have it.

525
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,115
And what do you think
your death will solve?

526
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,191
Do you really think it'll bring you
what you seek?

527
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,512
If losing the witch has cost you
your will, then I will get it back.

528
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,309
What do you mean?

529
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,869
Anything?

530
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,837
- He's not here.
- Did you try his office?

531
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,395
I'm beginning to wonder
if he even has an office.

532
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,474
He does.

533
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,391
Who are you?

534
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,755
I know who she is. Where's Cole?

535
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,318
Safe from you.

536
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,796
All right, you wanna punch her,
or should l?

537
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,712
I should have known all along.

538
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,838
You ruined him.
Made him pathetic, weak...

539
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,509
...good.

540
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,318
And I take it you have
a problem with that?

541
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,913
Yeah, I have a big problem with that.

542
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,997
Phoebe, what's going on here?

543
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,077
You were just a means to an end.

544
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,952
A way to sire a magical child.

545
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,480
But now you're hurting him,
and I can't allow that.

546
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,879
- Oh, no?
- No.

547
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,553
Two can play at that game.

548
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,592
- Okay, enough.
- Piper, don't. This is my fight.

549
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,989
Phoebe!

550
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,319
Home wrecker.

551
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,308
Okay, Phoebe, you're scaring us.

552
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,229
What?

553
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,076
Phoebe, fire throwing
is an upper-level demonic power.

554
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,548
Oh, my God.

555
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,313
What's happening to me?

556
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,869
Breathe.

557
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,799
How did I get here?

558
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,874
Through magic.

559
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,150
Dark magic.

560
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,393
Stay away from me.

561
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,434
Stop me.

562
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,759
Feels good, doesn't it?

563
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,034
Or more precisely, evil.

564
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,629
What do you want?

565
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,559
What have you done to me?

566
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,911
What I've done is not important.

567
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,554
What you must do now, however, is.

568
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,309
Your husband needs you
by his side.

569
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,634
- I don't understand.
- Don't you?

570
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,877
You and I share the same gift.

571
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,591
We both can sense the truth.

572
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,231
From the moment Cole
absorbed The Source's power,

573
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,391
you've sensed
something different about him.

574
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,356
Something that's changed
him forever.

575
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,590
You know the truth.

576
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,155
- Cole is The Source.
- Yes.

577
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,278
And he needs your help
if he hopes to survive.

578
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,993
He needs your love.

579
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,756
You can't keep fighting it.

580
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,357
The maternal bond is too strong.
Listen to your body, Phoebe.

581
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,395
Listen to your unborn son.

582
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,994
He takes after his father.

583
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,275
His father lied to me.

584
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,317
He never lied
about his feelings for you.

585
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,797
And despite my best efforts,
he never stopped loving you.

586
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,755
Your son was conceived in love,
you know that.

587
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,151
It's time to stop fighting it.

588
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,638
It's time to embrace
your new family, your new destiny.

589
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,918
Otherwise, Cole and your son
will die.

590
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,190
All of demondom will rise up
against them to destroy them and you.

591
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,633
Leave me.

592
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,233
But the coronation is imminent.

593
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,118
- The wizard--
- Knows that. I know.

594
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,675
Leave.

595
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,118
I knew you'd come for me.

596
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,469
If you wanted my powers...

597
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,993
...all you had to do was ask.

598
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,469
How much longer?

599
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,517
Give me a break, will you?
This is tricky stuff.

600
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,589
Be a lot easier if I could do this
in friendlier confines.

601
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,355
There are no friendly confines,
not anymore.

602
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,228
This had better work, or you'll
be joining the rest of your kind

603
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,549
and not the way you'd hoped for.

604
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,835
A little tip.

605
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,752
Pressure's not the best
motivating technique.

606
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,432
If you wanna lose
The Source's powers, don't rush me.

607
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,228
Fine. But just so we're clear,
once you get The Source's powers,

608
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,198
I never hear from you again.

609
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,273
Understood.

610
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,116
Not that I'm ungrateful,
but why are you so willing to do this?

611
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,154
I lost someone I love,
and I want her back.

612
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,799
That's all you need to know.

613
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,235
Love?

614
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,396
The Source can love.

615
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,153
Just keep working.

616
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,513
I'm done.

617
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,515
Now, if the spell's going to work...

618
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,398
...blood needs to spill.

619
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,593
Now me.

620
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,355
Save him.

621
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,073
For your son.

622
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,996
Maybe you should go back
down to the underworld.

623
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,674
I already tried.
I can't sense her anywhere.

624
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,195
Well, she's gotta be somewhere.

625
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,394
Doesn't she?

626
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,829
Got her.

627
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,715
Are you okay?

628
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,393
What happened?
What did you do?

629
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,194
I vanquished him.

630
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,916
Oh, but he was our last chance.

631
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,319
No, it wasn't.

632
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,189
Thank God we found you.

633
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,595
It's too late.

634
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,352
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

635
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,829
Hey, I thought only evil
can touch that book.

636
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,239
That's right.

637
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,878
Phoebe, what's going on?

638
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,031
I'm embracing my new destiny.

639
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,351
What the hell was that?

640
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,553
That was The Source.
And his queen.

641
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,638
You did this. You poisoned her.

642
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,598
Maybe we should just vanquish you.

643
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,194
You can't.

644
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,193
Not without the power of three.

645
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,032
I can't believe this is happening.

646
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,189
Leo, where did she go?

647
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,669
I can't sense her.

648
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,876
- They must be in the underworld.
- Orb us down there.

649
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,632
We'll drag her home
kicking and screaming.

650
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,633
There is no way we can find
the coronation site without the wizard.

651
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,756
I don't care.
We can't just leave her there.

652
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,309
We don't have a choice.
We'll have to find another way.

653
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,268
Are you sure about this?

654
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,353
You're giving up your life.

655
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,631
My life is with you and our baby.

656
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,952
We'll be strong together.
After all, we're family.

657
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,474
I love you.

658
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,399
It is time.

659
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,558
We're ready.
