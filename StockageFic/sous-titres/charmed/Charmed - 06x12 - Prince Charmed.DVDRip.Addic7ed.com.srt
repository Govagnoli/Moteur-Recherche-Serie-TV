1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,926
Come on, let's go skiing.

2
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,178
I want to, but...

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,515
But what?
What's holding you back?

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,225
Mama, Mama.

5
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,101
Wyatt?

6
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:24,983
He must be pretty special
for you to give up everything.

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,030
Mama. Mama. Mama.

8
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,244
- Mama.
- Wyatt.

9
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,750
Wyatt.

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,175
- Mama.
- Okay.

11
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:55,264
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

12
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:16,451
At last we have found him.

13
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,028
Okay, I think she's upstairs.

14
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,906
- I just got a neck spasm.
- Don't drop the bags, she'll hear you.

15
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,659
- Thanks for your concern.
- You okay?

16
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,453
Yeah, just sometimes it flares up
under stress.

17
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,582
Yeah, and you got enough stress
in your life, that's for damn sure.

18
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,043
With what you guys do, I'm surprised
it doesn't flare up all the time.

19
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,004
It's not demons,
it's this birthday stuff.

20
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,883
Especially Piper's.
I always screw up the surprise.

21
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,969
- I'll take these to the kitchen.
- Oh, thanks.

22
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,555
Plus, I have no idea
what I'm gonna get her,

23
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,473
and, obviously, time is running out.

24
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,643
Paige, I told you you could come in on
the dinner with me. I don't mind.

25
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,438
I appreciate that, but I don't want to
jump on your bandwagon.

26
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,440
I wanna do my own thing.

27
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,151
Well, being a mom, I can tell you
that a nice, normal dinner

28
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,361
with friends and family
is a perfect gift.

29
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,947
Especially since you guys
don't live here anymore.

30
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:03,160
No, the perfect gift actually
doesn't exist anymore.

31
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,122
- Do tell.
- Hey, do these go?

32
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,082
- Oh, no, grab those two.
- Okay.

33
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,919
It's a charm bracelet
that mom gave Piper.

34
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,171
And Piper loved it,
but then Prue lost it.

35
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,340
- Why don't we cast a...?
- A lost-and-found spell?

36
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,883
I tried. It didn't work.

37
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,928
Is Jason coming to the party?

38
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:25,015
No, he's in some faraway land,
like Zimbabwe or something.

39
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:28,143
That must be fun, you guys travelling
all around the world together.

40
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,604
Yeah, it's... It's nice.

41
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,356
I just... I really miss home.

42
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,941
I'm happy to be here right now.

43
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,068
What about your beau,
is he coming?

44
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:40,531
Richard? No. He's kind of got
a bit of a problem with magic.

45
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,949
Or it has a problem with him.

46
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,410
- He doesn't like it?
- No, magic just doesn't like him.

47
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,412
It's a long story.

48
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,499
- So it's just us then?
- What about Leo?

49
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,460
Yeah, we kind of thought that
that was inappropriate.

50
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,382
- That's her. Out, out. Hurry.
- We'll see you tomorrow.

51
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,008
Okay.

52
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,554
Go! Paige, the groceries.

53
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,100
- Hey.
- Hey.

54
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,727
How's that surprise party going?

55
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,613
What do you...? What do you mean,
surprise party?

56
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,031
There's no surprise party.

57
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,325
Just do me a favour
and don't invite Greg.

58
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,370
Or any other guys, for that matter,
because I'm done with them.

59
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:32,124
- I'm sorry?
- It's kind of an epiphany I had.

60
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,960
Right after I vanquished a demon
in Wyatt's room.

61
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,670
Wait, excuse me?

62
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:40,090
- You know, an epiphany, a revelation.
- No, I know about the epiphany.

63
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,508
What do you mean, a demon?

64
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:45,012
- Okay, why didn't you call us?
- Well, I didn't wanna bother you.

65
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,972
It's no big deal.
I blew him up, he's gone.

66
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:50,017
You know every time you say that
they come back with a vengeance.

67
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,144
- Kiss of death.
- It doesn't matter,

68
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,687
because I'm on it full-time now.

69
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,649
I'm actually thinking of selling the club
because I have a new mission in life.

70
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,902
And it's all become very clear to me.

71
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,320
Would you care to elaborate?

72
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,033
Do you guys know that Wyatt
called me "Mama"?

73
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:11,163
- He did? Oh, his first word.
- Right after he was attacked.

74
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,333
I don't think I'm gonna be putting that
in his baby book.

75
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,377
Back to giving up guys...

76
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,671
It's kind of freeing, actually.

77
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,673
You know, not having to play
the dating game.

78
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,426
It was just a big waste of time
for me, anyway.

79
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:29,139
I mean, I gave it my best shot, I did,
but it just didn't work out for me.

80
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:33,227
Okay, that is completely ridiculous.
You've been single for six months.

81
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,356
No, that's fate.
It's my fate, and I accept it.

82
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:41,902
Apparently, you get one soul mate
in a lifetime, so I guess Leo was mine.

83
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,573
And now I'm ready to devote my life
to protecting and raising Wyatt.

84
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,867
What about sex?

85
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,411
Well, you know, I'm the mother,

86
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,705
of one of the most magical
creatures ever.

87
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:57,042
Sex rather pales in comparison,
don't you think?

88
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:04,299
She doesn't need a party,
she needs an intervention.

89
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,847
He led us long ago.

90
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,683
And once he returns,
he will lead us again

91
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,563
and will reward you
for your unwavering faith.

92
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:25,863
Help us to cleanse him of the poison
that has corrupted him.

93
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,283
Turn him,
that he might lower his guard,

94
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,369
so that we may return him
to the fold.

95
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,038
To his destiny.

96
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,226
Okay, Piper couldn't find the demon
in the Book.

97
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,561
Any luck up here?

98
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,521
Actually, I'm working on
something else.

99
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:04,151
- A vanquishing potion?
- No, a birthday present.

100
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:05,986
A birthday present?

101
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,530
Paige, you're not gonna be able
to find the charm bracelet.

102
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:12,492
Trust me, this will be even better.
The perfect gift.

103
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,703
Okay, what are you talking about?

104
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,872
I figure Piper has no love
in her life right now,

105
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,458
so I think she needs
a little love back in her life.

106
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,252
- Okay, so you're making a love potion?
- No.

107
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,921
I'm making a love machine.

108
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,800
I am making the perfect man.

109
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,513
Are you kidding me?
Are you out of your mind?

110
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,598
No, I don't think I am.

111
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,476
Listen, we've conjured
magical beings before,

112
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,228
so, you know, hey,
what's the big deal?

113
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,813
The big deal is they always
come back to bite us in the ass.

114
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,857
No, this one won't.
He's just gonna be around

115
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,943
for her birthday
from midnight to midnight.

116
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,570
Paige, we can't just conjure up
a sex toy.

117
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,324
Listen, I figure magic owes Piper.

118
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,076
It has taken away
the love of her life,

119
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:57,204
and now it's threatening to take away
love from the rest of her life?

120
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:01,458
Look, I get Wyatt is super important.
All right, I do get that.

121
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,128
But I think this could be
for the greater good.

122
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,966
Okay, let's write down
some qualities.

123
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,134
Qualities?
What do you mean, qualities?

124
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,679
You know, qualities
for the perfect man.

125
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:18,475
Oh, okay, well, I think she would
want someone that lives nearby,

126
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,185
you know, and doesn't travel a lot.

127
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,479
Yeah, well, I would write down
something about

128
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,857
somebody who I could do magic
in front of.

129
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,567
But these are qualities
you and I want,

130
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,194
not qualities that Piper
would necessarily want.

131
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,363
Right, okay.

132
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,740
I think she wants, you know,

133
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:38,036
a strong man, but someone that's
not afraid to show his sensitive side.

134
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,914
Sensitive but not a wuss-bag.

135
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:44,585
And someone that is a good listener.

136
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,380
- Okay, good cook.
- Handy around the house.

137
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,843
- Good with kids.
- Gets the whole normal-life thing.

138
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:56,430
- Has a really big...
- Paige.

139
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,223
Is this the perfect guy or what?

140
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,934
All right, throw it in.

141
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,190
How am I supposed to protect Wyatt

142
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,026
if you don't tell me when a demon
attacks until hours later?

143
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,487
Because, Chris, I'm taking care of it.

144
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,240
That's fine, but what happens
if this demon was the one?

145
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:18,202
The one who was after Wyatt,
the reason why I came back?

146
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,705
Well, then you're in luck,
because I blew him up.

147
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:25,542
Not to mention, how many demons
have you said that about so far?

148
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,670
Piper, I've just got Wyatt's
best interest in mind.

149
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,256
So do I. Demon's not in here.

150
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,967
Well, what does it look like?

151
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,763
Tall, robed, with a metal-rod thingy.

152
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,974
Really? Well, that narrows it down.

153
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,227
If another one shows up, I'll be here.

154
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,479
That's just my point, Piper.
What if you're not?

155
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,689
What happens if you're on a date
with a fireman

156
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,483
or whoever else
you're seeing this week?

157
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,236
Look, Chris, I don't wanna
go into it,

158
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,572
but I'm not gonna be out on a date
with a fireman.

159
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,367
Or anybody else, for that matter,
anytime soon,

160
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,410
so that I can focus more on Wyatt.

161
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,580
- What?
- Did I stutter?

162
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,960
Piper, you can't give up
on love. Ever.

163
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,839
- Why not?
- Because you just can't, that's why.

164
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,757
It's not natural.

165
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,720
All I'm saying is you don't have to make
that type of sacrifice to protect Wyatt.

166
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:23,517
- That's why I'm here.
- You weren't here earlier, were you?

167
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,603
But the only thing that matters
right now is what's best for Wyatt.

168
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,605
This is not what's best for Wyatt,
Piper.

169
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:29,815
How do you know?

170
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:32,317
I've seen the future, and this isn't
supposed to happen.

171
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,361
So, what is supposed to happen?

172
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,196
Come on, you know I can't
answer that.

173
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,031
Since you're from the future
to change it,

174
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,367
maybe this one of the things
that needs to be changed.

175
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:44,705
No, it's not. Believe me, it's not.

176
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,251
Who left this?

177
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,295
If you're so concerned
about protecting Wyatt,

178
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,047
- there's other ways to go about it.
- Like what?

179
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,050
Like letting Leo take him up there
for a while.

180
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,344
Or...

181
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,933
You could always bind his powers.

182
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:09,229
Leo left me a birthday present.
How sweet.

183
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,066
What do you think
about what I said?

184
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,318
About what?

185
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,279
- About binding Wyatt's powers.
- No way.

186
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:21,200
Why not? Nobody would ever be
after him and you'd have your life back.

187
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,662
But that would be selfish of me,
wouldn't it?

188
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,373
To put my needs before his destiny?

189
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,920
I'm not being a martyr, Chris.
Really, I'm not. I just get it now.

190
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,757
I'm the mother of a very special child,
that if I do my job right,

191
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,218
he's gonna grow up to do
very special things.

192
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,553
What could possibly be
more important than that?

193
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,977
Sweetie, you go back to sleep.

194
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,896
And I will be right back.

195
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,239
Okay, I can't think of anything else.

196
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,992
One more thing.
Magical pheromones.

197
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,078
Magical pheromones?

198
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:09,206
Yeah, see, it's just one thing
to give him an extra shot.

199
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,417
To help Piper be a little bit more
receptive since he's only got a day.

200
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,712
I hope we're doing the right thing.
I hope this doesn't backfire.

201
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,297
I don't think it will.

202
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:21,176
If this were a date, honey,
this would be the martini.

203
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,928
Okay.

204
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:27,432
A perfect man, we summon now
Another way we don't know how

205
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:33,188
To make our sister see the light
Somewhere out there is Mr. Right

206
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,087
Hello.

207
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,548
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

208
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,226
- Okay, remember, she's gonna freak.
- Big-time.

209
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,521
- So just get close as you can to her...
- Yeah, really, really close.

210
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,940
- And you just let those pheromones
do their magic.

211
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:21,111
- So you could do your magic.
- Ladies, ladies, please.

212
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,031
You created me to know
exactly what Piper wants.

213
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,116
Don't worry.

214
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,459
I have a question for you.

215
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,794
Since when is Piper into
hot Latin types?

216
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,214
Since I put in
the hot-Latin-type ingredient.

217
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,425
- Oh, Phoebe.
- What, are you complaining?

218
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:52,601
Happy birthday, Piper.

219
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,605
Eggs Benedict, easy yolk.

220
00:14:56,772 --> 00:15:01,443
Steamed asparagus, fresh fruit.
Orange juice, no pulp.

221
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,362
How did I do?

222
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,365
Phoebe! Paige!

223
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,033
Yeah?

224
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,078
What's going on? Who is this?

225
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:15,457
Well, this is your birthday present.

226
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,211
From me, although, you know,
Phoebe helped.

227
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,715
- The breakfast?
- No, the muchacho.

228
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:32,391
Wait, you...? You hired
a guy for my birthday?

229
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,727
No, we would never hire a guy
for your birthday.

230
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:39,523
We made him, magically.

231
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,363
You know what,
this is Paige's present for you.

232
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,448
Mine's the surprise birthday party.

233
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,076
I know you're pretty mad,
aren't you?

234
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,458
Traitor.

235
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,335
I knew we should have
used more pheromones.

236
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,588
Hey, you.

237
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,631
- Okay.
- Piper, wait.

238
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:08,343
No, not until you send him back
to wherever you conjured him from.

239
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,387
We can't, not until
your birthday is over.

240
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:13,140
Yeah, so why not take advantage
of him while you can?

241
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,434
I mean, figuratively speaking,
of course.

242
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,686
Oh, hell, literally, it is your birthday.

243
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:21,648
I can't believe you guys did this.
Did you not hear me yesterday?

244
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:22,983
No, we did, loud and clear.

245
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,861
Yeah, we just wanted you
to change your mind.

246
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,614
So you whipped up a magical gigolo?

247
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,949
Oh, criminy, just give him a chance.

248
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,952
How could you resist him?
Did you look at him?

249
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:38,123
This is like something we would do
years ago, before we knew better.

250
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,834
But now we do know better,
at least we're supposed to.

251
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:44,171
You know what? Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

252
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,548
I'm sorry, are you all right?

253
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:51,595
Yeah, no, I'm pissed, remember?
Are you wearing cologne?

254
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:56,642
- No, you don't like cologne.
- No, I don't, do I?

255
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,393
But what does she like?

256
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,856
Well, she likes long walks
on the beach,

257
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,858
shopping at the Embarcadero,

258
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:10,239
lunching at Zuni,
deep-dish moussakas.

259
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,744
Well, that...
Yeah, that sounds great but...

260
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:18,413
So, what are we waiting for?

261
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,333
No, I can't, because the demon.

262
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,293
We'll take care of the demon.
It's done.

263
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,504
Well, what about Wyatt?
I can't just leave him.

264
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:26,964
Can't we take him with us?

265
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:29,800
You know, maybe go to the fair?

266
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:32,553
Or perhaps the zoo?

267
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,265
I'll get dressed.

268
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:40,561
I'll get him.
Unless you don't want me to.

269
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,229
No, no, you can get him.

270
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,190
- Okay. Excuse me, girls.
- Yeah.

271
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,526
- Bye.
- Bye.

272
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,821
- Cool your jets, lady, it's for Piper.
- Right.

273
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,114
- Stay on target.
- Yeah.

274
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,370
Oh, finally. I've been calling you for
hours, man. Where have you been?

275
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,038
- What's up?
- What's up?

276
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,291
- Your son was attacked yesterday.
- What?

277
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,834
Don't worry, he's fine.

278
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:05,961
- Piper vanquished the demon.
- Who was he?

279
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,172
That's the problem,
he's not in the Book.

280
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:11,633
We have to figure out who he is
in case there's another attempt.

281
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,510
On that point,
I have a radical suggestion,

282
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,263
a way of protecting Wyatt
from any and all future attempts.

283
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,472
I'm listening.

284
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,933
We get the sisters
to bind Wyatt's powers.

285
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,312
- No way.
- Come on, Leo.

286
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,065
Binding Wyatt's powers solves
all our problems, believe me.

287
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,194
No, Wyatt wasn't brought
into this world to be bound.

288
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,029
I can't condone that.

289
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,907
Unless there's something
you're not telling me.

290
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,327
All right, then we need to figure out
who's after Wyatt.

291
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:40,621
Okay. How?

292
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,916
Right here, above the din of the city.

293
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,212
It's why I come up here.

294
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:50,380
Just close your eyes.

295
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:53,008
Rely on your inner senses.

296
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,844
Listen to the wind.

297
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,619
We're running out of volunteers.

298
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:24,039
If we can't turn the model,
if we can't get it to lower its guard,

299
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,999
we won't be able
to turn the child, either.

300
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,255
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

301
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,882
It's because of my faith I raise
the concern, your eminence.

302
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,802
The acolytes grow restless,
the search has been long.

303
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,887
Without reassurance
that he can be converted,

304
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,014
their evil may splinter off or scatter.

305
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,474
What do you suggest?

306
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:44,685
Another encounter with the child.

307
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:48,313
To read his mind again, to better see
how his morals have been twisted.

308
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,734
I offer myself to the cause.

309
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,239
Your sacrifice will be rewarded.

310
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,701
But the witches will be
prepared this time,

311
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,453
which means you'll have to go in
as someone they know.

312
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,291
Trust.

313
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,763
Him.

314
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,730
Fly to New York right now, Jason?

315
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,398
You're so cute.
I would love to, but...

316
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:35,110
But she's busy setting
a demonic alarm system.

317
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:41,575
No, she said we're busy watching
a mechanic set up an alarm system.

318
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,786
You know us girls
can never be too careful.

319
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,622
Baby, can I call you back later?

320
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,624
Okay, I love you too. Bye.

321
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,834
- Cute, very cute.
- Just trying to help out.

322
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,419
What, you trying to blow my secret?

323
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,963
You said you're gonna have
to tell him sooner or later.

324
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,425
Yeah, but I wanna be the one
to tell him, not AT&T.

325
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:01,261
Hey, why are you in such
a good mood?

326
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:05,766
Well, it's nice to practice magic
without feeling guilty.

327
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,437
I guess we all have guy problems,
right?

328
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,441
Where's Piper?

329
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,568
She's out, why?

330
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,321
We know who attacked Wyatt,
and they're gonna attack again.

331
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,573
- Who?
- A demonic cult called the Order.

332
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,576
Used to be the most powerful force
until their leader was vanquished.

333
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:27,913
And guess what?
They think he's been reincarnated.

334
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,415
Wyatt?

335
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,960
He's young enough
to be turned evil, especially by them.

336
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,337
Where is Wyatt, is he with Piper?

337
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:40,259
Anybody home? A little help here.

338
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,469
Where have you been?

339
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:45,180
Well, everywhere, actually.

340
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:48,642
First we went shopping,
and then we went for a boat ride,

341
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:53,564
and then we had a picnic in the park,
and then we stopped at the fair.

342
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,107
Piper?

343
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,609
- Where's Wyatt?
- Oh, he's coming.

344
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:00,696
If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands

345
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,615
If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands

346
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:06,201
Hello.

347
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:09,955
Who are you?

348
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,001
He's... He's, you know, just a date.

349
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,961
A guy.

350
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,630
You know, you don't
have a name yet, do you?

351
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:21,175
What does that mean,
he doesn't have a name?

352
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:25,387
Why not call me David?
You've always liked that name, no?

353
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:30,017
No. I mean, yes. Isn't he perfect?

354
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,394
What the hell is going on?

355
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,521
You don't have to feel
threatened by me, Leo.

356
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,940
No one could ever replace you
in Wyatt's eyes.

357
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:40,235
And Piper wouldn't want anyone to.

358
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,906
- Phoebe?
- Yeah, okay.

359
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,408
Why don't you guys
put Wyatt down for a nap.

360
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:50,204
I'm sure he's really tired
from all this excitement. Come on

361
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:51,663
Okay.

362
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,501
If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands

363
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:01,048
And don't forget to turn off
the demonic alarm system.

364
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:05,636
You know, in case the baby
mistakes him for a...

365
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:07,930
...demon.

366
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,643
All right, fine. So I made him
out of my own little brew.

367
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,019
You what?

368
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:17,231
Piper was gonna give up on love,
on her birthday, nonetheless.

369
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,566
- So you conjured a man?
- No.

370
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:22,194
Not just a man, the perfect man.

371
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,531
See, he's somebody who knows
exactly what she wants,

372
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:29,034
and he's just gonna be here
long enough to straighten her out.

373
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:30,911
Twenty-four hours.
It's great, right?

374
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,541
Yeah, not even 24, more like eight.
And then, sadly, he goes poof.

375
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,962
Yeah. You don't want her to live life
without love, do you, Leo?

376
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,966
We'll talk about this later,
after we deal with the Order.

377
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:45,425
Okay.

378
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,929
Is this a bad time?
I just wanted to drop this off.

379
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:52,307
Darryl, why didn't you
just wait till dinner?

380
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:53,767
Dinner?

381
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,521
Actually, this is for Wyatt.

382
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,439
So he has a little something
to open up too.

383
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:01,275
Oh, that's so sweet.

384
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,114
Sheila's idea, actually.
Mind if I give it to him?

385
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:09,241
Oh, sure, yeah. They're upstairs.

386
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:10,617
Thanks.

387
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:14,329
Don't you think maybe we should
cancel the dinner party?

388
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,123
No.

389
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,816
- Darryl, right?
- Right.

390
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,028
How's it going?

391
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:49,031
Hi, what are you doing here?

392
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:52,534
Oh, I just bought the little guy
a present.

393
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:56,830
Oh, that's really sweet,
but we just put him down for a nap.

394
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:59,875
I'll sneak it in so he can see it
when he wakes up.

395
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,836
- He'll never know I was here.
- Okay.

396
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:05,506
No problem.

397
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,947
- What's up?
- We need to talk.

398
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:31,907
Wyatt may be in danger.

399
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,494
Why is it doing that?

400
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,081
You stay here.

401
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:49,842
- You're okay.
- Is he okay?

402
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,051
You're okay.

403
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,387
Did he hurt him?

404
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,975
No, I think he's okay.

405
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,190
Success.

406
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:07,526
We shall see.

407
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,460
He's ready to come home.

408
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,305
- Darryl?
- He's okay.

409
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,182
He said they didn't get
anywhere near him.

410
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:39,558
Oh, thank God.

411
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:42,186
Yeah, my question is how they
even know to impersonate him.

412
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:45,564
They must have been watching you,
who you trusted and let near him.

413
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,107
That's really creepy.

414
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:50,110
It's gonna get a lot creepier if we don't
stop them getting to Wyatt.

415
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,862
Well, we have a thought about that.

416
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:56,200
- "We"?
- Yeah, well, we've been talking,

417
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:59,119
and I think we need to give Chris'
idea another chance.

418
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:03,040
- What idea?
- About binding Wyatt's powers.

419
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,625
- What?
- What?

420
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,376
I'm just saying
we should consider it.

421
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,796
- If you think about it, it makes sense.
- You can't be serious.

422
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:11,798
Actually, she's never been
more serious.

423
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,800
Excuse me, I was talking to her.

424
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,637
This doesn't sound like you, Piper.

425
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:19,640
Doesn't it?
Piper wants to protect her son.

426
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:23,393
She wants a normal life.
This way she can have both.

427
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,479
Hey, that was my argument.

428
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:26,855
Well, that's a good one.

429
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:30,317
No, that's not a good one.
That's a bad one, a very bad one.

430
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:32,986
One that's been discussed
and discarded already.

431
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,614
But that was before demonic cults
started targeting him.

432
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:37,115
- This could be...
- Oh, what?

433
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,743
Just another big, bad evil thing
that's coming after him?

434
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,953
Yeah, yeah, we got it.

435
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,997
- That still isn't a good enough reason.
- Well, Piper thinks it is.

436
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:46,250
Hey, buddy,
don't forget who made you.

437
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,877
That's right, you did make him,
didn't you?

438
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,504
Piper, I don't understand.

439
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:53,507
Yesterday you were willing to give up
everything for Wyatt's future.

440
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:56,051
- Why this now?
- Well, you should know.

441
00:27:56,218 --> 00:28:01,390
You're the one that showed me
what I really wanted and really need.

442
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,100
She's got us there.

443
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,936
Well, it doesn't matter because
it's gonna take the power of three

444
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:08,105
to bind someone
as powerful as Wyatt,

445
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,940
and I'm not gonna support it.

446
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,275
Neither am I.

447
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,819
Well, then we have a problem,
because I am.

448
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:18,532
All right, why don't we all
just take a deep breath, okay?

449
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,577
Leo, why don't you orb Wyatt
up there until we can figure this out?

450
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,912
Gladly. Do you mind?

451
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:25,831
No, please.

452
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,801
All right, and why don't we...

453
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:39,553
- David, right?
- David.

454
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,931
Why don't you come with me
and let the girls talk alone for a minute.

455
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:49,605
So you got quite an influence
on Piper, don't you?

456
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,899
Well, I just reflect what she wants.

457
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:54,318
Interesting.

458
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:56,778
They just wrote down what
she wanted, and that was that?

459
00:28:57,196 --> 00:28:59,865
I don't know. I guess.

460
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:02,993
Let's see.

461
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,670
What were we just talking about?

462
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:17,257
Paige, and what she looks for
in a man.

463
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:18,467
Paige?

464
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:22,888
She wants a man who she can
openly practice magic around.

465
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,725
One she won't feel suppressed by.

466
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:28,227
Good, very good.

467
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:35,275
And what about Phoebe?

468
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:41,448
Phoebe? She wants the same thing.

469
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:45,911
Plus she wants him to be available
to live near her home.

470
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,246
That's what she wants.

471
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,915
This potion packs a hell of a punch,
doesn't it?

472
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:52,417
Of course, in order for them to be
with the perfect man,

473
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,628
is if they're happy
with each other first.

474
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:57,965
And the only way they can be
happy with each other first

475
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:01,677
is agreeing to bind Wyatt's powers.

476
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:14,022
Pheromones? What the hell.

477
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:17,901
This is my son we're talking about.

478
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:19,653
Piper, you're not listening to reason.

479
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,488
Phoebe, his life is in jeopardy.

480
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:24,366
And binding his powers may be
the only way to save him.

481
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:27,578
That's all that saved him.
Paige, please help me.

482
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,997
Well, I think that...

483
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,084
Oh, here, allow me.

484
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,088
Just relax, okay?

485
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,010
You keep all the tension
in your shoulders.

486
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:44,344
You're right.

487
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,389
I love your cologne.

488
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:50,309
Hey, that's my birthday present.

489
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,269
All day and all night.

490
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:57,733
Hey, what's going on? I thought you
were gonna keep him occupied?

491
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,361
I was, but I figured I had to break
the impasse between you three, so...

492
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:03,489
Really, how?

493
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:06,867
Hey.

494
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:17,461
Don't worry.
I'm here for you, Phoebe.

495
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:22,883
Not off taking care of business
in some faraway land.

496
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,177
Yeah, I like the sound of that.

497
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:28,805
So, what do we think about
binding Wyatt's powers?

498
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,516
Knock, knock.

499
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:32,017
Surprise.

500
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:36,396
Oh, hey. You guys need this?
Found this by the door.

501
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:39,650
Yes, we need it by the door.
Don't touch our crystals.

502
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:42,361
At least we know it's really Darryl.

503
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,491
- Hey.
- Oh, and who's he?

504
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:52,246
- Oh, this is David.
- Hi.

505
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,666
Actually, guys, the dinner has
been cancelled, sorry.

506
00:31:56,166 --> 00:32:00,546
Why? The girls still want to party,
don't you?

507
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,339
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

508
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:05,008
But the dinner isn't even made.

509
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:07,511
Oh, I can fix that.

510
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:13,600
On Piper's day, set this table
With all the favours you are able

511
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:25,654
Not bad, huh?

512
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:28,490
No, no, this isn't right.
This isn't what they want.

513
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:31,118
Hey, if it makes them happy,
it's all I want.

514
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:33,036
Come on, have a seat.

515
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:36,915
What about Wyatt? Anyone?

516
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:41,712
The child, he's gone.

517
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:45,215
- Can you sense him?
- No.

518
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:50,012
But they won't keep him away
for long. We'll wait.

519
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:59,938
So how long have you known
the girls?

520
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:02,774
Fourteen, 15 hours, I guess.

521
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:04,735
Did you say hours?

522
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:08,780
Oh, yeah, I made him, magically.

523
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,492
Actually, we both made him.

524
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,784
For my birthday.

525
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:15,746
- Hell of a gift.
- Yeah.

526
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:18,790
We just wanted to remind Piper
of the importance of love.

527
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,250
Love?

528
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:24,630
Spiritual, emotional,
deep-in-your-heart love.

529
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:28,425
The kind you should never,
ever stop searching for, Piper.

530
00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:31,470
I know, you're right, I know.

531
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:32,888
You're going to have it too.

532
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:35,557
I promise.

533
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:36,850
Your normal life.

534
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,103
What about me?

535
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:43,232
You shouldn't have to hide
your secret anymore.

536
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:46,860
- I understand you.
- I know you do.

537
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:54,284
- What about my dinner?
- Magical, Paige, just the way I like it.

538
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:57,621
They're really good peas.

539
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:03,794
- Excuse me. Wyatt, anyone?
- Later.

540
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:11,552
Is this some kind of demonic thing?

541
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,637
No, it's some sort of
messed-up thing.

542
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:19,476
- Maybe we should go.
- Good idea.

543
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:24,022
Hey, y'all need to make
your own present.

544
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,569
Hey, off of the lap.

545
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:40,038
I see.

546
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:44,251
- You're gonna play with cake now.
- Cake!

547
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:51,383
Girls, girls. Come on,
there's plenty of me to go around.

548
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:58,098
Well, thanks for dinner.

549
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:01,018
Happy birthday.

550
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:05,355
How are you making them happy
if they're fighting?

551
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:07,399
Get them to
bind Wyatt's powers now.

552
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,488
Are you sure about this?

553
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:15,616
What you want more than anything
is to get along.

554
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,201
And this will help you do that.

555
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,954
I'm pretty sure what we want more
than anything is a good dry cleaner.

556
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,623
Leo.

557
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:32,674
- What happened?
- You don't wanna know.

558
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:34,718
We're binding Wyatt's powers.

559
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:37,971
- What?
- We already decided.

560
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:40,224
You can't be serious.

561
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,193
He is one of us now.

562
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:02,913
Listen to me, what are you doing?

563
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,918
The pheromones wore off,
right after they took my son.

564
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:10,337
You don't seriously
believe this is my fault, do you?

565
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:13,382
So it's just a big coincidence
we all fell under Mr. Right's spell?

566
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:16,510
And then suddenly we all wanna
bind Wyatt's powers?

567
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:18,846
You see, Chris, what they really
want is for you...

568
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:20,305
For you to leave.

569
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,432
I knew that.

570
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,105
- This is crazy. Leo, tell them.
- Tell them what?

571
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:29,898
I'm wondering
the same thing myself.

572
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:34,486
Okay, so what if I did?
I was only trying to protect Wyatt.

573
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:36,864
- By tricking us?
- I had to.

574
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,991
- Why?
- Because the only reason I came here

575
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:40,617
is to keep Wyatt from turning evil.

576
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:42,870
Turning evil?

577
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:45,372
Don't you mean "stopping evil
from hurting him"?

578
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:48,458
I didn't think you'd help me
if you knew the truth.

579
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,878
I knew you wouldn't.

580
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:54,965
The evil from the future
I came back to stop isn't a demon.

581
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:58,510
- It's Wyatt.
- You're lying.

582
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:00,137
No, I'm not.

583
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,723
He's gonna grow up
and terrorize people with his powers.

584
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,308
Take over.

585
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:06,268
Kill, even.

586
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:10,480
Why should we believe you
after all the lies?

587
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:13,358
- Because you have to.
- No, Chris, we don't, actually.

588
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,611
Fine, don't. Either way,
we need to save Wyatt now.

589
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,321
And I'm the one who
knows how to do it.

590
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:19,323
- Oh, really? How?
- The Order.

591
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,409
They used their powers to turn him,
to reverse his morality.

592
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:25,245
See, he thinks bad is good now
and good is bad.

593
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,706
- That's why his shield repelled you.
- So?

594
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:30,792
So Wyatt brings his shield up
around me.

595
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:33,170
- He thinks I'm a threat.
- Yeah, so do I.

596
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:37,257
Listen to me. They reversed
his sense of morality.

597
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:41,595
That means his shield will protect him
from you, but not from me.

598
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:44,723
Please, I'm the only one
who can save him.

599
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:49,436
- Let me help.
- Chris, we don't need your help.

600
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:53,023
I will get my son back, and when I do,
I don't wanna see you anymore.

601
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:00,572
I'm sorry.

602
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:21,885
Behold, he has returned to us,

603
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:25,806
to his rightful place,
to one day lead us back to...

604
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,327
He protects me now,

605
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:49,163
not you.

606
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:10,350
Pick up the sceptre
and point it at Wyatt.

607
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:16,732
Trust me.

608
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,874
How come he didn't raise his shield
back up for you?

609
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,792
I don't know.

610
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:38,754
Looks like he trusts me now,
at least.

611
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,861
Good place to think, isn't it?

612
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,906
- What do you want?
- Just to talk.

613
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:10,369
You know, Chris,
trust is a precious commodity.

614
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:13,747
Once you lose it,
it's pretty hard to get it back.

615
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:16,208
Where'd you read that,
a fortune cookie?

616
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,418
Don't be a smart-ass.
It doesn't help your cause.

617
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,505
My cause? Pretty much
screwed that up, don't you think?

618
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:23,507
I don't know.

619
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:25,509
Are you saying you still trust me?

620
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:27,719
It's not my trust that matters,
it's the sisters'.

621
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:32,015
I know.

622
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:35,811
So, what do I do?

623
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:37,980
Just be straight with them, that's all.

624
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:39,940
Don't manipulate them.

625
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:42,025
Even if it is for the right reason.

626
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,489
And for what it's worth,
yes, I do trust you.

627
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:51,368
After all, you saved my son
from turning evil, didn't you?

628
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:55,372
For now.

629
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,177
Hi, I was just coming up to find you.

630
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:10,095
I know.

631
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:13,724
Yeah, see that's still
kind of weird to me.

632
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:15,309
I know that too.

633
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,563
Listen, thanks for cleaning up
the mess.

634
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,982
You really are a perfect guy.

635
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:23,775
My pleasure.

636
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:27,488
Well...

637
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,284
...I already said goodbye
to your sisters.

638
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:35,287
Now it's your turn.

639
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,166
I feel like I should apologize
or something.

640
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,459
Why?

641
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:42,628
I'm okay
with what's about to happen.

642
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:46,215
Really. I was made that way.

643
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:48,675
Weird.

644
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:50,761
Did you at least
have a good birthday?

645
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:56,141
It was interesting, to say the least.

646
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:59,186
You can't live without love, Piper.

647
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:01,104
We both know that.

648
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:03,398
That's all your sisters
were trying to tell you.

649
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:12,991
Don't ever stop dreaming about me.

650
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:15,369
And never stop looking for love.

651
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:30,300
Happy birthday, Piper.

652
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:52,823
You go to sleep.
