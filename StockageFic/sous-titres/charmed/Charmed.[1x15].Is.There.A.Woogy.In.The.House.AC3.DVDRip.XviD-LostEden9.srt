1
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,563
Oh, God. Not another aftershock.

2
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,900
At least they're getting smaller.
What was the main one, 4.3?

3
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,944
- Radio said 4.5.
- There you go, Grams.

4
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,991
- Earthquakes give me the jeebies.
- Would that be the Phoebe-jeebies?

5
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,660
Oh, you know, the comedy stylings
of Prue Halliwell.

6
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,954
The only Halliwell that
actually likes earthquakes.

7
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,832
I don't like them, but I don't go
running through the house naked,

8
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,667
screaming, "Run for you life," either.

9
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,961
Okay, that is such an exaggeration.

10
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,881
I was wearing slippers.

11
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,301
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Does anybody smell that?

12
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,304
Yeah. I caught a whiff of it
first thing this morning.

13
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,098
- I think it's coming from the basement.
- Gas leak?

14
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,350
I don't know. I called someone
to come and check.

15
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,561
They should be here any...

16
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,272
Now. I'll get it.

17
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,068
- We're never gonna pull this off.
- Everything's gonna be fine.

18
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,196
Yeah, until the house blows up.

19
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,865
Look, this Buckland's VIP
specifically requested

20
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,408
for the dinner party to be here.

21
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,911
Now, Claire may have prodded me
into agreeing.

22
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,414
- But the point is, I did agree and...
- Nothing has changed.

23
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,125
Piper's gonna cook a feast.
I will serve with grace.

24
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,002
And Claire will kiss your ass.

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,920
- Tronomical talents.

26
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,505
Morning, ladies.

27
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,132
Wow, that's the smell.

28
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,343
Doesn't really smell like gas.

29
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,887
Yeah. But if it is,
we can't light the stove.

30
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,430
No stove. No dinner.

31
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:41,142
Relax. I can have it cooked
at the restaurant and brought here.

32
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,269
Well, let me check it out,
see what's up.

33
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,938
Great. Thanks.
The basement is thataway.

34
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,191
Okay. Thanks.

35
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,489
Look, Phoebe. He's going
into the basement. Alone.

36
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:57,199
Don't even start.

37
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,870
What if, dare I say it,
the bogeyman gets him?

38
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,624
I believe Phoebe
pronounced it "Woogyman."

39
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,084
Or was that just the buckteeth?

40
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,836
Okay, I was 5 years old, you guys.

41
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,380
Oh, so, what, now you're over it?

42
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:14,675
Which is, I guess, why you haven't
been down there in what, 18 years?

43
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,094
Okay. You guys were not there.

44
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:20,014
- It was real. It was this...
- A story.

45
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:22,683
Grams told you she got rid
of the Woogyman in the basement

46
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,310
so you could sleep better.

47
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:04,224
What the...?

48
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,354
You have freed me.

49
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:13,984
And now you'll help
take back the house.

50
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:24,077
Who is Chanda Lier?

51
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:26,246
Oh, that's me. I ordered some CDs.

52
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:29,583
Using a fake name
to score some free CDs?

53
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,168
Isn't that a little dishonest?

54
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:33,920
Phoebe's dark side
rearing its ugly head?

55
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:36,006
I do not have a dark side,
thank you very much.

56
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:37,674
Just because I protect the innocent,

57
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,218
doesn't mean I have to be innocent
all of the time.

58
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:41,636
Oh, I don't know.

59
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:44,389
Still believing in the Woogyman
is pretty innocent.

60
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:45,891
And it's very cute too.

61
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:48,768
You didn't think it was so cute
when we were all sharing a room

62
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:50,145
and she kept you up all night.

63
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:53,940
It was scary and it was real.

64
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:57,652
So, what's the verdict?

65
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:58,987
Bad.

66
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:02,073
Bad as in destroying
my entire dinner party?

67
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,200
Or bad as in you can fix it quickly,

68
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:06,494
it'll just cost more than
my entire education?

69
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:10,957
By tonight, there will be
no more problems.

70
00:04:15,295 --> 00:04:17,380
Okay. I'm off.

71
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:19,841
I gotta go too.
I'm going to the wine store.

72
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:22,302
- Here, for you.
- Thanks.

73
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:36,649
Which one do you want?

74
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,944
I'll just be upstairs if you need me.

75
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,620
Phoebe.

76
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:54,995
A little down on the left.

77
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,455
Thanks.

78
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,752
So was this your first quake?

79
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:06,631
And hopefully my last.
I prefer my ceilings above me.

80
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,258
All right.

81
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:10,802
This is the final guest list for tonight.

82
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,263
All important clients to me,
to Buckland's,

83
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:15,598
and therefore to you.
And at the top of the list...

84
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:18,309
Professor Whittlesey.
Didn't she just buy the Calder?

85
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:21,980
Well, her family did, and they can
afford to buy much, much more.

86
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:25,316
And for whatever reason,
she's fascinated with your house,

87
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:27,902
so your job is to keep her happy.

88
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:31,322
Excuse me. Claire, I will be bringing
a guest, if that's all right.

89
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:34,325
Of course. Prue, tonight's going to be
five plus one.

90
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:37,537
- It's your home, then.
- Yeah.

91
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:40,623
Oh, Prue Halliwell,
Professor Whittlesey.

92
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,875
Beth. I can't tell you how excited I am

93
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:46,254
to be spending the evening
in a house with such history.

94
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:48,881
I understand you know a lot
about the Halliwell history?

95
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,759
I'm better versed on the
house's structure than its inhabitants.

96
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:53,511
The professor's tenured at Berkeley.

97
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:55,179
Architectural history.

98
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:59,267
As a matter of fact, I use your house
as an example in one of my lectures.

99
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:03,062
Really? Do you mention the leaky roof
and the limited hot water?

100
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:08,234
Oh, the original house that stood
on that spot was a masterpiece.

101
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:10,820
But it had to be rebuilt
after the earthquake of 1906

102
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:12,488
when it was completely destroyed.

103
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:14,615
That's the time my great-grandparents
moved in.

104
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:18,995
Metaphysicists believe the land
to be what they call a spiritual nexus.

105
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:22,456
But it's still standing
after this morning's rumble.

106
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,667
So okay, gotta go. Gotta go.

107
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,877
See you at 7.

108
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:29,255
Plus one.

109
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:37,888
<i>- Hello?
- Hey. How's my favourite sister?</i>

110
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:41,934
You want something.
I know you want something.

111
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:45,437
<i>Look, my boss just told me
it's plus one. I am so sorry.</i>

112
00:08:45,604 --> 00:08:49,108
Plus one? But I've already
bought the...

113
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:52,903
Oh, whatever. You owe me.

114
00:08:59,368 --> 00:09:00,994
Excuse me. That's...

115
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:03,872
Calera Jensen, '93. Last bottle.

116
00:09:04,248 --> 00:09:06,500
- Mine.
Look, why don't you try this.

117
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,127
It's got a robust flavour.

118
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:09,753
Good nose. Great vintage.

119
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,880
It's probably better than the Calera.

120
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:13,132
I'm impressed.

121
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:15,050
But why do you want it so bad?

122
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:17,052
Because it's got a great body.

123
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:20,931
<i>Look, I'm making coq au vin,</i>

124
00:09:21,098 --> 00:09:23,058
and I need that bottle
more than you do.

125
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:26,853
Look, I'm sorry, but I've already been
to three wine stores,

126
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,566
lunch break is long over, and I was told
that this was the bottle to get.

127
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:34,403
- Told?
- The woman who recommended this

128
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:36,113
grew up on a vineyard,

129
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:38,782
and she does know
how to choose wine.

130
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,284
Yeah. Well, I grew up in a house
with two sisters,

131
00:09:41,451 --> 00:09:42,994
and I know how to do this:

132
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:47,666
I can't... I can't use my powers
for personal gain.

133
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:51,378
But it's not really personal gain exactly.

134
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:57,175
Damn! You can keep the wine.

135
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:16,778
Help me!

136
00:10:19,197 --> 00:10:21,616
- Help me!
- Where are you?

137
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:24,369
Please. Help me.

138
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:37,090
- What's wrong?
- I fell.

139
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:39,008
I think I might have sprained
something.

140
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:42,929
My ankle.
I could really use a hand down here.

141
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:45,181
Right.

142
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:47,600
A hand.

143
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:50,728
Okay. I'm okay.

144
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:54,232
I'm coming!

145
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,318
Grams?

146
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:59,612
Phoebe! Go on back to bed, honey.

147
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,656
Go on.

148
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:08,162
The Woogyman.

149
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,378
You know, I think I'm just gonna call
somebody for some help.

150
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:16,921
No, please.

151
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:19,340
I need your help.

152
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:23,511
Okay.

153
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:38,984
Hello?

154
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:48,869
Where are you?

155
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:53,499
I thought you said that you were...

156
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:57,544
Phoebe.

157
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,005
No.

158
00:12:00,214 --> 00:12:03,050
Your nightmares are true. I exist.

159
00:12:03,258 --> 00:12:04,843
I'm a good witch.

160
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:07,262
- You can't take me.
- You'll fight me at first.

161
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:13,769
But in the end,
you'll do everything I ask.

162
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:25,572
Don't worry.
I can handle it all myself.

163
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:29,409
It's me, the culinary pachyderm.

164
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:35,499
Phoebe? Maybe we should call
someone to check the electricity too.

165
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,214
Kit? Hey!

166
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:44,800
Pheebs?

167
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:57,395
Oh, God! Oh, God, you scared me.

168
00:12:57,562 --> 00:12:59,856
Is everything okay with the house?

169
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:02,609
- It will be.
- Good. Could I get a ETA?

170
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:05,237
Because I'm gonna have
one very stressed out sister.

171
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:07,906
Have you seen my sister?

172
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:13,036
Phoebe!

173
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:15,246
Phoebe!

174
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:26,257
Phoebe. He just...

175
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:27,967
It's okay. It's okay.

176
00:13:28,426 --> 00:13:29,677
I thought he was gonna kill me.

177
00:13:29,844 --> 00:13:32,138
I didn't even have a chance
to freeze him.

178
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:34,390
Where did you get the bat?

179
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:38,937
I don't know. It just sort of appeared.

180
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:42,482
What do you mean, it appeared?
You opened the closet and found it?

181
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:45,068
Or appeared like you thought bat
and there it was?

182
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:46,486
Yeah. Door number two.

183
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:49,238
I can't explain it,

184
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:52,742
but something weird happened to me
down in the...

185
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,162
What? Phoebe, spill.
How did you make the bat materialise?

186
00:13:59,248 --> 00:14:02,919
Safety first. Witchcraft later.
We gotta call 911.

187
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:05,838
- This doesn't track.
- What's that?

188
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:08,549
I just got background on the gasman.
He doesn't have a record,

189
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:10,885
not even a parking ticket.

190
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:14,430
He's a family man, church volunteer,
Little League coach.

191
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:17,183
<i>When Good Coaches Go Bad.
Next week on Fox.</i>

192
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,185
- Andy, what's going on?
- Everything's fine.

193
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:21,604
An incident involving the gasman
checking your house.

194
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:23,397
He got a little rough with Piper.

195
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:25,066
Prue.

196
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:30,905
Hey. Piper, are you okay?
Are you hurt?

197
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:32,782
No. Yeah, I'm fine.

198
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:34,617
He attacked me.

199
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:37,453
And then Phoebe stopped him.

200
00:14:38,913 --> 00:14:40,081
Go on, show her.

201
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,625
I told you, I can't do it now.

202
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,043
Do what?

203
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:47,421
Phoebe has a new power.
She thinks of something,

204
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:49,507
and, poof, it appears.

205
00:14:49,715 --> 00:14:51,467
I just did it once.

206
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:54,678
And it saved my life.
I would think that you would be thrilled.

207
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:57,139
You've always wanted an active power.

208
00:14:57,348 --> 00:14:58,974
Whatever.

209
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:00,517
Wait a second. Timeout.

210
00:15:00,684 --> 00:15:04,438
Our powers are supposed to progress,
not grow at random.

211
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:06,023
And if it did grow, I would think

212
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,777
that it would be at least be
premonition-esque.

213
00:15:11,737 --> 00:15:14,239
<i>I smell Book of Shadows.
Did you do something?</i>

214
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:17,034
Okay, I just saved Piper's ass.
Where were you?

215
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:19,787
- Phoebe.
- Prue's just pissy because this time

216
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,955
she didn't get to play
Wonder Woman.

217
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:26,126
I'm not in the mood
to soothe your ego.

218
00:15:31,673 --> 00:15:33,550
Well, tonight's gonna be fun.

219
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:38,013
She'll be fine.
And everything will be fine.

220
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,363
Thanks for my new power.

221
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:57,824
You must not fail me again.

222
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:02,162
You must use your powers
against your sisters.

223
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,248
Please don't make me do this.

224
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,251
I don't wanna hurt them.

225
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,754
Phoebe,

226
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:15,717
you are not strong enough
to fight me.

227
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:32,442
It is almost time, Phoebe.

228
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:40,492
Use the powers.

229
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:47,957
Flour.

230
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:51,377
Hey, there is lava water spewing
from the showerheads.

231
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,087
Did you turn up the
water heater again?

232
00:16:53,463 --> 00:16:55,506
No. No, I...

233
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:01,512
All right. The earthquake must have
messed up the wiring or something.

234
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,474
Try cooking a feast when
your own kitchen is attacking you.

235
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:07,977
Okay, just relax.
We still have an hour before...

236
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,189
It's 7:00? How can that be?

237
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,609
The clock on the microwave says...

238
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:18,738
Something weird is going on.

239
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:20,489
Is anyone gonna answer that?

240
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:24,201
Phoebe?

241
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,704
Wait. Am I seeing things,

242
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,831
or did you just come
from the basement?

243
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:30,499
What about the Woogyman?

244
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,669
That was just a story, remember?

245
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,505
You should probably
finish getting ready.

246
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:45,347
Welcome to Halliwell manor.

247
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:49,769
My name is Phoebe.
I'll be your cruise director this evening.

248
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:01,030
Everything is fine. This is fine.

249
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,534
This is utter disaster.

250
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:09,788
I am a good person.
What did I do to deserve this?

251
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,374
Prue told me to give this to the chef.

252
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:14,877
You.

253
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:18,881
Most people call me Josh. I...

254
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,842
I work for Professor Whittlesey.

255
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,260
You're the plus one.

256
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,680
And I stole your wine.

257
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,223
Truce?

258
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:30,434
Calera Jensen. What a surprise.

259
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,269
Last bottle.

260
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:34,396
You have...

261
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:36,440
...flour on your... Right...

262
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:43,322
Perfect.

263
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:48,201
Are you planning on feeding
the people in the living room?

264
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,787
Of course. I've got...

265
00:18:50,954 --> 00:18:52,706
What have I got?

266
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,542
- What's in there?
- Duck medallions.

267
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,295
But... No, no.
That's supposed to be part of dinner.

268
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:01,465
Okay. Now I guess it's an appetiser.

269
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:04,134
Okay. Go. Go. Go.
Mingle. Mingle. Mingle.

270
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:07,679
The manor's been beautifully restored.
Really quite magnificent.

271
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,098
Prue. There you are.

272
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:11,725
Anyone hungry?

273
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,727
Well, what do we have here?

274
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,771
Duck medallions.

275
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:20,525
Sans medallions.

276
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,616
That's my sister, the magician.
Usually it's a dove or a rabbit.

277
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,581
Lightly simmering.

278
00:19:35,623 --> 00:19:37,876
Okay. Okay. Okay.

279
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:41,754
Sabotage. I am being sabotaged.

280
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:43,965
What seems to be the problem?

281
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:47,302
There is something terribly wrong
with the house.

282
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:53,224
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Call a plumber.

283
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:56,102
This is a complete and total disaster.

284
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:59,314
Somebody just kill me now
and spare me the agony of cleanup.

285
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,524
Ask and you shall receive.

286
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,360
Everything all right in here?

287
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:08,448
And people pay you to do this?

288
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,995
Phoebe, could you please escort
Mr Congeniality out of here?

289
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:15,788
Please, now.

290
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:20,376
And get Prue.
Tell her it's an emergency.

291
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:23,462
There's no other house
in the city quite like yours.

292
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:26,424
- Because of its architecture?
- Because of its location.

293
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:29,552
Right, you mentioned that. Something
about some sort of a spiritual...

294
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:32,555
Nexus. It's mythology, really.

295
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:35,725
But it's believed that when
a geographical point is equidistant

296
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:40,980
to the five spiritual elements,
it's a place of great power.

297
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:44,358
Power failure.

298
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:47,236
Look, I don't know what's going on,

299
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:51,574
- but I apologise for any inconvenience.
- Prue, Piper needs you in the kitchen.

300
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,828
No, don't worry.
I'll take very good care of your guest.

301
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:04,712
You came to see the house.

302
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:07,256
Would you like the grand tour?

303
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:18,642
Okay, aren't you the same girl
who said, and I quote,

304
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,437
- "Everything will be fine"?
- Yep.

305
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:24,106
- And?
- It's not. I don't know what it is,

306
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:26,483
but it's like the house is possessed.

307
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:29,111
No, no.
It is Phoebe and her new powers.

308
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:33,740
Look, I know she's been acting
really weird lately, but she wouldn't...

309
00:21:33,907 --> 00:21:37,536
I would argue
if I could think of another option.

310
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:40,080
Prue?

311
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:48,213
May I speak to you for a second?

312
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:50,924
Yes. I'll be out in one second, Claire.

313
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:53,593
What do we do?

314
00:21:53,802 --> 00:21:57,180
I don't know, but I can't cook this meal.
Not in this kitchen.

315
00:21:57,347 --> 00:21:59,725
And it's too late to get it from Quake.

316
00:22:00,225 --> 00:22:03,311
Okay. Let's just end it now
before it gets any worse.

317
00:22:03,478 --> 00:22:05,439
Be my wingman?

318
00:22:13,697 --> 00:22:15,615
Really, I don't need
to see the basement.

319
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:17,701
Are you kidding?

320
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:20,453
It's the best part of the house.

321
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:22,747
After you.

322
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:27,752
Well, as hostess,

323
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:30,297
it's sometimes helpful
to be present at the party.

324
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:35,760
Claire, I am so sorry, but I'm
gonna have to cut this evening short.

325
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:38,722
We're experiencing
some technical difficulties.

326
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,516
What?
Do you realise what you're doing?

327
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:44,018
Yes, and I think I'm doing it
just in time.

328
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:47,522
There is a table waiting for all of you
at Quake. On the house.

329
00:22:47,689 --> 00:22:50,150
- There is?
- There will be.

330
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:55,864
- Where's Phoebe?
- I think she's giving the professor a...

331
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,407
Tour.

332
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:01,786
She showed me the bedrooms,
the solarium.

333
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:04,539
I found the basement
particularly intriguing.

334
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:08,293
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

335
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:12,046
Okay. Dinner has been changed.

336
00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:14,257
We're having it
somewhere else, okay?

337
00:23:14,424 --> 00:23:16,175
Oh, professor.

338
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:19,095
I'm sorry you didn't get to spend
more time in the house.

339
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:21,180
My time was well-spent.

340
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:37,446
I'm looking forward to hearing
your explanation of tonight's events.

341
00:23:37,613 --> 00:23:39,198
- Need a ride?
- I just have to tie up

342
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,867
a few loose ends here.
I'll try and make it.

343
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:44,161
Try hard.

344
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:47,832
Now what?

345
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:49,959
Interrogation.

346
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:51,669
Are you looking for me?

347
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:53,671
Why are you doing this?

348
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,881
Because he asked me to.

349
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,383
Who asked you to?

350
00:23:59,135 --> 00:24:00,261
Okay.

351
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:03,472
That is it. We need to...

352
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:11,313
Prue. Prue, are you okay?

353
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,567
Phoebe! What's wrong with you?
Why won't you let us in?

354
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:16,902
No, you can't.

355
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:20,322
You shouldn't.

356
00:24:22,658 --> 00:24:25,786
You don't live here anymore.

357
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:28,205
He does.

358
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,972
Okay. We have been up all night.
We've tried everything.

359
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,600
If our powers can't get us
into the house, what can?

360
00:24:57,693 --> 00:24:59,361
That helped.

361
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:02,948
You know, yesterday I got shocked
when I walked through the front door.

362
00:25:03,156 --> 00:25:06,284
Me too. Do you think that's when
this all started?

363
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:07,994
Define "this."

364
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:12,249
Our house has turned against us
and so has our sister.

365
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:16,586
This is more than just Phoebe.
She said that he told her to do this.

366
00:25:16,753 --> 00:25:19,297
So who is he, and what does he want
with Phoebe?

367
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:21,842
Maybe that's the problem.
We've been focusing on Phoebe.

368
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:23,718
Maybe that's not the point.

369
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:27,681
- Then what is?
- Location.

370
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:29,891
Whatever has the house has her too.

371
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:31,893
And it's not letting us in for a reason.

372
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,688
<i>And we can't get to The Book
of Shadows to find out what it is.</i>

373
00:25:34,854 --> 00:25:37,482
- So we know nothing.
- Yes, we do.

374
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:41,236
There's someone who knows
the house better than we do. Come on.

375
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:55,542
Yes, I would like a pizza
delivered to my home.

376
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:59,170
Well, whenever you do open, then.

377
00:25:59,337 --> 00:26:01,839
I don't care what you put on the thing.

378
00:26:02,006 --> 00:26:05,093
Just make sure somebody delivers it.

379
00:26:05,552 --> 00:26:09,097
1329 Prescott Street.

380
00:26:09,264 --> 00:26:11,182
I'll be waiting.

381
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,986
Let's go. Please, ma'am.

382
00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:26,781
Hey! What happened?

383
00:26:26,948 --> 00:26:28,199
I don't know.

384
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:30,284
Professor Whittlesey
had just begun her seminar

385
00:26:30,451 --> 00:26:33,412
when she turned
and suddenly started choking me.

386
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:35,748
And if one of her students
hadn't pulled her off...

387
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:37,416
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

388
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,085
Yeah. I just...

389
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:41,587
I don't know why
she snapped like that.

390
00:26:41,754 --> 00:26:44,715
Okay. Josh, do you know anything
about what she said to Claire?

391
00:26:44,882 --> 00:26:46,968
It's something about
a spiritual nexus.

392
00:26:47,134 --> 00:26:48,970
She brought that up?

393
00:26:49,136 --> 00:26:51,263
The professor doesn't usually go in
for that sort of

394
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,057
metaphysical mythology.

395
00:26:53,224 --> 00:26:55,810
You know Claire, once she gets
her claws into something,

396
00:26:55,976 --> 00:26:57,353
she can't seem to forget about it.

397
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,022
You know, I've met people like that.

398
00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:05,402
A spiritual nexus is a point
of incredible energy.

399
00:27:05,778 --> 00:27:08,239
Equidistant from the
five spiritual elements.

400
00:27:08,405 --> 00:27:11,575
That's right. A place or thing
that could be swayed either way.

401
00:27:11,784 --> 00:27:14,078
- Either way?
- Yeah. Either to be a source

402
00:27:14,245 --> 00:27:16,539
of undeniable good or undeniable evil.

403
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:23,128
Ladies, I'm gonna follow her
and make sure she's okay.

404
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:26,715
Now, feel free to browse around
in our office if you think it'll help.

405
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:34,431
Okay, to find a way back in, we have to
know what we're up against.

406
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:38,018
The professor said
that a true spiritual nexus

407
00:27:38,185 --> 00:27:41,063
sits equidistant from
the five basal elements.

408
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,526
So that's earth, fire, water,
wood and metal.

409
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:49,071
Okey-dokey. Equidistant.

410
00:27:49,238 --> 00:27:51,281
Here is the manor.

411
00:27:51,448 --> 00:27:53,283
All right.

412
00:27:55,244 --> 00:27:56,578
Let's see. The bay, water.

413
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:03,460
Natural hot springs?

414
00:28:03,627 --> 00:28:04,795
Fire.

415
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:09,758
What about wood? That park that
Mom used to take us to, Kenwood.

416
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:13,553
Named after the type of tree that
grew there when it was still a forest.

417
00:28:13,762 --> 00:28:15,263
Okay.

418
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,600
Three out of five. Earth.

419
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:23,104
Twin Peaks. Highest point in the city.

420
00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:25,857
And last but not least, metal.

421
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:28,860
- Tiffany's.
- Cute. Natural metal.

422
00:28:29,027 --> 00:28:31,446
Okay. Fourth grade, field trip.

423
00:28:31,655 --> 00:28:33,198
We panned for gold.
Where was that?

424
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,995
Okay.

425
00:28:54,344 --> 00:28:57,097
Our house was built
in the centre of a pentagram.

426
00:28:58,264 --> 00:29:01,893
Looks like it's not just on a
spiritual nexus,

427
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,395
but a Wiccan one as well.

428
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,982
Which means it's a battleground
for good and evil.

429
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:10,818
And what happens
once evil has the house?

430
00:29:11,027 --> 00:29:12,820
It spreads.

431
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,865
<i>We'd have to check
The Book of Shadows to be sure,</i>

432
00:29:16,032 --> 00:29:19,619
but I'd bet that there's a reason why
our family built the house there,

433
00:29:19,786 --> 00:29:22,163
to reclaim the spot for good.

434
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:24,832
And now I'm thinking
evil wants it back.

435
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:27,502
Yeah, and it's taking Phoebe with it.

436
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,935
Why does it feel like we live here?

437
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:50,399
- Which one you want?
- I'll take that one.

438
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:53,194
- I could use a change of scenery.
- See you back here.

439
00:29:53,361 --> 00:29:55,446
- Next to you.

440
00:29:57,657 --> 00:29:59,033
Hello, inspector.

441
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,118
Phoebe.

442
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:03,829
- Hey, I stopped by to...
- Just in time.

443
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:07,333
I think there might be a gas leak.

444
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,169
And I'm home all alone.

445
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:14,381
Do you think you could look it over?

446
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,176
Sure.

447
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:25,351
It's down in the basement.

448
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:32,483
So he came out of his house,
walked over here

449
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,401
and started throwing things?

450
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,862
No. Not out of his house.

451
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:38,322
Out of the Halliwells'.

452
00:30:38,947 --> 00:30:40,532
Really?

453
00:30:40,824 --> 00:30:42,493
Hey, Morris, neighbourhood watch?

454
00:30:43,786 --> 00:30:46,371
Had a woman brought into
the station house today.

455
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:49,708
Wasn't feeling too well,
spent last night at your house.

456
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:52,753
- Professor Beth Whittlesey?
- Is she okay?

457
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:55,255
Not at the moment.
She's under observation.

458
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:56,840
Paul, what is the matter with you?

459
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:59,051
- Nothing.
- I'm occupied right now.

460
00:30:59,218 --> 00:31:01,511
Andy would like to ask you
a few questions. He's inside.

461
00:31:01,678 --> 00:31:03,680
I told you to keep your trash cans
off my driveway.

462
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:07,142
Wait. If Andy is in the house
and Paul was in the house,

463
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:09,853
- there must be a way for us to get in.
- We better hope so.

464
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,606
<i>Otherwise, there's no way to
get to The Book of Shadows.</i>

465
00:31:16,818 --> 00:31:17,944
- Freeze him.
- No, wait.

466
00:31:18,153 --> 00:31:20,113
What are you doing?

467
00:31:21,698 --> 00:31:24,493
- What was that?
- The house is letting him out, right?

468
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:28,121
This is the only second
that its guard is down.

469
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:30,457
- You're brilliant.
- Thank you.

470
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:39,299
Oh, my. She's frozen.

471
00:31:39,507 --> 00:31:41,343
- Good.
- No, no, no.

472
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:44,304
Remember? Our powers don't work
on good witches?

473
00:31:45,055 --> 00:31:47,557
- Oh, that means she's...
- We've lost her.

474
00:31:48,433 --> 00:31:51,603
Okay. Let's go get her back.

475
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,646
Run.

476
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:03,198
- I never liked living next door to him.
- Don't do it again!

477
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:04,741
Wanna give me hand here, partner?

478
00:32:04,908 --> 00:32:06,534
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Andy!

479
00:32:11,372 --> 00:32:12,707
What the hell was that?

480
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:14,751
What?

481
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:17,003
I have no idea.

482
00:32:19,964 --> 00:32:21,924
- Faster would be good.
- There is nothing here.

483
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:23,676
We don't even know
what we're fighting.

484
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:25,511
- Our sister.
- No, it's more than that.

485
00:32:25,678 --> 00:32:27,930
All right. When in doubt,
start at the beginning.

486
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:30,016
What happened first?

487
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:32,560
- Gasman attacked me.
- Before that.

488
00:32:32,727 --> 00:32:34,771
The earthquake, which is why
the gasman was here,

489
00:32:34,937 --> 00:32:36,355
to check the leak in the basement.

490
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:39,066
All right, and before
Professor Whittlesey freaked out,

491
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:43,112
she took a tour of the house
including the basement.

492
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:45,198
Noises don't help.

493
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:48,367
The gasman said
that's where Phoebe was.

494
00:32:48,576 --> 00:32:50,203
And we know she's been down there.

495
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,122
No. Piper it was just a story.

496
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:55,499
Are you so sure?
We've seen monsters and demons

497
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,001
from the past and the future.

498
00:32:57,168 --> 00:33:00,421
How can you be so certain that
Phoebe's childhood monster isn't real?

499
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:03,049
The Woogyman in the basement?

500
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:04,967
Phoebe swore she saw something
down there.

501
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:07,553
That's when Grams
started telling us the story...

502
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,263
Of how to destroy it.

503
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:11,974
And there was an earthquake
that night too, remember?

504
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:13,309
Maybe that's how it gets out.

505
00:33:14,101 --> 00:33:17,229
We've been looking
in the wrong place.

506
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:19,690
<i>How to vanquish the demon
isn't in The Book of Shadows.</i>

507
00:33:19,857 --> 00:33:22,276
It's in Grams' story.

508
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,404
So it wasn't a story.
It was a spell?

509
00:33:25,613 --> 00:33:27,656
All right,
the Woogyman is a real demon.

510
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:30,868
So Phoebe was right.
Now, how did it go?

511
00:33:31,035 --> 00:33:35,080
Something about a Woogyman,
and Grams fought it.

512
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:39,126
- That's all that you remember?
- Well, don't you remember anything?

513
00:33:39,335 --> 00:33:41,628
I remember that it was
sort of like a rhyme.

514
00:33:41,795 --> 00:33:43,172
Sounded like a children's song.

515
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,885
Well, we'd better figure it out fast,
or we're gonna have a whole lot of...

516
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,437
Prue!

517
00:33:58,604 --> 00:33:59,813
Prue!

518
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,773
- Phoebe?
- Any fantasies

519
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,650
about how you wanna die?

520
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:06,820
Phoebe, listen to me. This isn't you.

521
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:09,656
- Give the girl a prize.
- Prue!

522
00:34:09,865 --> 00:34:13,410
Look, whatever is doing this
hasn't completely beaten you.

523
00:34:13,577 --> 00:34:15,287
Otherwise, we would be dead by now.

524
00:34:15,495 --> 00:34:17,331
- Really?
- Phoebe?

525
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,293
- Phoebe, you were stronger than him.
- I mean it!

526
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:23,462
No, I wasn't.

527
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,048
That's why he chose me.

528
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:29,134
- But now I'm stronger than you.
- Prue! Phoebe!

529
00:34:33,847 --> 00:34:35,182
Prue!

530
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,436
Go!

531
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:48,737
Piper, where are you going?

532
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:51,239
It's just not Phoebe we're fighting.
It's the house.

533
00:34:51,448 --> 00:34:52,741
Piper, don't!

534
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:55,910
Oh, God.

535
00:34:56,786 --> 00:34:59,456
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not.

536
00:34:59,622 --> 00:35:01,499
Neither are you.
We're locked in this house,

537
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,877
and our sister is trying to kill us.

538
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,682
All right, the answer must be
in Grams' Woogyman story.

539
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:21,144
- Which neither one of us remembers.
- Yeah, but we have to keep trying.

540
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:34,073
There has to be a way out of here.

541
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,783
We've tried everything, Piper.

542
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:39,620
Besides, the only way to help Phoebe
is from inside.

543
00:35:40,496 --> 00:35:42,165
Help her kill us maybe.

544
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:47,170
- Yeah, well, we have to keep trying.
- Prue! Piper! Help me!

545
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,755
Do you think...?

546
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:53,217
Please? You gotta help me.
I'm down in the basement.

547
00:35:54,635 --> 00:35:57,597
- Trap.
- Yeah, well, what else can we do?

548
00:35:57,805 --> 00:36:00,099
We could not go to the basement.
I'd vote for that.

549
00:36:00,308 --> 00:36:02,560
Grams must have thought
that this evil might come back.

550
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,687
And that's why she told us the story.

551
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:08,065
How do we remember the words?
I never believed in the Woogyman.

552
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:11,193
No, but Phoebe did.
She knows the story by heart.

553
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,446
Something tells me
she's not in the mood to share.

554
00:36:13,946 --> 00:36:19,076
All right. We know that the source
of his power is in the basement.

555
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,620
So if we can weaken him,

556
00:36:21,787 --> 00:36:24,081
then maybe we can weaken his hold
on Phoebe.

557
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,709
At least long enough
for her to tell us the spell.

558
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:30,296
How do we do that? We don't
even know what it is or how to fight it.

559
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:32,798
Help! Please, I need you.

560
00:36:40,723 --> 00:36:42,474
Okay.

561
00:36:44,143 --> 00:36:46,854
We have no choice,
so we're gonna need a...

562
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:48,731
Light.

563
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:55,404
No. The light.
Grams' story, remember?

564
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:59,700
She said something about using it
to guide you through the shadow.

565
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:01,368
Or was it to the shadow?

566
00:37:01,577 --> 00:37:03,829
That doesn't make sense.
Using a light to find a shadow.

567
00:37:03,996 --> 00:37:06,373
Shadows retreat from the light.

568
00:37:06,748 --> 00:37:10,627
And they thrive in the darkness.

569
00:37:10,794 --> 00:37:12,838
Kind of like this.

570
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:15,841
Or in the basement.

571
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:19,803
Maybe that's what we're fighting, Prue.
A shadow.

572
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:21,763
Okay.

573
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,849
Let's fight it.

574
00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:33,024
Phoebe?

575
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:41,199
Okay. There, see that?

576
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,040
What took you so long?

577
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:54,963
One evil at a time.

578
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,257
Okay. Freeze it.

579
00:37:59,217 --> 00:38:01,761
It's not working. Can't you...?

580
00:38:03,471 --> 00:38:05,098
No, my powers
aren't working on it either.

581
00:38:08,393 --> 00:38:10,186
Phoebe, you've got to listen to us.

582
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:13,857
You're in no position
to tell me what to do.

583
00:38:14,065 --> 00:38:17,944
Remember Grams' story? The one
about the Woogyman? About the light?

584
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:20,780
Come on, Phoebe. Try.

585
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:25,368
I can't.

586
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:27,662
Don't make me.

587
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:29,372
Don't like the basement.

588
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:33,084
It's no use. Your sister's evil now.

589
00:38:33,251 --> 00:38:35,586
Come on, Phoebe.
You've got to fight it. You're good.

590
00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:42,093
- Grams?
- Phoebe. Go on back to bed, honey.

591
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,970
Go on.

592
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,646
Phoebe, please. Remember the story.
What did Grams say?

593
00:38:53,855 --> 00:38:55,815
Hurry, Phoebe, please.

594
00:39:00,194 --> 00:39:03,281
<i>I am light</i>

595
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:08,619
<i>I am one too strong to fight</i>

596
00:39:09,245 --> 00:39:13,666
<i>Return to dark
Where shadows dwell</i>

597
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:16,961
<i>You cannot have this Halliwell</i>

598
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:18,546
Keep it going, Phoebe.

599
00:39:18,754 --> 00:39:21,716
<i>Go away and leave my sight</i>

600
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:23,467
What are you doing?

601
00:39:23,634 --> 00:39:26,554
<i>And take with you this endless night</i>

602
00:39:26,846 --> 00:39:29,265
Phoebe, no!

603
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:16,103
Anybody home?

604
00:40:16,353 --> 00:40:18,272
Office hours aren't until 5.

605
00:40:20,274 --> 00:40:23,277
Piper. What are you doing here?

606
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:25,946
Oh, I just came by to see how you...

607
00:40:26,113 --> 00:40:28,073
Professor Whittlesey was doing.

608
00:40:28,281 --> 00:40:30,909
She seems better.
Hasn't choked anybody lately.

609
00:40:31,118 --> 00:40:33,537
Good. So you'd say
she's back to normal?

610
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:36,373
Yeah. Although she's being
censured for her behaviour.

611
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,502
You know, has to sit before
the university board, and for now,

612
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:42,671
well, it looks like
I'm covering her classes.

613
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:45,632
Oh, that's too bad. I mean...

614
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:49,010
- I don't mean you. I mean...
- I know what you mean. Yeah.

615
00:40:49,928 --> 00:40:53,431
You know, by the way,
I have something for you.

616
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:02,649
Calera Jensen, '93.

617
00:41:02,816 --> 00:41:05,068
Battles have been waged
over this wine.

618
00:41:05,235 --> 00:41:06,861
Not today. I'm too tired.

619
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,447
That's actually very nice.

620
00:41:09,656 --> 00:41:14,160
Don't sound so surprised. You know,
I am capable of a kind act or two.

621
00:41:14,744 --> 00:41:16,704
It's good to know.

622
00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:23,044
So Morris said that it was only
a two-week suspension.

623
00:41:23,253 --> 00:41:25,255
Doesn't seem fair.
It wasn't really Andy's fault.

624
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:28,633
Well, what was he gonna do,
plead shadowed?

625
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,718
Anyway, everyone seems
to be back to normal,

626
00:41:30,885 --> 00:41:32,637
but that doesn't erase their actions.

627
00:41:32,804 --> 00:41:34,847
Yeah, well, I wish it did.

628
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:38,142
Get me off of Claire's bad side,
as if she had a good one.

629
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:40,687
I'm beginning to wonder
if I have a good one.

630
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:44,983
Well, I am.

631
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:48,069
I mean, up until now,
I didn't even think I had a dark side.

632
00:41:48,236 --> 00:41:50,655
I mean, not any more so
than anyone else.

633
00:41:50,863 --> 00:41:53,825
Yeah, well, the important thing
is that the good side won out.

634
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:57,245
Yeah, but I must have been more
susceptible than either one of you.

635
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:59,872
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
chosen me, right?

636
00:42:03,376 --> 00:42:04,418
Right.

637
00:42:04,627 --> 00:42:06,629
You were the only one
that was born in the house.

638
00:42:06,796 --> 00:42:09,757
That makes you more connected to it.
It's that spiritual nexus thing.

639
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:12,802
That's exactly my point.
I could go either way.

640
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:15,554
Good or evil. It's kind of freaky.

641
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:21,185
I do have to tell you I am gonna
miss that new power, though.

642
00:42:21,394 --> 00:42:23,104
It was so fun.

643
00:42:25,314 --> 00:42:29,735
If Grams put away the shadow
and it came back...

644
00:42:29,902 --> 00:42:31,445
It means he can come back again.

645
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,698
Okay, it's time.

646
00:42:36,283 --> 00:42:38,744
<i>Every witch before us
has added to The Book of Shadows.</i>

647
00:42:38,911 --> 00:42:41,413
We need to warn who comes next.
It's our turn.

648
00:42:42,122 --> 00:42:43,457
Who should do it?
