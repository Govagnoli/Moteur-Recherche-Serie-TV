1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,428
Watch it, guys.
Wait for me. This thing's heavy.

2
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:12,679
We gotta keep moving.

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,516
I think we're going in circles,
because this looks very familiar.

4
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,850
It looks the same to me too.

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,560
Of course it does.
It's the underworld.

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,146
It all looks the same. How many looks
can they come up with?

7
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,732
No wonder they wanna take over
our world. This is ugly.

8
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:27,277
They've already taken over our world.
That's why we're stuck down here.

9
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,570
We gotta do something.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,906
Come on.

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,616
I'm open to suggestions.

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,244
Maybe we should talk
to the leprechauns again?

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,287
No, I've had it with the leprechauns.

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,289
I think they made
their allegiance pretty clear.

15
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,543
- They wouldn't even let us explain.
- I don't think it would have mattered.

16
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,420
Billie and Christy have everybody
thinking that we're the threat.

17
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,175
We gotta get out of here.

18
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,477
Why haven't the Charmed Ones
attacked yet?

19
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,729
They will. I assure you.

20
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,232
When?

21
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,900
When they're at
their most desperate.

22
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,152
When they realise
they have no other choice.

23
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,445
And Billie and Christy?

24
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,155
They've taken over
the Halliwell manor.

25
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,658
And they've got the entire
magical community behind them.

26
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,285
Not to mention us.

27
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,287
But are they prepared for the attack?

28
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,539
They will be.

29
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,786
Where'd everyone go?

30
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,290
Oh, I sent them home. I thought
they'd be safer away from us.

31
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,417
But we might need their help.

32
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,294
- The sisters...
- Are gonna come after us.

33
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,130
I know. But it's not the magical
community's fight. It's ours.

34
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,508
- It's our destiny.
- Here we go again.

35
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,343
Don't worry.
I know it's the right thing,

36
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,305
and it's all for the greater good,
but it doesn't mean I like it.

37
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:45,142
Look, Billie, I know
this is hard for you. Okay?

38
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,644
But it'll all be over soon.
I promise.

39
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,396
Don't be so sure.
We came after them

40
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,273
with our best shot
and they still got away.

41
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,941
- Yeah, but barely.
- It makes me think

42
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,943
maybe we don't have enough
to go against them.

43
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,613
They aren't the most powerful
witches of all time for nothing.

44
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,114
But we're no slouches either.

45
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,200
Besides, we don't know
what would have happened.

46
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,160
They got away
before our best shot hit them.

47
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:10,083
You know, Dumain thinks we should
use vanquishing potions next time.

48
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,502
Vanquishing potions?

49
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,504
You wrote down
their most powerful ones.

50
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,424
If we catch them off guard,
they won't stand a chance against us.

51
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,180
Billie...

52
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,974
What are you guys doing here?

53
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,018
Oh, it's a long story.

54
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,436
Oh, what happened?

55
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,189
That's what we're
still trying to figure out.

56
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,525
So, what brings you here?

57
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,485
I'm looking for Phoebe.
I can't find her.

58
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,530
- When's the last time you saw her?
- Last night at her loft.

59
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,490
Someone put her under a spell and...

60
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,494
You know what? Never mind.

61
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,496
If you see her, tell her
I'm looking for her.

62
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,165
Absolutely.
And you do the same.

63
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,251
We're looking for her too.

64
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,470
Wait. He said she was under a spell.

65
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,514
- So?
- So Phoebe said the same thing.

66
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,225
- That makes me wonder...
- She'll say anything to save herself.

67
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,977
So will he.

68
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,562
Come on. We have a potion to make.

69
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,149
Okay, do it.

70
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,782
Okay, we can't keep playing
"Survivor:" "Underworld" much longer.

71
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:24,992
What are we gonna do?

72
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,703
- How about we just orb home?
- No, it's too risky.

73
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,998
Billie and Christy will be waiting
for us. And their new friends.

74
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,749
Okay, well, we gotta do something fast

75
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,918
because word will get around
that we're down here.

76
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,754
She's right.
We can't fend off demons forever.

77
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,215
- We need a plan.
- Maybe just give up?

78
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,925
- What?
- What.

79
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,721
It's just that every time we go out
and try to get a life, meet people,

80
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:50,017
do new things, we seem to wind up
back in these kind of lame positions.

81
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,270
Giving up is not such a bad idea, is it?

82
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,272
No, I'm not giving up.

83
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,983
Not now and not after
I finally found someone

84
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,526
I could see having a future with.

85
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,782
Look, if we want our lives
and Leo back...

86
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,578
...we're gonna have to fight.

87
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,496
Fight Billie and Christy.

88
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,165
Exactly.

89
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:17,252
Are you sure you can do it?
I mean, really do it? Can you kill them?

90
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,671
Yeah, they're no different
than demons now.

91
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:20,964
Not after all of this.

92
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,887
Look out.

93
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,058
Energy ball.

94
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,147
Go, go, go.

95
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,740
- Excuse me.
- Hey, how are you?

96
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,162
- Sure, no problem.
- Thank you for waiting.

97
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,212
- Right.
- Oh, yeah.

98
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,300
Yeah. Okay, I'll tell him you called.

99
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,180
Excuse me?

100
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:11,890
Can I help you?

101
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,477
Oh, I'm sorry, I was just looking
for Miss Halliwell.

102
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,021
- And you are?
- I'm...

103
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,440
...an admirer of hers.

104
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,859
For quite some time now.

105
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,777
Fine. If you'd like
an autographed picture,

106
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,029
- leave your name and ad...
- I don't want a picture.

107
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,825
I'm actually here
for personal reasons.

108
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,202
And may I ask what it's regarding?

109
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,498
Well, like I said, it's...
It's personal.

110
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,835
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

111
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,464
Of course.

112
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,717
Forgive me.

113
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,891
It's just that she's not been back
to her condo for a couple of weeks,

114
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,435
nor to her sisters' house

115
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,978
and I can't find her anywhere.

116
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,647
I'm just a little concerned. That's all.

117
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,734
Aren't you?

118
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:19,124
- Are you sure it was them?
- They vanquished our best.

119
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,418
Kadl hasn't been heard from
since he followed them.

120
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,296
Believe me, if it's the Charmed Ones,
he's dead too, like the rest.

121
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,007
Then why do we keep sending demons
in after them? It's suicide.

122
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,593
No, no, no. It's necessary.

123
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,970
I need to understand
what they're doing there.

124
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,640
It's so uncharacteristic of them.

125
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,601
After all, they love it up here.

126
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:43,315
They have everything they want:
Friends, family, a bit of romance.

127
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,817
So then, what are they doing
in the underworld?

128
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,069
What are they running from?

129
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,445
My old mentors.

130
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,656
- The Triad?
- Who else?

131
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,825
They're the only ones powerful enough
to turn their worlds upside down.

132
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,744
But I thought the Triad
had been vanquished.

133
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,371
Well, they had.

134
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,790
But they always resurrect
sooner or later.

135
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,793
First in spirit form, then completely.

136
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:06,630
You see, it's why our generation
can never take power.

137
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,258
They won't let us because
they just keep coming back.

138
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,511
But it's our right. It's our time.

139
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,430
Perhaps, but they're too powerful.

140
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,267
We can't yet eliminate them,
at least...

141
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,269
...not without help.

142
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,271
Charmed help.

143
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,648
What are you talking about?

144
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,692
Phoebe hasn't been to work in days.

145
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,652
But it's so much more than
a job to her.

146
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,071
She gets to help people
with her column. She needs that.

147
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,240
She misses that.

148
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:37,536
Just like Piper misses her children,
and Paige misses her new husband.

149
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,623
And they'd do anything
to get it all back. Believe me.

150
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,252
Even if it means working with us.

151
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:58,182
Unless you draw a double red,
you don't stand a chance, my man.

152
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,058
Go ahead.

153
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,019
Pick that card.

154
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,446
Hey.

155
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,822
That's cheating.

156
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,157
It wasn't me.

157
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:16,658
It's Chris.

158
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,868
No way.

159
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,620
He doesn't have any powers yet.

160
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,497
Yes, he does.

161
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,670
Wyatt, shield. Orb!

162
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,721
All right, who the hell are you
and what do you want?

163
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,891
You've got the wrong idea.
I'm a friend. I'm a cupid.

164
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:44,478
Yeah, right. Get out of here,
or I'll sick my grandson on you.

165
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,231
I'm telling you,
I'm not the bad guy, it's...

166
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,566
Hey, Wyatt, what's going on, buddy?
You remember me?

167
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,569
I was at Paige's wedding
with Aunt Phoebe.

168
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:56,114
Saw you sneak out a little bit of cake,
before the ceremony, with Henry?

169
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,412
There we go. All right.

170
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,415
- See?
- Sorry.

171
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,417
We're a little on edge around here.

172
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,627
Yeah, I see that.

173
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,922
Listen, I know a little something
about what's going on,

174
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,423
and that's why I came here.

175
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,385
I'm looking for Phoebe everywhere.
I can't find her. I'm worried.

176
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,387
- Phoebe, huh?
- Yeah.

177
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:19,888
She and her sisters
are just fine.

178
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,890
They sent me a message
not too long ago.

179
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,433
Really? Where are they?

180
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,687
Well, you don't get to know that.

181
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:30,899
And frankly, I don't have anymore time
or patience for cupids or fairies,

182
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,776
and others like you.

183
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:36,446
Especially after the way
you treated my girls. So buzz off.

184
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,615
I completely understand
where you're coming from,

185
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,784
but I'm different. I swear.

186
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,369
I'm in love with your daughter.

187
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,205
- Oh, for the love of God.
- And I just wanna help her.

188
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,375
If you really want to help her,
just stay away and let her live her life.

189
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,710
If she survives this anyway.

190
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:50,961
Victor, listen to me...

191
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,212
Listen, I mean it.

192
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,214
I've watched one daughter
go to hell and back,

193
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,966
falling for some magical being,

194
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,843
and I'm not about to
go through that again.

195
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,929
And I'm not about to let Phoebe
go through that. She deserves better.

196
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,264
She's been through too much.

197
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,725
Nobody will ever love your daughter
more than me. Ever.

198
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,227
I promise you that.

199
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,645
What do you know about love?

200
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,647
I'm a cupid.

201
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,025
That doesn't mean squat
unless you had your heart broken.

202
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,443
Have you had your heart broken?

203
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:16,862
No.

204
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,615
Then you don't know about love.
Believe me.

205
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,580
Listen, I... I'm sorry I'm so cranky.

206
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,125
Got a lot on my mind. Just...

207
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,503
Just do us a favour
and let us be, okay?

208
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,046
We got enough to worry about here.

209
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,465
Victor, I am in love with your daughter.

210
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,800
There's nothing you can say
that's gonna change that.

211
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,845
So please, when you hear from her,
just call out my name.

212
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,263
Okay? It's Coop.

213
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,433
I'll be waiting.

214
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,987
Hey, you guys, keep it down.

215
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,864
They could still be in the house,
you know.

216
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,033
- Here's hoping.
- We don't wanna have to attack

217
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,701
before we're ready.

218
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,204
I wish we hadn't taken
the "Book of Shadows" to your condo.

219
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,581
- We could have used it.
- I don't think we'll need it.

220
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,501
Still, I don't wanna take any chances
after what happened last time.

221
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,170
Okay, well, that should be enough.
They are human, after all.

222
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,881
I'm not so sure.

223
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,800
All right, get the vials.

224
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,936
Anything?

225
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,521
No.

226
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,578
Well, I guess they're not here.

227
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,996
Maybe they're at Magic School.

228
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:51,915
No, we're not.

229
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,418
Waiting for us, I see.

230
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,754
We knew you'd have to come back
here eventually.

231
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,756
Yes, well,
seeing how it is our house...

232
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:04,344
- Oh, wow, I see we have potions.
- You taught me well.

233
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,308
So, what are you waiting for?

234
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,978
- Nothing.
- Stop it. Stop.

235
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,273
I told you this wouldn't
make them attack first.

236
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,865
- What was that?
- Billie's projection power.

237
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:47,095
- You okay?
- Piper, you okay?

238
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,606
Oh, my God, you're hurt.

239
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,566
Where are the other vials?

240
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,194
Let's get her out of here.

241
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,156
- Damn it.
- We've gotta take care of this.

242
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,159
- No, it doesn't matter.
- Well, it matters to me. Let's go.

243
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,416
I'll go get her some water.

244
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,010
How did you know
they'd come here?

245
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,762
Where else could they go?

246
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,348
It's tempting just to kill them now,
isn't it?

247
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,517
Oh, it's never that easy.

248
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,853
History proves that.

249
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,355
Besides,

250
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:43,986
we need them as much
as they need us.

251
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,836
- Piper. Paige. Wake up. Wake up.
- What?

252
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,588
Well, it's about time.

253
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,048
Okay. Piper, blast.

254
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,633
Wait.

255
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,261
If you vanquish me now,
who will help you stop the Triad?

256
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,639
- We already stopped the Triad.
- Yes, but they came back.

257
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,517
Or didn't you know?
They're evil incarnate.

258
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,395
And since evil never really dies,
neither do they.

259
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:19,730
Well, at least not for long.

260
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,648
Who else could invert morality
to the point

261
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,567
of making you out
to be as bad as us?

262
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,861
Billie and Christy?

263
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,404
I don't think so.

264
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,240
I always knew somebody else
was behind them.

265
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,075
All right, what do you want?

266
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,494
We want to help you.

267
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,037
How, by knocking us out?

268
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:37,539
We could have killed you
if we wanted to.

269
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:42,085
Or at least, we could have tried.
But we didn't.

270
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,421
The point is,
if you want your lives back

271
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:48,050
and you want to stop the Triad as
much as we do, then you'll let us help.

272
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,470
- Help with what?
- I know the Triad.

273
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,764
I used to serve under them.

274
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,432
And I know what they're thinking.

275
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:58,852
I might be able to find out what Billie
and Christy's next move might be.

276
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,230
Which might help you
defeat them next time.

277
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:06,068
Why would a demon want our help
killing another demon?

278
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:07,611
Personal reasons.

279
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,781
Look, what we need to know is if
you're going to do what must be done

280
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:14,535
to save your future.
You're gonna have to trust us.

281
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:17,621
Well, what do you say?

282
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,373
I don't know.

283
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,291
I don't like it.

284
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,561
- Did you see that?
- See what, sweetie?

285
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,398
Nothing...

286
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,609
We'll take whatever help we can get.

287
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,781
How can you trust them?

288
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:54,283
We can't.

289
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,826
But we're out of options.

290
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,126
How do you know
the Triad are even here?

291
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:05,377
I don't.

292
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,630
The witches are,
so I doubt they're far away.

293
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,549
But if you're right
and they find us here...?

294
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,177
They banish us
to the wasteland.

295
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,803
Yes.

296
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,308
Our sacrifice won't be in vain if we
find a way to make sure they die too.

297
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,059
Understand?

298
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,565
It's time for the Triad's reign to end.

299
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,194
One way or the other.

300
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,196
Christy, sit still. You're bleeding.

301
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,907
I don't care. Just put a bandage on it.

302
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,870
Too bad we're trying to kill Paige.
Otherwise, she could have healed you.

303
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,039
Are you done yet?

304
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:46,543
No, this is gonna sting a little bit.
So hold on, okay?

305
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,548
- Does that hurt?
- No.

306
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,717
Well, I still think we should
get this checked.

307
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,219
What are we gonna do, Billie?

308
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,554
Are we gonna go to the ER
and tell them what happened?

309
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,224
We have work to do.
We have to find a stronger potion.

310
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,227
Well, there aren't any, okay?
That was the strongest one they had.

311
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,063
Then we'll make a stronger one.

312
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,316
Look, Christy,
maybe this isn't a good idea anymore.

313
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,652
- Billie.
- I'm serious.

314
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,821
Look, it doesn't change how I feel
about them or what they've done.

315
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,908
But I don't want to lose you too.
You're all I have left.

316
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,078
Okay, Billie, listen to me.

317
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:23,747
You're not gonna lose me, okay?

318
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,917
And I am not gonna lose you.

319
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,586
As long as we stick together.

320
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,761
- What happened?
- It's nothing. I'm fine.

321
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,555
No, she's not.
The sisters attacked us

322
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,431
but they used the same potions
as we did.

323
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,517
They got hurt just as badly as we did.

324
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,645
- We'll get them next time.
- Apparently, not without more power.

325
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,897
You should go back to the manor.
We don't want them

326
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,108
using it as a power base.
In the meantime,

327
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,444
I'll see what I can do
about getting you what you need.

328
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,537
Wait here.

329
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,750
You told us they already had
what they needed.

330
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,461
That's the second time
you've overestimated Billie and Christy.

331
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,630
Or underestimated
the Charmed Ones.

332
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:17,092
With all due respect, it was always
an ambitious plan to begin with.

333
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,428
But it was
your ambitious plan, Dumain.

334
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:20,929
We hold you responsible.

335
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,182
And I accept responsibility, my lord,

336
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:26,143
as well as all due credit
for getting us this far.

337
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,479
After all, fighting the witches to a draw
is better than any demon has ever...

338
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,440
But that's not good enough.

339
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,151
We need to take over
before it's too late.

340
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,695
The Charmed Ones are weary,
depleted. They'll never be

341
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,447
more vulnerable
than they are right now.

342
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:41,325
And if we don't destroy them
while we can, their magical offspring

343
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:44,453
will continue to grow
in numbers and power.

344
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,164
And then there will be
too many to stop.

345
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,625
We need The Hollow.

346
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,834
Agreed.

347
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,837
Wait. We can't use The Hollow.

348
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,340
I mean, there's a reason
why both good and evil

349
00:20:56,507 --> 00:21:00,010
banished it hundreds of years ago.
It's uncontrollable.

350
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,346
Nevertheless, it is our only choice.

351
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:05,516
No, but it's too dangerous.
It consumes powers, sure,

352
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,893
but it'll drive whoever is
trying to control it insane.

353
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,686
Look what it did to The Source.

354
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:13,106
Billie and Christy will need
charmed-like powers to summon it.

355
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:16,693
Fortunately, Dumain knows
exactly where to obtain such powers.

356
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,945
Don't you?

357
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,378
Okay, they're back.

358
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:36,713
- At the manor.
- Okay, we're almost ready.

359
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,715
I'm worried Billie
is gonna be able to match

360
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,217
whatever potion we come up with.

361
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,469
Well, it's three against two.
It should be enough.

362
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,556
Yeah, well, not if the Triad
is helping them, it's not.

363
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,100
I mean, what we're making
might not be strong enough.

364
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:50,811
I just hope our demon friends
come through for us.

365
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:53,939
And isn't it strange saying,
"Demon friends"?

366
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:57,401
- We can't trust them.
- I think we're gonna have to.

367
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,779
So how much of this has to do with
what you think you saw?

368
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:03,907
I don't think I saw Leo. I know I did.

369
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,285
What do you think it means?

370
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:10,622
I don't know,
but I can't imagine it's a good omen.

371
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,293
Well, it's about time.

372
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,336
Cute.

373
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,172
So you want the good news
or the bad news?

374
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,466
- Just cut to the chase.
- Very well.

375
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,761
The Triad is, in fact, alive,
at least in spirit form.

376
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,638
But I don't think
Billie and Christy know.

377
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,474
- Then how are they helping them?
- Through a demon I don't know.

378
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:32,936
But the big news is what they want
Billie and Christy to get to kill you.

379
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,813
The Hollow.

380
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,064
The Hollow?

381
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:38,150
Actually, you should take it
as a compliment.

382
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:39,985
They obviously want you dead
at all costs.

383
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,654
And even, potentially, all of mankind's.

384
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,616
Well, that's really great because
even we can't stop The Hollow.

385
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,327
Which is why we need to get it
before they do.

386
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,370
- Wait, what?
- Piper,

387
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,664
do you remember the last time
somebody unleashed it?

388
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:57,503
Yes, I do. The Source used it to steal
our powers, which, I think, is the point.

389
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:01,048
But, then, he went nuts and then
it went into Cole and he went nuts.

390
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,258
And then he turned evil
and we had to vanquish him.

391
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,801
Is that ringing any bells, here?

392
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,638
Yes, which is precisely why
we need to get it first.

393
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:12,309
Finally, Phoebe...

394
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,190
What's going on?

395
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,108
In there.

396
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,742
- Are those demons?
- Yes, they are, but...

397
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:32,287
- What the hell are they doing...?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

398
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,832
Okay.

399
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,792
I'm sorry.

400
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:41,588
We're just... We're a little on edge
right now, you know?

401
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:45,342
I think you should go.

402
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:48,887
No. There's no way. I'm not leaving,
especially with demons out there.

403
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:52,432
I can't do this right now.
Okay, I don't have time for this.

404
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,853
I don't have time for you, okay?
I'm completely overwhelmed.

405
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:59,356
My sisters are sitting out there
and they need me right now.

406
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:01,567
And that's the most important thing
in my life.

407
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,527
Okay? So I can't.

408
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,489
I'm sorry.

409
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,880
You okay?

410
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,132
Does it matter?

411
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:26,884
So are we gonna do this, or what?

412
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,934
Hey, buddy, five more minutes
to bath time.

413
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:38,395
Okay?

414
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,151
Hi.

415
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:51,950
It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.
Auntie Billie sent me.

416
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:56,163
No, Wyatt, Wyatt,
Grandpa won't understand.

417
00:24:56,538 --> 00:25:00,125
He's not magical.
He'll ruin everything.

418
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,753
Do you want to help save Mommy?

419
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:06,590
Because you can, you know,
but you have to trust me.

420
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:09,927
I'm not going to make you go
anywhere. I promise.

421
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:14,348
All you have to do is orb back home.
Auntie Billie will tell you the rest.

422
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,976
Do you think you can do that?

423
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,770
For Mommy?

424
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,777
Well, that's a good boy.

425
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:30,781
Now, hurry, son, before it's too late.
Go on.

426
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,675
Wyatt, what are you
doing here, honey?

427
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:52,469
I'm gonna help Mommy.

428
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:59,142
And the best way to do that
is to help Aunt Billie

429
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:00,853
and her sister get more powers.

430
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:02,896
Dumain, what is this?

431
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:05,148
But the kind of power they need
can only be summoned

432
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:08,151
with great power itself.
Charmed power.

433
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,862
It's the only way
to summon The Hollow.

434
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:13,657
- That's crazy. We can't do...
- You don't have a choice.

435
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:15,492
It's the only way
to guarantee success.

436
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:18,787
It's the only way to save the greater
good and it's the only way

437
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:23,000
to save Wyatt and Chris
from following in the wrong footsteps.

438
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:32,009
Look, I wanna get them
as much as anybody else.

439
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:33,302
But at what cost?

440
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,846
You know, if we take this in,
how do we get rid of it?

441
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,556
Well, there's a spell right here.

442
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:41,476
Okay, if we summon the Hollow
and we get infected,

443
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,520
who is gonna be around to say it?

444
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,439
She's got a point.

445
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:49,026
Well, we can take Billie and Christy out
before we get infected

446
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:52,446
or we can do nothing,
let them get The Hollow

447
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:55,365
and then all of this really won't matter
because then we'll be dead.

448
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:58,952
You do realise, of course,
that taking out Billie and Christy

449
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:02,623
will only eliminate today's problems.

450
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:05,167
- What about tomorrow?
- What are you talking about?

451
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:07,127
What am I talking about? The Triad.

452
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,754
You'll have to go
after them, too,

453
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:10,464
if you want
this nightmare to be over.

454
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:14,009
Otherwise, they're gonna keep finding
new ways to attack you

455
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:16,470
for another eight years.

456
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:17,721
But with The Hollow,

457
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,099
you'll have the power to vanquish them
once and for all.

458
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:24,394
How do we know
you're not gonna come after us next?

459
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:27,773
We might, but probably not
any time soon.

460
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,318
No, we're not powerful enough
to challenge the Charmed Ones.

461
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,905
No demon who remains is,
save for the Triad.

462
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:39,910
You decimated the old guard and, we...
Well, we need time to rebuild.

463
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:42,830
We might be ready when
your next generation takes power.

464
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:46,291
I'll be looking forward to it.

465
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:51,296
There'll be nothing to look forward to.
Unless you take in The Hollow. Now.

466
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,936
Do you see him again?

467
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,855
Yes.

468
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:14,778
Let's do it.

469
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:23,370
Come on Phoebe, pick up.

470
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:26,415
<i>Hey, it's Phoebe.
Leave me your name and number.</i>

471
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:30,127
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't you worry, big buddy.

472
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,421
We are gonna find your brother.

473
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:38,051
Yes, we are.
Don't you worry about a thing.

474
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,887
Yeah.

475
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,096
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, Piper.</i>

476
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:42,931
<i>Sorry I can't get to the phone
right now.</i>

477
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,474
Damn it.

478
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,768
Oh, sorry, baby,
didn't mean to scare you.

479
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:51,773
Christy, we can't do this.
This isn't right. He's 3.

480
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,400
We need him.
We don't have a choice.

481
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:54,818
Well, what if he gets hurt?

482
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:56,987
That's a chance we'll have to take.

483
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:00,282
What has happened to you?
Are you even listening to yourself?

484
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:03,619
We didn't create this problem, Billie.
They did.

485
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:06,246
They're the ones who turned
their backs on everything good.

486
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:09,166
It's not our fault this is happening.

487
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,420
Okay, listen to me, Billie.
We've come this far.

488
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:14,922
We can't go back now.

489
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,966
If we don't do what we have to do,
they're gonna kill us.

490
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,444
Hi. Look, you only have to hold
our hands and we'll do the rest, okay?

491
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:38,946
Okay.

492
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:42,366
I hope one day you understand.

493
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:45,095
Hey, Chris.

494
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:47,931
Listen, buddy. Hide-and-seek.

495
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:52,394
You wanna play hide-and-seek?
Okay, where's Wyatt?

496
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:54,313
Can you find Wyatt?

497
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,441
Can you use your powers
to bring him home, please?

498
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,820
Its thirst for power is insatiable.

499
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:04,114
It craves it, absorbs it.

500
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:07,951
Now take his.

501
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,955
Hold out your hands.

502
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:21,131
Now you have his powers, all of them,
including his power to orb.

503
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,392
But that's not possible.

504
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:48,158
Oh, attaboy, slugger.

505
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:49,660
Attaboy.

506
00:31:57,292 --> 00:32:01,463
Just so you know, your sacrifice
will lead to the end of the Triad.

507
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,507
What sacrifice?

508
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:20,357
- First the Triad.
- Then Billie and Christy.

509
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:28,073
You don't understand.
It's an uncontrollable situation.

510
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,450
There's... There is no telling
what they'll do now.

511
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:33,036
They'll go after the Charmed Ones,
destroy them.

512
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,372
Yes, of course, but then what?

513
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:38,125
By infecting them,
their only allegiance now is to power.

514
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:41,211
- Your point being?
- They can't be stopped.

515
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:44,673
Short of some cataclysmic event,
The Hollow will never leave them.

516
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,217
Which means they'll keep craving
more and more power,

517
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:49,595
until they have it all. Including yours.

518
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,264
I think we can handle them
if they come.

519
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:54,641
But you can't.

520
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:57,603
Don't you see? Nobody can.

521
00:32:57,936 --> 00:32:59,730
We can.

522
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,169
We've been waiting for you.

523
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:23,795
Well, your wait is over.

524
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:26,423
No potions, huh?

525
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,342
We don't need any potions.

526
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:31,470
Funny, neither do we.

527
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:33,722
I knew we shouldn't have trusted you.

528
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:35,933
You should have followed
your instincts.

529
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:39,645
- Next time.
- There won't be a next time.

530
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:17,928
Phoebe.

531
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:20,264
It's okay.

532
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:25,102
Phoebe, come on.

533
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:28,355
Wake up, wake up. Come on.

534
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,316
It's okay. Look at me, look at me.

535
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,945
Breathe, sweetie.
Come on, kid, now, wake up.

536
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:42,286
No.

537
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:51,461
No.

538
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:18,489
Piper.

539
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,710
The battle is over.

540
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:34,505
Though not as I expected.

541
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:05,077
Paige? Hold her. Hold her.

542
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:06,870
Paige!

543
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,293
Paige.

544
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:18,882
Billie.

545
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:26,723
Piper! What are you doing? Stop!

546
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:29,685
What's the matter with you?
You're gonna kill her.

547
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,854
No, let go of me.

548
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:33,856
Stop, you don't understand. Stop!

549
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:35,732
Christy!

550
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:42,781
Why did you do that?
You let her get away.

551
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:44,158
We need to get out of here, okay?

552
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:47,119
There is nothing left for us here, okay?
Do you understand me?

553
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:49,079
We gotta go.
