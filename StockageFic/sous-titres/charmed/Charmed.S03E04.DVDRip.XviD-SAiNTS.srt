0
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,798
All right, let's go. I was supposed to be
at the club half an hour ago.

1
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,155
Hey, are you a good witch
or a bad witch?

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,590
I am going to be a very good witch
from now on.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,877
And you picked a role model
who wears lots and lots of pink?

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,710
- Yes.
- Glinda helped innocents, didn't she?

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,876
- Yes.
- You had the answer all along?

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,235
That's not help, that's mind games.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,516
I'm not gonna let you spoil
my new attitude.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,434
I'm going to celebrate
the witch's holiday with enthusiasm.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,430
The problem is, you never
know what you're celebrating

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,637
- when you celebrate Halloween.
- Details. Where's Darryl?

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,308
He's in the kitchen, on the phone.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,149
Hook-nosed hags riding broomsticks,
that's what we're celebrating.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,635
Personally, I am offended
by the representation of witches

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,074
in popular culture.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,479
Right, which is why you're dressed
as the mistress of the dark.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,989
This costume happens to be
a protest statement.

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,310
I am so impressed that you
can make a protest statement

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,277
and show cleavage
all at the same time.

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,271
- Thanks.
- Amazing.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,398
Let's go.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,637
All right, inspector. Put down
the phone and nobody gets hurt.

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,189
Yeah, sweetie, I gotta go.
Give your folks my love, okay?

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,395
I miss you guys.

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,519
- Nice costume.
- Yeah, it's from my rookie days.

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,352
- Still fits.
- Yeah, mine too.

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,311
Isn't that from World War II?

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,639
Who are you?

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,392
I'll explain on the way.

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,519
So in the meantime, we can just stick
together, since we are both dateless.

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,518
He's not dateless, he's married.
You're dateless because you're picky.

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,392
No. I'm not settling, all right.

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,790
The perfect guy is out there,
a real man,

33
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,598
and I will find him, trust me.

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,998
And they're gonna love the popcorn
and caramel in your teeth too.

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,628
All right, Darryl, let's go.
Somebody, get something.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,395
We can't leave yet.
We have to wait for Cole.

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,551
Cole Turner?

38
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,671
The ADA?

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,949
You're dating him?

40
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,837
No, I just sort of invited him
to go along with us.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,719
It wasn't set in stone or anything,
but something must've come up.

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,479
Hey. Hey, cool costumes, dudes.

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,832
What the hell are you doing?

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,558
Belthazor?

45
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,032
I use the name Cole here.

46
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,591
Let him go.

47
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,152
We don't need him.
Not to get the Charmed Ones.

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,316
My next question,
didn't they already get you...

49
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,072
...two years ago?
- Yeah, but it's Halloween.

50
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,390
When the veil between worlds thin...

51
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,552
...when the demons who know how
can return to seek their revenge.

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,993
I know.

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,230
Which is why I have a different plan
for the witches.

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,516
One that doesn't include you.

55
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,238
One that's been approved
by the Triad.

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,756
We don't answer to anyone
anymore. We're dead.

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,271
There's dead...

58
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,839
...and there's dead.

59
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,990
Fine. I'll just move up my timetable.

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,319
I've always hated that demon.

61
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,748
Nice costume though.

62
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,359
I want a picture of all of us first,
but I have to get my broomstick.

63
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,232
Cliché.

64
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,354
Come on, you guys, hurry up.

65
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,915
Trick or treat.

66
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,550
Oh, my God, that is so weird,
they look just like the Grim...

67
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,790
- "Uh-oh" what?
- Piper. Prue. Phoebe.

68
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,198
Didn't we vanquish them already?

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,913
That's not what I wanted
to warn you about.

70
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,678
What do you mean?

71
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,669
That's what I wanted
to warn you about.

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,678
Look out!

73
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,748
Leo, what the hell is...?

74
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,398
Wait!

75
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,229
They don't know what's happening!

76
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,070
This isn't good, right?

77
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,312
- Is everybody okay?
- Too soon to tell.

78
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,879
Did the Grimlocks do this?

79
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,429
Unless we're dead and this
is the hereafter, I don't think so.

80
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,556
Eternally Elvira.

81
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,869
All right.

82
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,670
- So this sort of looks like an altar.
- A witch's altar. What's going on?

83
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,239
There they are!

84
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,634
Kill the witches!

85
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,759
- You had to ask?!
- Not good, not good, not good.

86
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,918
We're not in Kansas anymore.

87
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,273
Come along!

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,033
Over there!

89
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,109
Come with me this way.

90
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,392
Don't tell me we've time-travelled
again. I hate time-travelling.

91
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,795
You do? I was burned at the stake
last time, remember?

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,195
All right, let's make sure
that doesn't happen again.

93
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,276
From what they're wearing,
it looks to be, what, 16, 1700s?

94
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,314
Where the life expectancy of the
average witch is, what, 15 minutes.

95
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,079
Find anything, Micah?

96
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,237
No, nothing here.

97
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,154
- Ride on.
- Ride on, men!

98
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,914
Hey, why didn't you
let me freeze him?

99
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,230
I don't know,
there was just something...

100
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,398
Okay, you know what?
I don't care why we're here

101
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,630
or how we got here,
I just wanna get home.

102
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,997
I've got a life to live and decorations
to hang, so where's the damn vortex?

103
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,594
I don't know where the vortex...

104
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,670
First demons I've ever seen.

105
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,073
Actually, except for that blond
with the funky snake tongue thingy.

106
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,515
- What are they?
- I don't know.

107
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,750
How do you know they didn't
make the girls disappear?

108
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,679
Because this is different.

109
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,798
This is a time portal that my bosses
sent them through.

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,797
Which is closed now, damn it.

111
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,437
- Who are you?
- I'm their...

112
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,358
Never mind.
It's too complicated.

113
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,431
I gotta get you out of here
before they unfreeze.

114
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,108
- Hold it, I'm not going anywhere.
- I've gotta figure out a way

115
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,236
to get rid of these demons
before the girls return,

116
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,958
otherwise they'll be sitting ducks.

117
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,876
- Are you sure they're coming back?
- They better be.

118
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,350
They gotta do it before
Halloween ends too, which means...

119
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,357
Which means you're gonna need
my help.

120
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,158
You don't know
what you're up against here.

121
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,554
The problem is, neither do you,

122
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,632
which means you're gonna need
a cop around to help you figure it out.

123
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,837
They're like sisters to me, Leo.

124
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,913
All right.

125
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,999
Phoebe said that she thought they had
vanquished these demons before,

126
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,912
so the first thing we have to do is...

127
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,078
Run.

128
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,591
Come on, let's go!

129
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,192
At least we can't die.

130
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,269
They can.

131
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,188
We have to figure out
where the witches went.

132
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,118
We know where they went.

133
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,952
Cole got them.

134
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,476
But if he fails, they'll be back.

135
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,596
And they'll be in our way.

136
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,554
Blessed be.

137
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,151
Our prayers have been answered.

138
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,594
- We need your help.
- Excuse me?

139
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,990
Forgive me for the manner in which
you were brought here,

140
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,390
but we had to make sure
you were who we'd sent for.

141
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,955
This doorway would have told us
if you were evil.

142
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,035
- Where can we get one of those?
- All right, wait.

143
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,599
Who do you think we are?

144
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,717
The most powerful good witches
of all time, of course.

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,355
- Okay, lucky guess.
- And you are?

146
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,630
I am Eva. A midwife, a witch,

147
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,791
and a free citizen
of the colony of Virginia.

148
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,439
These good women are my coven.

149
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,109
Come. Now, we don't have
much time.

150
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,750
No one can suspect that you've
come to us from the future.

151
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,030
- This is for you.
- Witches must not have to hide

152
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,553
in your time.

153
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,752
- What year are you from?
- 2000.

154
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,754
- What year is it now?
- 1670.

155
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,956
All right, so why do you need
our help?

156
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,438
To save a magical baby
who's prophesied to be born tonight.

157
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,949
- Save it from who?
- A dark practitioner.

158
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,317
She kidnapped the baby's mother
in hopes of raising the child evil.

159
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,513
If that happens, good magic
will never flourish in the New World.

160
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,148
You must rescue Charlotte
so that you can bring her here

161
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,709
and we can deliver her baby
within our own protective circle.

162
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,155
Wait a minute, you have the power
to bring us through time

163
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,039
but you don't have the power
to set her free yourself?

164
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,636
Well, we cast spells to prepare
your way of course,

165
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,711
but we know it was the power
of All Hallows Eve

166
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,279
that brought you here, not us.

167
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,919
All Hallows Eve?

168
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,476
A witch's most sacred day.

169
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,757
The day when the source of all magic
can be tapped into.

170
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,712
How can you not know
about All Hallows Eve?

171
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,038
It isn't what it used to be.

172
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,233
Wait a minute.

173
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,358
You can tap into that power
to send us home, right?

174
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,676
We assumed you could.

175
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,670
They assumed that we could.

176
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,032
Okay, well, Piper, I have an idea.
So, what time is it?

177
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,590
It's 2:15.

178
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,992
You've made a big clock so small,
you must possess great magic.

179
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,593
Just a good credit card.

180
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,919
Okay, excuse us for a minute.
Can we talk?

181
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,514
All right, I think
that I have this figured out.

182
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,639
I think that they sent us here, and
that's what Leo was trying to tell us.

183
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,360
Leave it to them to zap first
and give instructions never.

184
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,592
All right, but if I'm right, the only way
that they are going to let us go home

185
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,910
is if we bring that baby
back here by midnight.

186
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,789
- All right, Eva, do you have a plan?
- Yes.

187
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,078
This vial holds a potion which will put
the men who guard the house to sleep.

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,639
Then you'll use your powers
to bring the mother back here.

189
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,995
Easy for her to say.

190
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,439
We must be careful.

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,070
Looks like they're having a party.

192
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,032
It's the kidnapper, Ruth Cobb.

193
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,395
She's doing it pretending to mock
All Hallows Eve, but I know better.

194
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,956
She's really doing it to tap into
the powers of dark magic.

195
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,472
- Looks like our welcoming committee.
- Witch hunters.

196
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,671
Hunters of good witches, maybe.

197
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,990
They work for Ruth. They're after us.

198
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,072
Not all of them.

199
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,838
Beware the talismans.

200
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,029
They've barred our way each time
we tried to rescue Charlotte.

201
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,635
Oh, honey, those don't really pack
much of a punch

202
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,234
- where we come from.
- No, you don't realize...

203
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,396
Witches! There they are!

204
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,309
What the hell was that?

205
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,318
- The talismans?
- No way they have that much power.

206
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,953
They never have before.

207
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,350
Ruth's using the magic
of All Hallows Eve.

208
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,795
- Guards!
- All right, I got them. I got them.

209
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,233
What just happened?
What's the matter?

210
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,992
I don't know.

211
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,519
Piper!

212
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,831
- Use your powers.
- We don't have any.

213
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,268
- What?
- Run!

214
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,468
Oh, God.

215
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,069
It appears your witch friend
has brought others

216
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,958
to try and rescue you again.

217
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,996
Unfortunately, she's been wounded.

218
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,079
Oh, easy now, Charlotte.

219
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,232
We wouldn't want anything bad to
happen to your baby, now would we?

220
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,593
I won't let you have my baby.

221
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,950
Oh, you won't have a choice.

222
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,918
Especially since somebody
very special has recently arrived

223
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,308
to ensure it.

224
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,274
- How much longer, Ruth?
- Soon.

225
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,715
By nightfall perhaps.

226
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,592
You imbued the talismans
with great power.

227
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,149
Care to share your secrets?

228
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,752
Who are you?
Where do you come from, pray tell?

229
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,229
I come from the future.

230
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,952
To change it.

231
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,869
Eva, we're sorry. We didn't know
that our powers weren't...

232
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,110
Just leave us.

233
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,039
Just go back to wherever it is
you came from.

234
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,156
We asked for
the most powerful witches of all time,

235
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,753
and instead we get
powerless frauds.

236
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,392
Okay, I know
you're a little disappointed,

237
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,835
but "frauds" is a little harsh,
don't you think?

238
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,677
We do have powers, we just...
Or at least,

239
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,354
we had them, we just can't
access them right now.

240
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,795
Maybe that's because technically
we don't really exist yet,

241
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,552
so neither do our powers.

242
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,957
Protecting this baby is my destiny.

243
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,031
How can we come this far
just to fail?

244
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,556
We're asking ourselves
the same thing.

245
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,395
Bite down.

246
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,548
What are you doing?

247
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,269
- Cauterising her wound.
- No, no, no, no, no.

248
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,391
We may not have our powers,
but we do have basics.

249
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,553
Just get some hot water and
some soap and some clean cloths.

250
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,753
Hurry.

251
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,717
Eva, don't give up on us yet,
all right. I know that we can help.

252
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,349
Yeah, we've been through
tougher jams than this before.

253
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,074
- We have?
- Haven't we?

254
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,113
We were born witches.
That makes us innately magical.

255
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,076
Maybe you can just teach us
how to tap into it.

256
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,358
- There's not enough time.
- We're quick studies.

257
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,473
That thing's not gonna work
on them.

258
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,835
Maybe not, but it makes them
think twice about it.

259
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,912
Otherwise they would've
blasted in on us by now.

260
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,072
- Plus, it's the only thing we got.
- Maybe not.

261
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,151
I think I found out who they are.

262
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,193
"Grimlocks: underground demons
who are sensitive to light

263
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,669
and steal children's sight
so they can see the aura

264
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,593
that surrounds good people
and strangle them with it."

265
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,436
That snake-tongued blond
is looking better and better.

266
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,313
At least there's
a vanquishing potion here.

267
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,872
We can't keep waiting here.

268
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,639
We should be downstairs,
waiting for the witches.

269
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,430
We can't absorb any more wounds.

270
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,714
If they come into range,
we won't have to.

271
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,279
Darryl.

272
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,874
I told you you didn't know
what you were up against.

273
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,678
Who are you?

274
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,238
Come on, we got a potion
to cook up.

275
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,430
Your contractions are coming
closer together.

276
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,830
It won't be long now.

277
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,993
Don't touch me.

278
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,271
There's no need for you to be
any more uncomfortable

279
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,429
than you have to be.

280
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,593
Really?

281
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,998
Then let me go.

282
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,111
I beg you.

283
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,756
Even if I could, it wouldn't help.

284
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,715
Another would be sent
to take you right back.

285
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,030
What? What do you see?

286
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,234
A force of great good.

287
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,153
From your time.

288
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,797
Here for the baby as well.

289
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,799
Three of them.

290
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,077
I'm not surprised. My travelling here
undoubtedly alerted the other side.

291
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,472
- But this new force...
- If it's who I think it is,

292
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,312
I can handle them.

293
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,550
You just make sure she stays here
through midnight.

294
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,028
Here.

295
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,156
Dolls? We tap into our powers
with dolls?

296
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,038
It's not just a doll, it's a totem.

297
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,112
It reminds us of the wisdom
and the power of women.

298
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,271
Okay, but what does it
have to do with?

299
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,476
The witch's journey
is a walk of wisdom

300
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,315
collected over the years, Phoebe.
Wisdom gives us power.

301
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,029
Power frightens the fearful
and ignorant.

302
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,990
Well, that would certainly explain
why in our time,

303
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,832
witches are made to look silly
on Halloween.

304
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,868
And this magic, this knowledge,
is forgotten?

305
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,959
We could get it back
if you teach us.

306
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,508
Here.

307
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,831
The conical hat is a spiritual point.

308
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,070
It helps to channel our magic.

309
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,840
Keeps us centred, focused.

310
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,709
The apple holds a pentacle
in its heart.

311
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,989
Add a laurel leaf,
you will block the path of evil.

312
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,397
- A simple laurel leaf?
- Simple, but powerful.

313
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,751
Remember, there is magic
all around you.

314
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,638
Especially on this night.

315
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,878
What's with the masks?

316
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,389
Demons walk freely
on All Hallows Eve.

317
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,793
So a mask allows you to hide
your identity, walk amongst them.

318
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,313
Can I see that?

319
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,672
Okay, now, don't tell me
you ride around on this thing.

320
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,630
Anything's possible.

321
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,115
Here.

322
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,192
The broom's traditional purpose
is to sweep evil from your path.

323
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,275
Sweep east to west,
same path as the sun travels.

324
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,796
Like anything else in magic,
it's how you do it.

325
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,633
With knowledge and reverence.

326
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,988
Wow, do I feel silly.

327
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,116
- What happened?
- Nothing.

328
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,794
- Must've been just a spark.
- No.

329
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,791
You felt the power.

330
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,878
All right, Sally will go with you
to Ruth's house.

331
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,669
She'll give you the last few things
you'll need. I wish I could go with you.

332
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,674
We'll do great. You've armed us well.

333
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,031
Remember, connect with the power
of this day.

334
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,029
Will you know what they look like?

335
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,675
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay at the house.

336
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,355
The house is guarded by men and
magic. Charlotte's not going anywhere.

337
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,877
I've seen the future, Ruth.
Your ignorance is your destiny.

338
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,269
Charlotte should be in the bedroom
at the top of the stairs.

339
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,158
Be careful. Ruth's guards
are everywhere.

340
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,709
If they see you with these tools,
they'll know you as witches.

341
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,957
- Don't worry, we won't fail this time.
- I know you won't. Which of you

342
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,031
- will be standing guard for the others?
- Phoebe.

343
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,510
If need be, this will turn away
evil spirits.

344
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,836
Perhaps even the demon
you think Ruth summoned.

345
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,752
You're kidding, right?

346
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,799
- Okay, you're not kidding.
- Blessed be. Good luck.

347
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,312
All right.

348
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,631
- Trick or treat.
- Oh, boy.

349
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,555
Care to know your future, milady?

350
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,355
Oh, no, thanks,
I'm pretty familiar with it already.

351
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,595
Are you certain?

352
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,718
I can show you the first initial
of your true love's name.

353
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,911
Really? You can do that?

354
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,680
- With a simple peel of the apple.
- Prove it.

355
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,510
And why would you
be interested, sir?

356
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,438
And why wouldn't you be?

357
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,714
Okay. How do I do it?

358
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,279
First, you must fill your heart
with only thoughts of love.

359
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,831
And close your eyes
and blow on the peel.

360
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,792
Drop the peel into the water.

361
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,915
- And watch.
- And how is it that apple

362
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,992
- knows this big secret?
- It's simple, milady.

363
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,711
Apples are the fruit of knowledge.

364
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,872
It is C.

365
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,389
The name of your true love
begins with a C.

366
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,312
Cole.

367
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,234
Witch!

368
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,079
No.

369
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,713
Phoebe!

370
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,155
- Those two as well!
- Hey!

371
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,038
- There's your three.
- Hang the witches.

372
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,071
- Hang them.
- Hang them!

373
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,157
- Hang them all!
- My pleasure.

374
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,914
- Take them from here.
- Hang them!

375
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,599
Take them away.

376
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,952
To the woods. Hang them.

377
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,953
Take them away.

378
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,552
Come along.

379
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,278
Hang them!

380
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,792
Tell me this isn't happening.

381
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,876
Hang, witch.

382
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,152
Onward.

383
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,948
Ride on.

384
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,833
My apologies.
A little trick I learned from the French.

385
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,437
Run the noose line to the waist.

386
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,509
Yeah, well, it's a really good thing
the other guards didn't see you do that.

387
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,315
Wait a minute. I don't understand.

388
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,715
How did you know
you could trust him?

389
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,677
By the look in his eyes.

390
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,514
So that would be the second time
that you've saved our necks.

391
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,315
And what beautiful necks they are.

392
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,874
I'm Micah.

393
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,914
I'm charmed.

394
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,068
All right, I hate to bust up
the balcony scene, Romeo,

395
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,231
but why do you keep saving us?

396
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,914
And why are you running
with the witch hunters?

397
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,753
So I can undo their work
whenever possible.

398
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,158
I've seen what dark magic can do.

399
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,513
If you're fighting that,
I'm on your side.

400
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,911
And I should get back
before anyone gets suspicious.

401
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,274
Thank you.

402
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,838
Another time.

403
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,356
Who was that masked man?

404
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,797
Okay, you finally found a real man.

405
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,315
Too bad he lives
in colonial Virginia, Prue.

406
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,636
We need to get out of here.
Pay attention.

407
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,756
Okay, any idea
how we're gonna save the baby?

408
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,471
Well, they think we're dead now.
They certainly aren't expecting us.

409
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,436
Right. Besides, you guys...

410
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,511
...we're witches,
and it's All Hallows Eve, so...

411
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,592
- All right, glow elsewhere.
- Oh, right.

412
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,918
We need more thyme.

413
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,115
I can't help you there, buddy.
It's almost nightfall.

414
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,955
No, I'm talking about an herb,
it's for the potion. It's over there.

415
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,549
- Thyme, right?
- Yeah.

416
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,911
Do you think they know
what we're doing in here?

417
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,675
Probably. It'd explain why
they haven't burst in on us yet.

418
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,875
- Trick-or-treaters?
- Or a trap.

419
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,353
Didn't you say those things
steal kids' sight?

420
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,478
No, I should go. I can orb.

421
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,511
Which might be exactly
what they're waiting for.

422
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,829
Stay here, finish that potion.

423
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,470
No matter what happens, you make
sure you bring the girls home safe...

424
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,232
...whoever you are.

425
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,476
- Trick or treat.
- Spread the word. We're out of candy.

426
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,599
I don't see Ruth or the guards.
What time is it?

427
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,035
It's... It's 6.

428
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,918
And we're running out of time
and magic.

429
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,117
- It doesn't change what we have to do.
- How will we get past the talismans?

430
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,748
- Do you remember what Eva said?
- The "powerless frauds" part?

431
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,717
No, the "magic is all around us" part.

432
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,395
Well, it's time we learned how to
access that to sweep away evil.

433
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,834
What, no funny hat?

434
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,356
Lavender. Didn't she say
that was a protection herb?

435
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:50,470
Yes, and the wisdom of the women
before us will guide us again.

436
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,712
Okay, get sweeping.

437
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,796
Okay, which way is east?

438
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,032
That way.

439
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,989
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, keep going.

440
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,800
- It's working.
- All right, that's good.

441
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,828
- Micah.
- Prue, you can't.

442
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,877
Wrong.

443
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,109
- They found him out.
- We have to get to Charlotte.

444
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,559
What would he want you to do?

445
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,517
- Hi.
- Who are you?

446
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,280
Eva sent us. Charlotte,
we're here to take you back.

447
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,392
You're lying. I don't believe...

448
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,834
Okay, okay.

449
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,115
How does Lamaze breathing go?

450
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,754
Oh, that's it.

451
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,792
Oh, God.

452
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,872
Okay, try this. Okay, we'll do this.

453
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,034
How are you making the pain
go away?

454
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,551
Good magic. Just keep breathing.

455
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,398
- Good magic?
- Acupressure.

456
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,310
Good idea. All right.
We need to get you out of here.

457
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,999
Come on, honey. It's okay.

458
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,995
- Oh, her water just broke.
- I see that.

459
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,271
It serves you well.

460
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,473
- Quickly, check the house!
- No.

461
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,631
I know these witches.

462
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,150
They've already got Charlotte.

463
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,118
Follow me.

464
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,475
I know where they're going.

465
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,868
The altar.

466
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,116
Okay, just a little while longer,
we're almost there.

467
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,833
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- Yes, Charlotte.

468
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,069
- You can do this.
- No.

469
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,515
- Charlotte.
- The baby's coming now.

470
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,198
Oh, God.

471
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,670
Okay. Easy, easy.

472
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,670
It's almost 11.
Do you think they gave up on us?

473
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,672
- No, I don't think so.
- All right, what do we have?

474
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,035
We got big problems, a little time
and a little magic.

475
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,270
Didn't Eva say something
about Charlotte giving birth

476
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,556
- in a protective circle?
- Can we make one of those?

477
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,075
I don't know, we've got lavender and...

478
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,151
Isn't rosemary supposed to be good
for protection?

479
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,237
Apples and laurel leaves
block the path of evil.

480
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,590
Put it all together, it may just work.

481
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,872
- Who's gonna deliver the baby?
- Personally, I think you should,

482
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,230
considering we know
you're gonna have one in the future.

483
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,436
- I second that.
- Wait a minute.

484
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,235
- Go.
- I always get the messy jobs.

485
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,994
All right, if ever there was a time
that we were going to connect,

486
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,516
it needs to be now. So, Phoebe,
form a circle, I'll work on the apples.

487
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,911
Over here.

488
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,794
Okay, you're gonna have to try
and be kind of quiet.

489
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,956
Okay, I know, I'm sorry. Okay.

490
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,749
Don't worry.
Everything's under control.

491
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,748
Oh, my God. I see it.
I see it.

492
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,672
- Really?
- Phoebe, the circle.

493
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,592
- The circle.
- Okay.

494
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,033
Just... Just try not to push, okay.

495
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,953
- This baby is coming.
- Yeah, well, so are they.

496
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,677
Okay, we can do this.

497
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,155
- Yes, we can do this.
- We have to do this.

498
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,958
All right, here.

499
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,794
Knowledge and reverence.

500
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,439
Knowledge and reverence

501
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,512
Knowledge and reverence
Knowledge and reverence

502
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,918
- What are you doing?
- Seeing what they've learned.

503
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,959
- Here they come.
- Prue.

504
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,439
All right. Put it all together,
it's gonna work.

505
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,718
Come on.

506
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,232
They've connected.

507
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,550
- It's over.
- No, not yet.

508
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,512
How cool is that? It actually worked.

509
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,915
- Or not.
- It doesn't stop bullets.

510
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,034
We are running out of ammo.

511
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,395
Prue, it's not like an apple
is gonna stop them anyway.

512
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,638
It's a girl.

513
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,190
Piper, get Charlotte and the baby
out of here.

514
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,639
Okay, I think I have an idea
of what might really scare them.

515
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,432
What are you gonna do?

516
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,068
I'm going to embrace the cliché.

517
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,238
There is something
you don't see every day.

518
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,230
- A flying witch!
- Their power is great!

519
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,475
Gotta give them credit.
They're awfully good.

520
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,472
It's all right.

521
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,638
Time's on my side.

522
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,394
Blessed be.

523
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,229
- Isn't the future beautiful?
- It is, thanks to you.

524
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,277
You found the power.

525
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,436
You showed us where to look.

526
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,991
Yeah, I guess we now know
where all that flying hag stuff started.

527
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,156
You only have yourself to blame,
right, Pheebs?

528
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,878
I know it and I love it.

529
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,679
Now if I could just figure out
how to take it back with me.

530
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,196
Hey, what are they waiting for?
Why haven't they sent us home yet?

531
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,238
Maybe we haven't learned everything
that we're supposed to yet.

532
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,392
Well, it's almost midnight,
so if we're gonna learn anything more,

533
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,709
we better hurry.

534
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,237
I promise my daughter
will know of you.

535
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,473
Of the three powerful witches
who came to bring her into this world.

536
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,552
And we'll always be grateful.

537
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,474
Won't we, Melinda?

538
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,399
Melinda?

539
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,710
Yes, Melinda.

540
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,199
Melinda Warren.

541
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,635
What is it?

542
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,272
I...

543
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,919
I think we're related.

544
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,511
I told you they'd come.

545
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,949
Hey.

546
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,716
Hey, haven't I vanquished you
somewhere before?

547
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,791
Are you guys all right?

548
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,712
Are we all right? Are you all right?

549
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,639
- It's been a long day.
- Yeah, tell us about it.

550
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,595
- Darryl?
- Prue?

551
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,919
I got it.

552
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,476
Okay, open your eyes.

553
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,593
Happy Halloween.

554
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,315
Use that broom with reverence.

555
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,757
Hey, Halloween is now officially
my favourite holiday.

556
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,475
- Who knew?
- We didn't. But we should have.

557
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,838
So much knowledge, so much power
that we lost. But we'll get it back.

558
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,150
Okay, well, one crash course
at a time.

559
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,033
Yeah. It's too bad Darryl
didn't feel up to celebrating with us.

560
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,550
He saw a lot today. I think he needs
some time to sort it all out.

561
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,149
Yeah, well, so do we. I mean,
it's bad enough that the Triad

562
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,790
wants us dead, but to send someone
back to wipe out our whole line?

563
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,916
Do your bosses have any clue
who it is?

564
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,753
None that they're sharing.

565
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,394
I think it was that guy who was
hitting on Phoebe at the party.

566
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,189
Hang on. Not every guy I meet
wants to kill me.

567
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,918
Maybe he just liked me.

568
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,193
Well, you saved Melinda.
And that's all that matters.

569
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:03,196
And I helped to deliver our great, great,
great-whatever. Great-grandmother.

570
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,868
Too bad we couldn't save her
from moving from Virginia to Salem.

571
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,189
That would've been nice.

572
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,670
Yeah, well, you can't change history,
for better or worse.

573
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,398
Excuse me.

574
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,910
- Hi.
- Micah?

575
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,754
Mitch, actually.

576
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,711
Forgive my directness, but I've been
watching you from across the room.

577
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,038
Have we met?

578
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,636
You know, that's funny,
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

579
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,392
My turn.

580
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,912
- Hey.
- Hey.

581
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,510
I was beginning to think
I got stood up.

582
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,077
Yeah, sorry. Work, you know.
I guess I just lost track of time.

583
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,748
That's okay.
I got kind of hung up myself.

584
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,789
So you're an angel.

585
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,914
This?

586
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,998
No, not really.

587
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,274
That's okay.

588
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,193
Neither am I.
