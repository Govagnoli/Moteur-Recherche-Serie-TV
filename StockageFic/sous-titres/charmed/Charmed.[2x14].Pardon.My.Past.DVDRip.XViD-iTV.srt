1
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:12,406
- Great party.
- Thanks. Drive carefully.

2
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:13,803
Good night.

3
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:20,124
Great party.
We should do this more often.

4
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:24,043
Yeah, maybe next time
we can trim the guest list by one.

5
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:27,645
Piper, I had to invite Leo. He was at
the club when I picked up the supplies.

6
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:29,242
He knew that we were
throwing a party.

7
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:32,805
Well, didn't you think maybe he'd feel
a little bit awkward because of Dan?

8
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:36,317
Doesn't look like
he feels too awkward to me.

9
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,960
Look, Piper, he's been mortal for what,
a couple of weeks now?

10
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:41,801
I felt bad for him.
He doesn't know anybody.

11
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,243
And it's not like there's

12
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:45,798
a fallen-whitelighter support group
to join or anything.

13
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:49,684
Prue, I'm not upset with you.
I'm just upset with the whole situation.

14
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:54,320
Well, Leo is just gonna have to accept
the fact that you're with Dan now.

15
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,639
You are still with Dan, right?

16
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:59,323
Yes, of course.

17
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:02,400
What do you think they're
talking about?

18
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:04,685
- You.
- Great.

19
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:06,563
Hey, you guys.

20
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:08,919
Give me a break.
It's after midnight. I have midterms.

21
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:11,199
Sorry, Pheebs, didn't realize
we were being so loud.

22
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,325
Why don't you take a study break,
clear your head.

23
00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:15,963
I can't, I have too many phobias.

24
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:17,807
To learn about, for my psych exam.

25
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:19,322
I had no idea there were so many:

26
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:24,279
Claustrophobia, arachnophobia,
kleptophobia, phallus-phobia.

27
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:26,445
- "Relaxaphobia."
- Cute.

28
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:28,560
- Just trying to help.
- Help by keeping it down.

29
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:31,562
- Did I mention it's after midnight?
- Twice.

30
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:34,442
- Party's breaking up anyway.
- Thank you.

31
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:41,244
What the hell are they talking about?

32
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:43,644
My favourite ball player?
Joe DiMaggio, hands down.

33
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:45,168
I meant when you were
growing up.

34
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,679
DiMaggio was...

35
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,722
...my grandfather's favourite.
That's why he's mine too.

36
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:53,524
You know, Leo,
this is just an observation,

37
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,998
but you don't like to talk about
your past too much, do you?

38
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:59,281
It's just not all that interesting, really.

39
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:02,640
Not that interesting? I mean, being
in the Army sounds pretty interesting.

40
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:05,448
I mean, how long you been out?

41
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:07,048
- Piper.
- Hi, guys. Having fun?

42
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,688
Not talking about me
too much, I hope.

43
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,208
No, no, not at all.

44
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:12,521
No?

45
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:15,846
Actually, Leo was about to fill me in
on his Army experience.

46
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:17,727
The Army?

47
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,242
Look at the time. Gotta call it a night.
Party's over.

48
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:26,926
- Goodnight, everybody.
- Finally.

49
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:33,880
- You guys be safe tonight.
- Thank you.

50
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:52,087
Okay, I asked you guys once
to keep it down...

51
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:26,078
Phoebe?

52
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,240
Phoebe?

53
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:34,205
Hey, are you all right?

54
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,799
Yeah. I think so.

55
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,126
- What happened?
- I don't know.

56
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,325
But I'd sure like to find out.

57
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:14,007
Thanks.

58
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:16,444
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm fine, really.

59
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,322
You're lucky. Falling down like that,
you could've hurt yourself.

60
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:22,767
Maybe we should call it a night, huh?
Let her get some rest?

61
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:26,438
- Okay. I'll walk you out.
- Okay.

62
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,808
Hey, Leo. Coming?

63
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:34,802
No, he has to stay here and...

64
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:36,925
Take glasses back to P3.

65
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,006
Now? At this hour?

66
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,761
I'm a tough boss. Ready?

67
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:44,359
- Nice chatting with you.
- Yeah, you too.

68
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:54,888
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

69
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,159
What the hell were you two
chatting about all night?

70
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:58,802
Piper, do you mind?

71
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:01,927
Phoebe, so, what really happened?

72
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:04,523
Okay, I heard what I thought
were party noises,

73
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:09,439
so I came downstairs to check
and to yell at you guys,

74
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:14,046
and I was attacked
by something invisible.

75
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:15,642
So, what, like, a ghost?

76
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,640
I didn't sense another being.

77
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:24,247
It was more, I don't know,
like a daydream, I guess.

78
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:26,843
A daydream? Since when
do daydreams attack people?

79
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:31,441
It wasn't really an attack,
it was more...

80
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:35,638
...of a seduction.

81
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:37,965
- Interesting daydream.
- Yeah.

82
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:40,239
So I guess the question is,
what was it?

83
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:42,959
Have you ever run across
anything like this?

84
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:45,643
- I mean, as a whitelighter?
- Not really.

85
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:49,319
Which means we have no idea
if it's going to strike again or not.

86
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:53,524
This is so embarrassing.

87
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,759
I haven't needed my big sister
to walk me to school

88
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:57,123
since the first grade.

89
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:58,324
Yeah, well, get used to it.

90
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:00,719
Until we figure out what happened,
we're your bodyguards.

91
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:03,278
How do you know
that you don't need the bodyguard?

92
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,360
How do you know
that he won't come after you next?

93
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:09,966
Well, because from your description,
it sounded very intimate.

94
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,599
It makes me think that yours
is the only body it's interested in.

95
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:17,762
Hey, you know, are you sure
that you're up for taking this exam?

96
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:20,443
I can't let stuff like this
keep me from living my life.

97
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:22,520
Otherwise I'd never
leave the house, you know?

98
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,486
True.

99
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:27,963
You're not gonna sit beside me
while I take this test.

100
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:29,926
- I'm not?
- No, you are not.

101
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:33,128
You're gonna wait patiently out here
until I'm done. Please?

102
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,929
All right, but if anything
weird happens, yell.

103
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,448
Okay.

104
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,327
- How's Phoebe?
- Fine, so far.

105
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:57,480
She should be taking her midterm
as we speak.

106
00:07:57,689 --> 00:07:59,088
So no more attacks after I left?

107
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:01,041
Prue and I took turns
watching her all night.

108
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:03,962
- Nothing happened.
- Really?

109
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:06,285
That's good.

110
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,488
Wait a minute. I know that tone.
What's up? What do you know?

111
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,328
- Nothing. Just...
- Just what?

112
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:15,318
Come on, Leo, if this has anything
to do with what happened...

113
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:18,478
It may not, I don't know. It's just...

114
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:22,278
Look, I was up all night
trying to recall a similar situation

115
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:25,606
another whitelighter had
with one of his charges.

116
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:33,437
It had something to do with a past life
coming back to haunt her present one.

117
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:35,565
- What?
- It's obviously very rare.

118
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,481
It doesn't happen to most people.

119
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,607
But if I remember right,
in this particular case,

120
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,159
her past life was trying
to warn her present one.

121
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:46,638
- Warn her. About what?
- I don't know.

122
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,083
And that's what's so frustrating,

123
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:50,968
because I don't have any way
of finding out, either.

124
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:52,847
You miss being a whitelighter,
don't you?

125
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,997
Yeah, at times like this, I do.

126
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,763
When I know I can help.

127
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:03,842
And also when I think
that I'm never gonna be with you.

128
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:08,726
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

129
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:12,164
Dan, hi. No, don't be silly.
We were just...

130
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:13,848
Finished.

131
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:21,438
What are you doing here?
I thought you had a job to bid.

132
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:23,201
Well, I was on my way
back to the office.

133
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,803
You know, crunch some numbers.

134
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:32,845
If I ask you a question,
you promise you won't get mad?

135
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,124
Depends on the question.

136
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:37,366
How well do you really know Leo?
About where he's from, I mean.

137
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:40,682
- Why do you ask?
- Believe me, this isn't a jealousy thing.

138
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:44,848
I just wanna make sure you know
who's working for you, that's all.

139
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:47,159
Just call me overprotective.

140
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:52,082
That's very sweet, Dan, but trust me,

141
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:54,479
you don't have to worry
about Leo at all.

142
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:56,605
He's an angel.

143
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:14,598
Phoebe.

144
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:16,807
Is she all right?

145
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,681
Are you okay?

146
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:31,158
- What am I looking for?
- Anything to do with past lives.

147
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:33,445
Potions, spells, incantations.

148
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:35,839
There should be something
in the Book of Shadows about it.

149
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,119
You think that this has to do
with Phoebe's past life?

150
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:40,126
Well, that's how our souls evolve.

151
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:42,644
How we grow as individuals,
from one lifetime to the next.

152
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:44,965
Okay, then why is my past love
trying to kill me?

153
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:47,399
I don't think it is.
I think it's trying to warn you.

154
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:49,600
To give you a chance
to do something about it.

155
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:51,882
Maybe it's because
you get premonitions.

156
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:53,648
Wait, do something about what?

157
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:57,080
About whatever happened before
that's endangering her now.

158
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,849
Where's Shirley MacLaine
when you need her?

159
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,518
Don't need her. We've got this.

160
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,165
Leo's right. There's a spell
that will take you to that past life.

161
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:09,684
Wait, we're not doing this.

162
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:13,762
Looks like you don't have to.

163
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:16,959
It's written in the first person.
I can do it alone.

164
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:20,480
No, Phoebe, there's absolutely
no spell to bring you back.

165
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,038
Which means she can probably
come back whenever she wants to.

166
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:26,918
Probably? That's not good enough.
What if she can't?

167
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:28,448
She'd be trapped in her past life,

168
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:30,406
where something awful
may have happened to her.

169
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:33,919
But if I don't go back, the same awful
thing could happen to me in this life.

170
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:36,085
Fine, then we're going with you.

171
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:39,047
We can't. Not according
to the way the spell is written.

172
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:41,080
Only Phoebe can.

173
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:44,288
I've just started
to turn my life around.

174
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:47,009
I really don't want my past life
to ruin it for me now.

175
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:55,647
Remove the chains of time and space
And make my spirit soar

176
00:11:55,849 --> 00:12:00,877
Let these mortals arms embrace
The life that haunts before

177
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:21,483
- Did you have fun?
- It was a hoot.

178
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:31,879
Thanks for the love potion.
Worked wonders.

179
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,408
Welcome back.

180
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:04,563
- Do you think she's all right?
- She looks all right so far.

181
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:33,804
Well. I was wondering
where you went off to.

182
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:35,158
I had to get some herbs.

183
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:38,526
I can't very well make my potions
without them.

184
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:41,157
Would you like me
to curse anyone for you?

185
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:42,921
Maybe later.

186
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:49,964
Hurry up with that giggle water, Jake,
we have thirsty people waiting.

187
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:56,638
What's the matter, cousin?
You're not afraid of me, are you?

188
00:13:56,929 --> 00:14:00,717
- Should I be?
- My usual, and bring it to my booth.

189
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:03,528
Could you tell your husband
to play something different?

190
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:06,806
I'm bored with this old song.

191
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,520
Don't worry about her, baby,
just keep playing.

192
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:19,844
Anything for you.

193
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:43,327
- Hello, cousin.
- We have to talk. Soon.

194
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:45,485
We're done talking.

195
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:52,165
Did you find the spell?

196
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:01,998
Say these words:

197
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:04,598
Christina Larson,
what in the devil are you doing?

198
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,999
And you, get out of here.

199
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:10,767
I told you to watch my things,
that's all.

200
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:13,078
My dolly.

201
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:16,878
Spells and charms are not toys,
Christina, do you understand me?

202
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:34,684
I've been looking all over for you.

203
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:01,088
Why must you tease me, Anton?

204
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:02,921
Come with me.

205
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:14,482
- Drink this.
- What is it?

206
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:16,168
A potion to triple your power,

207
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:18,678
in case your cousins
are ready for us.

208
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:22,009
It's the only way for us to succeed.
You do want that, don't you?

209
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:28,325
That's my girl.

210
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,486
Go ahead, test it.

211
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:44,599
- Okay, okay.
- Where am I?

212
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:46,845
You're home, honey, you're home.
You're okay.

213
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:51,085
- What happened?
- I was bad.

214
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:54,361
Very, very bad.

215
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:06,242
Okay, family tree.
I know I saw one someplace.

216
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:08,127
I still don't understand.

217
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,081
We were all related. Cousins.

218
00:17:10,249 --> 00:17:13,286
And we lived here at the manor
back in the '20s.

219
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,407
Together, here?
So much for evolution.

220
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,323
Wait, so you saw us in our past lives?
I mean, did we look the same?

221
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:23,845
Yeah. You did, actually. Kind of.

222
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:26,806
Well, they probably
looked the same to you

223
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:29,728
because your soul
recognized their souls.

224
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:32,648
I mean, we all tend to travel
in the same circle of family, friends,

225
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:35,721
even enemies,
throughout our various lives.

226
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,039
And that's why our souls
kind of recognize each other.

227
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:40,120
So we can keep finding each other.

228
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:42,041
That's what soul mates means.

229
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:44,805
It was really weird
being back like that,

230
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:47,484
because it wasn't like I had
any control over my actions.

231
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,164
It was more like I was a visitor.
Watching, feeling.

232
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:55,408
- Feeling bad?
- Feeling very, very bad.

233
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:59,602
Okay, I admit it. I liked it.

234
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:04,126
It felt good to be respected
and powerful.

235
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:06,001
Hey, speaking of powers,

236
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,206
how come I didn't get to keep
that kick-ass power I had back then?

237
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:11,008
Well, if you screw up, you regress.

238
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:12,682
Your past self
must've abused the power.

239
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:14,328
That's why it was
taken away from you.

240
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:17,248
That's too bad,
because it was hot, literally.

241
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:20,247
Yeah, apparently that isn't
the only thing that was really hot.

242
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,919
Yeah. Anton was hot too.

243
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:28,327
Oh, and he was such a good kisser.
And so good with his hands.

244
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:30,639
Hands that very well
may have killed you.

245
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,482
Maybe. But, you know,
it also could've been past Dan.

246
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,362
Dan? As in my Dan?

247
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:38,721
- You saw him too?
- He was your husband.

248
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:40,522
- Sorry, Leo.
- That's okay.

249
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:42,486
I'm hoping Piper learns
from her past mistakes.

250
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:49,322
Prue, this was the camera
that you used in your past life.

251
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,643
Wait, l...? I was a photographer?

252
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:54,800
Yeah, and apparently
a really good one,

253
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:58,006
because people were lining up
to get their portraits taken.

254
00:18:58,169 --> 00:18:59,397
Really?

255
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:01,799
So any idea what kind of power I had?

256
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:05,120
I don't know, but whatever it was,
it must've been pretty powerful,

257
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:06,802
because Anton had to triple mine.

258
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:08,800
I found it. The family tree.

259
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:16,764
And there we are at the bottom.

260
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:18,800
Right, there's Mom and Grams.

261
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:21,603
Okay, and this must be us again,
three cousins.

262
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:23,441
Yeah, but which one is which?

263
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:26,360
Wait a minute.
What's the date today?

264
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:29,124
February 17th.

265
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:31,678
I think that this one is me.

266
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:35,803
She died February 17th, 1924.

267
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,318
The same age I am, also.

268
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:41,680
Certainly explains why the warnings
are happening today.

269
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:47,605
So that doesn't mean
that I'm gonna die today too, right?

270
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:51,278
We have to figure out
what happened, fast.

271
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:53,998
Wait, what was
that little girl's name?

272
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:56,127
Christina... Christina...

273
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:57,802
Christina Larson.

274
00:19:57,969 --> 00:20:00,085
Christina Larson. Maybe she
can remember what happened.

275
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:04,037
- Can you say "long shot"?
- Well, it's the only shot I got, Prue.

276
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:07,446
I will call Darryl, and maybe
the police can track her down.

277
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:11,039
I just hope she's forgotten
what I did to her doll.

278
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,323
My dolly. You broke my dolly.

279
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:18,642
No, that wasn't me, it was just
someone that looked like me, sort of.

280
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:20,077
It's hard to explain.

281
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:22,405
At least she recognizes your soul.
That's a good sign.

282
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,681
Just let her know that you're
the good Phoebe, not the bad one.

283
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:32,809
You don't have
to be afraid of me anymore.

284
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:35,159
I'm not gonna hurt you, I promise.

285
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:39,001
Ms. Larson, we need your help.

286
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:45,884
Do you remember, when you were
a little girl, back in 1924,

287
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:49,088
you used to go to a speakeasy
that was run by three cousins.

288
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,841
Do you remember that?

289
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:52,567
Daddy was a bartender.

290
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:55,642
He used to pick me up
after school and take me there.

291
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:58,718
I liked the piano.

292
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:10,761
The girl that looked like me,
do you remember her?

293
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,520
She was an evil witch.

294
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:19,520
I used to hide upstairs
by the landing.

295
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:21,042
I saw everything.

296
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:24,283
Did you see anything bad happen
to the evil witch?

297
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:26,844
Oh, it was scary.

298
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:30,567
Fire and screaming.

299
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,078
And then...

300
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:34,643
...you were murdered.

301
00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:37,720
Do you remember
who murdered me?

302
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,203
Was it a man named Anton?

303
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:43,803
It was such a pretty necklace.

304
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,126
Just ripped it off of the bad witch.

305
00:21:47,449 --> 00:21:48,962
And then strangled her.

306
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:50,807
Who strangled the evil witch?

307
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:55,123
That was my favourite dolly.

308
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,406
I'm so sorry.

309
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:08,922
Well, bright side:

310
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:10,721
At least I won't worry
about ending up

311
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:12,402
in a place like this
in my golden years.

312
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:15,438
Hey, at least we still have time
to figure out what happened.

313
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:18,038
Not much time. By midnight,
I'll be dead again.

314
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,364
How do you know that?

315
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:21,321
Midnight, a full moon,
what's the difference?

316
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:23,480
It's always one or the other, right?

317
00:22:23,689 --> 00:22:26,567
I know I won't make it
till February 18th, unless...

318
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:28,760
You go back to the past again
and find some answers.

319
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:36,802
Whatever you do,
make sure you get back

320
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:38,288
before your past life gets killed,

321
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:40,246
otherwise we may not be able
to wake you up.

322
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:43,122
Don't worry, dying is one experience
I don't plan on reliving.

323
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,762
Are you sure you wanna
do this again?

324
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:46,358
No.

325
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:50,162
But here goes.

326
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:53,847
Remove the chains of time and space
And make my spirit soar

327
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:58,522
Let these mortal arms embrace
The life that haunts before

328
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:07,323
Feels good to be bad, doesn't it?

329
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,880
Sometimes.

330
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:13,645
Second thoughts?

331
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,878
They're my cousins, Anton.

332
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:16,522
They're good witches, my love,

333
00:23:16,689 --> 00:23:18,520
which is why I gave you
this amulet to wear.

334
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:21,921
It protects you from their witchcraft
so they can never harm you.

335
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:23,608
Hey.

336
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,329
Killing them is the only way
for me to get their powers.

337
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:31,119
And once I have them,
together, we will be unstoppable.

338
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:41,761
First things first.
Are you ready?

339
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:44,405
Good. Now, remember,

340
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:46,878
wait until after I lure your cousin
away from her piano man

341
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:48,243
before you make your move.

342
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:51,557
- How you gonna do that?
- Easy.

343
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:54,163
By posing as her former lover.

344
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,439
And fighting through her power.

345
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,157
- Shall we?
- Let's.

346
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,569
What are you doing here?

347
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:34,041
Just missing you, baby.

348
00:24:34,209 --> 00:24:36,086
Stop it, we can't do this anymore.

349
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:38,360
What is the matter with you?
This isn't like you.

350
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:41,083
You're right. It's not.

351
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:49,640
Do you wanna talk now?

352
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:51,118
Upstairs?

353
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,402
I'm gonna like having that power.

354
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:28,639
How does it feel
to be powerless against me?

355
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,045
- Hurry!
- Run!

356
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:00,722
- We know Anton's a warlock.
- And that he's fallen in love with you.

357
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:03,084
- And turned you evil.
- We can't have you join forces.

358
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:05,399
- Not in this life, not in any life.
- God, forgive us.

359
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:06,797
Evil witch, in my sight

360
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:09,125
Vanquish thyself
Vanquish thy might

361
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:11,285
In this and every future life

362
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:20,444
- Phoebe, what?
- You.

363
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:25,367
You were the ones
that were trying to kill me.

364
00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:35,447
Phoebe, don't be ridiculous.
You know we'd never hurt you.

365
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:38,203
No? Tell that to past Phoebe.
You cursed her.

366
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:39,358
Phoebe, come on.

367
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:43,363
Hey. They didn't try to kill you, Phoebe.
You know that. It was their past selves.

368
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:44,678
I know.

369
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:47,238
And it was my past self
that tried to kill them first.

370
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:01,522
Phoebe, whatever happened,
you can't blame yourself.

371
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:03,407
It wasn't really you.

372
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:05,639
But that's the thing.

373
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:07,003
It was me.

374
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:09,729
Or at least a part of me
that I can relate to.

375
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:13,321
And I don't mean hurting you guys,
I can't even imagine that,

376
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:15,997
but being in my past life,

377
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:20,805
that powerful evil feeling, it was...

378
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:23,005
It was seductive.
And that's what scares me.

379
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:24,961
I mean, what if
that's who I really am?

380
00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:28,565
But that's not who you are, Phoebe,
not in this life.

381
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:32,768
I mean, you... You've evolved,
you've grown. You're good now.

382
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:36,838
I was good then too, before I...

383
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:40,964
Before she turned.
Before she fell in love with Anton.

384
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:43,165
Who, surprise, was a warlock.

385
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:45,882
Oh, and that's not the only surprise.

386
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:49,405
Anton could glamour into looking like
anyone he wanted to.

387
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:53,642
That's how he lured past Piper.
He glamoured into her former lover.

388
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:55,640
Her former lover? Who was that?

389
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:57,999
It was me.

390
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,961
Or, rather, past me.

391
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:02,766
- Him?
- Yeah.

392
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:05,762
- Hey, how did you know that?
- Yeah, how did you know that?

393
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:07,123
When you become a whitelighter,

394
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:09,723
they let you see your past lives,
for perspective.

395
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:12,284
No wonder he knows so much stuff
about this.

396
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:13,524
Hold it. Wait a minute.

397
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:16,601
You knew that we were lovers before
and you didn't tell me?

398
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,642
What, did it just slip your mind?

399
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:20,441
- No, I just...
- You just what?

400
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,438
I'm getting a migraine.

401
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:25,521
I didn't tell you because I didn't want it
to influence you in the present.

402
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:28,721
I wanted you to decide whether or not
you wanted me in this life.

403
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:29,878
I need an aspirin.

404
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:32,319
Okay, hey, can we get back
to my problem

405
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:34,599
since, at best, I only have
till midnight to live?

406
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,083
Right, sorry.

407
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:38,287
We will talk later.

408
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:40,320
I understand how
past Phoebe was killed,

409
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:42,366
but not why killing her
is going to kill you.

410
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:43,803
Because of the curse.

411
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:47,166
The cousins didn't wanna risk
past Phoebe and Anton

412
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:50,127
getting back together again
in any lifetime.

413
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:54,368
Anton was... Is immortal.

414
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:58,645
And I guess that they thought
that he and Phoebe were soul mates.

415
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:02,319
So he's still alive, running around
out there somewhere?

416
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:03,518
The immediate question is

417
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:05,884
how do we protect Phoebe
from her past life?

418
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,767
The amulet could protect me.

419
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:11,006
- What amulet?
- The one that Anton gave Phoebe.

420
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:13,120
I wonder if Christina
knows where it is.

421
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:15,206
Seventy-six years later?
I don't think so.

422
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:16,728
We probably have a better chance

423
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:18,800
of looking in the Book of Shadows
under "Anton"

424
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:22,359
and seeing where he got
the amulet in the first place.

425
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:24,360
Yeah, good.
You guys go check that out,

426
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,441
and I'm just gonna run downstairs and
grab something to eat. I'm starving.

427
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:29,958
Okay, we'll meet you downstairs.

428
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:34,248
Leo, wait.

429
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:37,522
I want you to come with me
to the retirement home.

430
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:40,767
- What about your sisters?
- I don't want them there.

431
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:45,127
If I don't find the amulet...

432
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:47,803
...l'm gonna die, Leo.

433
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:49,840
And I don't want them to see that.

434
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:55,282
If Anton is still around
and truly in love with Phoebe,

435
00:29:55,449 --> 00:29:56,802
he's going to be looking for her.

436
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:59,483
Yeah, I know. But right now,
that is the least of our problems.

437
00:29:59,649 --> 00:30:03,324
We need to find something, anything,
to save Phoebe.

438
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,760
Where's Leo?

439
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:10,841
Christina?

440
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:13,999
Hi, it's Phoebe.

441
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:16,524
I'm sorry to bother you again,

442
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:20,364
but I need your help with something.
It's really important.

443
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:25,328
I need you to try to remember
back to the day that the bad witch died

444
00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:27,719
and the pretty necklace
was torn off her neck.

445
00:30:27,889 --> 00:30:30,403
Do you remember that day?

446
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:35,160
Christina, I know this is difficult,
but please try.

447
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:37,007
Phoebe's life depends on it.

448
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:40,519
Do you remember what happened
to the necklace, Christina?

449
00:30:42,489 --> 00:30:46,641
I was up on the landing,
watching the whole scary thing.

450
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:49,445
And the necklace?

451
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:52,442
It just slid across the floor
into the foyer.

452
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:58,518
Damn it. We're never
gonna find it this way.

453
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,157
Maybe, maybe not.

454
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:05,042
Leo, do you think
that I could write a spell

455
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:06,961
that could not only send me
back to the past,

456
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:09,404
but give me complete control
over my actions as well?

457
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:10,558
I don't know, why?

458
00:31:10,729 --> 00:31:11,844
Because if I can,

459
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:13,840
I could go back to the past
and find the amulet

460
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:16,921
and hide it someplace safe so I know
where to find it in the present.

461
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:20,326
The only way to do that would be
to switch life forces with past Phoebe.

462
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:22,961
In other words,
you would be in 1924

463
00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:25,438
and evil Phoebe would be right here,
in your body.

464
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:27,958
But long enough for me
to find the amulet and switch back.

465
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:29,522
Yeah, but if something goes wrong,

466
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:32,442
we risk unleashing
a powerful evil witch in the present

467
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:34,008
and losing you in the past.

468
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:37,885
But if we don't do anything, Leo,
we're gonna lose me anyway.

469
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:41,203
I have to find the amulet.
It's my only hope.

470
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:54,167
You do realize you won't look
any different to them.

471
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,604
They'll still think you're evil Phoebe
and try to kill you.

472
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:00,762
Leo, don't worry so much.

473
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:04,478
You're mortal now.
You'll get wrinkles.

474
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:19,444
In this time and in this place
Take the spirit I displace

475
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:25,249
Bring it forth while I go back
To inhabit a soul so black

476
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:35,599
No! Wait!

477
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:46,477
- Where'd she learn that?
- I don't know.

478
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:49,365
Okay. The amulet.

479
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:51,485
Where is the amulet?

480
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:56,809
Why is she running from us?
Why isn't she just using her power?

481
00:32:56,969 --> 00:33:00,518
She's probably trying to lure us
into another trap.

482
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:06,805
Phoebe, are you all right?

483
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:14,724
- Are you there?
- Here, there, everywhere.

484
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:25,884
What?

485
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:46,039
If you were the only
Girl in the world

486
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:51,679
And I were the only boy...

487
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:04,405
Wake up, my sweet.

488
00:34:07,209 --> 00:34:10,679
- Anton, what's going on?
- It's okay.

489
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:13,881
- Where am I?
- You've been reincarnated.

490
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:16,483
Reborn.

491
00:34:16,689 --> 00:34:18,247
To me.

492
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,848
I'm not who you think I am.

493
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:35,364
I'm a different me,
a me from another lifetime

494
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:40,597
where we've evolved into sisters.
Good sisters, happy sisters.

495
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:42,925
Must've cut off too much blood
to her brain.

496
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:45,444
- Must have.
- Screw this.

497
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:48,721
In this time and in this place
Take the spirit I displace

498
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:53,121
Bring me forth while she goes back
To a soul so black

499
00:35:04,129 --> 00:35:05,801
Here you go, Ms. Larson,
try taking a sip.

500
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,083
Thank you, my dear.

501
00:35:10,929 --> 00:35:12,885
The nurse will be right in.
Is she okay?

502
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:15,439
Yeah, I'll be fine, thanks for asking.

503
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:17,241
You're not getting any sympathy
out of me.

504
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:19,923
You should never have let Phoebe
cast that spell.

505
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:23,122
Ms. Larson, can I get you
anything else?

506
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:27,288
- Some Jell-O would be nice.
- Some Jell-O.

507
00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:29,525
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

508
00:35:29,689 --> 00:35:32,328
Will you excuse me for a second?

509
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:36,522
I don't think she has any idea
what happened.

510
00:35:36,729 --> 00:35:39,038
Well, that makes two of us.
Do we really believe that Anton

511
00:35:39,209 --> 00:35:42,121
knew all along that Phoebe was gonna
come here looking for Christina?

512
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:44,564
Well, Christina is the only living link.

513
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:46,442
It was his only hope.

514
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:49,317
Who cares how he knew. We need
to get our Phoebe back, and fast.

515
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:51,923
The problem is she's the only one
who can say the spell.

516
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:56,241
And also, with evil Phoebe wearing
the amulet, she's protected from it.

517
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:58,282
We've gotta get the amulet off of her.

518
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,400
But only long enough
for Phoebe to switch lives.

519
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:02,640
She has to be wearing
the amulet in the present

520
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:05,562
to protect her
from the past-life curse.

521
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:08,766
Okay, so bottom line:
Get evil Phoebe, get the amulet.

522
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:10,442
Any questions?
Okay, good. Let's hurry.

523
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:12,567
- Hurry where?
- Back to the manor.

524
00:36:12,729 --> 00:36:14,720
If Anton and evil Phoebe reunited,

525
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:17,847
then I have a feeling they're gonna
wanna pick up right where they left off:

526
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,647
Trying to kill us.

527
00:36:34,449 --> 00:36:36,565
In this time and in this place

528
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:38,048
There you are.

529
00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:45,607
You are too good to be true.

530
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:47,723
Thanks for reminding me.

531
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:55,328
Got her.

532
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,159
Maybe they're not here.

533
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:00,604
Oh, they're here. Somewhere.

534
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:04,239
Didn't I tell you they'd come?

535
00:37:04,649 --> 00:37:05,877
Hello, cousins.

536
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:09,323
Or is it sisters now?

537
00:37:14,729 --> 00:37:16,162
The amulet's protecting
both of them.

538
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:22,207
It's your turn to die this time.

539
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:29,838
We have to figure out a way
to get that amulet off of her.

540
00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:31,562
Yeah, great. Any idea how?

541
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:38,644
In this time and in this place

542
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:44,765
- Hi. How's it going?
- Behind you.

543
00:38:02,169 --> 00:38:04,729
- Sorry, Pheebs.
- Get the amulet.

544
00:38:09,409 --> 00:38:14,039
She goes back to her soul so black

545
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,607
Piper? Prue?

546
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:25,959
Okay, it's her. Put it back on, fast.

547
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:35,039
- It's okay.
- You're safe.

548
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:41,201
Thank you, guys, for saving my life.

549
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:44,405
All of them.

550
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:52,445
So I hope that you're not
still upset with me,

551
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:56,165
you know, for not telling you
about our past lives together.

552
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:58,684
I'm not letting you
off the hook for that just yet.

553
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:00,840
I'm still not quite sure
what it even means.

554
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:06,406
Well, I like to think it means
we're destined to be together.

555
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:09,924
Saved by the bell.

556
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,037
Or not.

557
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:17,959
- Leo. What are you doing here?
- Leo was just leaving.

558
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:23,598
- Bye.
- Okay, I'll see you at work. Dan.

559
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:31,480
You know, I'm gonna
come right out and say this,

560
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:33,168
even if you get mad at me,

561
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:36,088
but I know in my gut
that something's not right with him.

562
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:39,286
He worries me, I mean, just for you.

563
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:42,919
- Are you talking about Leo?
- If Leo is his real name.

564
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:46,398
I had my brother-in-law who works
for the State Department

565
00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:48,207
check on his Army records,

566
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:50,360
but the only Leo Wyatt
they came up with

567
00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:52,679
died almost 60 years ago
in World War II.

568
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:54,607
Well, there must be
some kind of mistake.

569
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:59,200
Piper, there is no record
of him anywhere, nothing.

570
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:01,564
It's almost as if he didn't have
any past at all.

571
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:05,484
I'm sorry, I just...

572
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:08,607
Just...

573
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:11,561
Just do me a favour

574
00:40:11,729 --> 00:40:13,685
and watch your back
when you're around him, okay?

575
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:17,598
At least until I find out
who he really is.

576
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:22,317
- Okay.
- Well, I gotta go.

577
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:24,962
Goodbye.

578
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:32,245
Hey. You all right?

579
00:40:32,449 --> 00:40:36,158
Yeah, I think so. I'm just writing a little
warning in the Book about Anton.

580
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:38,280
Why, you don't think
we actually vanquished him?

581
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:40,605
I don't wanna take any chances.

582
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:44,404
I just hope my future me is somewhere
near this book if he ever strikes again.

583
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:46,884
Something tells me that we're always
gonna be near it,

584
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:49,722
always have been, always will be.

585
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:52,244
Yeah, you're probably right.

586
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,684
Of course, the warning
won't do much good

587
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:56,282
if the future me turns out to be bad.

588
00:40:57,449 --> 00:41:00,998
It's not just you, you know, I mean...

589
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:02,488
...we all have a little bad in us.

590
00:41:02,689 --> 00:41:06,443
It's just that when you turn bad,
things tend to catch on fire.

591
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,005
And this is supposed to be
making me feel better?

592
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:12,644
What I mean is, is that
it's just as natural to be bad

593
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:13,958
as it is to be good.

594
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:15,803
That's how we know
what good is.

595
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:19,086
That's how we're able
to make the choice to be good.

596
00:41:19,249 --> 00:41:22,764
Remember, Anton wouldn't
have needed evil past Phoebe

597
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:25,204
if you hadn't evolved
into good Phoebe.

598
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:29,969
Still, it's okay to be bad
every once in a while, isn't it?

599
00:41:30,649 --> 00:41:32,048
Oh, yeah.

600
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:34,006
A lot.
