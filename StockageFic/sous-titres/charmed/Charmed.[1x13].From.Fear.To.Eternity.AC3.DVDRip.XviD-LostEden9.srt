1
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,974
Excuse me, but I'm getting ready
to close now.

2
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,727
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
that you were open till 1.

3
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,147
Normally, I am, but not on the
eve of Friday the 13th.

4
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,399
In fact, I kind of wanna
be closed by midnight.

5
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,110
All right, well, we won't be
much longer, will we, Pheebs?

6
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,864
Okay, okay. So input?

7
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,450
- It's nice. Let's go.
- It's nice? That's it?

8
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,995
- Maybe I should look for another one.
- Phoebe, the woman wants to close.

9
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,957
I know, I know, but choosing the right
good-luck charm is a very big decision.

10
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,752
If they all bring good luck,
what's the worst that can happen

11
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,879
if you choose the wrong one?

12
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,215
All right, you know, this is why
I like shopping with Piper.

13
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,927
Do you want me to put this
on Piper's order?

14
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,263
- No, I'll pay separately.
- Cash or charge?

15
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,475
Will you put it on a credit card for me?
I will pay you back.

16
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,435
You know, tomorrow
I have a job interview...

17
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,564
And the good-luck charm
is going to help you get the job.

18
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,233
- How much?
- Twenty-five fifty, plus tax.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,860
Okay.

20
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,654
Oh, but you get 10 percent off
if you sign the mailing list.

21
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,074
See? Good luck already.

22
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,372
If you're interested,
we're having a Wicca gathering

23
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,249
for the Spring Equinox.

24
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,044
What makes you think that
we would be interested?

25
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,379
Most witches are.

26
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,758
We never said
that we were witches.

27
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,097
- You think she knows?
- How could she?

28
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,653
Can you please hurry?

29
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,864
- Is there a problem?
- I told you, I just...

30
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,532
I wanted to be closed
before midnight.

31
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,911
Wow, you really take this
Friday the 13th stuff seriously.

32
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:02,246
Yeah, you should too.
Especially this one.

33
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,874
- And why is that?
- Because once every 1,300 years,

34
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:09,170
there's a universal convergence
of negative energy on Friday the 13th.

35
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,089
- And this is the year.
- Of course it is.

36
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:17,344
Did you hear that?

37
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:22,183
The clock struck 13.
It's starting already.

38
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,567
Goodnight, Tanjella.

39
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:16,570
Sorry, we're closed.

40
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:21,908
I said, we're closed.

41
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:31,668
Not to me, witch.

42
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:33,128
Oh, my God.

43
00:03:37,257 --> 00:03:41,595
Amulets don't work with this demon.

44
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,774
Your greatest fear is being
buried alive in an earthquake.

45
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:08,288
Yes.

46
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:16,254
Oh, you can't run!
You're frozen...

47
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:19,174
...in fear!

48
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:04,170
Think about it.
When has she ever said it to you?

49
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:06,631
I don't remember exactly,
but I'm sure she must have.

50
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:09,968
Yeah, okay. Try to think of a time.
Just one.

51
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:12,345
Whenever I say it to her,
she says something like,

52
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:15,723
- "Oh, me too" or, "Same here."
- You know, you're right.

53
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,727
Yeah, the girl cannot say the words,
"I love you." It's like some weird...

54
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:22,772
- Morning.
- Oh, good morning.

55
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:27,485
- Oh, that outfit looks great on you.
- Thank you for giving it to me.

56
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:29,821
Wait, you gave her that outfit?

57
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:31,531
Yeah, it was an early
birthday present.

58
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:34,784
- For the next three years.
- Are you feeling okay?

59
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:36,911
I am fine.

60
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:39,747
In fact, I had a wonderful dream
about Mom.

61
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:42,625
Oh, how great. What about?

62
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:45,795
Well, I was a little kid,

63
00:07:45,962 --> 00:07:50,299
like 4 or 5, and I was reaching up,
holding her hand.

64
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:52,885
And she was taking me someplace.

65
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:56,597
I don't know where,
but it felt so safe.

66
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:59,100
- I wish I had dreams like that.
- Mom would have to knock

67
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:01,310
before she came into your dreams.

68
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:06,732
What are you doing?

69
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:10,653
You have to cover your mouth when
you yawn, or you might let the devil in.

70
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,740
Especially on Friday the 13th.

71
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:18,077
Is that amulet one of the things
that we picked up for you last night?

72
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:21,789
Yes, and this and these.

73
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:25,418
We're having a superstition-themed
fundraiser at the restaurant today.

74
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:27,294
I'm going to need
all the help I can get.

75
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:30,214
Don't you think that you're
overdoing it just a little bit?

76
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:33,092
With all the warlocks and demons
we've seen, I don't think so.

77
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:35,344
Piper, those things are real.

78
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,847
Okay, superstitions are like

79
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:41,433
old wives' tales invented to explain
somebody's misfortune.

80
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,270
Statistics show more bad things
happen on Friday the 13th

81
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:47,189
than any other day.
I met Jeremy on Friday the 13th.

82
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:49,441
- Really?
- Yes, and he tried to kill me.

83
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:53,362
Afterwards, I found out there's
a superstition that any relationship

84
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,698
started on Friday the 13th
is doomed.

85
00:08:55,864 --> 00:08:57,991
More bad things happen
on Friday the 13th

86
00:08:58,158 --> 00:09:00,994
because people put energy into
believing bad things will happen.

87
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:03,080
Pheebs?

88
00:09:03,247 --> 00:09:06,792
Actually, I prefer the upside
of superstition: Good fortune.

89
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,920
Which is what I hope this little honey
brings me at my job interview

90
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:12,422
with the real estate agency.
Will you give me a lift?

91
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:14,800
- I'm running late.
- Sure.

92
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:18,178
Okay, well, have a great day, Prue.

93
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:20,264
- I love you.
- Yeah, me too.

94
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:30,023
I wonder if she knows
she does that.

95
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,655
- Oh, hey, Andy.
- Hey. Prue in?

96
00:09:36,822 --> 00:09:39,074
Prue, there's a policeman
here to see you.

97
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:42,452
See you later, Andy.
We're running late.

98
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,085
- So this must be bad news.
- Why would you say that?

99
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:54,089
- It's a little early for a social call.
- You're right.

100
00:09:54,256 --> 00:09:56,299
We've had three suspicious deaths
since midnight.

101
00:09:56,466 --> 00:10:01,263
All single females, all under 30.
One was a bookstore owner.

102
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:04,266
Credit card company's records
show you were her last customer.

103
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:06,101
Oh, my God.

104
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,478
You remember anything
out of the ordinary?

105
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:10,689
Suspicious characters
hanging around?

106
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:12,816
No, Phoebe and I were
the only ones in there.

107
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:15,318
In fact, she was locking up
when we left.

108
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:18,071
- Was the place in order?
- Yeah. Why?

109
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:21,157
Well, when we found her,
her body was half buried in debris.

110
00:10:21,324 --> 00:10:23,576
The coroner said it wasn't
her injuries that killed her.

111
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:26,621
- It was a heart attack.
- A heart attack?

112
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:30,333
Yeah, her hair had turned shock white.
Her face was contorted in terror,

113
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,544
just like all the others.

114
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,295
If I didn't know any better,

115
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:37,090
I'd say they were
literally scared to death.

116
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:41,552
You visit occult bookstores
at midnight often?

117
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:44,263
No, of course not.

118
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,475
Phoebe needed a good-luck charm
for her job interview today.

119
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:49,435
It was... It was very last-minute.

120
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:52,313
These killings look like some
weird, ritualistic thing.

121
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,274
The victims all had ties to the occult.

122
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:59,320
You might consider shopping
somewhere else.

123
00:11:00,905 --> 00:11:02,698
Meaning?

124
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:04,450
Just be careful.

125
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:13,918
Friday the 13th.

126
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:16,545
Friday the 13th.

127
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:22,093
"The Demon of Fear appears
once every 1,300 years

128
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:24,512
on Friday the 13th.

129
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:28,391
He feeds on the fears
of witches for his survival."

130
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:32,561
Mom's handwriting.

131
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:41,529
Okay, we need a table
for taking the tickets.

132
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,738
Okay.

133
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:49,745
Who's the guy?

134
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:54,083
Lucas Devane. He's chairing the
fundraiser for the children's hospital.

135
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,710
Oh, right. I saw his picture
in a magazine.

136
00:11:56,877 --> 00:12:00,089
Wasn't he named one of the
Bay Area's most eligible bachelors?

137
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:02,549
- Don't rub it in.
- Hey, you're the one who's letting

138
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:05,719
a silly superstition run your life.

139
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:07,805
Is he still looking over here?

140
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:10,474
Yeah.

141
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:12,851
He's undressing you with his mind,

142
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:15,729
and he's down to white cotton.

143
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:19,525
I haven't worn white cotton
since high school.

144
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:23,445
Humour me.

145
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:25,614
So sorry I had to rush you
off the phone.

146
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:28,116
What's with the Demon of Fear?

147
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:30,744
<i>Well, I found a page about him
in the Book of Shadows</i>

148
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:32,204
in Mom's handwriting.

149
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:35,040
- Mom? Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

150
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:38,502
I checked it against the handwriting
on the back of the spirit board.

151
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:42,506
<i>Wow, this is the first time we've found
anything Mom's written in the Book.</i>

152
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:45,842
Well, she must've known that this
demon would appear in our lifetime,

153
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:48,053
and she wanted to warn us
against him.

154
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,888
I don't like the sound of that.

155
00:12:50,055 --> 00:12:53,975
Well, if he can kill
13 unmarried witches before midnight,

156
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:57,604
he'll be freed from the underworld
to wreak his terror every single day.

157
00:12:57,771 --> 00:13:01,441
Unmarried. Like being single
doesn't have enough problems.

158
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:03,777
- So how can we stop him?
- I don't know.

159
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:08,239
But he does kill by turning
a witch's greatest fear against her.

160
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:10,575
<i>- Meaning?
- The Book doesn't say.</i>

161
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:16,247
But Mom wrote that in the face of our
greatest fear our powers are paralyzed.

162
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:18,666
Wait a minute.
We're on the most-wanted list,

163
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,877
and we're defenceless?

164
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:23,421
Didn't Mom say anything
about how to get rid of him?

165
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:26,341
- Just to release our fear.
- How do we do that?

166
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:28,968
Don't know. That's all she wrote.

167
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:33,348
Look, I know that
you're afraid of flying.

168
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:36,434
It's not really a fear.
I just prefer buses.

169
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:40,396
Well, as long as you stay in
a crowded restaurant, you'll be fine.

170
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:43,691
And since Phoebe's afraid of being
trapped in an elevator,

171
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:46,069
I'll tell her to take the stairs.

172
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:47,987
And you'll stay away from pools.

173
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,493
Ever since Mom drowned,
you've been terrified of the water.

174
00:13:53,993 --> 00:13:56,537
That's why you never took
swimming lessons with us.

175
00:13:56,704 --> 00:14:00,291
We've always known
that was the reason. It's okay.

176
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,795
Yeah, well, don't worry about me.
I'll be fine. I gotta go.

177
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:06,756
Call me when you get to Buckland's.

178
00:14:06,923 --> 00:14:11,761
I'm not going to Buckland's.
Mom warned us, but there are others.

179
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,388
We don't know any other witches.

180
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:17,850
No, see, Tanjella gave me
this flyer for a Wicca gathering.

181
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:20,811
And there's a woman named
Zoe listed as a contact.

182
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:22,939
I'm hoping that she can help.
So call Pheebs

183
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:24,815
- and let her know what's up, okay?
- Okay.

184
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,692
Okay.

185
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:29,362
- I love you.
- Yep.

186
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:36,452
We're a small firm, but we've
built a very successful business.

187
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:39,789
Oh, well, size doesn't matter to me.

188
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:41,874
What does excite me though
is the chance

189
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,667
to work with a successful woman.

190
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:46,545
I mean, if I wanna be a success,
who better to learn from, right?

191
00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:48,422
Well, I like that.

192
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,218
I've heard all I need to hear.
When can you start?

193
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:55,471
Are you serious? I got the job?

194
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:59,558
I can spot talent when I see it.
Can you start today?

195
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:03,145
Yeah. Yes, of course.

196
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:07,191
Hi, honey. Give me a second.

197
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:14,323
Here are the keys.
Louise is out of town. I've got...

198
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:19,703
I'll be in Calistoga for the day, so all
you have to do is answer the phones.

199
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,831
Taking a romantic midweek break?

200
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:26,126
Well, yeah, which reminds me...

201
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,380
...there is one special task I'll need
you to handle from time to time.

202
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:34,218
If my husband calls,
I'll need you to cover for me.

203
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:40,766
Oh, right.

204
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,977
- Sure.
- Our little secret?

205
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,146
Oh, of course.

206
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:50,984
Well, you have my pager number,
so have fun.

207
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,195
Okay.

208
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:58,408
You too.

209
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:25,352
I thought you might come.

210
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,898
There's nothing for you here.

211
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:33,818
Oh, you couldn't be
more wrong, witch.

212
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:37,906
You're all alone. That's all I need.

213
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,992
You have no power over me.

214
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:47,123
I have evolved to a place where
I have released all mortal fears.

215
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:52,128
My inner strength will destroy you.

216
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:07,268
You didn't release your fear of fire.

217
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:09,228
You only repressed it.

218
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,275
No. Please.

219
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:18,279
Save it for another lifetime.

220
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:23,034
You're frozen in fear!

221
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:29,540
Hello.

222
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,780
Sorry I'm late. So, what do we have?

223
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,116
The coroner says there are
no burn marks on the body.

224
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:08,621
She didn't die of smoke inhalation.
Her heart gave out, just like the others.

225
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,540
And I can't believe you're wearing
the serial shoes again.

226
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:15,544
- They're my good-luck charms.
- They're embarrassing.

227
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:18,547
This is the fifth woman with ties to
the occult that's been found dead

228
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:22,384
since midnight. Now, tell me it's not
the work of some serial nutcase.

229
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:26,680
I can't, but it still doesn't mean
those shoes aren't embarrassing.

230
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:30,267
Inspector, will you look at this?

231
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:44,656
The doorman keeps
a visitor sign-in log.

232
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,200
Wanna guess who the last person
was to see the victim?

233
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,369
I'm gonna guess the killer.

234
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,496
Prue.

235
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,585
- What did you tell Andy?
- I didn't talk to Andy.

236
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:59,421
I didn't want him to know that
I was anywhere near there,

237
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:03,049
- so I called 911, and I left.
- Are you sure you're okay?

238
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:06,344
Yeah, it's just that I can't get her face
out of my mind, you know.

239
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:10,015
There was so much fear,
and her hair was pure white.

240
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,142
The terror that she must've felt,
it's just...

241
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:16,313
Okay, I'm scared enough,
thank you. So now what?

242
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:19,316
We avoid any place
he could use to terrorize us.

243
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:22,360
- And what about all the other witches?
- I took Zoe's Day Runner.

244
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:25,989
Some of the names in it have got to be
witches. I'll start making phone calls.

245
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,868
Quick, throw some
over your shoulder.

246
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,953
- Don't be ridiculous.
- It's bad luck.

247
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,748
You could be attacked by evil spirits.

248
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:38,543
Piper, we have been attacked
by plenty of evil spirits,

249
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,130
and they had nothing to do with salt.
And considering our powers,

250
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:45,341
I can't believe that you wanna rely
on this for our protection.

251
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:48,052
My feeling is you can never
be too rich or too safe.

252
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:50,221
Oh, look, a ladybug.

253
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:54,225
- Is that bad luck?
- No, actually, Grams once told me

254
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:58,229
that whatever direction it flies in
you can find your ideal mate.

255
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:00,732
We gotta try it. Ready?

256
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:13,369
So does a positive superstition
cancel out a negative one?

257
00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:15,747
- I don't know.
- Wait, what's going on?

258
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:18,291
That guy has been trying
to talk to Piper all day,

259
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,585
and she has been avoiding him
because she...

260
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:25,089
Oh, no.

261
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:27,800
- You should've thrown the sa...
- Piper, don't even say it.

262
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,928
- The salt. Okay.
- I'm going home to change.

263
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:33,556
- Be careful. I love you.
- Yeah.

264
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:39,103
All right, so she can't say it.

265
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,523
Maybe she's afraid it'll make her
look too vulnerable.

266
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,735
Ever since Mom died, you know,
she has to be the strong one

267
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:49,155
to take care of us and everything.
It's probably just all part of that.

268
00:20:49,321 --> 00:20:52,783
- Maybe. Hey, I gotta get back to work.
- How's the new job?

269
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,829
Great, except my new boss wants me
to lie to her husband about an affair

270
00:20:56,996 --> 00:21:00,457
- that she's been having.
- How nice. What are you gonna do?

271
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:03,335
I don't know. I'm just hoping
it never comes up.

272
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:06,005
Hey, good luck.

273
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:13,721
- How's it going?
- Oh, good.

274
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:17,808
Listen, we've been working so well
together on this fundraiser,

275
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:21,311
I was wondering if you'd want
to get dinner after it's over.

276
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:27,151
I should probably... I should
probably check my schedule.

277
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,114
- You don't know if you're free tonight?
- Well...

278
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,703
Dinner would be great.

279
00:21:38,704 --> 00:21:40,247
Great.

280
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:52,301
Okay, heads, I tell him the truth.
Tails, I lie.

281
00:22:00,517 --> 00:22:02,769
Oh, that helped a lot.

282
00:22:07,774 --> 00:22:10,610
Oh, hold on, please.

283
00:22:14,614 --> 00:22:15,949
Prue.

284
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:22,205
No one's in. Call back later.

285
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,094
<i>We're not in. You know what to do.</i>

286
00:22:36,261 --> 00:22:38,638
<i>Prue, it's Phoebe. Pick up.</i>

287
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:41,599
<i>Prue, are you there?
Pick up. Hello?</i>

288
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:45,353
Prue, I just had a premonition.
You could be in trouble. Are you there?

289
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:49,065
<i>Prue, are you there? Hello?</i>

290
00:22:49,274 --> 00:22:51,359
<i>Prue, pick up.</i>

291
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:28,563
Your greatest fear is drowning.

292
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:32,066
Thank you for making it so easy.

293
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:40,032
That's right.

294
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:43,744
Feed me your fear.

295
00:23:43,911 --> 00:23:45,663
No!

296
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:49,917
Help!

297
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:04,765
Your powers are frozen by your fear.

298
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:20,864
I wish I could think of a logical reason
to explain why Prue's involved in this.

299
00:24:21,031 --> 00:24:24,702
You mean, this time
or every other time?

300
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:31,917
Look out.

301
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:35,504
Prue?

302
00:24:40,384 --> 00:24:42,177
Prue?

303
00:24:44,638 --> 00:24:46,682
Prue?

304
00:24:52,187 --> 00:24:53,855
You okay?

305
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:55,357
I don't know.

306
00:25:02,072 --> 00:25:04,366
I'll wait for you downstairs.

307
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:41,027
So, what were you screaming about?

308
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:44,239
- I told you, I had soap in my eyes.
- You had soap in your eyes?

309
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:46,908
- That's why you were screaming?
- Yes.

310
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:49,077
What were you doing
at that woman's apartment?

311
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:51,496
Well, I was...

312
00:25:52,413 --> 00:25:57,043
Zoe was a collector of occult items,
and she wanted to know

313
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,171
if the auction house was interested
in selling them for her.

314
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:03,883
When you got there,
was she alive or already dead?

315
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,802
Dead.

316
00:26:06,594 --> 00:26:09,097
So you called 911?
Why didn't you leave your name?

317
00:26:09,264 --> 00:26:12,350
- Why'd you just duck out?
- Because I wanted to avoid this.

318
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,104
I knew that you would suspect me
of being involved, and I'm not.

319
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,023
Don't you think it's a little coincidental,
you being one step ahead

320
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,318
- of death twice in one day.
- What exactly are you implying?

321
00:26:22,485 --> 00:26:25,279
- In my shoes, what would you think?
- First of all,

322
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:27,573
- nobody should be in those shoes.
- Told you.

323
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,908
But if I were,

324
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:31,953
I would never think that you had
anything to do with these deaths.

325
00:26:32,411 --> 00:26:36,916
Prue, five women your age have been
scared to death since midnight.

326
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:39,293
Now, we show up,
we hear you screaming, break in,

327
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,087
find you terrified in the shower...

328
00:26:41,254 --> 00:26:42,964
I told you, I had soap in my eyes.

329
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,299
That wasn't pain on your face,
that was fear.

330
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:49,971
Prue!

331
00:26:50,262 --> 00:26:52,181
- Hi.
- Hi.

332
00:26:52,348 --> 00:26:56,018
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

333
00:26:56,185 --> 00:27:00,481
- So are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

334
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:13,869
You would not believe
what happened to me.

335
00:27:14,036 --> 00:27:18,040
Yes, I would. I saw it. Prue...

336
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:20,292
...he came really close, didn't he?

337
00:27:20,793 --> 00:27:23,671
You've got some white in your hair.

338
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:44,817
<i>There's gotta be something
in the Book about releasing fears.</i>

339
00:27:44,983 --> 00:27:47,277
Maybe it's just not obvious.

340
00:27:48,237 --> 00:27:50,697
Phoebe, do you smell that?

341
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:54,493
- What?
- It's like sandalwood.

342
00:27:54,826 --> 00:27:56,161
No, I don't smell anything.

343
00:27:56,536 --> 00:27:59,456
Mom used to wear
a fragrance like that.

344
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:02,876
I was too young to remember.

345
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:07,172
Wait, I thought you said
there was nothing in here

346
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:09,591
about releasing your fear.

347
00:28:11,301 --> 00:28:14,846
"To let go of your fear,
trust in the greatest of all powers."

348
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:17,140
That wasn't there this morning.

349
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:20,102
Well, you know, maybe because
of all the stress you've been under...

350
00:28:20,268 --> 00:28:23,271
No, it wasn't there. It's in Mom's
handwriting. I would've remembered.

351
00:28:23,438 --> 00:28:25,232
Okay.

352
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:27,317
What do you think the
greatest of all powers is?

353
00:28:27,484 --> 00:28:30,278
- Do you think it's the power of three?
- I don't know.

354
00:28:30,445 --> 00:28:33,907
- What is it?
- It's like I can feel her presence.

355
00:28:35,784 --> 00:28:38,703
Okay, maybe you should
get dressed and go to Buckland's.

356
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,957
No, I don't really think
that I'm up for that.

357
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:44,709
Look, Prue, you said he disappeared
once Andy got there.

358
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:47,170
So maybe he only attacks
when you're alone,

359
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:50,215
- when your fear is greatest.
- Yeah, you're right.

360
00:28:50,382 --> 00:28:53,843
Of course I am. And whatever you do,
stay away from water. Any water.

361
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,054
- Don't even drink it.
- Don't worry.

362
00:28:57,597 --> 00:28:59,724
- I love you.
- Me too.

363
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:03,061
Hey, why do you do that?

364
00:29:03,228 --> 00:29:06,648
- What?
- You never say, "I love you" to me.

365
00:29:06,814 --> 00:29:09,901
- I just did.
- No, you just said, "Me too."

366
00:29:10,068 --> 00:29:13,905
You never say it to Piper either. Have
you ever said, "I love you" to anybody?

367
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:20,870
Yeah, I said it to Mom.

368
00:29:21,037 --> 00:29:23,247
It was the last thing I said to her
before she died.

369
00:29:46,562 --> 00:29:49,982
Do me a favour? Walk behind me
so you don't cross my path.

370
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:52,360
- Okay.
- Oh, wait.

371
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,946
You dropped your tail.

372
00:30:09,585 --> 00:30:11,545
- Are you okay?
- Me?

373
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:15,216
Yeah, you seem kind of,
I don't know, tense.

374
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:18,344
Well, it just seems ever since
I agreed to have dinner with Lucas

375
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:20,971
I've had a run of bad luck.

376
00:30:21,138 --> 00:30:23,515
I broke a nail,
the shipment of clams is late,

377
00:30:23,682 --> 00:30:25,851
I had to fire a hostess,
and I just ripped my skirt.

378
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:28,687
Well, it is Friday the 13th.

379
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:30,189
Doug, order up.

380
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:37,946
Here you go.

381
00:30:39,365 --> 00:30:41,533
- Yeah, just hand it here.
- Here you go. It's ready.

382
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,750
<i>Sage so fair, from far and wide</i>

383
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:53,670
<i>Take my troubles
And brush them aside</i>

384
00:30:56,006 --> 00:30:57,049
Hey!

385
00:30:57,341 --> 00:30:59,760
Is there a fire?
Where's the smoke coming from?

386
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:03,013
- Is there a fire?
- I don't know.

387
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:06,266
- Is it malfunctioning?
- Just not my day.

388
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,733
Hi. May I help you?

389
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,777
Hi, I was looking for Susan.

390
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:20,447
Oh, she's not here, but I can tell her
you came by. What's your name?

391
00:31:20,614 --> 00:31:22,657
Richard Warner.

392
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:26,369
You're Susan's husband.

393
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:28,705
Unless she's got one
that I don't know about.

394
00:31:30,707 --> 00:31:33,043
No. No.

395
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,086
She doesn't have another husband.

396
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:38,924
I thought I'd surprise her and take her
to dinner. You know where she is?

397
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:41,301
Yes.

398
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:43,595
She went out.

399
00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:48,058
Okay, well, I think we established that.
Do you know where?

400
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:50,810
Well, she...

401
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:54,064
It's actually interesting. She just...

402
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,399
I can't do this.

403
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:58,234
I don't understand.

404
00:31:58,401 --> 00:32:01,404
I'm sorry, Mr Warner, but I can't be
the assistant your wife wants

405
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:04,073
without compromising my beliefs,
and I just won't do that.

406
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,659
- Wait a minute. Slow down.
- Don't worry about the office.

407
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:08,953
I will lock up.
Susan...

408
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,624
Thank you.

409
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:15,501
For what?

410
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:18,046
For not lying to me
about Susan's affair.

411
00:32:18,922 --> 00:32:20,882
- You knew?
- I've tried to deny it

412
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:24,052
for some time now, but I guess...

413
00:32:24,886 --> 00:32:28,222
...there comes a time when
you have to face the truth.

414
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:29,974
I'm so sorry.

415
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:31,934
Don't be.

416
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:34,812
And listen, don't quit on my behalf.

417
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:37,940
I'm not.

418
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,333
<i>- SWA Property.
- Hello, may I speak to Susan?</i>

419
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:57,752
No, she's not in right now.
Can I take a message?

420
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,172
<i>This is Mrs Joffee. I'm outside a house
Susan's supposed to show me,</i>

421
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:03,507
<i>and she's not here.</i>

422
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:06,844
Well, I'm sorry,
but she must've forgotten.

423
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:08,596
She's out for the rest of the day.

424
00:33:08,763 --> 00:33:11,932
<i>Can anybody help me? I flew in
from L.A. just to see this house.</i>

425
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:15,102
<i>I'm under a terrible deadline
to move from my other house.</i>

426
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:17,229
No one's here.

427
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,648
But, you know,
since you flew in and all,

428
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:23,611
I guess I can show you the property.
What's the address?

429
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:41,378
Mrs Joffee?

430
00:33:41,962 --> 00:33:44,214
Hello.

431
00:33:52,347 --> 00:33:54,641
Mrs Joffee?

432
00:33:54,808 --> 00:33:57,728
It's SWA Properties.

433
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,857
Hello, dear.

434
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:04,526
Thanks so much for coming out.

435
00:34:07,404 --> 00:34:10,866
- Let go, or I'll scream.
- Go ahead, I could use the fix.

436
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:19,624
I know how you kill, but there
are no elevators around here.

437
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,669
Elevators? That's what you think
your greatest fear is?

438
00:34:22,836 --> 00:34:27,799
You mortals need to look deeper.
Down where the real truth lies.

439
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:32,846
Your greatest fear is losing a sister,
and I get two for one.

440
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,565
He's only a threat
till midnight, okay?

441
00:34:44,107 --> 00:34:48,153
All right, well, take care
and don't look in any closets till then.

442
00:34:48,612 --> 00:34:52,240
All right, look, I gotta go.
Somebody's calling me. Bye.

443
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:53,908
- Hello?
- Prue, it's Phoebe.

444
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:56,661
I got stuck at a house I was showing.
Can you come get me?

445
00:34:56,828 --> 00:35:01,624
- Yeah, sure. Where are you?
- I'm at 3112 Napa Street.

446
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:05,003
All right. I'm on my way.

447
00:35:22,812 --> 00:35:26,024
I can't remember when
I've enjoyed a dinner more.

448
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,610
I'm so glad you suggested this.

449
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:30,820
You know, I almost didn't.

450
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:32,655
- Really?
- Well, I'm pretty sensitive

451
00:35:32,822 --> 00:35:35,867
to people's feelings,
and I got the sense this morning

452
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,745
that you were
totally turned off to me.

453
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:40,913
How odd.

454
00:35:41,664 --> 00:35:47,086
So, what's it like being one of the city's
most eligible bachelors?

455
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:51,883
Oh, that magazine article was so lame.
I'm really a very simple guy.

456
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:56,804
I value home and hearth.
I'd like to settle down, have kids.

457
00:35:56,971 --> 00:36:01,475
I've got two nieces I'm crazy about.
I even carry pictures of them.

458
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:09,358
You sound too good to be true.

459
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,329
You are too good to be true.

460
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,586
Lint. You had a little lint.

461
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:30,671
Oh, thanks.

462
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:34,550
So your instinct about me
this morning was right.

463
00:36:34,717 --> 00:36:37,803
I was sort of sending out
negative vibes.

464
00:36:38,387 --> 00:36:39,597
Why?

465
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:41,348
Well, there's this superstition

466
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:44,727
that any relationship
started on Friday the 13th is doomed.

467
00:36:44,893 --> 00:36:46,770
So I was determined to avoid you.

468
00:36:46,937 --> 00:36:50,566
But then there's another superstition
about finding your ideal mate...

469
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:52,317
Wait a minute.

470
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:57,489
You were gonna reject me
because of a superstition,

471
00:36:57,656 --> 00:37:00,075
but then decided
I was worth going out with

472
00:37:00,242 --> 00:37:02,578
only because
of another superstition?

473
00:37:04,163 --> 00:37:05,289
Yeah.

474
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:08,250
Well, doesn't say much for me then,
does it?

475
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:09,793
Oh, no, it's not...

476
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,255
Piper, I'm sure you're very nice,

477
00:37:13,422 --> 00:37:16,842
but someone who lets things
like superstitions or omens

478
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:19,511
determine their lives...

479
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:24,182
Well, I just had an experience
like that

480
00:37:24,349 --> 00:37:28,186
with my last girlfriend,
and it was a disaster.

481
00:37:28,353 --> 00:37:33,692
I'm looking for someone
who's just not into that stuff.

482
00:37:34,317 --> 00:37:35,735
I'm sorry.

483
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:50,625
- Phoebe?
- I'm in the backyard.

484
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:53,128
You won't believe
the view from here.

485
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,674
Pheebs, where are you?

486
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:03,638
Phoebe?

487
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:10,311
Isn't that a great view?

488
00:38:10,478 --> 00:38:12,480
Bring your suit?

489
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:24,284
That's right.

490
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:28,454
Feed me your fear.

491
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:47,849
<i>Prue.</i>

492
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:49,183
<i>Prue.</i>

493
00:38:51,144 --> 00:38:53,938
<i>You must face your fears, Prue.</i>

494
00:38:54,856 --> 00:38:59,151
<i>You must trust in the greatest
of all powers: Love.</i>

495
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:00,486
<i>Mom?</i>

496
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:03,364
<i>Save yourself.</i>

497
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:06,367
<i>Save your sister.</i>

498
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,371
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

499
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:32,059
It's over.

500
00:39:42,403 --> 00:39:45,739
- Your fear.
- I'm not afraid anymore.

501
00:39:47,116 --> 00:39:49,201
No!

502
00:40:08,846 --> 00:40:11,390
Oh, my God. I was so scared.

503
00:40:11,557 --> 00:40:13,642
I know. I'm just glad you're safe.

504
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:16,603
I don't know what would happen
if I ever lost you.

505
00:40:17,646 --> 00:40:19,481
I love you.

506
00:40:19,648 --> 00:40:22,276
I love you.

507
00:40:43,171 --> 00:40:45,799
Hey, what are you doing?

508
00:40:45,966 --> 00:40:51,763
Kicking myself. I just lost probably
the greatest catch in San Francisco.

509
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,348
What happened?

510
00:40:53,515 --> 00:40:57,602
He doesn't like women who rely on
superstitions to make decisions.

511
00:40:57,769 --> 00:40:59,604
And I'm not so sure he's wrong.

512
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:04,693
So Prue vanquished
the Demon of Fear.

513
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:09,155
Well, at least put him back in the bottle
for another 1,300 years.

514
00:41:09,322 --> 00:41:11,783
Wait, whoa, what? What happened?

515
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:15,453
Well, he pushed her into a pool,
and then...

516
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:17,664
And Mom helped me out.

517
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:19,541
Mom?

518
00:41:19,707 --> 00:41:22,836
Okay, I know it sounds crazy,
but I saw her.

519
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:26,381
It was just like my dream.
She was this incredible vision,

520
00:41:26,548 --> 00:41:29,592
so peaceful, and she took my hand
and brought me to the surface.

521
00:41:31,886 --> 00:41:34,097
It doesn't sound crazy.

522
00:41:34,264 --> 00:41:36,432
- I wish I could've seen her.
- Me too.

523
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:41,312
I'm just glad you're all right.

524
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:45,441
I love you.

525
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:50,321
- What did you just say?
- I love you.

526
00:41:54,492 --> 00:41:56,536
That's the first time
you've ever said that to me.

527
00:41:56,702 --> 00:41:58,037
Yeah, I know.

528
00:41:58,204 --> 00:42:01,040
I wish I would've said it
a long time ago.

529
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,794
Ever since Mom died,
I've been afraid to say it.

530
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:06,671
I didn't wanna lose anybody else.

531
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:10,049
Well, we're not going anywhere.

532
00:42:13,886 --> 00:42:17,682
Okay. I'm exhausted.
I'll see you two in the morning.

533
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,860
What happened to her in that pool?

534
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:33,864
I don't know, but whatever it was,
it must've been incredible.

535
00:42:49,713 --> 00:42:53,092
<i>Thanks for letting them
into your heart.</i>

536
00:42:55,928 --> 00:42:57,930
I miss you, Mom.
