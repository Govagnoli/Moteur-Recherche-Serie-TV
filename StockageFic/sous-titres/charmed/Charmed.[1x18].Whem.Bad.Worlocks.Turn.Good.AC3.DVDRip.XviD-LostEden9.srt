1
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:05,589
<i>I wake up at night.</i>

2
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:07,549
<i>My heart pounding,</i>

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,552
a voice whispering in my head:
"You're a fraud.

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,888
You can't fool God."

5
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,725
These are not new fears, Brendan.

6
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,935
I've watched you grow, wept for you,

7
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,395
rejoiced in you.

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,564
You are not a fraud.

9
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,316
I know your heart.

10
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,235
You don't know my family, Father.

11
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,654
Generations of evil.

12
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,448
Evil that's in my blood.

13
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,617
The blood of the sacrament
washes it clean.

14
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,410
Hello, Brendan.

15
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,788
Long time, no see.

16
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,958
- How'd you find me?
- Yeah, good to see you too.

17
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,711
Didn't mean to interrupt
your conversation.

18
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,838
We'll wait outside for you

19
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,757
so we can have a family reunion.

20
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,146
Hey, you know what, the next time
Quake does a food pantry,

21
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,481
why don't you call some guys.

22
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,233
Yeah, I'll just go through
my handy guy Rolodex.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,278
Which I believe now stops
at J for Josh.

24
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,238
Or is it B for boyfriend?

25
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,073
I don't wanna talk about it.

26
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,117
Why not, Piper?
You know you like him,

27
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,994
and he calls you all the time.

28
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,662
Why don't you just go out with him.

29
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,581
I told you. Because I'm too busy
with work,

30
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,875
and my instincts are telling me
to lay low.

31
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,960
Always trust your instincts.

32
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,755
Whose side are you on?

33
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:34,010
- Now, they have got the right idea.
- Who, the nuns?

34
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:36,512
Yep. Nice, safe environment.

35
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,181
Yeah, if you like monks.

36
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,934
Stress-free, no need to worry
about guys, no wardrobe.

37
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,312
No wardrobe? Okay,

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,980
now you're scaring me.

39
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,860
Whose pen is this?

40
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:52,904
Oh, it's Brendan's, I think.

41
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,615
You know, the cute guy who signed
for the food. Remember?

42
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:58,284
- I remember him, yes.
- Good, then you can take it to him.

43
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,161
I think he's in the church office.

44
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:03,289
Okay, just don't go taking any vows
while I'm gone, all right?

45
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,009
Cute guy. I just saw him
being attacked by a warlock.

46
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:17,261
- Where?
- I think it was here, somewhere.

47
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,555
All right, let's split up.

48
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,308
Give it up, little brother.

49
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:24,602
You're praying to the wrong deity.

50
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:27,479
Aren't you, Brendan?

51
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:29,940
I mean, after all,

52
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:31,901
you can't deny who you are.

53
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,569
You don't scare me, Greg.

54
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:36,071
Sure, I do.

55
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:48,500
We've come a long way to find you.

56
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:52,629
We're not leaving until you join us.

57
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:55,883
Please, Brendan.
We don't wanna hurt you.

58
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:06,268
Did you really think that the Church
could save you?

59
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:13,442
Hey.

60
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:19,448
- Piper, Phoebe!
- We'll come back for you.

61
00:03:19,656 --> 00:03:21,074
- Prue?
- You guys, over here.

62
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:25,412
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

63
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:29,207
- Thanks.
- Wait, where...?

64
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:31,042
Hey.

65
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:32,627
What happened?

66
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:36,006
I don't know,
but I'm gonna go find out.

67
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:30,661
Amazing reflexes. Check it out.

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,455
Should've kept a closer watch
over Brendan over the years.

69
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:35,666
We shouldn't have left him alone.

70
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,751
Seriously, you gotta see this. Watch.

71
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:40,921
I am sick and tired of you
and this freaking lizard.

72
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:43,424
Yeah? Too bad.

73
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:49,930
I'm sorry. Okay?

74
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:53,142
Just stay away from my pet.
That's all I ask.

75
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:58,397
Maybe we should let Brendan go.

76
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:00,566
I mean, we don't really need him.

77
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:02,443
It's not like we don't already
have powers.

78
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:05,070
Without his powers,
we can't complete our triangle.

79
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:08,448
Paul, the prophecy
of the Rowe Coven.

80
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:10,534
He must accept his heritage.

81
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:12,202
He must be initiated as a warlock.

82
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:14,955
Initiated how? We can't force him
to kill an innocent.

83
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:16,373
Maybe not.

84
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:21,670
But we can stir his inner nature.

85
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:23,964
The part that he thinks
he's suppressed.

86
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:25,507
Make him wanna kill.

87
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:27,467
By tomorrow? Not a chance.

88
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:29,636
Once he's been ordained, he's safe.

89
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,680
He can never become a warlock.

90
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:35,851
In which case,
we will have to kill him.

91
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,107
Hello?

92
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:45,902
Oh, hello, Josh. How are you?

93
00:06:46,236 --> 00:06:47,571
I will call him back.

94
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:50,156
Yeah, she's right here.
Hold on a sec.

95
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:53,910
You're dirty.

96
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:55,579
Hello?

97
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:59,582
No, that's all right.
I'm always up this early.

98
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:01,710
What's that?

99
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:03,211
My horoscope said that?

100
00:07:03,378 --> 00:07:05,046
Really?

101
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:08,508
Oh, well, that's a shame,
because I have to work Friday night.

102
00:07:08,717 --> 00:07:09,801
Yep, Saturday too.

103
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:11,678
Okay, I'm gonna go change
the cat litter.

104
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:12,971
Phoebe.

105
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:16,266
What? What is the problem?
She likes him. He likes her.

106
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:18,935
The problem is
it's none of our business.

107
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:22,814
I... I've gotta go now, so...
Thanks for calling, though.

108
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:24,315
Yeah, but I gotta go to work.

109
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:27,193
I'll be there all day and all night.

110
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,862
Yep. Gotta go, bye.

111
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:35,827
Okay, you know what, it's your life.
You wanna be a nun? Godspeed.

112
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:37,036
Thank you.

113
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:38,663
Now, back to our warlock crisis.

114
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,874
Why do we think they're after...?
What's his name again?

115
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,960
Brendan, and I don't know.
I couldn't find him.

116
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,087
But I've seen him
at the church before.

117
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:48,881
I'm hoping that
the parish priest can help.

118
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,508
Yeah, well, you better hope Brendan

119
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:52,218
doesn't tell anybody
about your powers,

120
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:54,595
or else we've got bigger problems
than just warlocks.

121
00:07:54,804 --> 00:07:56,430
Yeah, but I don't think he will.

122
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:58,391
There's something in his eyes.

123
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,560
I don't know.

124
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:02,937
It just seemed like
he wasn't surprised by it.

125
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:05,565
All right.

126
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:08,192
I've gotta go. I'll call you guys
if I find out anything.

127
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:10,111
Do you want us to go with you?

128
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:12,446
You have to work, remember?

129
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:20,037
Don't you dare answer that.

130
00:08:20,204 --> 00:08:21,997
Sit down.

131
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,126
Excuse me.

132
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:26,419
- Yes.
- Father Austin?

133
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:28,712
- Yes.
- Hi.

134
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,922
I'm Prue Halliwell.

135
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:32,341
My sister helped coordinate
the food for last night's...

136
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:35,970
Piper, right. Of course.

137
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:37,513
I'm very grateful to her.

138
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,765
It was a wonderful evening.

139
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:43,394
Except for what happened in here.

140
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:45,187
Actually, that's why I'm here.

141
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:47,606
Do you know someone
named Brendan?

142
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:49,775
I think he was one of the volunteers.

143
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:53,612
I know Brendan very well.

144
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:56,532
You don't think he had
anything to do with this?

145
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,535
No, no.

146
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:04,957
But I did see two other men
trying to hurt him.

147
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:07,543
I mean, he's fine.
He got away all right.

148
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:09,837
But I don't think that
they're gonna stop trying.

149
00:09:11,046 --> 00:09:12,965
He always said they'd come.

150
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:15,384
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

151
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:20,138
It's just something I know Brendan's
been wrestling with his whole life.

152
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:24,017
Do you know where I might
be able to find him?

153
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:27,062
Why do you want to?

154
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:30,524
I think he's in trouble.

155
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:32,317
And I might be able to help him.

156
00:09:33,193 --> 00:09:34,653
You?

157
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,571
How?

158
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:42,994
I can't really tell you that, Father.
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:47,249
It's kind of personal.
I just have to ask you to trust me.

160
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,551
So the lunch rush is almost over and
then you're closed till dinner, right?

161
00:09:57,717 --> 00:09:59,803
- Yeah, why?
- Just curious.

162
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,888
Have you heard from Prue yet?

163
00:10:02,055 --> 00:10:04,516
No, not yet.

164
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:09,062
What?

165
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:12,691
- Why are you staring at me?
- Because I'm worried about you,

166
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:14,776
- that's why.
- Oh, Phoebe, don't start.

167
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:16,152
No, Piper, something's up.

168
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:18,363
You're turning down dates
with a guy that you like,

169
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,281
extolling the virtues of convent living,

170
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:22,784
you've been working double shifts
three times a week.

171
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:25,411
This is not the Piper I know,
and I'm worried.

172
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:28,331
Don't be. Everything is fine.

173
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:30,750
I'd like a glass
of Calera Jensen, please.

174
00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:33,545
'93, if you've got it.

175
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,047
Josh.

176
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:38,341
Good start. You recognize me.

177
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:41,427
What are you doing here?

178
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:42,971
- Phoebe.
- What?

179
00:10:43,888 --> 00:10:45,807
This is such a surprise.

180
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:48,184
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna cut right to the chase.

181
00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:50,853
Do you wanna get all hot
and sweaty with me?

182
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:53,314
I'm kidding.
I'm on my way to the gym,

183
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:55,733
and I thought since I can't
buy you dinner,

184
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,237
maybe we could work out together.

185
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:02,782
I'll be right back.

186
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,077
So will I.

187
00:11:07,954 --> 00:11:09,705
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Why?

188
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:11,958
A little exercise, a nice steam,

189
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:14,293
a trip to the juice bar.
What could it hurt?

190
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:15,920
My job. I'm at work.

191
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:17,421
I can't just up and leave.

192
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,925
Okay. Well, I could babysit for you
while you're gone.

193
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:23,010
The restaurant? I don't think so.

194
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,970
It's not like anything's gonna happen.

195
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:27,139
You said it yourself,
you're closed until dinner.

196
00:11:27,598 --> 00:11:30,935
Come on. It is just a workout.

197
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:32,520
The worse-case scenario:

198
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:35,481
You're in better shape by the time
you check into the nunnery.

199
00:11:38,317 --> 00:11:41,362
Okay, fine. But only
if it will get you to shut up.

200
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,863
- It will. Okay.
- Good.

201
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:49,286
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

202
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:58,170
You sure you've never ridden
a horse before?

203
00:11:58,337 --> 00:12:00,297
I've never even seen a horse before.

204
00:12:00,506 --> 00:12:02,132
Except on television.

205
00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:03,967
Well, you're a natural at it.

206
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:06,053
Keep your grades up,
you can come riding again.

207
00:12:06,261 --> 00:12:08,055
Promise?

208
00:12:09,473 --> 00:12:11,433
A spider! Kill it!

209
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,060
Oh, no.

210
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:15,979
He's just trying to find
his way home, that's all.

211
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:19,650
Besides, all life is precious
to God, you know?

212
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:23,570
Here. Don't be afraid.

213
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,405
Trust me.

214
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,993
There you go.

215
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:37,709
Why don't you take him into the stable
and set him free. I'll be right in.

216
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,172
You're braver than me.

217
00:12:42,714 --> 00:12:44,508
How'd you find me?

218
00:12:44,716 --> 00:12:47,385
Father Austin told me
that you would be here.

219
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:48,929
We need to talk.

220
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:51,056
Look...

221
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:52,516
Prue.

222
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,477
Prue.

223
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:58,855
If you're worried about my telling
anybody your secret, you don't have to.

224
00:12:59,064 --> 00:13:00,190
It's safe with me.

225
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:02,067
Yeah, well, that's good to know.
But why?

226
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:05,737
I mean, most people would be pretty
freaked out if they saw what you saw.

227
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:07,197
I'm not like most people.

228
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:09,324
Yes, I know.

229
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:11,618
Most people aren't attacked
by warlocks.

230
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:15,413
I don't wanna talk about that.

231
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,123
Okay.

232
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,043
Hi, just gonna borrow this
for a minute.

233
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:22,003
Sure. Go ahead.

234
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,656
Hey, wait up.

235
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:57,288
Keep your grades up, maybe
you can come riding again too.

236
00:13:57,497 --> 00:13:59,374
Oh, you promise?

237
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,959
Who are you, anyway?

238
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:04,587
Oh, well, that's not fair.
I asked you first.

239
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:07,965
I'm not quite sure I know
the answer to that one, I'm afraid.

240
00:14:08,174 --> 00:14:10,343
Well, as far as I can see,
you're too good to be true.

241
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,720
I mean, church volunteer,
great with kids.

242
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:14,472
Loves horses, spiders.

243
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,932
Not all spiders.

244
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,809
- Hate black widows.
- That's a good thing.

245
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:23,648
What?

246
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:25,816
Brendan, you're in danger.

247
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:27,193
Serious danger.

248
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,654
I know.

249
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:32,198
Wait. How do you know?

250
00:14:33,908 --> 00:14:35,284
I can help you.

251
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:37,661
No, you can't.

252
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:40,706
You're lucky they didn't hurt you.
They could've killed you last night.

253
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,583
Who could've? Who are they?

254
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,586
Doesn't matter.

255
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:48,047
After tomorrow,
I'll be safe from them forever.

256
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:51,800
- What happens tomorrow?
- I become a priest.

257
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:00,309
A little sweat.

258
00:15:00,517 --> 00:15:03,854
A nice steam. A trip to the juice bar.

259
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:06,523
I'm gonna kill you, Phoebe.

260
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:11,028
- How you doing?
- Great. Never better.

261
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:12,988
Well, you're looking great.

262
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:15,365
I can't believe
you've never done this before.

263
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:17,993
Yeah, well, believe it.

264
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:19,828
Want me to keep you company
on the way up?

265
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:24,249
Oh, no. I'll meet you down there.

266
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,834
All right, then. See you in a few.

267
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:37,012
Gotcha.

268
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,680
Talk about falling for a guy.

269
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:51,610
I can't believe I said that.

270
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:54,738
<i>- Hello, Quake.
- Phoebe.</i>

271
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,157
Hey, Piper.

272
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,533
How's it going?

273
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:00,619
Bad, real bad.

274
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:03,413
Really? Why?
Cliffs Notes version will do.

275
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:05,123
You wanna know why?
I'll tell you why.

276
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,042
Because we shared the look.

277
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,169
<i>- The look?
- Yeah. You know,</i>

278
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,588
<i>the look that precedes the kiss.</i>

279
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:13,381
You look at each other
at the same time,

280
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:15,258
you smile at each other
at the same time.

281
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:19,220
Well, that's great.
I knew you'd have a good time.

282
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:22,557
No, Phoebe. This is exactly
what I did not want to happen.

283
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,769
Is that water I hear running?

284
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:30,273
Water? I don't know.
Maybe just a little.

285
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,860
You know, just out of curiosity,

286
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,404
if you were the water shutoff valve,

287
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:37,822
where would you be?

288
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,163
Where'd you get the phone?

289
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:47,707
Phoebe just called.

290
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,543
There's an emergency
at the restaurant. I gotta go.

291
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:57,467
I had a really great time. Thanks.

292
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:59,177
You're welcome.

293
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,612
Prue.

294
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,787
- Dear God!
- Call 911. Hurry.

295
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,801
Prue, wait. You don't understand.

296
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,845
- Don't I?
- I didn't hurt Father Austin.

297
00:17:43,054 --> 00:17:44,221
I found him like that. I swear.

298
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,223
Before or after
you turned into a warlock?

299
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,809
After. When I saw what they did
to him, I was crazed.

300
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:50,394
The rage turned me into a warlock.

301
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:53,314
Look, don't believe me. I don't care.

302
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:55,149
Just at least let me call
the paramedics.

303
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:57,526
Please. Don't let him die.

304
00:17:59,153 --> 00:18:00,487
I'm begging you.

305
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:02,364
They've already been called.

306
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:04,366
Thank you.

307
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:07,870
Do you actually expect for me
to believe that you're a good warlock?

308
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:10,205
No. There's no such thing.

309
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,835
I can explain it to you if you let me.

310
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:17,880
I can make you understand.
I won't hurt you.

311
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:20,924
I need your help.

312
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:24,720
- For what?
- To stop the other warlocks.

313
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:26,513
To stop my brothers.

314
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,696
Got an eyewitness. A nun.

315
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:46,742
Saw someone she ID'd
as Brendan Rowe run from the scene.

316
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:50,704
Apparently Mr Rowe lives
in the rectory behind the church.

317
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:52,664
You all right?

318
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,042
No, I'm not.

319
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:59,463
Father Austin's my priest.
He gave me my first communion.

320
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,966
What kind of animal would do this?

321
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,223
- Wanna follow him to the hospital?
- No.

322
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:13,476
I wanna catch the scum
that did this to him.

323
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:22,068
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

324
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:26,489
You should've called me.

325
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:29,325
I know, I know.

326
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:31,536
But you had a good time, right?

327
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,204
Unfortunately.

328
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:35,415
Do you confuse yourself
when you do that?

329
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,376
It's just...

330
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:40,336
I don't know, Phoebe. It seems like

331
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:42,630
every guy I've liked lately has been

332
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:47,635
either a warlock, a ghost
or otherwise unavailable, like Leo.

333
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:50,555
I was just trying to save myself
some grief with Josh.

334
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,557
But Josh is available.

335
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,434
And human too.

336
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:56,185
I think.

337
00:19:58,104 --> 00:20:00,231
I just don't wanna be
disappointed again.

338
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:01,983
I'm tired of falling for the wrong guy,

339
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,277
human or supernatural.

340
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:06,529
Well, I am sorry.

341
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:09,032
If I had known that you wanted
to take a dating hiatus,

342
00:20:09,198 --> 00:20:10,575
I wouldn't have pushed so hard.

343
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:14,620
Are you mad at me?

344
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,582
No.

345
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:19,375
I'm grateful.

346
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:24,839
- Yeah?
- You followed my instincts.

347
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:27,758
I don't know what I would do
without you.

348
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:33,639
A warlock naturally comes from two
warlock parents, like Greg and Paul do.

349
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:37,685
But they're just my half brothers.
I had a different mother.

350
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:42,606
- A human mother?
- Yes, a wonderfully human mother.

351
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:45,026
So then we have something
in common.

352
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:46,819
My father was human.

353
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:50,322
Difference is, he came from good.
Mine came from pure evil.

354
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,742
Descended from
an ancient warlock line,

355
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:55,703
intent on furthering the Rowe Coven.

356
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,123
Three brothers destined to become
the most powerful force for evil

357
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,416
the world has ever known.

358
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,668
The evil Charmed Ones.

359
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,130
Only, I went into hiding.
I didn't wanna be a part of it.

360
00:21:06,297 --> 00:21:07,631
I wanted to break the chain.

361
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:10,134
Make amends
for all my family's done.

362
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:12,678
By becoming a priest?

363
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:16,098
Embracing God in that way
is the only way to lose my power,

364
00:21:16,265 --> 00:21:18,851
my warlock nature, forever.

365
00:21:19,435 --> 00:21:23,022
And with it, keep the Rowe Coven
from ever being.

366
00:21:24,857 --> 00:21:27,609
I've been at war with myself
all my life, Prue.

367
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:29,945
Running from the evil inside of me.

368
00:21:30,154 --> 00:21:31,780
I guess it finally caught up.

369
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:35,826
- You can fight it. Fight them.
- No, I can't.

370
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:38,328
My brothers are too powerful.
They're relentless.

371
00:21:38,495 --> 00:21:41,707
They'll keep hurting the people
I care about till I give in.

372
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:43,500
They'll even hurt you.

373
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:47,254
I can take care of myself.

374
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:49,339
It's you that I'm worried about.

375
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:51,133
Don't worry about me.

376
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,010
I know what I have to do.

377
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,223
I have to kill my brothers before they
trick me into killing somebody else.

378
00:21:58,432 --> 00:22:00,684
You'll have to follow me
to their place.

379
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:03,228
And then you and your sisters
will have to kill me.

380
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:12,112
- Everything's ready.
- Good.

381
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:14,573
He's coming.

382
00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:17,826
This is amazing.

383
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:20,370
Just at his approach,

384
00:22:20,537 --> 00:22:22,372
my power quickens.

385
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:26,001
It's as if I'm reaching out for him

386
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:27,919
for completion. Do you feel it too?

387
00:22:35,927 --> 00:22:37,345
Brother.

388
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:40,515
- I'm here to kill you, Greg.
- Well, I'm glad.

389
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:43,393
Anything less, I'd be disappointed.

390
00:22:44,686 --> 00:22:46,646
But first...

391
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:51,192
...you're gonna need this.

392
00:22:56,114 --> 00:22:58,783
It's okay, Brendan. Take it.

393
00:23:03,955 --> 00:23:07,292
I know this wasn't your doing, Paul.
But I'm gonna have to kill you too.

394
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:10,294
But me first.

395
00:23:18,594 --> 00:23:20,763
Yes. Just come on.

396
00:23:20,972 --> 00:23:23,349
You're feeling it now.
Come on, that's it!

397
00:23:23,516 --> 00:23:24,851
You're almost there.

398
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:27,270
Feel that pull in your gut,
in your blood?

399
00:23:27,436 --> 00:23:31,649
This is us. This is your birthright.

400
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:43,160
What the hell?

401
00:23:43,327 --> 00:23:44,787
You smell it, Brendan?

402
00:23:44,954 --> 00:23:47,123
It's damp, intoxicating.

403
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:49,750
But you need to kill.

404
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:52,586
Oh, yes. That's it.

405
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:55,756
That's it.

406
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:58,509
We got here as soon as we could.

407
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:00,344
<i>We didn't have time to get
the Book of Shadows.</i>

408
00:24:00,511 --> 00:24:02,346
Yeah, I don't wanna
have to kill Brendan too.

409
00:24:02,555 --> 00:24:04,849
- You said he's a warlock.
- Yeah, I know he is.

410
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:07,351
But if we can vanquish his brothers
before he turns,

411
00:24:07,518 --> 00:24:08,936
we might be able to save him.

412
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:10,479
Okay.

413
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:12,731
One clean thrust,

414
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:14,358
and you're both at peace.

415
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:16,277
Finish it.

416
00:24:21,156 --> 00:24:22,825
Brendan, no.

417
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:28,372
Three witches.

418
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,000
We can't defeat them without Brendan,
and we haven't got him yet.

419
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,553
- It's okay, you're safe.
- No, don't take the blindfold off.

420
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,681
- She'll see us. We'll call for help.
- Prue, he's a warlock.

421
00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:47,307
I know.

422
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:56,858
- Minimal traffic.
- CSU needs the photos.

423
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:58,068
I'll give it to them.

424
00:24:58,235 --> 00:25:01,655
Victim's a little shaken up,
so let's give her some air, okay?

425
00:25:02,823 --> 00:25:04,741
- Here you go, inspector.
- Thanks.

426
00:25:04,908 --> 00:25:07,035
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

427
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,955
You okay to talk a little more?

428
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,750
Yeah.

429
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:15,585
I had just gotten to my car,

430
00:25:15,752 --> 00:25:19,798
and I was loading the groceries
in the back...

431
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:23,510
...and they just came out of nowhere.

432
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:26,930
Was this guy, Brendan Rowe,
was he one of them?

433
00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:28,682
No.

434
00:25:28,848 --> 00:25:33,061
But I remember them calling
one of the other ones that.

435
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:36,898
I was blindfolded, and I think
they drugged me or something,

436
00:25:37,065 --> 00:25:38,984
because the next thing I remember,
I was here.

437
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:44,155
I felt the tip of the knife.

438
00:25:44,322 --> 00:25:46,616
He was gonna kill me.

439
00:25:47,617 --> 00:25:50,578
- But she made him stop.
- She?

440
00:25:51,162 --> 00:25:53,665
One of the women that came.

441
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:57,293
Prue. I think her name was Prue.

442
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,670
Thanks.

443
00:25:58,837 --> 00:25:59,879
Stay with her.

444
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,765
Bastards painted an occult symbol
on her chest. A target.

445
00:26:10,932 --> 00:26:12,767
She's lucky to still be alive.

446
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:15,812
- She ID Brendan Rowe?
- Yeah.

447
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:17,814
She said two others blindfolded her,

448
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,483
brought her here for him to kill her.

449
00:26:21,776 --> 00:26:23,611
Where are you going?

450
00:26:24,445 --> 00:26:27,615
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this,
once and for all.

451
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:33,579
Hey, you can sleep in my room,

452
00:26:33,746 --> 00:26:35,498
and I'll sleep with Piper.

453
00:26:35,665 --> 00:26:36,958
Why?

454
00:26:37,124 --> 00:26:38,501
Because Phoebe kicks.

455
00:26:38,668 --> 00:26:41,045
No, I mean, why are you doing this?

456
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:43,589
Why are you being so kind to me
after what I almost did?

457
00:26:43,756 --> 00:26:45,758
Yeah, but you didn't.
And that's what's important.

458
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:48,344
You didn't succumb
to your brothers' will.

459
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:50,680
Only thanks to you.

460
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:52,139
They had me, Prue.

461
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:53,849
Right where they wanted.

462
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:57,186
I mean, I could feel the evil inside
taking over.

463
00:26:57,478 --> 00:27:00,231
It was so strong, so powerful.

464
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:02,900
If you and your sisters
hadn't come in when you did...

465
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:05,945
You would've stopped yourself.
You wouldn't have hurt her.

466
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:09,698
How can you be so sure of me
when I'm not even sure of myself?

467
00:27:11,075 --> 00:27:14,036
Because you're a good person,
Brendan. I've seen it.

468
00:27:14,203 --> 00:27:16,914
At church, in Father Austin's words,

469
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:19,792
at the stables with that little girl.

470
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:22,044
Your good side is much stronger
than your evil side.

471
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:24,922
You just have to keep fighting
until the ordination in the morning.

472
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:27,132
And then you're home free.

473
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:32,763
And we are gonna make sure
that you get there on time.

474
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:43,190
How many more temptations
must I endure?

475
00:27:58,622 --> 00:28:00,332
Okay, I'm gonna go. Night.

476
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:02,793
Night.

477
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:09,549
He was about to drive a knife
into that woman's heart.

478
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:12,177
- You couldn't have missed that, right?
- I didn't.

479
00:28:12,344 --> 00:28:15,555
I saw Brendan
not plunge the knife into her.

480
00:28:15,722 --> 00:28:17,808
Yeah, that's because
we stopped him.

481
00:28:18,016 --> 00:28:19,142
Then why isn't she dead?

482
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:20,393
Because we showed up.

483
00:28:20,602 --> 00:28:22,270
No, because we followed him.

484
00:28:22,437 --> 00:28:24,689
Because last night,
Phoebe had a premonition

485
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:25,941
of Brendan being attacked.

486
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:28,485
That makes him the innocent
that we're supposed to protect.

487
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:31,196
Not necessarily. I mean,
maybe we were directed to him

488
00:28:31,404 --> 00:28:33,448
so we could save the real innocent,
the woman.

489
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:36,326
Which we did, and now you've brought
her would-be killer,

490
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:39,412
a warlock, into our house. How do you
know he won't try to kill us?

491
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:41,039
That's what warlocks do.

492
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:44,167
He's not just a warlock,
he's human too.

493
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:51,132
Okay, look. Piper, remember when the
Wendigo turned you into a monster?

494
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:54,344
The struggle that you went through?
And, Phoebe,

495
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:56,596
what about when the shadow
turned you evil?

496
00:28:56,805 --> 00:28:59,265
What you went through
to fight him off just to stay good.

497
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,936
If anybody could relate
to what Brendan is going through,

498
00:29:03,102 --> 00:29:04,521
I would think it would be you two.

499
00:29:04,938 --> 00:29:08,816
He has worked so hard for so many
years to overcome his dark side,

500
00:29:08,983 --> 00:29:11,152
his brothers. And he's so close.

501
00:29:15,281 --> 00:29:17,700
What if...? What if you're wrong?

502
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:21,287
What if he crosses over
and joins his brothers?

503
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:23,373
Well, then, they become
the evil Charmed Ones,

504
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:25,291
and it's too late to stop them.

505
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,834
I know.

506
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:32,215
Look, I can't explain it.

507
00:29:32,924 --> 00:29:35,092
I'm just following my instincts.

508
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:36,761
And they've never
led me wrong before,

509
00:29:36,928 --> 00:29:39,764
at least not when I've really
listened to them.

510
00:29:41,265 --> 00:29:44,435
Guys, if you can't believe in him,

511
00:29:44,602 --> 00:29:46,896
can you please at least
believe in me?

512
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:51,817
Okay. Well,
if we're gonna help Brendan

513
00:29:51,984 --> 00:29:55,446
get to his ordination, we have to
figure out a way to stop his brothers.

514
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:57,490
They're definitely
gonna be there waiting.

515
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:01,786
Who could that be?

516
00:30:01,994 --> 00:30:03,829
Brendan's brothers?

517
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:07,333
Something tells me they're not exactly
the ringing-the-bell types.

518
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:15,257
- Andy.
- Hey, Prue, you feeling lucky?

519
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:17,384
Because I'm here to do you
a big favour.

520
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:20,054
I'm gonna forget that I can place you
at the scene of a crime.

521
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:22,890
If you tell me where I can find
Brendan Rowe.

522
00:30:23,432 --> 00:30:25,476
I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.

523
00:30:25,684 --> 00:30:28,062
I'm talking about justice
for Father Austin.

524
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:29,271
Ever hear of him?

525
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,068
What's the matter? Need more time
to work on your story?

526
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:37,154
- Andy.
- Sorry, but all bets are off on this one.

527
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:40,240
A priest, my priest, was viciously
attacked at his own church.

528
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:45,162
This is a guy who dedicated
his entire life to doing only good.

529
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:47,956
Then a young mother
was kidnapped

530
00:30:48,123 --> 00:30:50,959
and almost sacrificed at an altar.

531
00:30:51,168 --> 00:30:54,880
Now, I can place Brendan Rowe
at both scenes of the crime.

532
00:30:56,089 --> 00:31:01,428
And the female victim
hearing your name at the last one.

533
00:31:01,637 --> 00:31:03,180
And believe it or not,

534
00:31:03,347 --> 00:31:04,806
I don't care why you were there.

535
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:08,226
All I care about is who tried to kill
Father Austin.

536
00:31:08,894 --> 00:31:11,563
I wish that I could help you.

537
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,317
Piper, what about you?

538
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:17,027
You wanna tell me where he is?

539
00:31:18,028 --> 00:31:22,032
We're not hiding any criminals here,
Andy, if that's what you're asking.

540
00:31:25,202 --> 00:31:26,828
Fine.

541
00:31:27,037 --> 00:31:29,789
Father Austin's in intensive care.

542
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:32,167
If he dies, it's first-degree murder.

543
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,169
And if I find out you were
somehow involved,

544
00:31:34,377 --> 00:31:36,796
I won't be able to look the other way
this time, Prue.

545
00:31:50,268 --> 00:31:52,312
I've never seen him like that before.

546
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:54,022
Can you blame him?

547
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:56,816
I hope you're right
about Brendan, Prue.

548
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:02,989
<i>Fratrem nostrum reconciliate</i>

549
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:07,076
<i>Conventum nostrum consummate</i>

550
00:32:07,285 --> 00:32:11,372
<i>Fratrem nostrum reconciliate</i>

551
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:15,418
<i>Conventum nostrum consummate</i>

552
00:32:15,627 --> 00:32:19,631
<i>Fratrem nostrum reconciliate</i>

553
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,968
<i>Conventum nostrum consummate</i>

554
00:32:24,135 --> 00:32:28,014
<i>Fratrem nostrum reconciliate</i>

555
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:56,500
He should've been here by now.

556
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:59,170
- I told you the spell wouldn't work.
- We've still got time.

557
00:32:59,337 --> 00:33:00,755
I'm telling you, he can't be taken.

558
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:02,715
His mother's blood
is too strong in him.

559
00:33:02,882 --> 00:33:05,301
Then we will have to kill him.

560
00:33:05,468 --> 00:33:07,386
I won't let that happen.

561
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:09,555
You won't have a choice.

562
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:14,685
- Brendan.
- The spell brought you here.

563
00:33:14,852 --> 00:33:18,063
But the rest you're gonna have to do
on your own, little brother.

564
00:33:18,272 --> 00:33:20,441
- I understand.
- Do you really?

565
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:23,152
I feel only my power
reaching out to yours,

566
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:26,155
and yours, to complete our triangle.

567
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:30,284
All it takes is the life of a mortal.

568
00:33:31,994 --> 00:33:35,414
And then your initiation is complete.

569
00:33:35,623 --> 00:33:38,709
I'm afraid it's gonna take a bit more.

570
00:33:38,876 --> 00:33:41,628
We need proof
that you have truly turned.

571
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:48,302
To complete the Rowe Coven...

572
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:50,888
...you need to sacrifice a witch.

573
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:55,309
Prue.

574
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:25,797
Where'd he go?

575
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:29,634
Probably to the rectory to get ready.

576
00:34:29,843 --> 00:34:31,136
But you're not sure.

577
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,890
- No, I'm not.
- What are you gonna do?

578
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:36,475
I'm gonna go find him.

579
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,187
- Wake up Pheebs, okay?
- I'm up.

580
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:42,230
<i>Wanna know what
the Book of Shadows says</i>

581
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:43,523
about the Rowe Coven?

582
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,734
- Go.
- It's not good.

583
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:49,362
Ever since the tenth century,
each generation has grown stronger.

584
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:53,158
Nobody can find a spell or a weapon
that can stop them.

585
00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:55,368
Some days you just shouldn't
get out of bed.

586
00:34:55,535 --> 00:34:57,787
Let's just hope that the power of three
can beat them.

587
00:34:58,121 --> 00:35:00,415
Unless it's already
three against three.

588
00:35:04,294 --> 00:35:05,962
You sure you don't want us
to go with you?

589
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:08,882
- If he's turned, he'll kill you.
- No, he won't. I can talk to him.

590
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:13,178
Look, I'll yell for help if I need it.
I just need a minute alone with him.

591
00:35:20,226 --> 00:35:21,853
Hello, Prue.

592
00:35:22,478 --> 00:35:24,022
Hi.

593
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,525
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, sure.

594
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,736
Why?

595
00:35:29,902 --> 00:35:31,696
Worried about me?

596
00:35:33,823 --> 00:35:37,452
A little. Especially since
you left this morning without a word.

597
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,246
Yeah, well, big day.
I wanted to get a jump on it.

598
00:35:40,413 --> 00:35:44,083
Yeah. Shouldn't you
be getting ready?

599
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,796
I am ready, Prue.

600
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:51,632
They got to you, didn't they?

601
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:53,217
Look at this place.

602
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:56,345
It's hardly furnished. Dresser...

603
00:35:56,512 --> 00:35:59,181
...crucifix, bed.

604
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:02,518
Will this be my life, to meditate?

605
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:05,062
To shut out the world?

606
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:08,983
- Have your brothers been here?
- Mortify the flesh?

607
00:36:10,192 --> 00:36:11,986
They put a spell on me,

608
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,364
to make me see
your mortal body only.

609
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:18,701
Something to kill.

610
00:36:23,122 --> 00:36:24,874
And I see it.

611
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,420
You can fight it, Brendan.

612
00:36:29,628 --> 00:36:31,338
No, it's okay, don't.

613
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,928
So this is it?

614
00:36:38,137 --> 00:36:39,930
You kill me or I kill you?

615
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:41,682
Prue.

616
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:44,351
Everything that you've worked for.

617
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:47,062
All the good that you've done
and still can do.

618
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,357
All for nothing, all lost?

619
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:52,901
I don't believe it.

620
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:54,862
I don't believe
that this is the real you.

621
00:36:55,738 --> 00:36:59,032
No, Brendan, wait. You're good.
You can't kill me.

622
00:36:59,741 --> 00:37:01,743
It's not who you are.

623
00:37:01,952 --> 00:37:05,122
It's not why Father Austin
believes in you.

624
00:37:30,689 --> 00:37:31,982
Did I hurt you?

625
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:34,776
No, I'm okay.

626
00:37:36,236 --> 00:37:37,988
Forgive me.

627
00:37:39,823 --> 00:37:42,409
I wasn't worried. Were you worried?

628
00:37:46,788 --> 00:37:48,623
It's clear.

629
00:37:53,962 --> 00:37:55,964
You betrayed us, little brother.

630
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:58,842
I'm very disappointed.

631
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:00,802
Leave them out of this, Greg.

632
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:02,345
You're protecting witches now?

633
00:38:03,138 --> 00:38:05,348
- You make me sick.
- Prue?

634
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:06,808
Now.

635
00:38:10,729 --> 00:38:14,023
No, not this time. I'm ready for you.

636
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:20,989
- But family first.
- Yeah? Come and get me.

637
00:38:21,197 --> 00:38:22,448
Greg, wait!

638
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:24,868
Brendan, don't let them turn you.
Don't use your powers.

639
00:38:25,076 --> 00:38:28,371
Give him a chance.
It's not too late, Brendan.

640
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,164
You can still join us.

641
00:38:30,373 --> 00:38:34,168
You're either with us
or you are against us.

642
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:35,712
Then I'm against you.

643
00:38:36,087 --> 00:38:37,964
Then you will die.

644
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:44,887
Damn you, Brendan.

645
00:38:45,096 --> 00:38:47,223
No, Greg.

646
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,142
Damn you.

647
00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:58,860
No.

648
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:16,168
I'm sorry.

649
00:39:16,335 --> 00:39:17,712
I'm not.

650
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,050
It's time.

651
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:26,429
Yeah, I know.

652
00:39:29,223 --> 00:39:30,891
After all these years,

653
00:39:31,058 --> 00:39:34,311
after everything I've given up
to get here...

654
00:39:34,478 --> 00:39:37,231
...the sacrifice never seemed greater
than it does right now.

655
00:39:43,737 --> 00:39:45,406
Tell me about it.

656
00:40:29,783 --> 00:40:32,327
You know, if you're ever
gonna lose a guy...

657
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:34,413
...it might as well be to the big guy.

658
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:36,123
Yeah.

659
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:58,103
- What can I get you, Prue?
- Hi, Bobby. The usual.

660
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,938
- You got it.
- Thanks.

661
00:41:00,105 --> 00:41:01,564
Hey.

662
00:41:01,731 --> 00:41:03,191
Hi.

663
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:04,818
Still mad at me?

664
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:07,153
Listen, Prue, I'm sorry
about how I acted earlier.

665
00:41:07,946 --> 00:41:10,615
Andy, please.
You don't have to apologize.

666
00:41:10,824 --> 00:41:12,826
I know how close you are
to Father Austin.

667
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:15,703
I've known you
a long time, remember?

668
00:41:15,912 --> 00:41:18,289
Yeah. I remember.

669
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:22,710
Actually, I just came from the hospital.
The doctors think he's gonna be okay.

670
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:24,504
I'm glad to hear that.

671
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,383
And he said it wasn't Brendan Rowe
who attacked him, it was his brothers.

672
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,969
I suppose you don't know
where I might be able to find them.

673
00:41:31,177 --> 00:41:33,513
No. Thanks.

674
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:37,725
But I have a feeling that you're not
gonna be able to find them anywhere.

675
00:41:37,934 --> 00:41:39,394
Really.

676
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,562
Now, I wonder how
you might know that.

677
00:41:44,983 --> 00:41:46,984
Never mind, I think I already know.

678
00:41:47,944 --> 00:41:51,197
Well, I'd better get back to work.
I just wanted to stop by.

679
00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:53,491
I'm glad you did.

680
00:42:05,294 --> 00:42:08,214
Well, you're not handcuffed.
That's a good sign.

681
00:42:08,422 --> 00:42:10,591
Depends on who's cuffing you.

682
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,218
I'm joking.

683
00:42:12,885 --> 00:42:14,679
I wonder how he knew
that I would be here.

684
00:42:14,887 --> 00:42:17,974
Are you kidding? We're always
at Quake after we vanquish warlocks.

685
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,684
Either here or at home.

686
00:42:21,978 --> 00:42:24,063
Oh, there's Josh.

687
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,234
Oh, man.
That guy cannot take a hint.

688
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:32,154
Piper, this is my fault.
I'm the one who pushed you on him.

689
00:42:32,321 --> 00:42:33,906
So I will handle this, okay?

690
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:35,866
It's okay. I called him.

691
00:42:39,328 --> 00:42:42,414
I've decided it's time to try
and work through my fears

692
00:42:42,581 --> 00:42:44,917
and trust my instincts.

693
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:46,460
Always a good thing to do.

694
00:42:46,669 --> 00:42:49,380
- Especially when they're that cute.
- Yeah.

695
00:42:49,588 --> 00:42:51,548
Piper. Hey.

696
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:53,092
I'm a little surprised you called.

697
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:55,469
I thought maybe you were
mad at me or something.

698
00:42:55,636 --> 00:42:58,389
No, I just had to go to church.

699
00:42:58,555 --> 00:42:59,765
Table for two?

700
00:43:00,808 --> 00:43:03,102
Yes, you.

701
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,361
So maybe I didn't do
such a bad thing after all.

702
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:15,656
I'd say helping her get over
always falling for the wrong guy

703
00:43:15,823 --> 00:43:17,658
is a pretty good thing.

704
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:20,285
Now maybe you can help me with it.

705
00:43:20,452 --> 00:43:22,579
Yeah. It's not fair,

706
00:43:22,746 --> 00:43:26,083
Iosing such a catch like Brendan
to the priesthood.

707
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,834
God's got all the studs.

708
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:30,337
Well, at least he's not
a warlock anymore.

709
00:43:30,504 --> 00:43:33,423
And at least Piper is not a nun.

710
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,009
- Right?
- Right.
