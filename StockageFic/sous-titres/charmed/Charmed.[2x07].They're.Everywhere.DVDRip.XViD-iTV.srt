1
00:00:04,449 --> 00:00:07,122
Legend holds that buried
somewhere in the Iraqi desert

2
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:09,678
is a fabled book penned
by ancient mystics

3
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:11,805
known as the Akashic Records,

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,759
believed to be a written account of all
significant events throughout time.

5
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:18,044
Powerful stuff.

6
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:22,084
If someone were to get their hands
on that, they could win the lottery.

7
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:24,160
Or at least get tenure.

8
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,638
To know the future brings,
obviously, ultimate power.

9
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:32,245
Which is why everyone from Herod to
Hitler has been looking for the records.

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,206
But to find them...

11
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:37,725
To find them, one needs a map.

12
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:41,442
This tablet, found
in the lvory Coast last year,

13
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,327
is believed to be the very map.

14
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:48,085
Although the engravings are of a lost
language so far indecipherable

15
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:50,160
to even scholars like myself.

16
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:52,524
But we're close.

17
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:57,288
Whoever can decipher them first will
know the exact latitude and longitude

18
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,519
- of the Akashic Records.
- My God, that's it.

19
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:03,643
- Excuse me?
- No, no. Excuse me.

20
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:09,078
If you'll follow me, I'll show you the
next exhibit, which is quite interesting.

21
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:16,922
I cracked it. Dad,
the rest of the map,

22
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:20,081
it was a transposition sequence,
just like you said.

23
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:25,243
And it's all in here. The location
of the Akashic Records.

24
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:30,120
Now, they're gonna come after me
just like they came after you.

25
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:32,405
But I'm gonna be ready
for them, Dad.

26
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,767
- Hey.
- Hey.

27
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:39,758
- How's he doing today?
- The same.

28
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:43,286
Thanks for always keeping his room
so cheerful. I really appreciate it.

29
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:47,602
Oh, don't mention it. I mean, for all
we know, he knows they're here too.

30
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,919
Isn't that why you keep
talking to him?

31
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:52,398
Eric, can I speak to you
alone, please?

32
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:57,606
Yeah. Outside.

33
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:04,321
- I'm not moving him, Dr Stone.
- Eric, it's been six weeks.

34
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:07,287
This facility is not designed
for long-term maintenance.

35
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:10,566
Maintenance? That's my father
you're talking about.

36
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,562
And he's gonna get better.
And he's gonna stay here.

37
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,158
Sorry.

38
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:26,528
Eric, wait!

39
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,284
- I think Jack's a warlock.
- Who?

40
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,964
Jack. Jack Sheridan, the
Internet-auction guy I met, remember?

41
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,359
I went to go get coffee,
he was standing in front of me,

42
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:46,679
and then I went straight
to the newsstand, and wham,

43
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:48,726
he was right there
reading a magazine.

44
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:51,164
He went from one place to another
in the blink of an eye.

45
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,808
- You think he blinked.
- Well, yeah.

46
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:55,164
I mean, that's what warlocks do,
right? Where's Phoebe?

47
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:57,160
She's volunteering
at the convalescent hospital.

48
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:58,603
Great.

49
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,920
Wait. You have to know
if there's a warlock test.

50
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:04,159
Me? Why would I know?

51
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:05,967
Well, l...

52
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:08,404
I mean, you are a warlock magnet.

53
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:10,128
Am I never going to
live Jeremy down?

54
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,280
You know, you had that
Rex-and-Hannah thing at work.

55
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:15,839
Okay, you've got them in your love life,
I've got them at the water cooler.

56
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,959
- What's up with the suitcase?
- A little overnighter.

57
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:20,926
Dan's friend is getting married
in Tahoe,

58
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:23,557
and Dan invited me to come along.

59
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:27,039
In-the-same-hotel
in-the-same-bed sort of thing?

60
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,245
That has yet to be decided.

61
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:34,121
Oh, so then this is just
tennis outfit, right?

62
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:35,768
Give it. Thank you.

63
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:38,921
I mean, you did test him, right?
You know that he's not a warlock?

64
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:41,478
He's not a warlock.
No cats have hissed at him,

65
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:44,117
he has not blinked, he has not
tried to kill me or my sisters

66
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:47,087
and steal our powers, which,
as you know, is a key indicator.

67
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:48,921
I need the Book of Shadows.

68
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:54,805
Oh, I'll get it.

69
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:02,165
- Hello, you.
- Hi.

70
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,843
I was wondering if maybe
we could get an earlier start.

71
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:06,920
You know, miss traffic,

72
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,080
get there quicker so we could
have enough time to...

73
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,526
- Relax?
- "Relax" is a good word.

74
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:16,761
Any chance you could be ready
in an hour?

75
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:18,847
Yes, every chance.

76
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:25,121
I wonder what her problem is.

77
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,526
I gotta go now.

78
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:31,157
Bye.

79
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,925
Prue! Did you find
that warlock test yet?

80
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:25,647
Nineteen warlock-specific
death spells and not one test.

81
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:28,243
What if it's a conspiracy?
Jack and Dan working together,

82
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:32,402
sweet-talking, and the whole time,
they're figuring out how to kill us.

83
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:34,878
- Okay, now you're getting paranoid.
- Well, how can we not,

84
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:37,609
with warlocks and demons coming
out of the woodwork all the time?

85
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:40,408
- It's a wonder we trust anybody.
- We don't.

86
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:43,524
- Here it is.
- "To hear secret thoughts"?

87
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:45,725
We can hear Jack and Dan's
thoughts just long enough

88
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,720
to confirm or deny our suspicions.

89
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:49,845
- No personal gain.
- Purely for protection.

90
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:58,761
Okay.

91
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:01,724
As flame lights shadow
And truth ends fear

92
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,767
Open locked thoughts
To my mind's willing ear

93
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:07,602
May the smoke from this candle
Into everywhere creep

94
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:11,887
Bringing innermost voices
To my mind in speech

95
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:18,238
- Hey, she's wearing my lipstick.
- What, I can't borrow your lipstick?

96
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:23,647
- I didn't say that Prue, I thought it.
- Whatever. Just learn to share.

97
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:25,561
I heard that.

98
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,569
- This could be very dangerous.
- Stay calm. Calm down.

99
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:30,367
Book of Shadows,
needles and warlocks.

100
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:32,599
And Eric's in trouble.
Find out who. Find out what.

101
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:34,885
The hospital hottie?

102
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,318
What?

103
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:39,957
How's Eric? Did you see him today?

104
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:43,248
Why is the Book of Shadows
down here, girls?

105
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:46,287
- Jack blinked.
- And Kit hissed at Dan.

106
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:48,400
Right. And we think that
they may be warlocks,

107
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:52,562
so we were looking for a test
so that we could test them.

108
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:55,482
- Hello, paranoid?
- We are not.

109
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,647
Able to find a spell
in the Book of Shadows.

110
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:00,720
Well, just prick him.
Warlocks don't bleed.

111
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,845
So if there's no blood,
you got your answer.

112
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:04,362
- Who knew?
- Phoebe did.

113
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:06,804
- The spell, don't tell her.
- Should we reverse it?

114
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:08,846
Not until we know if they're really...

115
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:14,359
- Are you two okay?
- So how's Eric?

116
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,918
- Has he asked you out yet?
- No, but he's in trouble.

117
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:18,522
I had a premonition today.

118
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:21,999
A demon, or a warlock, maybe,
with a needle thingy on his finger,

119
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,921
and he was sticking it
into Eric's head.

120
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:26,398
So I came home to see
what we're up against.

121
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:28,480
You guys go deal with Jack and Dan,

122
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:32,198
and I'll look on the Internet,
and I'll tell you if I find anything.

123
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,808
Great, we're surrounded
by warlocks.

124
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:35,561
Next time, get your own
damn lipstick.

125
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,000
- I heard that.
- I love you.

126
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:40,046
Bite me.

127
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:54,605
- Prue.
- Jack, you actually wear that to work?

128
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:56,728
Feisty, feisty.

129
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:59,084
Well, when work puts me
in front of an online server

130
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:04,118
handling 5 million online
auction hits a day, yeah, I do.

131
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:07,562
- So, what's the emergency?
- Verschwang.

132
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:09,208
My what?

133
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:11,929
Verschwang Publications,
the German conglomerate.

134
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,319
You handled their CEO's
bronze-miniature collection

135
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:15,842
for the Internet auction, right?

136
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:18,882
Be careful. She suspects.

137
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:20,721
Yeah, of course.

138
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:23,687
Well, I need some bronzes
checked out. Who did your validation?

139
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:27,917
Validation?

140
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:32,719
You do have people's collections
validated, don't you?

141
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:36,404
Mostly, I put people in graves,
or I incinerate them.

142
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:39,246
Oh, yeah.

143
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:43,004
It was Walt Potock at Berkeley
School of Design. He's the best.

144
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:47,321
If she finds out I'm lying,
she's gonna die.

145
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,240
Well, you know what,
I'm a little late. Gotta go.

146
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:53,446
Good to see you again.

147
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:57,118
You're dying first.

148
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:01,607
You ready?

149
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,760
Can you come in?

150
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:13,122
- Where's your suitcase?
- Upstairs.

151
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,127
I see.

152
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:22,477
Cold feet. She's backing out. It's okay.
Don't push it. Just don't push it.

153
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:25,243
Look, don't move.

154
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:28,998
Okay, this is gonna hurt me
a lot more than it's gonna hurt you.

155
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:35,046
Piper, we have to get to Eric.

156
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:36,722
What's the matter?

157
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:40,484
He didn't bleed. He's not bleeding.
There's no blood. There's nothing.

158
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:45,447
Yeah. Of course he's not bleeding.
He's frozen, his blood is frozen.

159
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:46,803
Yeah. Right.

160
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:49,164
- Okay, go back upstairs. Go.
- Yeah.

161
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,278
Okay.

162
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,884
- What the hell was that?
- You're bleeding.

163
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:01,960
It's... Just a little bit.

164
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,847
Love her touch.

165
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,804
If she doesn't wanna go,
it's okay. Don't force it.

166
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:13,084
- Dan, listen. I really want to go.
- But?

167
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:17,362
- He's bleeding.
- He's lucky.

168
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:19,599
Hi. Listen, Dan,
I have to borrow Piper

169
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:22,044
for just a little while,
but I'll have her back soon, okay?

170
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:24,564
- Nice butt.
- Hey!

171
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:30,123
Hey, you hang in there.
And I'll be back in time.

172
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:33,367
- Yeah, I hope so.
- Later.

173
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:47,322
That's what's scaring Kit.
It's... You got hornets.

174
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:51,084
- It's probably what stung me too.
- Yeah, probably.

175
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:53,444
Okay, gotta go.

176
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:55,565
Don't leave without me.

177
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:59,204
Okay, gotta go, gotta go.

178
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:13,120
They're called "collectors."
They're a warlock...

179
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:15,723
They're a warlock breed
that drains knowledge

180
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:17,959
out of people's brains
with that weird finger I saw.

181
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:19,721
The Book didn't say
how to vanquish them?

182
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:22,642
No, it just said, "Their hunger
for knowledge is your ally."

183
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,277
Okay, whatever that means.
Are you sure this is where he lives?

184
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:27,883
That's what the hospital record said.
5D, here it is.

185
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:36,406
Piper!

186
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:39,527
Okey-dokey.

187
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:44,161
Oh, my God. That is Dr Stone,
Eric's dad's doctor.

188
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:47,920
All right, let's get him out of here.
We'll figure out what they want later.

189
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:49,078
Okay, ready?

190
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:51,205
- You do a little thingy.
- Okay.

191
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,641
Get out of here! Get him out of here!

192
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:02,602
Get back.

193
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:09,647
Oh, my God.

194
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:18,919
Okay, let's go, let's go!

195
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:35,363
They put my father in the hospital.
They took his mind.

196
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:38,601
- Who do you think they are?
- NSA, CIA, who knows?

197
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:44,002
Somebody in bulletproof vests.
The question is, who are you?

198
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:45,608
Friends.

199
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:48,408
Yeah, right.
They're after the Akashic Records too.

200
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:53,206
- What are the Akashic Records?
- I knew it.

201
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:54,722
Wait, what did you just say?

202
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:56,801
The Akashic Records,
what are they?

203
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,880
- You tell me.
- I'll tell you.

204
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:01,438
They're a book of ancient prophecies.
The future of the world,

205
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:04,442
down to the smallest detail,
hidden away and lost for centuries.

206
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:07,077
- But it's just a legend. How did you...?
- You're well informed.

207
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:10,721
- I read a lot. How did you know that?
- I'll tell you later.

208
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,641
So they want those records.
And they want Eric

209
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,367
because he knows
how to find them, right?

210
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:17,999
- Who are you people?
- What if it's not a legend?

211
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:21,047
Say they're real. What happens
if the bad guys get these records?

212
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:25,680
And they use the future against us?
No more us, the bad guys win.

213
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:29,722
- I gotta get my father out of there.
- No, wait, Eric.

214
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:31,766
He's stuck in the hospital.
Dr Stone's in on it.

215
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:34,124
Eric, it is not about
your father anymore.

216
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,245
It's about you,
especially if they think you know

217
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,640
- how to find the Akashic Records.
- Try and stop me.

218
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:45,598
How?

219
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:50,360
- Entertaining guest, I see.
- Hi.

220
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:53,963
Piper? Could you help me out a little?

221
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:59,244
Who's the cute boy?

222
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:01,081
It's Eric, from the hospital.

223
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,968
Two warlocks called collectors
want what's in his brain:

224
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:05,687
The location of the Akashic Records.

225
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:07,805
A lost text that predicts
all future events.

226
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:09,846
Collectors get it, the world's a goner.

227
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,124
- It's a...
- It's a lost text

228
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:12,883
that predicts all future events.

229
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:15,085
The collectors get it,
the world's a goner, I know.

230
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,843
Okay, does someone wanna tell me
what's going on here?

231
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:20,200
Have to tell her now.

232
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:22,758
Okay. Phoebe, see,

233
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:25,807
Piper and I didn't really know
about the whole pricking thing

234
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:27,197
to expose a warlock.

235
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:31,362
So we sort of cast a little hearing-
thoughts spell just to find things out.

236
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,042
Oh, a hearing-thoughts spell.

237
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:36,645
- Dan's clean, by the way.
- Glad to hear it. Jack's not.

238
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:39,084
Wait, are you guys thinking
something about me right now?

239
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:41,645
No. Does Eric know
witches, warlocks?

240
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,640
No, he thinks it's
a government conspiracy.

241
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,367
How do you know Jack's a warlock?

242
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,804
I heard his thoughts,
and they are bad. Really bad.

243
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:51,759
You know, graves, dead people,
burnt bodies.

244
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:53,885
- Did you prick him?
- No, that's why I need Piper.

245
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:57,041
Freeze him, prick him and then
vanquish him if necessary.

246
00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:58,324
Where did you get that?

247
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:02,205
Remember the troubled priest
with the warlock brothers?

248
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:05,402
Well, they left this behind,
and I've sort of hung on to it,

249
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:07,480
just in case we needed it
for future warlock use.

250
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:10,607
Wow, it's been a while,
but it seems like they're everywhere.

251
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,442
Okay, you two go to it. I'll stay here.

252
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:16,919
- What if the collectors show up?
- Well, just get back before they do.

253
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:19,644
And don't lose that dagger.

254
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:24,564
We have to go kill a warlock
while she sits on some guy's...

255
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:27,163
Hey, hey, hey!

256
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:29,047
You heard that?

257
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:33,365
Like I need a hearing-thoughts spell
to know what you're thinking.

258
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:35,440
Stop it.

259
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,687
Now, are you gonna behave?

260
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:42,599
Do I have a choice?

261
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:44,768
No.

262
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:56,759
- Did you find Eric?
- No.

263
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:59,966
Not good. He's being protected
by a time-freezing witch.

264
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:02,324
And Bruce Lee's little sister.

265
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,322
The Akashic Records
are within our reach.

266
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:09,277
It's going to be very difficult to drain
his brain if they know what we're after.

267
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:12,607
Not to worry.

268
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:16,921
We'll get into his mind
through his heart.

269
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,047
Very nice.

270
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:29,040
There she is, hard at work.

271
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,126
- I'm glad you called. Can I come in?
- Sure.

272
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:38,049
Stay focused. Get it over with.

273
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:40,161
Freeze him.

274
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:44,527
The dagger, his hand,
just kind of poke him.

275
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:52,567
- He's not bleeding.
- He's frozen.

276
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:56,358
Yeah. Okay, okay, okay.
Wait a minute.

277
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:58,688
Okay.

278
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:00,928
Hey, any survivors?

279
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:11,088
- Okay, there's two of them.
- Twin warlocks?

280
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:13,365
Or maybe they're just twins.

281
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:18,605
Okay, you unfreeze them.
If that prick doesn't bleed,

282
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:20,964
- then that one's dead too.
- All right.

283
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:22,767
All right, let them go.

284
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,444
What? What's the matter,
she bite you?

285
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:27,678
You shouldn't be here.

286
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:29,840
Come on, man, I couldn't let you
take all the blame.

287
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,840
He's bleeding.

288
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,803
All right, this is my sister Piper.
Which one of you jerks is Jack?

289
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:40,485
I'm the jerk.
This is my twin brother, Jeff.

290
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:45,677
Hey. Nice to meet you. Look,
sorry for the little tap dance earlier.

291
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:50,159
So, what exactly was it that you guys
were trying to prove?

292
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,127
It's just a little something
we used to do growing up.

293
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:55,757
Yeah, so when one of us would
take an interest in someone...

294
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:57,203
Don't get the wrong idea.

295
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,247
So you'd send the other one
to check out the merchandise,

296
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:03,321
- sort of kick the tires?
- Crude, but accurate.

297
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:05,560
Still doesn't explain
why he wanted to kill me.

298
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:06,798
Good point.

299
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:10,359
So, Jeff, what is it
that you do for a living?

300
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:13,118
Oh, great, this should be
a conversation stopper.

301
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:17,407
I own a mortuary.
Actually, a whole chain of them.

302
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:21,240
- Mortuaries.
- Put them in graves, set them on fire.

303
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:27,406
You know, you two should be
ashamed of yourselves.

304
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:30,685
That's for thinking that you
could get away with it.

305
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:33,921
And that's for thinking
that you wouldn't get slapped.

306
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,647
Piper.

307
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:43,761
I approve.

308
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,368
How did you know to be there
to help me?

309
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:58,326
- That's a long story.
- Wait. Shorten it.

310
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:01,966
I have this gift.

311
00:20:02,129 --> 00:20:05,246
I sort of know when things are gonna
happen, if there's gonna be trouble.

312
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:08,960
- How?
- Just something I was born with.

313
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,525
So you don't work
for some government agency?

314
00:20:11,689 --> 00:20:13,964
No. I'm just a girl.

315
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:18,197
Now, let me ask you a question.

316
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:26,002
This thing that you did, translating
this ancient code or whatever...

317
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:28,799
...why did you do it?
- I did it for my father.

318
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,963
- To finish his work?
- People hurt him.

319
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:34,962
And I wanted to find out who,
and I wanna get even.

320
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:38,041
- Even at the risk of them hurting you?
- He's my dad.

321
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:41,645
I love him. And if I can't
have him back, I want justice.

322
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:46,962
- I envy you.
- You're not close to your folks?

323
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,999
My mom is dead.

324
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:54,606
- I'm sorry.
- And my dad is...

325
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:56,202
...gone.

326
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,119
You don't know where he is?

327
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:01,365
I'm not really that interested.

328
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:04,248
- I don't understand that.
- You don't know my dad.

329
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:06,362
Do you?

330
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:12,999
No, I never got the chance to,
unfortunately.

331
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:18,404
Okay. I'm a sucker for family.
Follow me.

332
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:22,244
- Jack's not a warlock.
- He's a jerk.

333
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:24,969
We're going to the hospital.
We gotta get Eric's dad out of there

334
00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:27,848
and keep him someplace safe.
Come on.

335
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:01,559
Where is everybody?

336
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:05,004
- Did you bring that dagger?
- Yep.

337
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:16,686
- Dad!
- Eric, wait!

338
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:21,918
Dad, we gotta get you out of here.

339
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:24,557
- Eric.
- I'm getting him out of here, Phoebe.

340
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:34,207
- What's going on?
- Later.

341
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:36,803
Get him. We gotta get out of here.

342
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:38,800
Where did they go?

343
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:41,241
Looking for that?

344
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:43,400
He's got the dagger.

345
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:45,727
Piper!

346
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:51,518
Move, and she dies.

347
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,321
Dad?

348
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:20,839
Eric. Eric, we still wanna help you.
Nothing has changed.

349
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:25,958
No, everything has changed. Some
kind of monsters just took my dad.

350
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:28,882
- They're called warlocks.
- Warlocks?

351
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,803
What does that make
the three of you?

352
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:34,164
Witches.

353
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:38,642
Forgive me, but what
you're saying is insane.

354
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:41,281
Eric, you believe in
the Akashic Records

355
00:23:41,449 --> 00:23:43,644
and all the power
that they represent, right?

356
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:46,482
- Yeah, I guess.
- Well, most people think that's a myth.

357
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:48,242
But you now know that it isn't.

358
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:52,846
So isn't it possible that other things like
witches and warlocks actually do exist?

359
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:55,967
Maybe, but why would warlocks
want my dad?

360
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:59,121
They're probably gonna offer you a
trade: Your dad for what's in your head.

361
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:01,723
And they can appear
any time, anyplace.

362
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:03,800
Which is why we need to get you
back to the manor.

363
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:06,403
You'll be safer there
than anywhere else.

364
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:08,241
Okay, look, Eric, I am the same girl

365
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:10,047
you met at the hospital
a few weeks ago.

366
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:12,882
The only thing that's changed is,
now you know our secret.

367
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:16,360
- It's one hell of a secret.
- Yeah, and I trust you with it.

368
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:19,079
So please trust me in return.

369
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:22,841
Look, if we're gonna save your father,
we have to keep you safe

370
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:24,567
until we figure out
what we're gonna do.

371
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,721
You do that. I have another idea.

372
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:30,961
Okay, I'm gonna go get him,
you two get home.

373
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:34,481
- Do we have to protect him?
- He is pissing me off.

374
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:40,444
- Eric, what are you doing?
- You'll see.

375
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:44,568
We shouldn't be out in the open
like this. It's not safe.

376
00:24:44,729 --> 00:24:46,720
Then go. I have
something I have to do.

377
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:48,242
What? What do you have to do?

378
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:50,918
Get busted, Eric? That...

379
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:56,448
That's the map stone, isn't it?

380
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:59,282
Yeah. My father thought it would be
so wonderful translating it.

381
00:24:59,449 --> 00:25:02,998
A gift of knowledge to usher the world
into the new millennium.

382
00:25:03,729 --> 00:25:04,718
What are you doing?

383
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:08,717
If the Akashic Records are everything
you say they are, they're not a gift.

384
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:11,164
I mean, the warlocks shouldn't have
that knowledge.

385
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:13,081
Neither should the rest of us.

386
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:15,809
With all knowledge revealed,
we could have no free will.

387
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:18,642
And no world as we know it.

388
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:21,040
Maybe no world at all.

389
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:23,921
Oh, my God!

390
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:34,002
Now no one else will ever
be able to translate the map.

391
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:37,161
The only place the longitude exists
is in my head.

392
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,081
I'll get security.

393
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:44,726
- Poor Eric.
- He'll be okay. We'll figure this out.

394
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:46,720
Yeah. In the meantime,
warlocks have his father.

395
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:49,244
I can't imagine
how helpless he must feel.

396
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:51,001
I can.

397
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:55,603
Prue, a warlock
didn't take our father.

398
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:57,964
No, he left on his own.

399
00:25:58,129 --> 00:26:01,804
- Do you miss him?
- I didn't say that.

400
00:26:02,609 --> 00:26:05,282
- Do you think about him?
- Why?

401
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:08,521
Because I'm wondering
if I'm the only one who does.

402
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:12,040
- No, you're not.
- So you miss him.

403
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:16,157
I miss who he should have been,
and I miss who he never was,

404
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:18,365
but I don't miss him.

405
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:22,447
I do.

406
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:25,203
All right, can we get to work?

407
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:28,681
Okay, let's save
someone else's father instead.

408
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:30,800
All right, the only way to protect Eric

409
00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:32,960
is to take the information
out of his brain forever.

410
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:34,642
The spell is right here.

411
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,961
But if we do that, Eric won't
have anything to offer the warlocks,

412
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,802
and they'll be furious.
And they'll kill his dad.

413
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:43,927
Well, Eric is our innocent.
Our priority is him.

414
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:45,602
Yeah, but they're both innocents.

415
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:48,966
Piper, I hope it doesn't come to this,
but we may have to make a choice.

416
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:52,519
Why? I mean, there's gotta be another
way, with all the hocus-pocus we have.

417
00:26:52,689 --> 00:26:54,964
Still may not be enough.
I mean, we're talking about

418
00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:57,848
the future, everyone's future.

419
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:00,125
So we have to sacrifice Eric's dad?

420
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:02,601
For the greater good.

421
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:06,008
Man, you can dress it up
any way you want, it still stinks.

422
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:07,648
You know what, it sucks.

423
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:12,605
Oh, that's Dan.
I gotta go deal with him.

424
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:16,000
You gotta figure out
what we're gonna say to Phoebe.

425
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,877
Hey. You ready to go?

426
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:28,279
Oh, man. She's not coming.

427
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,361
Dan...

428
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:35,918
Look, I wanna go, I really do.
I'm just not quite ready yet.

429
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,922
Piper. Any word from the...

430
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:42,923
...pizza guy? Hi, Dan. We ordered
pizza. Would you like to stay for pizza?

431
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:46,684
No, I wanna go. With her.
But what's the point?

432
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:48,441
Okay, okay,
I know what you're thinking...

433
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,407
Piper!

434
00:27:50,689 --> 00:27:53,408
- But I can be ready on time.
- Okay.

435
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,163
Well, I have to leave in an hour,

436
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:57,206
I'm gonna be late
for this wedding rehearsal.

437
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:59,519
So car's gonna leave at 6.
I hope to see you in it.

438
00:27:59,689 --> 00:28:01,247
Okay.

439
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:03,842
Someday, some way, somehow,

440
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:06,523
I'm gonna make it
through that damn door.

441
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:09,048
Have the warlocks
made contact yet?

442
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:12,797
No, not yet.
Where have you guys been?

443
00:28:12,969 --> 00:28:15,244
Well, Eric destroyed the map stone,
so we're covered there.

444
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:17,365
Did you guys find
anything in the Book?

445
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:21,317
You tell her. I've broken
enough hearts this afternoon.

446
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:22,524
We'll both tell her.

447
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:25,449
Eric, why don't you go check
your messages at home.

448
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:28,840
- Maybe they tried to contact you there.
- Okay.

449
00:28:30,129 --> 00:28:31,926
What's going on?

450
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,482
Can we talk?

451
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:43,883
You have no new messages.

452
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:47,004
Wait, you're willing
to let Eric's father die?

453
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:50,445
We can't risk losing Eric and allow
the warlocks to gain future knowledge.

454
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,966
But not at the expense of his father.
We have to save him.

455
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:55,801
Phoebe, we have to save
everyone's dad.

456
00:28:55,969 --> 00:28:58,119
We have to protect the whole world
from these warlocks.

457
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:00,086
And we can't do it
if they have the Records.

458
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:01,807
So, what am I supposed to tell Eric,

459
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:03,687
that we might have to
sacrifice his father?

460
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:07,478
I can't do that. I promised him
that we would save him.

461
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:13,126
- Phoebe.
- You don't even care.

462
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:15,917
I'm sorry.

463
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,398
I didn't mean that. I don't know
why I even thought it.

464
00:29:18,569 --> 00:29:22,528
- Do you want us to tell him?
- No, it's something that I have to do.

465
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:30,041
- Hello?
- Eric. I assume you know who this is.

466
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:33,281
- Where's my father?
- Oh, you do know. Good.

467
00:29:33,449 --> 00:29:35,883
Say hello to Eric, Ben.

468
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:41,159
- Eric? Son?
- Dad?

469
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:42,478
I feel so odd.

470
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:45,279
Dad! Dad!

471
00:29:49,129 --> 00:29:52,439
Oh, he's gone, Eric. But I can
bring him back and give him to you.

472
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:55,797
All I want in exchange is
what's in your head.

473
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,924
- Where can I find you?
- The oak grove, the west end

474
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:03,321
of Golden Gate Park. Half an hour.
Alone. Without the witches.

475
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:04,882
Eric?

476
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:09,409
- Any messages?
- No, not yet.

477
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:10,763
Eric...

478
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:14,638
Before you say another word,
I just wanna say thank you

479
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:16,959
for everything you've done
for my father.

480
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:19,601
I mean, everything you're trying to do.

481
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:22,408
You sure you're not an angel?

482
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:26,642
No, I'm no angel. I could probably
introduce you to one, though.

483
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,400
It's a shame your father's
not a part of your life.

484
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:32,567
He would be so proud of you.

485
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:36,845
Eric, I need to talk to you...

486
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,645
...about you and your dad.

487
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:41,128
Okay.

488
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:45,129
Maybe we should have
another cup of tea first.

489
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:48,804
- Okay, I'll go get it.
- Thanks.

490
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,727
Eric, where are you going?

491
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:00,202
I'm just gonna go out, get some air.

492
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:02,405
The oak grove, Golden Gate Park.

493
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,968
Phoebe!

494
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,366
Yeah?

495
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:09,726
- Where is he going?
- He was thinking Golden Gate Park.

496
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:12,449
Oh, my God, the warlocks
must have contacted him.

497
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:35,849
All right, there are
oak trees everywhere.

498
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:38,648
- What if we're too late?
- Phoebe, stop thinking that.

499
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:40,606
Would you get
out of my head, please?

500
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:42,999
The Book of Shadows
said that their hunger is our ally.

501
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:45,160
So there must be a way
to use the knowledge

502
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:46,887
that they've acquired against them.

503
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:48,721
Or use their greed to trap them.

504
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:50,766
Yeah, well, if all else fails,

505
00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:53,762
then we'll freeze them and move them
long enough to get Eric away.

506
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:56,284
And save his father, right?

507
00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:00,169
Look, it just seems to me we should do
everything we possibly can

508
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:02,320
to reunite Eric and his father.

509
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:05,640
I mean, imagine, a dad who actually
wants to be with his child.

510
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:07,162
Pheebs, we'll do our best.

511
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:12,046
Okay. Then we should split up.
The first one that sees him hollers.

512
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:07,445
- Dad!
- That's close enough, Eric.

513
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:13,083
I can restore him,
or I can kill him, Eric.

514
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:15,403
That choice is mine.

515
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:18,879
Restore him, or you don't get
what you want. That choice is mine.

516
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:22,962
No, no, no, no, no, you can't bargain,
Eric. We're in control here.

517
00:33:25,329 --> 00:33:27,126
Let's check again.

518
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:29,928
Who's got the upper hand?

519
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:33,525
Haven't you been paying attention?
That gun won't do anything to us.

520
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:35,884
No, but it will blow my head off.

521
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:38,802
And if I do that, you don't get
the second half of the map.

522
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:43,357
Restore him. Now.

523
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:03,127
- Dad?
- Eric.

524
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:06,120
Son, what are you doing?

525
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:07,688
Dad!

526
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:13,921
You're mine now, Eric!
Like I said, we're in control.

527
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:34,762
Phoebe.

528
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:38,726
Prue, watch out!

529
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:44,079
That's right, witches.
Come and get me.

530
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:47,844
Don't blink.
Keep them focused on me.

531
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:49,806
Let him surprise them from behind.

532
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:52,164
- Wait, don't freeze him.
- Why not?

533
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:54,240
Didn't you hear his thoughts?
He's playing decoy.

534
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:56,081
Let him think that it's working.

535
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:20,357
You know, they really shouldn't have
given us the finger.

536
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:21,882
You read my mind.

537
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:28,639
Prue? Piper?

538
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:31,002
Are you okay?

539
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:33,967
I think so.
What are we doing in the park?

540
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,846
Who are those people?

541
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:45,648
- You don't recognize Eric?
- No. Why, should I? Should I?

542
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:48,403
What's the last thing you remember?

543
00:35:49,409 --> 00:35:52,765
- The Halloween party.
- That was three weeks ago.

544
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:00,681
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

545
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:02,680
Just a little confused.
What am I doing here?

546
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:04,919
You don't recognize her?

547
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:06,761
No.

548
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:08,681
Wait, I think I've seen you
at the hospital.

549
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:10,960
Who's the cute guy?

550
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,401
- Dad?
- Eric.

551
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:21,321
Oh, my God! You're...

552
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:22,808
You're better!

553
00:36:23,729 --> 00:36:27,165
- What's going on? What's happening?
- I don't know.

554
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:30,560
- Did we do something good?
- You did something incredible.

555
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:44,038
Okay, what am I thinking?

556
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:45,722
That Dan's gonna leave without me.

557
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:48,005
- Nope. Good, the spell is reversed.
- What a relief.

558
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:50,399
I think we've proven beyond
a shadow of a doubt that man

559
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:53,129
and, especially, woman aren't meant
to hear each other's thoughts.

560
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:54,483
Definitely. Too much knowledge,

561
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:56,844
whether it comes from the
Akashic Records or people's heads,

562
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:59,159
- is just dangerous stuff.
- So, what were you thinking?

563
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:02,082
I was thinking what it shame it was
that Phoebe finally met a nice guy,

564
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:04,399
and she's not even
gonna remember it.

565
00:37:05,529 --> 00:37:06,518
- Hi.
- Hi.

566
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:08,486
- Hi.
- They're gorgeous.

567
00:37:08,649 --> 00:37:11,527
They're for you. The florist left them
on the porch. But there's no card.

568
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:13,725
- They're huge.
- They're expensive.

569
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:15,921
They're ringing.

570
00:37:17,889 --> 00:37:19,481
- Hello?
- Oh, no!

571
00:37:19,649 --> 00:37:22,402
Dan! He's leaving. Without me.

572
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:25,447
- Don't just stand there, freeze him.
- Oh, right.

573
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:30,647
I gotta go.

574
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:33,208
It's such a nifty little power.

575
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:37,087
Honey... Open.

576
00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:40,485
- Hello?
- At last.

577
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:42,879
I've been calling you every
20 minutes for the last hour.

578
00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:45,844
- Did you like the flowers?
- Jack, what do you want?

579
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:48,519
You know, you are
a very suspicious woman.

580
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:50,885
No, I just like to think of it as careful.

581
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:54,838
Oh, come on, Prue, are you saying
you've been totally honest with me?

582
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:59,446
Jack, I can't hear you,
the phone's breaking up!

583
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:05,167
I just... I wanted to apologize.
Can l...? Can I take you for dinner?

584
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:08,719
- I don't think so.
- Come on. Let me buy you a drink.

585
00:38:09,209 --> 00:38:11,643
- I don't think so.
- Can I at least get my phone back?

586
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:14,208
I don't think so.

587
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:24,284
- Oh, I like it.
- What are you doing?

588
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:26,644
I'm calling Tokyo.

589
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:31,241
Konnichiwa.

590
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:43,082
Excuse me.

591
00:38:43,249 --> 00:38:46,127
I'm looking for a Dr Schlenzig. I need
him to sign some insurance papers.

592
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:47,881
I was told he'd be in here.

593
00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:50,927
Yeah, he actually just took
Mrs Bruen to the sunroom.

594
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:54,365
- You could probably catch him there.
- Great. Thanks.

595
00:38:57,809 --> 00:38:59,401
You're Phoebe, right?

596
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:01,958
I'm Eric Bragg. I think I saw you
the other day at the park.

597
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:04,559
Right. Right, how's your father?

598
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:07,721
Oh, he's better, thanks.
He's almost back to his old self.

599
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:10,367
I remember...

600
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:13,282
...you were really sweet to him
when he was in here.

601
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:15,599
Not many people
would have bothered.

602
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:18,727
- You must be an angel.
- No, I'm no angel.

603
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,961
But I could probably introduce you
to one if you'd like.

604
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:36,440
You know, I just realized, I have
no idea where the sunroom is.

605
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:40,839
It's kind of complicated.
Maybe I should draw you a map.
