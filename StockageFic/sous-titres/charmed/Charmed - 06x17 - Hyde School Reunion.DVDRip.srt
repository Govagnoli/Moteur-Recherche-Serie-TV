1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,006
Interesting.

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:07,883
Are you okay in there?

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:13,138
I don't remember having morning
sickness this bad with Wyatt.

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,058
Oh, honey, that sucks.

5
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,102
I'm just going over some
pictures here,

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:24,066
trying to educate myself
before I go to Phoebe's reunion.

7
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,402
Todd Marks.
I wonder if he's still even alive.

8
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,239
Alive? What kind of school
did she go to anyway?

9
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,782
Not a bad one, actually.

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,452
It's just that Phoebe tended
to hang out with the bad-boy crowd.

11
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,329
You know, anything to piss off Grams.

12
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:42,251
- Was he her first love?
- More like first lust.

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,254
Talk about crazy, though.

14
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,841
Rick Gittridge. He was kind of
the leader of their little gang.

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,134
- Phoebe was in a gang?
- Not the drive-by kind.

16
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,054
But he was kind of the type.

17
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,431
If he's at the reunion,
I'd stay away from him.

18
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,684
This is so weird.

19
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,894
It's a whole different side
of Miss Phoebe.

20
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:04,815
I think she missed Mom in her life
more than Prue or I did.

21
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:09,111
And the more Grams tried to control
her, the more she became rebellious.

22
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,115
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

23
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,658
- What happened?
- What happened?

24
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:19,121
The dry cleaner ruined my dress
for tonight, that's what happened.

25
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,832
Phoebe, you know better than
to scream in this house

26
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,417
if there isn't a demon.

27
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,503
I'm sorry, but what am I supposed to
wear to the reunion tonight?

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,255
How about some prison stripes?

29
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,132
You told her about the shoplifting?

30
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,676
- You little thief.
- No, I acted out.

31
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,803
Now, back to what
I'm supposed to wear tonight.

32
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,014
I know, why don't you try your
little black suit,

33
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,224
the one with the thigh slit?
Sexy, yet successful.

34
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,686
No, I think black is too threatening.
I'll be in my closet.

35
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,649
- Chris, hi.
- Hey.

36
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,277
Look, I need your help.
I think I got scabbers on my tail.

37
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,240
Oh, well, I have some
hydrogen peroxide in my bathroom.

38
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,783
No, scabber demons.

39
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,119
I went undercover to follow
a lead on who turns Wyatt,

40
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,454
but I think they're on to me.

41
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,290
I need a cloaking spell, just in case.
Is the Book in the attic?

42
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,375
Yeah, the last I saw.

43
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,711
Want me to help you?

44
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,715
- He hates me.
- No, he doesn't.

45
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,759
Yeah, he does.

46
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:21,600
He's just distracted, that's all,
by, you know, imminent death.

47
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,477
That's no excuse.

48
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,813
I mean, he's been avoiding me
for weeks. He won't even look at me.

49
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,525
What could I have done in the future
that would be so bad?

50
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,611
Maybe he should have
a father-son talk.

51
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,112
No, I can't do that to Leo.

52
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,782
He had a hard enough time
letting go.

53
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,534
Besides, he doesn't know
I'm pregnant.

54
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,661
I know, but don't boys need their?

55
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,538
I know, and that's why
I called my father,

56
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:46,375
so he could figure out why
his surly new grandson hates me.

57
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,799
I got you.

58
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,300
Guys, how about this one?

59
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,221
Okay.

60
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,020
I remember this poem.

61
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,441
Those who mock who I am
Let them always remember when

62
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,666
- Hi.
- Piper.

63
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,210
- Honey, good to see you.
- Good to see you.

64
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,629
All of you. Look, you're pregnant.

65
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,006
Yeah, it looks that way, huh?

66
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,383
When did this happen?

67
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,178
Oh, well, you know, I've been meaning
to call you, but, you know...

68
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,596
Leo is the father.

69
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,974
Leo? I thought you guys split up.

70
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,433
We did.

71
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,185
Well, then how did?

72
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,520
I don't understand.

73
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,940
He was dying and I was crying...

74
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,984
It's all very complicated.

75
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,698
So, Leo, he's... moved on?

76
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,702
Yeah, but I'm happy for him.
He really wanted to go.

77
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,913
- He wanted to die?
- No, no, no. He's not dead.

78
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,958
He's just up there
being a full-time Elder.

79
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,334
He doesn't know about this?

80
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,129
No, no, not yet.

81
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,131
Did I mention this was all
very complicated?

82
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,425
The point is, he's not around.

83
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,469
- Was he ever?
- Were you?

84
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,056
- Sorry.
- No, no, no, I deserve that.

85
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,850
I wasn't around enough for you girls.

86
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,226
But...

87
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,813
I want to make up for that
with Wyatt and his little...

88
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,232
It's a boy. Chris, actually.

89
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,984
Chris?
Why did you choose that name?

90
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,069
I don't know and he won't tell me.

91
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,155
He's very secretive about the future.

92
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,324
He's actually the reason
I asked you to come.

93
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,367
See, he hates me

94
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,746
and he doesn't want to talk to me,
and I need you to find out why.

95
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,249
I don't understand
your Wiccan ways.

96
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,251
But I'll try.

97
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,505
Hello, Chris. Chris?

98
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,965
Hello, Chris. Can you hear me?

99
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,800
Someone calling me?

100
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,886
Yeah. Sweetie,
could you come here a sec?

101
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,304
Jeez, he can come out?

102
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,433
Can we hurry this up
because I gotta get...

103
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,560
Grandpa.

104
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,949
Okay, Paige, I should warn you.

105
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,327
There's gonna be a lot of people
in there that used to hate me.

106
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:51,912
They're not gonna hate you.

107
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,083
San Francisco reads your paper
every day and they love you.

108
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,378
I never dropped smoke bombs
on San Francisco.

109
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,755
Pep rallies, I hated them.

110
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,174
All right. Well, after we're done tonight,

111
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,219
they're gonna rename the gym
just for you.

112
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:08,804
Come on, conquering hero.

113
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,020
Phoebe.

114
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,983
- Hi. Wow, you look great.
- Really? Thanks.

115
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,652
- Well, see you inside.
- Yeah. That would be great.

116
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,406
- Who was that?
- I have no idea.

117
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,492
Well, I didn't expect to see you here,
Miss Halliwell.

118
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,579
Still testing the boundaries
of the criminal justice system, are we?

119
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,291
Hi, Miss Hickock.
No, actually, I'm a columnist now.

120
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,877
I give advice.

121
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,255
On relationships.

122
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,715
I'm sorry, dear.

123
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,467
I just never figured you
for the advice-giving type.

124
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,386
You certainly never took it.

125
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,724
Enjoy.

126
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:56,810
Gym teacher?

127
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,646
How did you know
she was a gym teacher?

128
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,566
All right, lady, let's go in there.

129
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,861
- Show your sordid past a thing or two.
- Yes.

130
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,755
Oh, my God,
everybody's looking at me.

131
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,590
Yeah, that's because
you're a celebrity

132
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,635
and you look fabulous
and they probably all want to be you.

133
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,429
Nice try. I'm an empath, I feel hate.

134
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,474
Phoebe. Phoebe Halliwell.
I can't believe you showed up.

135
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:38,185
- Ramona. Hi.
- You're so skinny.

136
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,896
How'd you stay so skinny?
Who's this?

137
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:44,650
I'm Paige Matthews,
her long lost sister.

138
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,693
Oh, wow, are you famous too?

139
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,904
You look famous. Okay, so,

140
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:54,117
dweeb time, but, since I knew you
when, can I have your autograph?

141
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,913
Oh, yeah, of course.
I usually charge $20 for it.

142
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,998
I think I have a 20 here somewhere.

143
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,708
No, I'm kidding.

144
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,088
I used to do everything Phoebe said.

145
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,632
Remember that night when
you snuck me into the country club

146
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,175
in the trunk of your car?

147
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,510
And then you left me there

148
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:14,263
so that you could go make out
with Todd on the golf course?

149
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,431
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

150
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:20,644
Actually, I'm sorry about a lot
of the tricks we used to play on you.

151
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,312
Tricks?

152
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,607
You made me feel like
part of the gang.

153
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,609
Those were the best times
of my life.

154
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,780
So I think you need to tell me more
about this gang.

155
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,115
What else did she do?

156
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,617
One time she broke into
the principal's office,

157
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,287
just to make out with some guy
on his desk.

158
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,667
See, now, I remember that it was you
that broke into the principal's office

159
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,128
and I just tagged along out of curiosity.

160
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,506
- Where's Paula?
- She's around, somewhere.

161
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,466
This is so awesome.

162
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:55,179
It's like the gang's all
back together again. Well, almost.

163
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,805
Oh, yeah. Where's the ringleader?

164
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:59,516
Rick, good old Rick. Where is Rick?

165
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,352
I heard he got picked up
for a liquor-store robbery.

166
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,105
Oh, my God, are you kidding?
Did he do it?

167
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:08,150
I only know what I read in your paper
and I read everything you write.

168
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,652
Thanks. I'm flattered.

169
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,865
- So, what are you doing now?
- I'm a personal-injury lawyer.

170
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,701
That sounds interesting.

171
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,494
Well, it's not.

172
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,955
But it's legal, just barely.

173
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,832
It pays the mortgage.

174
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,210
I miss the fun we used to have.

175
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,046
Yeah, me too.

176
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:33,008
Todd. There you are, sweetie.

177
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,178
Oh, and there you are.

178
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,472
I was wondering if
you had the nerve to show up.

179
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,100
- What do you mean, "nerve"?
- Oh, you're the talk of the reunion.

180
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,728
You know, you can fool San Francisco
with your pithy advice,

181
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,063
but you can't fool us.

182
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,191
We all know you, sweetie.

183
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,193
- That's enough.
- What does that mean?

184
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,694
It means you're a fake.

185
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,155
The only thing you
were ever known for

186
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,616
was lying and ditching
and stealing boyfriends.

187
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,077
Phoebe, are you gonna let
somebody

188
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,830
with a giant helmet that passes
for hair talk to you like that?

189
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:06,416
God, Paula, just because
Todd had a thing for Phoebe,

190
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,835
you don't have to be so mean.

191
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,712
I'm not being mean,
I'm doing her a favour.

192
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,091
To the rest of the world,
you might be "Ask Phoebe,"

193
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:17,761
but to us, you'll always be Freebie.

194
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,891
You okay?

195
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,356
Hey.

196
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,817
Let's dance.

197
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:38,240
Hey, why didn't you just tell that chick
to go screw herself?

198
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:41,618
Phoebe?

199
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,745
Okay, what just happened?

200
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,205
- You tell me.
- I have no idea.

201
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:49,418
I was just standing here, and then I
had some weird high school flashback.

202
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,920
Yeah, your whole body
just flashed back.

203
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,380
What, are you kidding me?

204
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,549
- I just felt...
- Pissed?

205
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,802
- Very.
- Well, as someone who's seen Carrie,

206
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,638
both versions,
I'd say the reunion is over.

207
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,977
So we're close?

208
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:08,645
Yeah. You're awesome, Grandpa.

209
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,856
Did you hear that?

210
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,026
- Awesome.
- Yeah, after the event happened,

211
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,612
- we got really close.
- What event?

212
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,407
- I can't tell you.
- Is this event my fault?

213
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,492
Is that why you're treating me
like a nonperson?

214
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,703
I can't talk about it,
it'll mess with the future.

215
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,414
But you did say I was awesome, right?
You can talk about that?

216
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah. You're the best.
I love hanging out with you.

217
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,253
I gotta admit, I'm a little surprised.
I mean,

218
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,589
it's no secret
I wasn't the greatest dad.

219
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,842
It means a lot to me that
I could do something to make up for it.

220
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,886
- You do.
- After the event.

221
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,846
- Right.
- That you won't tell me about.

222
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:46,475
- I told you. I can't talk about it, okay?
- Hey.

223
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,894
Don't talk to your mother like that,
okay?

224
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,354
You're right.

225
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,523
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,652
Piper?

227
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,239
Hey, what's going on?

228
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,492
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

229
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,994
Okay, I hate to cut this reunion short.

230
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,996
I think you've had enough
of those for today.

231
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,707
You go upstairs
till we figure this out.

232
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,376
Bye, Daddy.

233
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,003
What happened?

234
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,340
Well, you've heard of
recapturing your youth.

235
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,509
I think Phoebe's youth
is trying to capture her.

236
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,344
- Explain.
- I don't know.

237
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,264
One minute she was normal.
The next, it's like she's Freaky Phoebe.

238
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,015
- Great, who else saw?
- No one.

239
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,309
She changed back
before anyone noticed.

240
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,228
I'm having a little trouble
keeping up here.

241
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,022
Phoebe's being chased
by what, demons?

242
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,400
Maybe inner demons
or a spell gone wrong.

243
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:37,651
It seemed to happen after

244
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,529
someone named Paula Marks
called her "Freebie."

245
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,073
Oh, yeah, that'll do it.

246
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:46,243
You want to go upstairs and check
the Book, see if there's anything?

247
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,703
- Okay.
- You two go ahead.

248
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,747
I need to get back to the scabber
demons before they know I'm missing.

249
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,709
Hey, wait. What, and leave your
awesome grandpa alone?

250
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,962
Grab a sandwich, grab a beer,
get an answer.

251
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,508
Cubans?

252
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,181
I am not that person anymore.

253
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,475
I am not, so whatever you think
you're doing or...

254
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,276
What is happening to me?

255
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,451
Hello? This is Phoebe, I think.

256
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,245
Hey. Where did you go?
Are you okay?

257
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,040
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

258
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:35,542
Listen, I'm sorry about Paula.

259
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,462
It always burned her up.
You know, you and me together.

260
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,256
- Yeah. Hey, listen...
- You know, the only reason I came

261
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,509
to this thing was because of you.

262
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:45,761
Hoping I'd see you again.

263
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,932
- You there?
- Yeah.

264
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:53,018
I need to ask you a question.

265
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,021
Was I really a...

266
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:00,859
A different person
when you knew me?

267
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,486
Different?

268
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,155
- How do you mean?
- You know, what Paula said.

269
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:08,367
Phoebe, we were kids.

270
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,619
You know, we were young,
we were dumb,

271
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,496
we didn't let anything
stand in our way.

272
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:14,039
Yeah, I remember.

273
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,791
I don't know about you, but I miss it.

274
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,795
When was the last time you were wild?
You know, really wild?

275
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,673
- The way we used to be.
- Actually,

276
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,803
- quite recently, to tell you the truth.
- Who is that? Who are you talking to?

277
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,054
Is this Freebie?

278
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:34,393
You bet your ass.
And I'm coming to get you, bitch.

279
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:54,037
Sorry, bad idea.

280
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,167
It's cool. It's just... It's strong.

281
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,544
I was just trying to help us
bond a little, you know.

282
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,254
We don't need help, we're cool.

283
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:07,342
In the future. But I haven't
been there yet, you know.

284
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,803
I'm feeling a little out of sync here.

285
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,223
Well, you hungry?
Do you want to grab a bite?

286
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:16,602
Yeah, yeah, that would be
great. Just...

287
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,687
- Let me change first, okay?
- Okay.

288
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:25,235
Listen. About those things,

289
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,821
you might want to pick up
a different habit,

290
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,199
to avoid any future problems,
if you know what I mean.

291
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,870
Oh, gee.

292
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,788
Thanks for the tip.

293
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,976
Phoebe.

294
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,896
Phoebe?

295
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,398
When you said you were feeling wild,
you weren't kidding.

296
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,401
What happened?
Your hair, your clothes...

297
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,447
Oh, my God!

298
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,115
Get off him.

299
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,161
This isn't high school, Phoebe.

300
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,913
They are married now.

301
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,498
And what the hell are you thinking?

302
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,083
No, no, no. Let her go.

303
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,003
Todd's a personal-injury attorney
and I have a hundred witnesses here.

304
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,215
I'm sure "Ask Freebie"
has very deep pockets.

305
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,801
Yeah, well, I'd rather be rich
than a bitch.

306
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,894
What the hell was that?

307
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:44,398
I have no idea, but that was so cool.

308
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,652
The past is the future
And the future is the past

309
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,738
Let's welcome back
The senior class

310
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,618
- Now, that's more like it.
- Come on.

311
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,969
Oh, my God.

312
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,644
I haven't felt this way since...

313
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,938
Homecoming game,
underneath the bleachers.

314
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,773
Yeah, the crowd cheering.

315
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:29,943
How did you make this happen?

316
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,653
Magic.

317
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,780
- I think I'm a witch.
- A witch, huh?

318
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,825
How come I'm not scared of you?

319
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:40,329
Because you're under my spell.

320
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,798
Phoebe?

321
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,467
Phoebe?

322
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:04,102
- Hello?
- Okay, I found Phoebe.

323
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:07,105
I have good news
and I have bad news.

324
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,191
- Give me the good.
- Well,

325
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,318
I now know what Phoebe was like
as a teenager.

326
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,197
- That's also the bad news.
- How bad is it?

327
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,533
In a word...

328
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:20,869
...bad.

329
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,457
Let's get out of here.

330
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,460
Phoebe?

331
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,463
Phoebe.

332
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,757
Hey, wait for me.

333
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,475
- So where are we going, guys?
- Anywhere.

334
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,644
I don't care.
I just don't want this night to end.

335
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,688
The night is young.

336
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,781
I can't get busted.

337
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,616
Don't worry,
I'm gonna get us out of here.

338
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,326
You want to steal a cop car?

339
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,912
Not steal, borrow.

340
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,500
Yeah, great idea. Let's go.

341
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,548
Phoebe!

342
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,812
What is the "gigot"?

343
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:33,358
The gigot is your choice,
leg of lamb or mouton.

344
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,903
Mutton.

345
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,781
What is that, meat?

346
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,784
Yes, meat. It comes from a sheep,
you know.

347
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,622
Why don't you just bring us
a couple of steaks, please.

348
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,416
Medium. Thank you.

349
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,295
Sorry, I thought you might like
a fancy meal.

350
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:55,088
Why?

351
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,465
Trying to live up to my rep.

352
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,884
With cigars and mouton?

353
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,094
Sorry, Grandpa,
that's not how you did it.

354
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,096
- Did I take you to the batting cages?
- No.

355
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,389
- Strip clubs?
- God, no.

356
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:05,641
What did I do?

357
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:09,394
You gotta tell me
because I am crashing here.

358
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,231
Nothing, you just...

359
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,150
We talked.

360
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,909
Look, we should just get back.

361
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:26,245
I'm undercover with demons
who'll be looking for me.

362
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,956
No, no, no. Wait. Let's talk.

363
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,458
We need to talk.

364
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,586
Piper asked you here to find out
what's wrong with me, right?

365
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,965
She just wants to know why
she's such a terrible mother.

366
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,092
She what? No, no.

367
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,844
She's great.

368
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,388
Well, then why are you treating her
like she doesn't exist?

369
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,433
Chris.

370
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:51,436
If what we do is talk...

371
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,064
...talk to me.

372
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:00,362
Because she doesn't exist
in my future, okay?

373
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,740
She dies when I turn 14.

374
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:13,041
That's the event?

375
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,795
How?

376
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:19,423
I can't, all right.
I've already said way too much.

377
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,216
The point is,

378
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:24,261
after I save Wyatt,
I have to go back to where she isn't.

379
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:27,222
I can't get close to her,
because I don't want to lose her again.

380
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:29,892
Maybe that's all the more reason
to get close to her.

381
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:47,451
Proving once again
that we are smarter than the cops.

382
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:49,328
Can I play with the siren now?

383
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:53,332
No, I'm cleaning the fingerprints.
We've gotta ditch the car here.

384
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,625
Hey, what's the rush?

385
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,962
The coast is clear, the night is young,
and so are you.

386
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:03,592
Guys, I'm not gonna crawl in the trunk
again so you two can make out.

387
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,513
Hey, we could TP Gabby Fernandez's
house, how about that?

388
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,557
- How about lame?
- Yeah, I have to agree.

389
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,059
This is a special night.

390
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,269
We need imagination.

391
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:17,064
Hey, Rick always said
he had imagination.

392
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,399
That's exactly what I was thinking.

393
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,193
This is reunion night.

394
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,736
Let's get the gang back together.

395
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:25,197
Yeah, but Rick's locked up
in county.

396
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:28,492
- So?
- So the jail's closed.

397
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,620
Well, just think of me as your
get-into-jail-free card.

398
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:34,581
- You want to break in?
- Just to say hi.

399
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:36,250
It's something to do, right?

400
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,585
Right.

401
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:44,174
Damn it, I thought I had her.
She's on the move again.

402
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,677
Well, we better find her soon
because we're gonna need her

403
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,720
if those scabber demons
come after Chris.

404
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,974
I can't believe I let him go out
with Dad. What was I thinking?

405
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,559
Honey, you weren't thinking.

406
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:56,103
You were actually feeling,
which is allowed in this family.

407
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,734
You're okay.

408
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,279
Who says I'm okay?

409
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:07,990
Don't worry, you'll get used to orbing
in the future.

410
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:09,950
I thought something
might have happened.

411
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:11,994
No, we're fine. We just talked.

412
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:15,372
Really, I'm fine.

413
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:19,251
Yeah. Well, Phoebe's not. She's out
running around with her old gang.

414
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,587
- She's not downstairs?
- No, she's out the window.

415
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,422
Even worse,
she's under the influence.

416
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,507
- Of alcohol?
- No, adolescence.

417
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:27,926
She stole a cop car as a prank.

418
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:29,595
That's not a prank, it's a felony.

419
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,014
Well, teen Phoebe also happens
to have her adult powers

420
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:35,100
and she cast a spell
on her entire reunion class.

421
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:36,351
- What?
- Don't worry.

422
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,812
Paige was able to reverse it all, but...

423
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,316
Hey, hey.

424
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,153
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm just a little lightheaded.

425
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,030
Sorry.

426
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:50,199
You know, about me.

427
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:54,119
Must have been
some hell of a talk there.

428
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:57,748
Yeah.

429
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:00,542
Better get off your feet, honey.
Come on.

430
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:02,461
We need to stop Phoebe

431
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:05,172
before she gets into some trouble
that we can't get her out of.

432
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,799
I'm trying. She keeps moving,
she keeps moving.

433
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,344
I got her.

434
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,479
Glass.

435
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:29,988
Get back.

436
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:37,454
Icky stuff.

437
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:44,920
"Icky stuff"?

438
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,381
It worked.

439
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:50,592
Here.

440
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:56,014
Sorry about all this.

441
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,724
It's okay, kids are messy.

442
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,935
- They'll be back.
- And we'll handle it.

443
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:06,567
Any idea how we're
gonna find Phoebe now?

444
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:15,701
You're not my lawyers.

445
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:19,913
Well, Mr. Gittridge, we're here
at the request of your public defender.

446
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:22,916
- May I call you "Rick"?
- No.

447
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:26,420
You don't look like much
of a defence team to me.

448
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,881
Sit down, Gittridge.

449
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,465
Mr. Gittridge,

450
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:33,135
did you at one time provide

451
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:38,473
Phoebe Halliwell with a smoke bomb
during a school assembly?

452
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:42,269
All right, what is this?

453
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:49,943
Hey, stay away from me.

454
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,781
Jeez...

455
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,575
Chill out, Rick. It's us.

456
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,994
- We just came by to say hi.
- Hi.

457
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:09,463
What the hell's going on?
How did you guys do that?

458
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,590
Wait, are you crazy or just stupid?

459
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,675
- No, tell me how you did that.
- It's Phoebe.

460
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:16,803
She does things like magic.
But for real.

461
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:23,310
We'll see how real.

462
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:25,646
This isn't supposed to happen.
It's a prank.

463
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,481
We just came to say hi.

464
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,775
You want me to use my magic
to get you out of here?

465
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:31,527
Oh, I know you are.

466
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:34,530
Only way you're
getting out of here too.

467
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,615
In for a penny, in for a pound.

468
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,992
Let's go.

469
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:52,089
All clear.

470
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,932
Sweet.

471
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,185
What is this?
Is this a spell or something?

472
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,479
Or something.

473
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:11,525
I never believed in much of anything
before, but I am a believer now.

474
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,735
Whatever, have a good life.
Come on, you guys.

475
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:16,196
No, wait, wait.
Don't get all attitudinal on me.

476
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:18,949
It's not like we did anything
wrong here, guys.

477
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:20,826
Rick, you hit a cop.

478
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:22,578
That was an accident.

479
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,372
You guys had me so freaked out
with that magic trick,

480
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:27,249
I didn't know what was going on.

481
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,626
He does have a point, Phoebe.

482
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:31,295
- Yeah.
- Don't buy into his crap.

483
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:33,005
He made us break him out of prison.

484
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:37,384
That was justice.
You guys, I never hit no liquor store.

485
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:40,345
I mean, I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

486
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:42,306
You expect us to believe that?

487
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,141
I'm being straight with you.

488
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:45,809
You guys, you know me.

489
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:48,437
Yeah, I'm a troublemaker,
I'm not an armed robber.

490
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,606
- Could have fooled me.
- I grabbed the shotgun

491
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,316
to scare you, okay.

492
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:55,235
I was desperate to get out of there,
to be with you guys.

493
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:57,362
I'm one of you.

494
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:03,035
- What do you think, Phoebe?
- He's capable of hurting people.

495
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,786
That's what I think.

496
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:06,997
I vote we let him stick with us.

497
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:11,376
Just doesn't seem right
to leave him out.

498
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,254
That's two out of three, babe.

499
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:18,175
Guess we're all back together again.
Isn't this great?

500
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,890
The crystals should protect you.

501
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:28,101
They won't be able to find you
as long as you stay in the attic.

502
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:29,478
You sure about that?

503
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:31,647
Well, I'm pretty sure.

504
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,733
Okay. Well, you and Wyatt
need to go someplace safe.

505
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,071
- I'm gonna go get him.
- No, you're not leaving this room.

506
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,614
- What about you?
- What about me?

507
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:42,783
I have to stay here and help Paige
summon Phoebe.

508
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,993
I'm part witch, remember?
I can help Paige do that.

509
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:47,913
You can't vanquish the demons
if they come and attack again.

510
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,374
- Well, I can try.
- Listen to your mother, Chris.

511
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,292
What if something happens to her?

512
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,253
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

513
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,758
Unless you know something
that I don't.

514
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,928
Nothing's gonna happen
to you, honey.

515
00:30:04,221 --> 00:30:05,889
Not now.

516
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:10,853
So when?

517
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:13,564
Chris?

518
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:15,440
Is that what you've been living with,

519
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,109
knowing that something happens
to me?

520
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:21,572
I see.

521
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:26,201
Well, does it happen soon?

522
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,953
I can't tell you that.

523
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,497
It could change the future
in even worse ways.

524
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:32,124
Right.

525
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,294
But isn't that why you came here
in the first place?

526
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:37,629
To make the future better?

527
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:40,007
How do you know you haven't
already changed mine?

528
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:41,884
She's got a point.

529
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:46,221
Well, whatever it is, it obviously doesn't
happen until you're born,

530
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:49,308
so save it, got it?

531
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:51,351
I got it, Mom.

532
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:02,362
And then, while I keep Miss Hickock
busy on the telephone,

533
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:05,532
you three creep up to her house
and egg her car.

534
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:08,452
I haven't egged a car in years.
I get first shot.

535
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:09,661
Pull it together.

536
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,955
You're acting like
you're still in high school.

537
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:14,500
Because they are. I cast a spell.

538
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,628
Okay, that explains so much.

539
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:20,672
Listen, I picked up a tip today
in lockup,

540
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,883
and I got a better idea
what we can do tonight.

541
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,384
Knock off another liquor store?

542
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:25,761
No.

543
00:31:25,928 --> 00:31:27,221
An armoured car.

544
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,140
You're joking, right?

545
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,726
No, he's not joking.
He's psycho, look at him.

546
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:36,563
You're wrong. Look, I would have
never even considered it before.

547
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,565
But we got magic now, right?

548
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:41,068
I mean, we can pull this off.

549
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:43,070
An armoured car, huh?

550
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,948
A little bit big league,
don't you think?

551
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:50,202
That's right, we're not kids anymore.
We gotta think about our futures.

552
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:51,912
What do you say? Ramona, you in?

553
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:54,873
I don't know.

554
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:56,875
I don't want to go to jail.

555
00:31:57,042 --> 00:32:00,087
Listen, we're not gonna get caught.
We got Phoebe, all right.

556
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:02,840
Now, we need a majority vote here.
So, what do you say?

557
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,717
No.

558
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,010
I want to go home.

559
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:10,222
You're not going anywhere.

560
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:12,724
In for a penny, in for a pound,
remember?

561
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,227
The cops aren't after us,
they're after you.

562
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:20,899
She's right.

563
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:25,404
Come on, guys,
let's get out of here.

564
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,073
It's over.

565
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:36,373
Nothing's over until I say it's over.

566
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:43,213
What's going...?
What are you doing?

567
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:45,757
I kill demons every day.
You think I'm afraid of you?

568
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,217
Stay right there.

569
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:57,477
Honey, you okay?

570
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,646
No, I'm not.
You have to send me back.

571
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:01,148
You're not a teenager anymore.

572
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:03,192
Very good, Paige.
Now, please, send me back.

573
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,443
We need the power of three

574
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,320
to vanquish the demons
that are after Chris.

575
00:33:06,487 --> 00:33:08,947
No, it's gonna have to wait.
There are innocents in danger.

576
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:11,200
- Well, what if you revert back?
- I won't.

577
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:15,496
Look, there's a crazy man with a
shotgun. Now, please send me back.

578
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,627
Todd. Todd!

579
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,838
- Are you okay?
- You go to the cops?

580
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:27,883
No, I didn't. I swear.

581
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:31,887
- Where's Ramona?
- Somewhere safe.

582
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:34,932
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I got nervous when you took off.

583
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,976
I didn't know where you went,
so I decided I need a little leverage.

584
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:40,687
- Where is she?
- Don't take a tone with me, Pheebs.

585
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:42,981
All right? Not if you wanna
see your friend again.

586
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,109
She's locked up tight. Now,
if you want her to keep breathing,

587
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:48,487
you're gonna do what I say.

588
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,990
Don't you just love reunions?

589
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:07,548
They should be passing by any minute.
You stop up there.

590
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:09,633
You don't have to do this.
You have a choice.

591
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:12,719
A choice? Here's my choice.

592
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:16,181
Freedom with money to burn
or life in prison.

593
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,599
You won't get life.

594
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,103
Maybe not, but I'll get
30 to 40 years.

595
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,272
That robbery was my third strike.

596
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:26,400
So you did do it?

597
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,069
Yeah. But you knew that.

598
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:31,363
Even before you got all grown up.

599
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,699
Don't to this, Rick.

600
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,869
Don't make things worse than
they are. Tell me where Ramona is.

601
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,788
When I get what I want,
she'll go free.

602
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:41,957
Except guys like you
never get what they want.

603
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:45,294
Well, not for lack of trying,
that's for damn sure.

604
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,172
I got a feeling this time
it's gonna be different.

605
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,882
I've got magic on my side.

606
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,509
- God, what happened to you?
- Me?

607
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:55,846
What happened to you?
You're the one who changed.

608
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:58,765
You got all... different.

609
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,144
Yeah, I did.

610
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:05,439
Go.

611
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:12,863
We're gonna do this
just like I said,

612
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,531
then you're gonna give me
a new face.

613
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:17,576
And not one of them lawyer faces
you used. Something new.

614
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:19,453
Or Ramona dies. Are we clear?

615
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:25,709
Okay.

616
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:30,047
Go, go, go.

617
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:35,093
I can't guarantee a perfect spell,
you know.

618
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:37,596
What do you mean?
I saw you do magic.

619
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:41,642
No, you saw a hormonal teenage witch
with no fear of consequences.

620
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:46,188
Leave the consequences to me.

621
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:54,655
Go, now.

622
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:58,659
Make them see what cannot be
Flames that leap to make them flee

623
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,208
Oh, my God, he's on fire.

624
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,086
- Wasn't that the idea?
- No.

625
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:12,130
It was just supposed to be an illusion.

626
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:43,620
Now, it wouldn't be the first time
I kill someone.

627
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:50,919
Let's get the money.

628
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,759
Make him hear what isn't there

629
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:00,637
His deepest worries come to bear

630
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:05,767
Damn it. Where'd they come from?

631
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:07,686
I think your time's running out.

632
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:10,731
Let's go, let's go.

633
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,649
Come on.

634
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:19,198
I wish I was asleep.

635
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:20,657
You should sleep.

636
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,409
No, I can't.

637
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:26,371
Not until Phoebe's back
and Chris' demons are vanquished

638
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:30,000
and I accept the fact
that apparently I die young.

639
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:37,049
You know, don't you?

640
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:38,467
When it happens?

641
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:41,845
It's like you said.

642
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:44,932
The future could have changed.

643
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,562
I do know that Chris loves you.

644
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:55,150
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

645
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:58,821
I love you too.

646
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:10,249
Wait here. Wyatt's force field
will protect you.

647
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:12,835
You stay put.
I'm gonna take care of it, okay?

648
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,461
Just keep Chris in the attic.

649
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:17,172
Okay, no more stalling.

650
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:18,841
- Do it.
- Where's Ramona?

651
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:22,386
You think I'm stupid?

652
00:38:22,553 --> 00:38:25,013
I tell you where she is,
I lose my leverage.

653
00:38:25,222 --> 00:38:27,766
- What's going on?
- Who are you?

654
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,560
Don't, she's my sister.

655
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:31,228
Yeah?

656
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:32,646
She a witch too?

657
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:34,773
Yeah, you could say
it runs in the family.

658
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,776
Good. Then maybe she can
give me a new face.

659
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,903
We'd be more than happy
to give you a new face

660
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,613
once you tell us where Ramona is.

661
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:44,074
What the hell.
You're my leverage now, anyway.

662
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:47,035
She's locked in a tank
under the pumping station.

663
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,205
How do we know you're
telling the truth?

664
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:54,501
You don't. Now, my face.
Make it different.

665
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:58,046
Heartbreaking, charming, young.

666
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:06,513
You know, I'm thinking maybe you
should use our nephew for inspiration.

667
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,934
Who you were, you're now another

668
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:12,811
Take the face of Wyatt's brother

669
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:24,948
Yeah. I like it. This will work.

670
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:27,951
Phoebes, watch out.
This could get messy.

671
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:50,015
You okay?

672
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,808
Yeah.

673
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:57,481
You know you had to, right?

674
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,610
I know.

675
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,726
- Hey.
- Hi.

676
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:36,979
How are Todd and Ramona?

677
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:39,398
They're shaky, but they're okay.

678
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:41,608
Yeah? Do they remember anything?

679
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:44,153
No. Once I reversed the spell,
the past was...

680
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,531
- Forgotten?
- Some things are best forgotten.

681
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,324
Yeah, like Freaky Phoebe?

682
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,869
My God, I was such an angry
little teenager, huh?

683
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:54,079
It's good you didn't
have your powers back then.

684
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:58,667
Tell me about it. I'm just glad that's
all behind me, you know.

685
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,380
Still, it's good for me to see you have
a couple of chinks in your armour.

686
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,924
As an older sister,
you're quite a bit to live up to.

687
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,093
- Shut up.
- I swear, dude.

688
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:10,095
- Get out of here.
- I'm telling the truth.

689
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:13,557
I'm all embarrassed now.

690
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:15,142
Next time I ask you to drop by,

691
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:18,145
I promise I will keep
the demonic drama to a minimum.

692
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,564
Yeah, now you know why
I don't come around that often.

693
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:23,692
- Dad.
- Just kidding... sort of.

694
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:28,447
Take care of yourself. You got
a great kid growing inside of you.

695
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:30,449
I look forward to really
getting to know him.

696
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:33,243
I still can't believe you like orbing
in the future.

697
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,537
- Do I live to see that?
- Oh, nice try.

698
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:40,584
Don't worry so much
about the future.

699
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:42,836
Spend time with him
while you can, talk to him.

700
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:44,838
Every moment counts, is that it?

701
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:47,049
Yeah. Something like that.

702
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:51,803
Piper...

703
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:53,639
...be careful.

704
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:12,866
That's nice.
What else do we have in here?

705
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,953
Look, it's a racecar. Do you see it?
