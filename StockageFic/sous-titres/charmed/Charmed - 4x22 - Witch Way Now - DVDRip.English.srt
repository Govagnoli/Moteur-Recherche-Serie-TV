1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,628
Our next caller
is from Rohnert Park, California.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,432
Veronica, honey, tell Tashmin a little,
and I will tell you the rest.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,200
Hey, more "Dear Phoebe" letters.
Where do you want them?

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,873
You can just put them anywhere.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,269
Maybe we ought to keep
some of these in storage?

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,670
- No, I'll get to them.
- All of them?

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,310
- Yes. I am on a roll.
- More like on a mission.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,072
Hey, will you get these
to Elise, please?

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,753
And find out which one
she wants to run.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,592
Yeah, sure. Right away.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,710
You're amazing, you know that?

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,953
What do you mean?

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,111
What is your secret?
Herbs? Acupuncture?

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,794
Do what Tashmin says
and get on with your life.

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,835
Tashmin?

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,757
I take it you don't believe
in psychics?

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,673
You know, if it works for you,
I'm all for it.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,075
It hasn't worked for me for a while.

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,877
You know how sometimes
you just find yourself

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,395
going through a really bad period
in your life?

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,913
Don't even get me started.

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,318
Well, let's just say I'm finally
coming out from underneath mine,

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:11,077
and nobody, nothing will ever
bring me back to that place again.

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,795
Good for you.

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,197
Help me, Phoebe.

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,354
What did you just say?

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,116
I didn't say that.

28
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,112
She did.

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,872
Help me, Phoebe.

30
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,038
Did they say how much longer
this was gonna go on for?

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,475
Three weeks,
which means three months.

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,914
A little higher.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,555
Well, better hope no demons attack.
That'd be a bust,

34
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,836
especially if one of us
goes flying out the window.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,912
I wouldn't worry about that. There's
so much chaos in the underworld.

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,389
- They're too busy fighting each other.
- I hope it lasts.

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,313
I almost forgot what it's like
to lead a normal life.

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,675
It's gotta go a little higher.

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,194
- I need a ladder.
- Leo, just hover.

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,998
No, no, no.
I don't wanna jinx anything.

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,118
I'd rather we not use magic
unless we absolutely have to.

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,635
- Thank you very much.
- Come on, Piper, relax a little.

43
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,916
Use it or lose it, lady.

44
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,513
Fine.

45
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,117
See, no major disaster struck.

46
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,359
- We have a huge problem.
- You were saying?

47
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,072
- Cole tried contacting me again.
- What, more whisperings?

48
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,798
No, this time he was channelling

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,713
through a TV psychic
while I was at work.

50
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,395
- He sounded so desperate.
- Wait, did anybody else notice?

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,471
My highly suspicious assistant.

52
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,111
How am I supposed
to move on with my life

53
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,714
when I keep being haunted
by his afterlife?

54
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,552
- Leo, what do you think?
- I think

55
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,838
- you need to do something, fast.
- No, I mean how is he holding on?

56
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,271
I don't know.
I guess because he's half demon,

57
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,670
- it must be some kind of astral plane.
- Whatever.

58
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,075
We can't risk him
contacting me again.

59
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,913
I have to figure out a way to get to him
and find out what he wants.

60
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,073
Honey, what he wants is you.
Why else would he be hanging on?

61
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,678
Piper?

62
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,593
Why is Leo frozen?

63
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,278
Well, this is very strange.

64
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,159
Guys, I think you ought
to take a look at this.

65
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,715
So much for not performing
any magic, huh, Piper?

66
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,555
Me? I didn't do that.
I couldn't freeze all that stuff.

67
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,199
But I can.

68
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,759
Who are you?

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,359
I'm the Angel of Destiny.

70
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,671
And I've come to change yours.

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,278
He's not freezing.
Why isn't he freezing?

72
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,237
You're wasting your time.

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,278
I am beyond your powers.

74
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,951
Besides, I pose no threat to you.

75
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,839
Well, forgive us for not believing that,
but the last being we met

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,718
who could freeze time
was a demon.

77
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,110
It's because of a demon
that I've come to see you,

78
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,510
which, in and of itself, is very rare.

79
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,433
We Angels of Destiny
normally don't intervene.

80
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,556
Except in extraordinary situations.

81
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,159
Mozart at age 7.

82
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,479
Michelangelo, Albert Einstein...

83
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,153
...Britney Spears.

84
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,388
I don't understand.

85
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,275
You three have accomplished
something few others ever dream of.

86
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,797
By vanquishing The Source of All Evil,
you have fulfilled your shared destiny

87
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,871
much earlier than anticipated.

88
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,957
Some of us didn't think
you'd ever achieve it,

89
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,839
but that's beside the point.
What's important is you have.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,709
And because of that,
we are offering you a reward.

91
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,190
A chance to chart a new destiny,
one of your own design.

92
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,794
A reward?

93
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,152
You can continue
to remain as you are,

94
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,199
charmed,
vested with all your witchly powers...

95
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,430
...and, of course, demonic burdens.

96
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,829
Or...

97
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,109
Or?

98
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,676
You can choose
to relinquish your magic

99
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,831
and lead normal lives again.

100
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,879
Unencumbered.

101
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,589
Free.
We'd wipe the entire slate clean.

102
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,637
Nobody would ever
come after you again.

103
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,113
- Well, what do you say?
- What do we say? Are you kidding?

104
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,955
You can't just freeze the whole world
and come in here

105
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,829
and drop a bombshell like that
and expect a quick decision.

106
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,077
I don't care who you are.

107
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,716
I don't think you quite grasp
the uniqueness of this opportunity.

108
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,916
No, I'm grasping it.
But that is beside the point.

109
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,833
The least you could do is give us
a little time to think about it.

110
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,589
Think about what? No time needed.

111
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,069
Thanks, but, no, thanks.

112
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,794
Right?

113
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,710
Yeah. Right.

114
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,439
Of course, right.

115
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,352
But, you know,
as long as he's offering,

116
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,272
maybe we should talk about this.

117
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,398
Just talk about it. Over there?

118
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,433
Right over here, please. Now.
Excuse us.

119
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,755
You can't be serious, Phoebe.
You, of all people,

120
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,638
you love being a witch.

121
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,792
- I know I do. But l--
- But what? What has changed?

122
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,190
I don't know,
I became queen of the underworld

123
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,672
and nearly died carrying baby Lucifer.
That's what changed, Paige.

124
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,276
Paige, it's just that we've been
doing this a lot longer than you have.

125
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,759
And I'm not trying to discount

126
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,753
all the good that we've done,
or that we could do.

127
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,959
But at the same time,
I'm not gonna minimize the costs.

128
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,669
Paige, I can't get pregnant
because of what we do.

129
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,756
Punching out demons
just isn't as much fun as it used to be.

130
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,593
So, what are you guys saying?

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,437
She's saying you need some time,
which I'll grant.

132
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,472
But not too much time.

133
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,598
After all, other people's destinies
are tied to yours.

134
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,356
And since it's your charmed destiny
that's at stake here, majority will rule.

135
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,318
Two sisters will decide
the fate of all three.

136
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,038
So consider your choice wisely.

137
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,835
Perhaps what happens next
will help you to decide.

138
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,872
Hey, did you just freeze me?

139
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,675
- No, dear, the Angel of Destiny did.
- Who?

140
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,957
Yeah, you better check with the Elders
and make sure he's for real.

141
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,348
I'm not kidding.

142
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,393
- Hello?
- Don't talk, just listen.

143
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,353
Darryl? What's wrong?

144
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,994
Apparently, you guys are about
to be put under surveillance.

145
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,877
An FBl agent named Jackman
called me into his offiice today.

146
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,519
He did a search on unsolved cases.

147
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,195
Apparently, your names came up
on way too many witness lists.

148
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,839
What do you mean?
What does he know?

149
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,031
I don't know,
but I'm gonna try to find out.

150
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,637
In the meantime, just lay low.
And whatever you do,

151
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,392
don't use any magic.

152
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,151
So are we screwed?

153
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,676
Maybe, but that would take destiny
out of our hands,

154
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,637
and I don't think
that's what the angel meant.

155
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,360
Okay, ix-nay on the angel-nay talk.

156
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,112
Let's go upstairs. Come on.

157
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,192
I still don't understand
how coming up here is gonna help.

158
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,555
Actually, it's pretty simple.

159
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,878
So you guys
have been home all day, right?

160
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,519
Yeah. So?

161
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,229
There's no way he would have had
time to bug the inside of the house.

162
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,198
He's gotta be listening
from the outside.

163
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,399
Is it ironic that here we are
presented with the opportunity

164
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,950
to give up our powers, and now
we suddenly can't even use them?

165
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,759
Except not using our powers
doesn't necessarily mean

166
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,753
that we won't be exposed.
We still have Cole to worry about.

167
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,633
Phoebe, you can't make contact
with a dead demon husband.

168
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,950
Yeah, but if I don't, he will.
And then what?

169
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,232
The FBl is outside,
and if they find out about us,

170
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,029
it's gonna be the same thing as last
year. We don't want that, now, do we?

171
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,431
So I'm gonna cast
the "To Find a Lost Love" spell.

172
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,468
I mean, if Cole's soul
is on some astral plane,

173
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,278
it should astral me there, right?

174
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,069
Are you sure he even has a soul?

175
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,749
Well, what else
would be calling out to me?

176
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,358
Cole needs closure.

177
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,999
And so do l.

178
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,791
We will create a distraction outside

179
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,077
in case your spell inside
creates any fireworks.

180
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,753
Be careful.

181
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,879
- Good.
- Come on through.

182
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,311
Going through.

183
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,631
Come on, man, let's get it moving.

184
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,110
Must we spike the lemonade?
I don't know--

185
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,715
That phone-company van
looks suspicious.

186
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,718
- Why?
- Well, because it wasn't there earlier.

187
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,917
And, besides,
he didn't put out any cones.

188
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,593
That's what you're basing it on?

189
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,031
Well, it's the best that I got, okay?
Now, are you ready?

190
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,509
Why don't you just...to the street?

191
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,956
Because what if somebody
drives around the corner mid...?

192
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,114
Now, you just need to use
some of your God-given magic.

193
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,032
Okay? Go.

194
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,918
Anyone feel like a little cool down?

195
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,158
- Let's go.
- Yeah!

196
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,311
Easy, boys,
there's enough for everyone.

197
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,757
Whither my love
Wherever you be

198
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,277
Through time and space
Take my heart nearer to thee

199
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,316
- Cole.
- What are you doing here?

200
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,879
Nobody's allowed to be here!

201
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,679
Here? Where is here?

202
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,712
We gotta move fast. Come on.

203
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,917
We'll be safe here, but not for long.

204
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,753
We have to keep moving,
or the beast will devour us both,

205
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,319
for eternity.

206
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,990
I knew you'd hear my cries.

207
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,317
- Cole.
- It's all right.

208
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,270
You did the right thing.
The Source is gone, devoured.

209
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,315
This is the wasteland,
where all vanquished demons end up.

210
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,996
The beast feeds on their essence...

211
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,434
...their powers.

212
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,833
So, what are you doing here?

213
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,599
Holding on to our love.

214
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,950
I'm a demon with a soul, Phoebe.

215
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,832
It's rather unique to the cosmos.

216
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,516
That's why my soul's been able
to cling here, keep from moving on.

217
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,957
Oh, but that's not healthy.

218
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,355
Everyone has to move on, you know,
sooner or later.

219
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,833
Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say,
you'll get to go to the good place. Me...

220
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,393
Over here. Come on.

221
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,918
Okay, you know, you can't keep
running from that thing forever.

222
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,877
That's why I've been calling you.

223
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,838
You can help save me. Save us.

224
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,630
- How?
- Get Leo to get the Grimoire.

225
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,314
That resurrection spell
that the wizard was after,

226
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,551
you can use that to resurrect me.

227
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,353
What?

228
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,717
It's easy. I'll walk you through it.
All you have to do is...

229
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,993
What's the matter?

230
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,869
I can't use dark magic again.

231
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,393
I won't.

232
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,516
Not even for us?

233
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,479
Phoebe!

234
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,474
- Hold me!
- Help me!

235
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,638
- Your powers!
- I don't have any powers!

236
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,514
Phoebe.

237
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,431
What's the matter?
What happened?

238
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,831
- Something's hurting her.
- Something is killing her!

239
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,352
Paige, here, reversal spell.

240
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,397
Return thy love
Wherever she be

241
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,798
Through time and space
Bring her back...

242
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,149
It's okay. You're okay.

243
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,759
Oh, my God.

244
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,956
What was I thinking?

245
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,348
I hope the freeze didn't wear off.

246
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,433
Agent Jackman, FBl.

247
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,394
We should talk.

248
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,035
In case you're wondering,
that's just a copy.

249
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,750
Nice way to engender trust,
Agent Jackman.

250
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,468
If I wanted to expose you,
I could have done that six months ago

251
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,278
when that file first crossed my desk.

252
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,879
Expose us as what?

253
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,115
Witches.

254
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,593
It's the only logical explanation
for all the unsolved cases,

255
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,991
the missing persons,
the mysterious deaths.

256
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,038
Prove it.

257
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,834
- Something's hurting her.
- Something is killing her!

258
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,672
Paige, here, reversal spell.

259
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,671
Return thy love
Wherever she be

260
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,070
Through time and space
Bring her back to me

261
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,671
That doesn't prove anything.

262
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,913
No, but it implies everything,
especially when coupled with that file.

263
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,150
You think your newspaper
wouldn't run that story?

264
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,790
- What do you want?
- Believe it or not, your help.

265
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,919
See, I specialize
in occult-style slayings.

266
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,436
That's why I was watching you,
in hopes of catching a serial killer.

267
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,113
A witch-hunter.

268
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,919
All right, I've heard enough
of this nonsense.

269
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,351
Wait a second, he froze before.

270
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,634
This time, I was prepared.

271
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,080
Like I said, I specialize in this stuff.

272
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,953
Supposed to be only a few
of these amulets left in the world.

273
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,395
Got this one
off the witch-hunter we're after.

274
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,034
Her name is Selena.

275
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,838
I traced her genealogy
all the way back to the witch trials.

276
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,638
I think killing you people
is in her blood,

277
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,234
it's what she lives for. I mean,
why else would she have burned

278
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,789
her last three victims at the stake?

279
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,792
Why are you telling us this?

280
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,269
Well, because I thought
you were gonna be her next victims.

281
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,715
But now that I know who you really are
and what you can do,

282
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,950
I need you to help me find her
before she kills again.

283
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,754
- Do you have any idea where she is?
- I did for a while.

284
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,514
I had her in custody once,
but she got away.

285
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,194
These are some
of Selena's personal belongings.

286
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,715
Now, from what I know,
if you use your powers on them,

287
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,189
you might be able to find her.
Now, you do that,

288
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,510
I'll make sure those files
disappear forever.

289
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,878
You don't...
Well, you figure it out.

290
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,158
Call me.

291
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,675
- I don't trust him.
- Gee, you think?

292
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,400
Maybe we should take
the Angel of Destiny up on his offer.

293
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,232
Great, so we'd be free
and so would Selena,

294
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,038
who, for all we know,
could be a warlock.

295
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,111
No, warlocks don't burn
witches at the stake,

296
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,032
- they just steal their powers.
- Exactly.

297
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,873
Powers, Phoebe, the very things
we were given to do good with.

298
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,912
Remember?

299
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,517
- Yeah, Paige, I remember.
- Guys...

300
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,875
Do you really,
or has all that dark magic

301
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,315
just kind of gotten into your brain?

302
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,629
Guys!

303
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,995
I can't believe you're so willing
to throw away our powers.

304
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,230
Paige, you don't know the hell
that I've been through.

305
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,719
- You didn't live it.
- Oh, really?

306
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,269
I was just turned into a vampire,
and then I was shrunk,

307
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,396
and then we switched bodies and--

308
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,516
Okay, imagine going through that
for years.

309
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,038
- All I'm asking is for my life back.
- Okay, guys, enough!

310
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,111
We need to focus.

311
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,240
What about you, Piper,
what do you think?

312
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,075
I think we need to see this through
like the angel suggested.

313
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,310
So, Paige...

314
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,473
...you are gonna go up to the attic
and get started on this stuff.

315
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,393
We will meet you there. Scoot.

316
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,235
Leo! You can orb. It's all right.

317
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,789
- What about the FBl agent?
- He already busted us.

318
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,916
But, supposedly,
all he wants is our help.

319
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,877
Find anything out
about the Angel of Destiny?

320
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,317
He's legit, and so is his offer.

321
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,919
Okay, can you do us a favour
and go get Darryl

322
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,470
and make sure
that Agent Jackman is legit too?

323
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,790
And, meanwhile,
we have a witch-hunter to find.

324
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,877
Don't ask, just go.

325
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,190
- Having a crappy day?
- Yeah.

326
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,470
- Cole?
- Yeah.

327
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,032
Phoebe.

328
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,108
You don't want his powers.
You want me!

329
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,357
Here I am. Come and get me!

330
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,398
Come on! Hurry up, end this!

331
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,517
This could be good.

332
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,314
"Before the flame subsides,

333
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,074
Iet wax from the candle drip
onto the crystal.

334
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,074
Once consecrated, scry with
the crystal for the one who is sought."

335
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,393
Ain't magic grand?

336
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,639
Okay, bye.

337
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,558
That was Morris. He confirmed
that there is a serial killer on the loose

338
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,757
- doing exactly what Jackman said.
- We're all over it.

339
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,629
He also said that Jackman has more
information on us than he shared,

340
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,916
including our genealogy.

341
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,355
Dating all the way back
to Melinda Warren.

342
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,880
- What does that mean?
- They're gonna keep checking.

343
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,758
It means he's gone through
a lot of trouble

344
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,480
to get as much information on us
as possible.

345
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,790
I got a bad feeling
he's not gonna let us off the hook

346
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,190
so easily after this is all over.

347
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,271
What, he's just gonna
keep using us afterwards?

348
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,874
Great, Charlie's-freaking-Angels.

349
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,235
This just keeps getting
better and better.

350
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,594
Got Selena. Do we still go after her?

351
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,319
Well, we don't have a choice.

352
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,159
We can't let her run around
burning people at the stake.

353
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,272
She has bodyguards.

354
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,833
Lots of bodyguards.

355
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,070
I wonder why Jackman
didn't tell us about them.

356
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,629
Probably figured
we wouldn't help if we knew.

357
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,357
Paige! Did you not have the sense to
sense if anybody else was in the room

358
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,794
before you orbed us in here?

359
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,793
Going somewhere?

360
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,280
We're gonna need some serious
memory dust after all this is over.

361
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,154
Yeah, well, we gotta get out of here.

362
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,754
Phoebe.

363
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,268
Cole.

364
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,557
I swear, he was just there.

365
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,951
Time to go. Orb, orb, orb.

366
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,709
- Where is she?
- In there.

367
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,397
You don't need that.
She's unconscious.

368
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,670
- She put up much of a fight?
- No, but her bodyguards did.

369
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,512
Bodyguards? She had bodyguards?

370
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,398
Yeah, lots of them, with lots of guns,

371
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,710
and they weren't shy
about using them either.

372
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,632
Must have known
we were closing in on her.

373
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,354
Still, don't you think it's odd

374
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,829
that a serial killer
has hired guns protecting her?

375
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,311
Well, maybe she's not
working alone.

376
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,394
Or maybe you're just not telling us
everything.

377
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,828
Maybe I'm not.
What are you gonna do about it?

378
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,231
Well, for one thing, we're not gonna
let you take her without a warrant.

379
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,677
You know, you're all the same.

380
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,036
You think that just because
you have gifts, powers,

381
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,838
that you're above it all.
You're special.

382
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,956
- Well, I know different.
- Oh, really?

383
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,588
Yeah. Your arrogance
is your Achilles' heel.

384
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,159
That's why
witch-hunters and demons

385
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,436
are always after you,
and they always will be.

386
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,556
I wouldn't trade places
with you for the world.

387
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,030
- Here's your warrant.
- So when do we get our files?

388
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,191
When she's in jail,
and I feel I'm safe.

389
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,353
- Safe from what?
- Safe from you.

390
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,632
I don't wanna be another one
of those people

391
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,439
who mysteriously disappear
around here.

392
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,192
I knew he'd never give up those files.

393
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,989
In case anybody is wondering,
we are officially screwed.

394
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,434
Not necessarily.

395
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,353
No. We are not
giving up our powers.

396
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,880
Paige, I don't wanna give up
our powers either,

397
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,315
but I don't wanna give up
our lives even more.

398
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,232
He's just gonna keep using us.

399
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,388
Unless we let the angel
wipe the slate clean.

400
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,798
Look, Paige, we said
we would wait to decide

401
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,269
until this thing played out, and it has.

402
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,113
And frankly, if the angel
hadn't made this offer,

403
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,273
I'd probably think differently.

404
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,512
And I'd think,
"Let's just keep fighting."

405
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,398
But I'm tired of fighting.

406
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,472
And Jackman's right.
It is never-ending.

407
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,430
Unless we end it ourselves.

408
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,472
So do we need to talk to Leo
about this first?

409
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,473
No.

410
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,433
Doesn't have anything
to do with him, it's just us.

411
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,431
And he will understand.

412
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,073
You guys are only seeing the bad.

413
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,958
What about all the wonder
of being witches,

414
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,873
the stuff you introduced me to
in the first place?

415
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,758
You're gonna let all that go?

416
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,798
Paige, it doesn't
balance out anymore.

417
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,436
And after everything that we've lost,

418
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,118
it doesn't seem worth it.

419
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,230
What about all the good we've done?

420
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,868
- Doesn't that count for anything?
- Of course it does.

421
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,156
But that's exactly why we have
this choice to make.

422
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,993
He said we fulfilled our destiny.
We've done it.

423
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,000
This is supposed to be
our reward for that.

424
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,233
Yeah?

425
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,233
Well, pardon me if it doesn't seem
like much of a reward.

426
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,029
Because without being witches...

427
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,235
... I wouldn't have sisters.

428
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,471
Are you sure about this?

429
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,509
Yeah.

430
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,637
As sure as we're ever gonna be.

431
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,075
You understand
this decision is final.

432
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,071
There'll be no changing your minds.

433
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,432
We understand.

434
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,118
Very well.

435
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,429
Hold it! Just so we're clear.

436
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,388
This wipes the entire slate clean,
no "read the fine print" technicalities,

437
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,391
no more demons,
no more vengeful warlocks--

438
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,518
And we won't have to worry
about Agent Jackman anymore

439
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,716
or anyone else who might
have found out we were witches?

440
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,919
Exactly. Just free to lead normal lives
with no demonic aftertaste.

441
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,559
Absolutely.

442
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,559
Will we remember?

443
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,509
Being witches, that is?

444
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,352
You'll remember everything.

445
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,030
This doesn't change your history...

446
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,912
...only your future.

447
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,990
And what about the Book?

448
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,549
It will pass
to some future descendant.

449
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,873
What about Cole?

450
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,395
Will he keep trying
to make contact with me?

451
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,995
I don't know.
I have no control over that.

452
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,989
He exists beyond time and space,

453
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,351
outside destiny's reach.

454
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,832
What is it?

455
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,910
It's just that he's still holding on.

456
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,037
That's why he appeared to me.

457
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,316
So maybe if I could tell him

458
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,438
that I don't have
the power to save him,

459
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,109
then he'll be able
to move on for good.

460
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,513
I don't think that's such a good idea,
considering what happened last time.

461
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,877
I can't leave it like this.

462
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,031
I owe him more than that.

463
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,673
Cole.

464
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,517
I have to talk to you,
but I don't have a lot of time.

465
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,191
- Did you see me come to you?
- Yes. I did.

466
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,557
- How did you do that?
- It's a secret.

467
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,512
I'm giving up my powers.

468
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,999
We all are.

469
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,551
- What?
- I don't have time to explain,

470
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,508
- but it's true, which means--
- I know what it means.

471
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,389
Cole...

472
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,678
...we did the best we could.

473
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,233
We tried every way possible
to make this work, but...

474
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,273
It wasn't meant to be.

475
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,792
And it wasn't because
we didn't love each other.

476
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,636
It's just...

477
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,159
...Iove wasn't enough.

478
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,233
So now we have to move on, okay?

479
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,277
The both of us.

480
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,032
You better go.

481
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,676
Before the beast attacks.

482
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,476
Are you okay?

483
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,913
Yeah.

484
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,199
- Let's do this.
- Well, we've been thinking a little bit...

485
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,879
Are you having second thoughts?

486
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,918
Not about the decision,
unfortunately.

487
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,071
About Jackman and Selena.

488
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,639
Yeah, a lot of things don't add up.

489
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,031
His extensive knowledge of witches,
he got ahold of that amulet...

490
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,634
The fact that he came in alone
to pick up Selena.

491
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,399
The bodyguards.

492
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,790
We just wanna make sure
that we've done the right thing

493
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,712
before it's too late
to do anything about it.

494
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,508
Okay.

495
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,399
Is that okay?

496
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,351
Oh, sure, absolutely.

497
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,474
Frankly, I thought you were being
a bit premature anyway.

498
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,835
Then why didn't you say something?

499
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,116
Can't. Free will, and all.

500
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,109
Let me know when you're ready.

501
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,398
So now what?

502
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,759
Leo?

503
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,033
- We were just coming to get you.
- Why? What did you find?

504
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,112
Another genealogy Jackman has
besides yours.

505
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,232
Well, yeah, we know Selena
is a descendant of witch-hunters.

506
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,833
No, Jackman is.

507
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,436
- Selena is the daughter of a witch.
- What?

508
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,711
She is not a suspect, she's a victim.

509
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,519
They have her in a safe house
because somebody's trying to kill her.

510
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,151
Please tell me we didn't just help
a witch-hunter get a witch.

511
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,196
Oh, my God.

512
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,113
Oh, my God.

513
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,718
Somebody, please help me!

514
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,031
No one can hear you.
Not where we are.

515
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,838
Please don't!

516
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,319
No!

517
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,199
- But I must.
- No! Oh, God.

518
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,396
You see, it's my duty.

519
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,355
It's what I was born to do.

520
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,111
It's what I will continue to do

521
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,512
until every last one of you is dead.

522
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,669
Help!

523
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,832
You're not gonna get away
from me this time, witch.

524
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,991
Help.

525
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,509
You're making a mistake.
I swear, I'm not a witch.

526
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,912
Of course you are, Selena.
It's in your blood.

527
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,957
Your mother was,
that makes you one too.

528
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,078
Please, I'm begging you.

529
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,551
You know why they burned witches
at the stake 400 years ago?

530
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,435
So they would burn forever
in eternal fire.

531
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,716
They used greenwood too,
made it last longer.

532
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,677
Prolong the agony.

533
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,270
No! Help!

534
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,156
Come to save your sister witch,
have you?

535
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,639
Actually, yeah.

536
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,196
You see, I buried the rest
of the amulets around here

537
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,952
in anticipation of your arrival.

538
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,670
Your powers are useless here.

539
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,558
However...

540
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,952
...mine aren't. Move and she dies.

541
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,235
It was his plan all along.
He was gonna kill us anyway.

542
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,039
Hey, how's it feel
to be powerless, huh? Mortal.

543
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,679
You're the scourge of mankind,
a blasphemy!

544
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,432
Burning will be your justice too.

545
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,238
Get Selena!

546
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,116
Help me.

547
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,120
- Piper, the leg!
- Hurry!

548
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,074
What are you doing?

549
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,472
Piper!

550
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,474
Saving her life just cost you yours.

551
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,154
Cole.

552
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,436
I couldn't very well let you die,
now, could l?

553
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,915
- I don't understand, how are you--?
- Here?

554
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,673
Let's just say I picked up
a few powers lately.

555
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,478
Quite a few, actually.

556
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,868
I'm not giving up on us, Phoebe.

557
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,268
Ever.

558
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,989
Paige, you gotta go get the amulet.

559
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,310
- Go, go, go.
- You're gonna be okay.

560
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,159
Okay, okay, a little more.
A little more. That's good.

561
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,435
Here we go.

562
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,429
- Where's Paige?
- She had to park down the street

563
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,591
because the driveway was blocked.

564
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,318
That's ridiculous.
I'll go talk to them,

565
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,311
- tell them to move.
- No, it's not a big deal.

566
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,517
And to think, 24 hours ago,
that was our biggest problem.

567
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,954
How'd it go?

568
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,118
Well, it looks like we got away
with everything so far.

569
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,191
Thanks to Selena testifying for us.

570
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,112
What about
how Agent Jackman died?

571
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,634
They're stumped.

572
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,473
They can't figure out how he shot
himself from 20 feet away.

573
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,433
What are they gonna do,
subpoena Cole?

574
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,477
You guys stopped
one of their own from killing.

575
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,029
- I think they'd be grateful.
- Yeah, one would hope.

576
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,760
At least until they find
those files on us.

577
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,311
They won't.

578
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,439
I sort of orbed them into a volcano.

579
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,679
You what?

580
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,037
Excuse me,
are you allowed to do that?

581
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,073
Well, my job is to protect my charges.
That's all I did.

582
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,438
Thanks.

583
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,990
Maybe, sometime soon,

584
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,470
you won't have to protect your
charges. Are you okay with that?

585
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,390
Whatever you guys decide,
I'll support.

586
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,437
I mean that.

587
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,713
The door's stuck.

588
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,312
It's you.

589
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,472
Well, still ready to retire?

590
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,631
Actually...

591
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,519
... I don't think so anymore.

592
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,718
We saved someone.

593
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,393
And it felt good.

594
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,834
It felt right.

595
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,836
Besides, I got a little taste of what life
would be like without my powers,

596
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,833
and I didn't like it at all.

597
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,474
What about you?

598
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,597
Majority rules, right?

599
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,995
Might as well make it unanimous.

600
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,515
What can I say, we're masochists.

601
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,309
- We are?
- Yeah, sometimes.

602
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,753
But Phoebe's right.

603
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,111
This isn't a choice we have to make.
It's who we are.

604
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,232
You realize you
won't get this opportunity again?

605
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,638
We understand.

606
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,878
Very well.

607
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,399
By the way,
thought you'd like to know,

608
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,472
neither decision
would have affected yours...

609
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,279
...and Leo's personal destiny.

610
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,279
What?

611
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,670
You'll find out soon.

612
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,392
- Oh, my God.
- What?

613
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,198
- Don't you get it?
- What?

614
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,878
Don't you get it?

615
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,473
- She's pregnant!
- Who's pregnant?

616
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,756
- You're pregnant!
- I'm pregnant?

617
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,716
Hi, baby.

618
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,432
Hi, baby.
