1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,150
Paige! Where are you?

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,715
Look out!

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,639
Hurry.

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,190
Claws of pain we have to sever
Demon, you are gone forever

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,750
Sorry to bother you,
but she was immune to my powers.

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,036
That's okay, I was just
getting ready to leave work.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,237
- Oh, honey, you're hurt.
- It's okay. It's just a scratch.

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,789
So how's it going?
How's the new place?

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,155
Great and great.

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,709
- How about you?
- Can't complain.

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,308
Ditto.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,040
Well, it's good to know
that we can live apart

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,589
and still kick some butt
if we have to, right?

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,840
So do I wanna ask about this demon
with the bad manicure?

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,036
A Harpy, part of a faction.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,316
Tried to kill us to move up
in the world, you know.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,629
Pretty standard stuff.

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,279
You wanna stay for dinner?

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,509
I would love to,

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,831
but Cole is planning this whole
romantic thing for us tonight.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,230
Yeah, I just thought, you know,
maybe we could talk.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,277
Why? Are you okay?
Is everything okay?

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,671
Yeah. Everything's fine. I just thought
maybe we could catch up.

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,592
Another time.

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,432
Do you want me to orb you home?

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,513
No. Cole's not so crazy about you
orbing in without calling first.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,750
Except for emergencies, you know?

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,837
- You understand.
- Sure.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,989
Whatever.

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,758
Okay. I'm gonna go.

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,958
I'll call you guys.

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,992
No orbing?

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,435
Don't start
with the suspicions, Paige.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,956
Cole's probably just trying
to protect their privacy.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,230
He's trying to protect something.

36
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,033
I'm just trying to protect our assets.

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,078
And the only way to do that
is to cut our losses,

38
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,196
consolidate our resources.

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,115
Keep the competition
from killing you.

40
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,749
Us.

41
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,036
- Fine, what are you proposing?
- A merger.

42
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,872
Everyone here
has similar agendas, right?

43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,357
So why don't we work together
to accomplish them?

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,031
You're late. Sit down.

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,871
Where was l?

46
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,715
You were just encouraging us
to hold hands and be friends.

47
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,915
It's a new millennium.

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,878
We need to think in new ways
to ensure our own survival.

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,873
Let's face it, it's a
demon-eat-demon world out there.

50
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,349
Each one of you leads a faction.

51
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,274
But that is the problem.

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,635
You're too busy
trying to kill each other.

53
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,314
In the end, everyone loses.

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,516
Tell that to the Grimlocks.

55
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,036
They tried to vanquish us
just last week.

56
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,599
You had it coming.

57
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,512
Care to try again?

58
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,633
My point exactly.

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,514
Infighting has always been
our undoing.

60
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,591
And I have learned
from the humanity in me.

61
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,678
The only way for us to defeat good

62
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,479
is to work together
to achieve common goals.

63
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,435
And who will decide
what these goals are?

64
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,635
You?

65
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,918
Unless someone
wants to challenge me.

66
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,554
Meeting's adjourned.

67
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
Hi, honey. You're home early.

68
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,119
Vegetarian egg-white omelette,
just the way you like it.

69
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,997
That's sweet, honey, but I think
my stomach has other plans.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,639
- What's the matter?
- Headache, upset stomach.

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,758
- It's going around right now.
- So maybe you should call in sick?

72
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,480
While so many relationships
are in peril?

73
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,234
What would San Francisco do
without my advice column?

74
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,432
I gotta go.

75
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,269
I wanna invite my sisters over
for dinner this week.

76
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,715
- Is that okay?
- Well, we just moved out.

77
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,916
Yeah, I know, but I wanna
show them the place.

78
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,834
Besides, I don't want them to think

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,911
that they're not still
part of my life, you know?

80
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,237
Fine, just no orbing, all right?

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,879
Already taken care of.

82
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,753
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing.

83
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,309
My shoulder just got in the way
of a Harpy's claw, that's all.

84
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,277
A Harpy? You got attacked?
Why didn't you tell me?

85
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,351
I didn't think it was that
big a deal. That's why.

86
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,272
Well, it is to me.

87
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,518
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,238
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,872
It's just...

90
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,794
I think I deserve to know
when my wife gets hurt.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,752
You're right. You do.

92
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,829
Excuse me, Mr. Turner?

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,672
Your 9:00 is waiting in the lobby.

94
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,076
Julie, what are you doing here?

95
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,514
You didn't tell me she was here.

96
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,638
Well, we're working
out of the apartment today.

97
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,758
They're painting my office.
You don't mind, do you?

98
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,480
No. No, of course not.

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,479
Make yourself at home.

100
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,118
I will, thank you.

101
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,518
Pretty little witch,
if you're into that sort of thing.

102
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,792
I am.

103
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,519
Get the leader of the Harpies.

104
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,150
I want to explain to her the
consequences of attacking my wife.

105
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,240
You don't really expect me
to wage war on the new Source

106
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,550
without even talking
to him first, do you?

107
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,518
It's a waste of time.
He'll never bring you back from exile.

108
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,837
He's heard the stories
of what you did.

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,719
That was a different time
and a different Source.

110
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,110
Still, it's not going to happen.

111
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,430
I wouldn't be here
if I wasn't sure of that.

112
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,234
Then what makes working for us
any better than working for him?

113
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,550
You ought to listen better.
I don't work for anyone.

114
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,473
We'd be equals, partners.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,834
And once The Source is dead,
we'd go our separate ways.

116
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,478
So?

117
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,949
I'll let you know...

118
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,434
...when I'm ready.

119
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,717
I want you to offer
the new Source an olive branch.

120
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,598
And if he refuses?

121
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,196
Then Keats has a new ally,
and we have a new enemy.

122
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,953
Go.

123
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,909
Plenty of leftovers.

124
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,640
Probably won't have to do
any cooking for a week.

125
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,872
I like to cook.

126
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,194
Well, there's less dishes to do,
and that's a good thing, right?

127
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,473
I guess.

128
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,317
It's just with Phoebe and Cole gone,
it's so quiet around here.

129
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,869
Everybody I grew up with is gone.

130
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,956
Still, we can make it noisy again

131
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,033
with kids, people who will
grow up with us.

132
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,911
We have an extra room now, right?

133
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,559
Right.

134
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,192
Sorry. Am I interrupting?

135
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,078
Actually, I need to get going.

136
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,719
There's an upsurge
in demonic activity

137
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,916
and the Elders wanna
figure out why.

138
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,311
Well, since that demonic activity
spilled into our living room last night,

139
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,471
I'm assuming it has something
to do with us.

140
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,837
Well, keep an eye out, and I'll
let you know if I find anything out.

141
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,910
- I love you.
- I love you too.

142
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,713
You okay?

143
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,359
Me? Yeah, I'm fine.

144
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,713
Liar.

145
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,440
Look, I know I am not Phoebe,
but I am still your sister,

146
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,874
and you can talk to me, you know.

147
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,633
It's-- It's just silly.

148
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,713
My period was late this month
by a couple of days.

149
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,348
And I guess I got
my hopes up a little.

150
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,670
That's not silly, honey.
You want kids, right?

151
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,518
Yeah, of course.

152
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,477
It's just that we've been trying, and--

153
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,996
- For a couple of months.
- Four. But who's counting?

154
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,313
Oh, Piper, you're not
baking cookies, you know?

155
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,471
It's gonna take some time.

156
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,598
Yeah, I know. I guess
I was just worried that,

157
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,751
you know,
something could be wrong.

158
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,118
Getting flung around by demons isn't
exactly conducive to making babies.

159
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,077
Okay, A, you're gonna have kids.
You saw that in your future.

160
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,437
And B, I am living proof
that magic happens

161
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,670
when whitelighters
and witches get together.

162
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,992
So the sooner you stop
worrying about it,

163
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,720
the sooner I will be an aunt.

164
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,472
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

165
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,040
The leader of the Harpies
won't be coming to see you.

166
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,714
I'm afraid things
got out of hand for her.

167
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,513
Nice work.

168
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,069
- What's next?
- Rowan's waiting to see you.

169
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,674
Apparently, the queen
would like in on the new alliance.

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,149
Send him in.

171
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,673
He'll see you now.

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,752
Thank you for the audience.

173
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,278
- The queen sent me to tell you--
- Tell your queen

174
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,712
that if she steps a foot
inside my realm,

175
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,000
she'll beg me to banish her again.

176
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,309
Sent me to tell you
that we've learned our lesson,

177
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,954
and we're willing to serve you.

178
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,192
No, thanks. I already have
enough demons betraying me.

179
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,919
You haven't even heard our offer.

180
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,399
I think you should be leaving now.

181
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,397
- Paige.
- I just thought I'd pop in.

182
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,999
- From where?
- The kitchen.

183
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,516
- I'm not interrupting anything, am l?
- No. We're done here.

184
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,191
Elevator's that way, Rowan.

185
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,671
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

186
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,308
This is exactly why I don't want
you people orbing in here.

187
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,277
You people? Nice.

188
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,998
- What do you want?
- Phoebe.

189
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,912
I think Piper needs to talk to her.

190
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,513
Well, you missed her.

191
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,035
But why don't you orb on over
to the newspaper.

192
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,031
I'm sure those journalists
can keep a secret.

193
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,191
Just tell her I stopped by, okay?

194
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,397
And dare I ask, why is it so dark
in here in the middle of the day?

195
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,310
Migraine, which
you're only adding to.

196
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,674
You know what, Cole, just bite me.

197
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,872
After you.

198
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,272
Nice guy, huh?

199
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,832
Cole.

200
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,870
- You a lawyer?
- No.

201
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,594
Why?

202
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,194
Because only another lawyer
would think that.

203
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,193
No, I was being sarcastic.

204
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,549
About being a lawyer?

205
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,280
No, about thinking
he was a nice guy.

206
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,318
- Sorry.
- No.

207
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,873
- I'm Rowan.
- Paige.

208
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,632
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

209
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,439
- So how long have you disliked Cole?
- Ever since I first met him.

210
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,074
You?

211
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,073
Pretty much just recently,
ever since he married my sister.

212
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,673
Do you have any siblings?

213
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,398
Oh, yeah. My family's real big.

214
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,520
Then you know what it's like
to have to bite your tongue.

215
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,870
Been there, done that.

216
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,152
Listen, I'd like to continue this,
but we've just run out of floors.

217
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,592
Any chance we could get together?

218
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,073
Well, my sister-- My other sister
owns this nightclub called P3.

219
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,800
And I'll be there later
if you wanna stop by.

220
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,950
- I'll drop in.
- Okay.

221
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,075
- Are you coming?
- Oh, no, underground parking.

222
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,112
You're certain of her identity?

223
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,999
She's the sister
of The Source's new bride.

224
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,639
That makes her a Charmed One.

225
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,677
This might be our lucky day.

226
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,718
And you said meeting with
the new Source would be useless.

227
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,393
He refused your offer, didn't he?

228
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,597
Yes, but he gave us something
much more valuable instead.

229
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,796
If we can get
a Charmed One on our side,

230
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,748
we can use her magic to take over
the underworld before The Source can.

231
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,878
We can destroy him
and anyone else who opposes us.

232
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,679
Yeah, but she's a witch.
They don't change sides on a whim.

233
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,638
Oh, I think I can get her
to see things our way.

234
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,673
With your permission, of course.

235
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,349
By all means.
Take whomever you need.

236
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,273
Your mystery man
still pulling a disappearing act?

237
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,158
I can't believe he stood me up.

238
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,117
Well, I'm glad
I'm not dating anymore.

239
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,633
Yeah, well,
I should've known better

240
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,791
than to think I could
meet a guy through Cole.

241
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,750
Paige, I have two words for you:
Broken and record.

242
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,754
If you keep this up, you're just gonna
end up pushing Phoebe further away.

243
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,955
She's right.

244
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,997
- That's more than two words.
- Hi.

245
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,993
Do I still get free drinks here
or do I have to pay now?

246
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,870
You don't look so good.
Are you okay?

247
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,075
That's partly why I'm here.

248
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,629
I thought it was just a bug,
and now I'm not so sure.

249
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,870
So I'm wondering if maybe
it has something to do with,

250
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,393
you know, the scratch.

251
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,039
Maybe you're turning into a Harpy.

252
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,919
Oh, God. Are you?

253
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,072
Well, that's how Piper turned into
a Wendigo. Or is it the Fury?

254
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,073
I've turned into so many things,
I can't keep track.

255
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,356
You know, I wouldn't worry.
You can't turn into a Harpy

256
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,953
just by getting scratched.

257
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,509
Yeah, but still.
Do you mind--? You know.

258
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,669
Hey, hey, hey.

259
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,035
A little discretion in public.

260
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,234
Hey.

261
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,669
- Feel any better?
- A little, I think.

262
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,434
So any word from the Elders
on what's going on?

263
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,955
- No, not yet.
- Why? What's going on?

264
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,395
A lot of bad guys,
apparently, more than usual.

265
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,835
- Should we be worried?
- Nope. Not until after dinner.

266
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,912
- You want to join us?
- Okay, sure. Why not?

267
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,115
I'm not gonna go.

268
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,158
I don't want Rowan thinking
I was waiting for him

269
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,072
if he shows up this late.

270
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,038
God forbid. You buying?

271
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,713
You kidding?

272
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,830
Phoebe, I think you should try
to find a moment to talk to Piper.

273
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,797
- Why, is something wrong?
- No, not really.

274
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,713
I just think she could use
your support about something.

275
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,155
That's why I orbed over
to your place this morning to talk to--

276
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,197
Wait! You orbed to my place?

277
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,272
After I specifically asked you not to?
Paige, what were you thinking?

278
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,873
I was just trying to help Piper.

279
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,996
- Was Cole upset?
- A little.

280
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,039
A lot.

281
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,673
Great, Paige. Just great.

282
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,070
I was just trying to help.

283
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,550
So am I the weirdest case
you've ever seen?

284
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,078
I don't know. I've worked
the night shift for a while now.

285
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,071
Seen some pretty strange things.

286
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,117
Yeah, but these were bats, doc.

287
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,033
Paige! Paige!
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

288
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,873
- What happened?
- Bats. Lots of bats.

289
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,349
- You the sisters?
- Yeah. Is she gonna be all right?

290
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,636
Honestly, if she hadn't been found
by somebody in time,

291
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,119
she might have bled to death.

292
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,679
- But she's gonna be okay?
- Yes.

293
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,400
After some rest and rabies shots.

294
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,955
You got attacked by bats
outside of my club?

295
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,319
That can't be natural. Can it?

296
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,789
Well, bat bites aren't completely
unheard of in the city.

297
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,279
I have a friend over at County

298
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,873
who treated one
a couple of months ago.

299
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,395
Right, but these were bats. Plural.

300
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,315
I'll be right back. Excuse me.

301
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,680
Sounds more natural
than supernatural to me.

302
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,072
- Yeah. Well, I'm thinking vampires.
- Vampires? That'd be different.

303
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,196
- No, that's not possible.
- Why not?

304
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,636
Well, because as far as I know,
vampires attack in human form

305
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,872
and not as a swarm of bats.
You know, it's gotta be something else.

306
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,397
True. Vampires have been ostracised
from the underworld for centuries.

307
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,949
As far as I know, they're a part
of a whole different network now.

308
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,157
I'm sorry, Lisa here
is gonna draw some blood

309
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,833
so we can run some tests.

310
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,436
- That mean I can go home?
- Well, I don't see why not.

311
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,238
I'm gonna get you started
on antibiotics

312
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,756
and then schedule the first
of the rabies shots in the morning.

313
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,631
Okay, now make a fist.

314
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,115
Relax your hand now.

315
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,793
I'm almost done.

316
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,838
- You okay?
- Yeah, as long as I don't look.

317
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,799
I didn't mean you.

318
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,959
Phoebe?

319
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,349
Damn it. Where is she?

320
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,431
What about the Grimlocks?

321
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,318
The Grimlocks?
You think they attacked her?

322
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,710
If they did, I'll crush their skulls
with my bare hands.

323
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,950
Who said romance was dead?

324
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,839
We were talking about
who we could trust, remember?

325
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,594
Grimlocks, yea or nay?

326
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,990
Sorry. Yeah.

327
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,559
Grimlocks are okay.

328
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,950
Keats is the only one I don't trust.

329
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,558
- That's gotta be her.
- I could only hope.

330
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,869
- Phoebe?
- Hi, honey.

331
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,190
Are you all right? I called your cell.
You didn't pick up.

332
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,749
Yeah, well, that's probably
because I was unconscious.

333
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,639
- What? Did a demon hurt you?
- No, it was nothing like that.

334
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,836
I just-- I fainted.

335
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,199
- Fainted?
- Yeah, it was no big deal.

336
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,271
Why do people gotta keep
their high beams on?

337
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,476
Phoebe, people
just don't faint for no reason.

338
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,393
Well, I've been pretty rundown,
and the doctor said I might be anaemic.

339
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,391
He took some blood
to make sure that's all it is.

340
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,154
Well, maybe you ought to get Leo
to check the Harpy scratch in case--

341
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,515
I already did and he said
there's nothing to worry about.

342
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,511
Besides, we have bigger
demonic issues

343
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,877
that we have to deal with right now.
Paige was bitten by a bunch of bats.

344
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,993
Bats? Are you sure?

345
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,119
- I'm sure he's all broken up about it.
- Yeah, she's okay.

346
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,077
Leo's gonna heal her
when we get home.

347
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,753
So you wanna meet us there?

348
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,590
I am home, Phoebe. You called me.

349
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,919
I meant the manor. I'm sorry.

350
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,873
I'm on my way.

351
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,038
You think it was Rowan?

352
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,151
He must've been trying to turn her--

353
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,356
You can't let them
get a Charmed One on their side.

354
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,239
- They'll be too powerful.
- Don't you think I know that?

355
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,433
Damn it.

356
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,635
Gather the faction leaders.

357
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,233
The queen wants a war.
She's got one!

358
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,913
- Where are you going?
- To the manor!

359
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,469
To help save Paige.

360
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,520
- "Manticore."
- Bites but doesn't fly.

361
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,709
- "Phoenix."
- Flies but doesn't bite.

362
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,039
- "Chupacabra."
- God bless you.

363
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,760
Flies and bites
but only attacks livestock.

364
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,952
What about shape-shifters?

365
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,189
What about this
being a waste of time?

366
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,032
Look at me. I'm fine.

367
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,316
Let's just call it a night.

368
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,072
Paige, if you're tired, just go to bed.

369
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,754
We'll wake you up
if we find something.

370
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,239
Fine.

371
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,470
I'll be asleep.

372
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,630
She's a delight.

373
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,631
She's been through a lot.
She needs some rest.

374
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,030
Isn't there some way you can help us
narrow down the suspects?

375
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,794
With every demonic faction in town,
it makes it kind of hard.

376
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,949
Okay. So, what's going on?

377
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,270
Is there a demon convention
in San Francisco or what?

378
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,749
Yes, there is a demonic
electoral college.

379
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,878
They've called a meeting
and they're voting in a new Source.

380
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,636
- You think?
- Well, not the voting part. But maybe.

381
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,155
I mean, there's gotta be
somebody pretty powerful

382
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,878
that's bringing together
these factions.

383
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,235
- Which means--
- Evil may have a new leader.

384
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,190
- Cole.
- Honey, I came soon as I could.

385
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,198
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

386
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,477
- How's Paige? Where is she?
- She's sleeping. I healed her.

387
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,429
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Why?

388
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,278
Do you know
what we're up against?

389
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,000
Bats that bite can only be
one thing, vampires.

390
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,833
No, we ruled them out.
It doesn't seem like their m.o.

391
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,433
Have you ever seen a vampire?

392
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,238
No, but I've read about them.

393
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,674
Well, I've dealt with them.

394
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,592
You can trust Anne Rice,
or you can trust me.

395
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,749
I think he might be right.

396
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,475
Wait, you dealt
with vampires as a demon?

397
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,279
How is that possible? I thought
they were pariahs in the underworld.

398
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,431
Well, I wasn't too picky
who I dealt with.

399
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,397
I didn't care that The Source
had banished them

400
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,120
- for selling him out to his enemies.
- Why attack a Charmed One now?

401
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,236
- What do they want?
- There must be a power struggle.

402
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,073
- Trying to overtake the underworld.
- By killing Paige?

403
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,879
No, by turning her into a vampire.

404
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,077
Paige?

405
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,199
Paige?

406
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,512
Where'd she go?

407
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,550
Oh, my God! Paige!

408
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,233
Watch out!

409
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,872
I ransacked the whole house,
and this is all I could find.

410
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,759
Okay. So, what do we do
about the holy water?

411
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,069
I can get some.

412
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,631
You know, that stuff's only gonna
help you fight off the vampires.

413
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,438
It's not gonna change Paige back.

414
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,113
Yeah, I'm working on that.

415
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,919
According to the Book,
if you kill a vampire queen,

416
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,752
then all her little vampires
die with her.

417
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,833
Really? Interesting.

418
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,509
They certainly don't like
to spread that around.

419
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,114
But that's not gonna work,
because then it'll kill Paige too.

420
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,555
No, not if she hasn't bitten anyone.

421
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,076
Apparently, the transformation
only takes place after blood is spilled

422
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,832
or in this case, sucked.

423
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,309
Okay, so we have to kill
the queen fast.

424
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,708
How do we vanquish her?

425
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,632
With the power of three.

426
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,518
Of course, can't anything be easy?

427
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,951
Oh, it gets worse.

428
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,714
Vampires are immune
to witch powers.

429
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,997
Well, I'll get the holy water once l
fill in the Elders about the new Source.

430
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,148
New Source?
There's a new Source?

431
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,197
Yeah, we think so.

432
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,157
- Any idea who it is?
- No, not yet.

433
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,431
Okay, let's just focus
on finding Paige.

434
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,797
So if you were undead,
where would you be?

435
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,030
- Cemetery?
- Right, let's go.

436
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,315
We don't got a lot of time.

437
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,833
We got a bunch of them
to check out--

438
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,433
Well, Phoebe...

439
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,829
...I don't want you to go.

440
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,871
- What?
- Well, it's too dangerous.

441
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,759
What happens if you faint again,
but this time in a vampire attack?

442
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,434
- Baby, that's not gonna happen.
- Well, how can you be sure?

443
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,439
I don't wanna lose you.

444
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,189
I don't wanna lose Paige.
I don't understand.

445
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,555
Weren't you just telling us
that we had to save Paige?

446
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,711
Well, yeah, but that was before
I had all the facts.

447
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,154
You need the power of three.

448
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,231
I'm sure Paige is not gonna be
in a rhyming mood.

449
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,515
So, what do you suggest?

450
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,830
That we let her spend eternity
as a vampire?

451
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,035
She's still my sister.

452
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,989
And that doesn't change
because I happen to be sick.

453
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,719
Or because I'm your wife.

454
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,355
The vampires are trying to convert
my wife's sister, a Charmed One.

455
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,434
I'm interpreting this
as an act of war against me.

456
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,079
Wait a second now.
Let's not overreact.

457
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,471
Maybe this is some kind
of a misunderstanding.

458
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,153
I don't misunderstand anything.

459
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,877
I want the vampires exterminated.

460
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,558
- Every last one of them.
- But vampires multiply too fast.

461
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,553
We could never get them all.

462
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,631
If we kill the queen,

463
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,873
they all die.

464
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,918
I've never heard that.
What's your source?

465
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,514
Are you questioning my orders?

466
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,988
No, of course not.

467
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,073
I want the queen.

468
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,312
Dispatch your forces.

469
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,755
Tell them to torture
any vampire they see.

470
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,592
Make them talk.

471
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,512
But don't forget

472
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,871
my wife is out there too.

473
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,074
Anyone lays a claw on her

474
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,595
will answer to me.

475
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,751
- Leave.
- As you wish.

476
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,399
What about the other sister?

477
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,120
Are you gonna let her die
with the queen?

478
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,713
It would eliminate
the Charmed Ones.

479
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,712
Phoebe would be devastated.

480
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,358
But I wouldn't be.

481
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,996
Sorry to interrupt you during dinner.

482
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,230
That's all right, I've had better.

483
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,672
- Is she here then?
- Just arrived.

484
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,708
She's perfect.

485
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,389
She'll fit right in.

486
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,073
I thought you'd like her.

487
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,192
Are you hungry, my dear?

488
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,915
Famished.

489
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,832
That's wonderful.

490
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,911
Now, for your first meal,

491
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,436
I have two savoury victims in mind.

492
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,192
Here you are.

493
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,470
Anything for you, my queen.

494
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,430
I want you to go back
to your sisters, Paige.

495
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,671
Take a taste of your own blood.

496
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,230
It will seal your conversion
and turn them as well.

497
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,118
That's genius.

498
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,875
With the power of three
on our side,

499
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,913
The Source will be no match for us.

500
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,072
My sisters are very powerful.

501
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,552
They won't join us willingly.

502
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,432
I don't think I can do it alone.

503
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,797
Oh, my darling. Look around you.

504
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,920
That's what families are for.

505
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,514
What are you doing here, Keats?

506
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,070
- I have to get a message to the queen.
- Well, why don't you take it yourself?

507
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,958
Because someone
might be following me.

508
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,190
Tell her she needs
to leave town fast.

509
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,237
- The Source is--
- The Source is what?

510
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,673
Where's the queen, Keats?

511
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,552
You can vanquish me if you want,
but I'm not telling you anything.

512
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,434
Do you really think that
vanquishing you is the worst I can do?

513
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,960
So let's try this again.

514
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,111
Where is the vampire queen?

515
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,234
They're not here.

516
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,833
They must be looking for you.

517
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,434
Do-gooders.

518
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,909
I was hoping to get this over with.

519
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,150
Now, just relax.

520
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,591
You're only innocent once.

521
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,111
But I'm starving.

522
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,033
I feel like I've been waiting
for this moment my whole life.

523
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,596
- What are you smiling at?
- I was just thinking of my first time.

524
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,474
Tell me about it.

525
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,715
It's better than you
can possibly imagine.

526
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,159
Danger, excitement,

527
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,028
the warm glow you feel afterwards.

528
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,872
There's nothing like it.

529
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,474
How many have you had?

530
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,549
I don't keep track.

531
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,956
The faces all fade away.
It's the taste you remember.

532
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,510
And what was l, just fast food?

533
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,874
Oh, hardly.

534
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,079
Just relax. Clear your mind.

535
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,791
You are a hunter now.

536
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,039
You have the ability
to find your prey.

537
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,518
I don't understand.

538
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,632
You will.

539
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,438
Close your eyes...

540
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,677
...and focus.

541
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,509
I know where they are.

542
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,953
Oh, you're a natural.

543
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,069
Tell the queen to expect company.

544
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,232
Hey, wait!

545
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,676
Hey! Wait!
We just wanna talk to you.

546
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,034
What is going on?

547
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,033
That's the fourth demon tonight
to run away from us.

548
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,191
Well, maybe word got out
that we killed The Source?

549
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,828
- The old Source.
- You had to mention that, didn't you?

550
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,389
I don't get it. We've been
chasing demons all night,

551
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,677
searching cemeteries all night,
and no freaking vampires.

552
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,909
This is ridiculous.

553
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,197
We gotta figure out something else
before the sun comes up.

554
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,200
What's the matter? You okay?

555
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,669
Yeah, just a little dizzy.

556
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,549
Those tombstones
aren't actually moving, are they?

557
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,435
Phoebe, this is not funny.

558
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,637
Maybe this is more
than just being rundown.

559
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,711
Maybe you're pregnant.

560
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,879
That is funny.

561
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,270
Actually, it's not so funny.

562
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,719
I went to the drugstore. I got a test.

563
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,236
I peed on a stick and I anxiously
awaited the results in two minutes.

564
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,955
- And?
- And...

565
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,470
It was negative, thankfully.

566
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,233
Yeah. Well, mine was too.

567
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,908
You thought you were pregnant?

568
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,391
For about a minute and a half.

569
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,190
Oh, honey, I am so sorry.

570
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,358
No, it's okay. It's no big deal.

571
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,751
Yes, it is. To you it is.

572
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,198
Is this what you wanted
to talk to me about?

573
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,071
I had no idea.

574
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,235
- It's okay. I understand.
- No, it's not okay.

575
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,231
I left the manor, not the family.

576
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,279
I still want to be a part of your life.

577
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,078
All of it.

578
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,989
You sure?

579
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,954
You come over here.

580
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,873
- Don't I get a hug?
- Paige.

581
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,357
- How did you find us?
- We share the same blood, Piper.

582
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,394
I sniffed you out.

583
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,113
Paige, listen to me.

584
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,429
We can go back to the manor,

585
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,353
and we'll find something
to change you back.

586
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,796
- Hold it.
- Why you gotta be like that?

587
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,395
Now it's time
we really bond as sisters.

588
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,833
Paige, we are just trying
to help you, damn it!

589
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,718
Catch me if you can.

590
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,755
Okay, Leo, come on.
Come on. Orb.

591
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,997
Where are we? I can't see a thing.

592
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,434
Good.

593
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,712
Well, which one's Paige?

594
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,950
How should I know?

595
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,434
Welcome to our family.

596
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,799
Stay away from us,

597
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,520
or you'll get an eyeful of holy water
and a chest full of wood.

598
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,875
You'd only be delaying
the inevitable.

599
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,190
Now, why can't we do this
without a fight?

600
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,396
Paige, we're your sisters.
You're not a vampire yet.

601
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,630
We're offering immortal life.

602
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,234
An eternity together as sisters.

603
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,233
Now, isn't that preferable to death?

604
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,038
Are those our only two choices?

605
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,794
Because I prefer the scenario
where you die

606
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,279
and we get to stay human.

607
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,955
If you could have killed me,
you would've done so already.

608
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,235
We both know that.

609
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,633
- We gotta get out of here.
- Not without Paige.

610
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,756
Words will never
make them understand.

611
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,036
No, but they will.

612
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,597
Incoming!

613
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,633
Look out!

614
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,039
Leo, holy water!

615
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,953
Let's go!

616
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,594
Leo!

617
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,639
No, my babies!

618
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,878
Come before The Source kills us all.

619
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,113
We gotta get Paige.

620
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,111
The Source.

621
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,274
I should have bitten you.

622
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,038
Yeah. Well, bite this.

623
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,273
- What's going on?
- The queen must be dead.

624
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,875
Paige!

625
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,119
Paige?

626
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,473
In-laws.

627
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,152
Paige, thank God you're alive.

628
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,234
Are you all right?

629
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,876
- The Source.
- The Source?

630
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,712
- What do you mean?
- He was here.

631
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,515
Just now? You saw him?

632
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,319
The queen must have posed
a threat to him.

633
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,311
Well, that would explain
why he wanted to kill her.

634
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,879
But why not Paige or us?

635
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,272
I don't know.
Let's just count our blessings

636
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,271
and get the hell out of here.

637
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,557
You're up early.
Vampire nightmares?

638
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,668
Oddly enough, no.

639
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,114
Just some other thoughts.

640
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,032
Any you want to share?

641
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,199
You wouldn't be interested.

642
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,554
Try me.

643
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,832
They're about Cole.

644
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,952
I'm listening.

645
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,277
Okay, remember the guy
that stood me up?

646
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,158
How could l? I never met him.

647
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,756
Yeah, you did actually.

648
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,638
He was one of the vampires.

649
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,598
And I first met him at the penthouse.

650
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,113
He was there seeing Cole.

651
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,358
Now, I know what you're gonna say.

652
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,192
Maybe Cole didn't know
he was a vampire,

653
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,432
and we should probably give him
the benefit of the doubt.

654
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,068
And you're right, we should.

655
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,591
So then why do I get
the sinking feeling

656
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,273
that you might be on to something?

657
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,958
- You do?
- Well, it's just a lot of little things,

658
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,032
Iike him not wanting you to orb in,

659
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,668
- him not wanting us to--
- Save me?

660
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,558
Go after vampires.

661
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,828
I mean, I'm not saying
that he's a demon, okay?

662
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,913
Because we both know
that's not possible.

663
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,789
We both know anything is possible.

664
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,393
Okay. But what if we're wrong?

665
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,235
Then we lose Cole
and Phoebe forever.

666
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,235
We're not wrong.
Something is not right.

667
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,791
- Hello?
- Hi. It's Paige.

668
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,276
Paige? How are you feeling?

669
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,039
Human again, thank God.

670
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,031
Yeah, thank God.

671
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,713
Is Phoebe there?

672
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,189
She's still sleeping. Is it important?

673
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,910
I'll just call her later.

674
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,749
Who was that?

675
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,911
Oh, nobody. How you feeling?

676
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,513
Better.

677
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,474
Good.

678
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,313
Phoebe,

679
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,349
I'm never gonna be okay with you

680
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,150
chasing demons anymore.
You can't change that.

681
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,435
And you can't change the fact

682
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,830
that they're gonna
keep coming after me.

683
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,993
And that I have sisters
that need me.

684
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,151
- I understand.
- Do you?

685
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,235
Because yesterday,
it seemed like you didn't.

686
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,829
Well, I just don't want
anything to happen to you.

687
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,834
Ever.

688
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,999
Is that so bad?

689
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,239
No.

I'll be at work.

Hello? This is Phoebe Halliwell.

Hi, doctor.
Did the test results come in?

693
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,868
I'm what?

694
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,749
I double-checked
the results myself.

695
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,555
You're pregnant, Miss Halliwell.

696
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,517
Congratulations.

697
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,119

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,111
Miss Halliwell? Hello?
