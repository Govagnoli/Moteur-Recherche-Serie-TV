0
00:00:04,329 --> 00:00:06,206
I don't think we'll be able
to pull this off.

1
00:00:06,369 --> 00:00:08,246
- We have to.
- We've been in tighter jams

2
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,559
- than this before.
- But we're running out of time.

3
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:13,846
- I don't think we're gonna make it.
- Phoebe, we can do this, okay?

4
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:16,647
If we just get a quick bite
to eat at Reds,

5
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:19,522
we can still make the 9:30 Faithless
at the Avalon.

6
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:20,917
The foreign film?

7
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:24,240
- I thought we were seeing a thriller.
- No, I wanna stop thinking about Cole

8
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:26,969
and his demon dodging,
not be reminded of it.

9
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:31,079
- Piper?
- Leo, it is three votes for Faithless.

10
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:33,399
Well, a thriller would be okay.

11
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:36,438
Okay, wait a second.
The vote's two against two?

12
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:39,523
- That's new.
- Welcome to the power of four.

13
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:40,878
I demand a recount.

14
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,400
Wait, that never works.

15
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:49,607
Something tells me you're not gonna
want to see either movie now.

16
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:00,805
- Hey.
- Hey.

17
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:08,527
- I was so worried.
- I know, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:10,520
I couldn't come back
until it was safe.

19
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,609
- It's safe now?
- I think so.

20
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:15,884
For the moment.

21
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:26,798
Hey, welcome back.

22
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:28,960
Thanks, glad to be back.

23
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:31,161
Love to chat,
but we're late for a movie.

24
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,081
You wanna go?
We could use a tiebreaker.

25
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:36,525
Actually, I was hoping
Phoebe and I could catch up alone.

26
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:38,767
Works for me. Ciao.

27
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:43,488
Look at Phoebe and Cole trying
to be a normal couple.

28
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,839
- You know what that means.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:49,001
We're gonna go see the thriller as if
we don't have enough scary bad guys

30
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:52,206
around in our real life.
All right, come on.

31
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:58,683
I was starting to worry that you weren't
gonna make it back in time

32
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:00,202
for my graduation.

33
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:03,327
Wouldn't miss that for the world,
or the underworld.

34
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:08,722
It's really not safe for you here, is it?

35
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:12,487
No... Yeah, it is. I mean...

36
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,607
At least I think so.

37
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:17,167
Then what's wrong?

38
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:22,117
The truth is I don't know how much
longer I can keep doing this.

39
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,967
Doing what?

40
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,721
You know, the running and hiding.

41
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:28,607
Even if I stop, where do I go?

42
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:31,647
I'm still half human,
but I can't go back.

43
00:02:31,809 --> 00:02:35,085
On the other hand, there's no place
for me in your world either.

44
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:38,407
What are you saying?

45
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:40,607
I'm just saying it's complicated.

46
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:45,998
It doesn't have to be, not with magic
on our side. I've been thinking.

47
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,360
Isn't there some spell in the Book
of Shadows that can strip my powers?

48
00:02:51,369 --> 00:02:53,644
Wait, you want to give up
your powers?

49
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,525
If I don't have them, I can't be tempted
to use them. I could just stay good.

50
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:00,000
You would do that for me?

51
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:05,927
Prepare for the Brotherhood!

52
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,079
- Cole, what is it?
- The Thorn is coming!

53
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:15,085
Stop the Brotherhood! No Luxiron!

54
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:17,280
- Do you know him?
- Prepare for the Brotherhood!

55
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,719
No, but if he doesn't watch
what he's saying...

56
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,647
Phoebe, don't.

57
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:27,208
No!

58
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,287
Where were you?

59
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:51,564
What happened to you?

60
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:54,360
You just vanquished my brother.

61
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:28,838
You know, Cole,
there's plenty working against us.

62
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:31,682
I just thought at least I could count
on you being honest with me.

63
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:32,918
I am.

64
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:34,920
Okay, so you just forgot
that you had a brother?

65
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,283
He's not that kind of brother.

66
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:37,928
How many kinds of brothers
are there?

67
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,683
- It's complicated.
- You know, I hate that word.

68
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:42,726
All right, we were just about
to find out

69
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,164
who the real killer is
and the pager goes off.

70
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:47,479
So this better be
a really good emergency.

71
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,759
Well, I'm the real killer.

72
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:51,521
I just vanquished Cole's brother.

73
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:54,040
This is so much better than
the movie.

74
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:56,286
I didn't want him to see me.

75
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:58,644
And we lost an innocent because of it.

76
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:02,768
Some poor street prophet who was
ranting about the Brotherhood.

77
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,006
The Brotherhood of the Thorn?

78
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,241
Yeah. I was a member.
I am a member.

79
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,644
What does that mean?
What does he mean?

80
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,208
You should have told us.

81
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:15,088
I've done a lot in 100 years.
It'll take a while to catch you up.

82
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:18,486
- Okay, so who are they?
- They're an elite gang.

83
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:20,560
They answer directly to The Source.

84
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,725
He selects the members himself.

85
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:25,926
Then they take a blood oath
to a lifelong pledge of loyalty.

86
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:28,484
Oh, that kind of brother.

87
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,759
All that matters now
is that they're surfacing.

88
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:34,999
They must have something big
in the works.

89
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:37,763
So why kill a crazy old street preacher?

90
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:40,284
Because not all of them are crazy,
or human.

91
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:43,209
Some of them are magical seers
who can foresee actual events,

92
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,679
but they're loud and dirty
so people ignore them.

93
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:50,605
If you call Inspector Morris,

94
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,765
he'll tell you other prophets
have been killed too.

95
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:56,723
For what? Just for talking about your...
This gang?

96
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:59,727
The Brotherhood can't risk anyone
figuring out what they're up to.

97
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:02,802
- Okay, so what are they up to?
- I have no idea.

98
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:05,847
I'm not exactly a member
in good standing anymore.

99
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:09,167
The prophet that I tried to save
was talking about Luxiron.

100
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:12,761
The Internet provider? What, the
demons want their own website now?

101
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:14,487
No, there must be more to it
than that.

102
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:17,925
All right, Phoebe, you check the net.
Piper, you got the Book of Shadows...

103
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:21,047
Save it. You can't stop
the Brotherhood with a little research

104
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:24,007
and your basic kick,
freeze and magical move.

105
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:25,444
No offence intended.

106
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,318
- Some taken.
- No, he's right.

107
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,480
They're way beyond anything
you've ever dealt with.

108
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,520
So we can't just let them go.

109
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:35,523
There's gotta be a way to find out
what they're planning.

110
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,441
There is one way.

111
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,638
- For me to go back.
- Cole.

112
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,001
If you want to find out
what they're up to, we have no choice.

113
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:48,201
Okay, but you'll be exposing yourself
to The Source.

114
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:50,844
- He'll kill you.
- Maybe not.

115
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:54,565
They've probably already surfaced,
set up camp in this world.

116
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:56,481
I won't have to go under completely.

117
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,758
It does kind of make sense.

118
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,521
Well, of course it makes sense
to you.

119
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,839
You always look for ways
to get Cole out of our lives.

120
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:05,488
Phoebe.

121
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:08,278
This isn't about her, Phoebe.

122
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,128
- It's about me.
- No...

123
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:12,883
...it's about us.

124
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:27,637
We might have a problem.

125
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:29,367
- With one of the prophets?
- No.

126
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:32,282
All the ones we've targeted
have been taken out, including Trigg's.

127
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:35,998
- So what's the problem?
- Trigg's missing.

128
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,648
I can't find him anywhere.

129
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,363
Which means someone
is on to our plan.

130
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:43,886
Impossible.
As long as the prophets are dead.

131
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:47,161
Keep searching for our brother.
I have to complete my assimilation.

132
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:49,206
We must move forward.

133
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,682
I'm worried, and not just about Cole,
but also Phoebe.

134
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:02,842
I mean, sending him back under is
like sending an alcoholic to a kegger.

135
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,244
- It's just setting him up to fall.
- I agree.

136
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:09,607
All right, look, this whole voting together
thing would be really, really cute

137
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:11,327
if it weren't so annoying.

138
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:14,287
I mean maybe you guys' vote
should just count as one from now on.

139
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:16,758
Bet you wouldn't mind
if we were voting with you.

140
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:19,877
What if we lose him? You don't
want that responsibility, do you?

141
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:22,609
Okay, look, the only votes
that count are Phoebe and Cole's,

142
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:24,361
and Cole has already volunteered.

143
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:26,480
Well, then maybe Phoebe
can talk him out of it.

144
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:28,645
Right, which is why we need
another plan.

145
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,845
So you guys work on
the Book of Shadows together

146
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:33,438
and I will call Morris
and see what he knows.

147
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:39,606
- Phoebe, I have to go.
- Nope. You can't.

148
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:43,361
- Phoebe.
- Remember the power-stripping potion

149
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:47,522
you asked me for, like, an hour ago
when everything was still wonderful?

150
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:51,284
Well, I have an idea.
I just need some time.

151
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:54,128
Phoebe, I have to go.

152
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:57,964
- I'll need my powers while I'm gone.
- Why? What are you gonna do?

153
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:01,121
Just blend in, that's it.
I won't do anything evil.

154
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:03,001
Well, let me make sure you can't.

155
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:16,488
I'll be smart, and careful.

156
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:18,281
I'll check in with you every two hours.

157
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:20,964
How? They'll track your shimmer.

158
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:24,366
Not if we meet in the mausoleum.
That's the second safest place I know.

159
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:27,927
- What's the safest?
- With you.

160
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,203
- I thought you'd be proud of me.
- Of what?

161
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:40,122
- Being suicidal?
- I'm coming back.

162
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:41,278
I always have.

163
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:44,003
How can you be so sure that
you're gonna come back this time?

164
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:46,883
Cole, you've been hiding from them
for months.

165
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:49,045
I don't understand.
There's a price on your head,

166
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:51,882
and now all of a sudden
you're willing to expose yourself?

167
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:53,647
- For what?
- For good.

168
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:58,805
You taught me not to walk away
and let evil win, to fight the good fight.

169
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:00,528
That's all I wanna do.

170
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:03,643
- They'll kill you.
- I have a plan.

171
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:04,924
Don't worry.

172
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:08,880
This is the right thing to do, Phoebe.

173
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:10,607
You know that, we both do.

174
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:14,318
Mausoleum, two hours, okay?

175
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:37,881
Vornac.

176
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:43,888
Well, look who's back.

177
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:49,366
- Kill him?
- In a minute.

178
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:58,358
Belthazor.

179
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,123
Come in, come in.

180
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:14,085
Nice of you to come home to die.

181
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:17,281
Actually, I came to help.
I overheard the prophets talking.

182
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:19,878
- Afraid they'd spoil your plan.
- Who said we have one?

183
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:22,319
Tarkin, you always have a plan.

184
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:26,486
And after everything you've done,
you think you can just

185
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:30,086
walk back in,
pick up where you left off?

186
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,558
I'm here to do what's right, Vornac.

187
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:34,043
For the Brotherhood.

188
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:36,322
Really.

189
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:40,848
And what can you possibly offer
that will save your traitorous head?

190
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,327
The prophet's.

191
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,127
You actually expect me to believe
you killed the prophet?

192
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:08,325
He was a threat to you.

193
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:11,367
A bounty on your head
and yet you still think of us.

194
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:15,244
- The Brotherhood comes first.
- Words to live or die by.

195
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:17,599
Trigg was assigned
to kill that prophet.

196
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,363
- Did you see him?
- No.

197
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:21,962
How is my old friend?

198
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:28,082
Your old friend's missing, suspiciously.

199
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:32,043
Brothers missing, prophets talking,

200
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:35,765
I had no trouble tracking you down.
Pretty careless.

201
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:39,246
- What does Raynor think of this?
- Raynor thinks you're a disgrace.

202
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:41,917
- Why, because I killed the Triad?
- Isn't that enough?

203
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:46,766
They were plotting to kill The Source
so they could take over.

204
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:50,478
Which means they would have killed
every other demon in his inner circle,

205
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,128
including Raynor.

206
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:56,680
- We never did trust the Triad.
- Then why didn't he come back

207
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:58,487
and explain himself?

208
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:00,048
Why run?

209
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:05,038
Because I had no proof...

210
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:07,200
...that's why.

211
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:09,121
I knew nobody would believe me.

212
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:16,325
Brothers for a hundred years,
and you...

213
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:20,046
...disappeared without a word.

214
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:26,285
Left us with the rumours,
the accusations.

215
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:29,959
Were you thinking about
the Brotherhood then?

216
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:41,764
Check his story.

217
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:49,321
Back to work.

218
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,805
So who we after?

219
00:14:56,049 --> 00:15:00,645
Not your concern.
Until Klea returns, he goes nowhere.

220
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:08,160
He always was a tight-ass,
wasn't he?

221
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,087
Do you blame him?

222
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:12,528
No.

223
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,842
It's nice to have you back, Belthazor.

224
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:21,479
- I just hope it's for good.
- Yeah, me too.

225
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:24,485
Poor Phoebe, she must be going
out of her mind.

226
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:25,798
It's only been three hours.

227
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:29,644
Three and a half, way past the time
he said he would check in with her.

228
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:31,481
Leo, maybe you should orb
to the mausoleum

229
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:33,008
and see if she's heard from him.

230
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:35,006
Well, she said that she would call
if she had.

231
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:38,087
I should stay here till we figure out
what the Brotherhood's plan is.

232
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:40,840
So now you're voting with her?

233
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:45,124
Luxiron, that's what the prophet said,
right?

234
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,759
"Merger talks between
Luxiron and MetaSatellite

235
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:51,521
faltered over the weekend."

236
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:56,846
Wait a minute. So Cole is risking
his life to preserve stock portfolios?

237
00:15:57,049 --> 00:15:58,402
No, it's much bigger than that.

238
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:00,685
According to this,
if the merger goes through,

239
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:02,521
the world's information flow
will wind up

240
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:06,443
- in the hands of one company.
- Well, that sounds evil all by itself.

241
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,765
Except for one of the CEOs.
Frank Pirelli

242
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:10,521
is apparently getting cold feet
about it.

243
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:13,004
Want to bet the Brotherhood
wants this merger to go through

244
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:14,761
so they can take over the company?

245
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:17,437
Which means they'll have
to force Pirelli to vote for it.

246
00:16:17,849 --> 00:16:19,521
Yeah, or kill him.

247
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:23,079
It sure would be nice to be able
to compare notes with Cole.

248
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:27,561
Well, we could if someone would orb
to the mausoleum.

249
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:32,761
Phoebe.

250
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:34,687
Anything?

251
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:39,361
I'm sure it's not as easy to break away
from there as he thought.

252
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:41,768
He'll show.

253
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,442
It's okay to be scared.

254
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:48,566
No, I'm not scared.
Concerned maybe, a little.

255
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:51,324
- We shouldn't have let him go.
- We didn't.

256
00:16:51,729 --> 00:16:55,039
- He chose to.
- I know, and for what?

257
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:57,165
To prove to me that he's good?

258
00:16:57,329 --> 00:16:59,797
He doesn't have to prove
anything to me.

259
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:03,322
Cole.

260
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:07,326
Are you okay?
Did they buy your story?

261
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:10,162
For now, but I gotta get back.
They're suspicious enough as it is.

262
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,763
Well, then maybe
you shouldn't go back.

263
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:15,199
I want to, to stop them.

264
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,361
Look, I don't have much time.
All I know is they're after someone

265
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:22,124
who's gonna be at Pier and Pescadero
at 8 a.m.

266
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,320
- But I don't know who.
- We might.

267
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:27,921
Frank Pirelli runs Luxiron.

268
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:30,400
But he doesn't want
a big merger to happen.

269
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:32,361
And the Brotherhood does.

270
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:36,045
Makes sense. Explains why they've
taken over an investment banking firm.

271
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:37,643
How does it explain that?

272
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:40,888
The best way for evil to get a foothold
in the human world...

273
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:43,085
...is to take over their businesses.

274
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:44,923
Work from the inside out.

275
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:46,967
Really?

276
00:17:47,689 --> 00:17:50,044
You just learned that, did you?

277
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,566
No.

278
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:57,366
So we need to safeguard Pirelli

279
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:01,522
till the merger vote at 11
and the Brotherhood loses.

280
00:18:01,729 --> 00:18:05,517
Yes. But if you intervene, they might
think I had something to do with it.

281
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:06,917
You could blow my cover.

282
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:10,122
- We can't let them kill Pirelli.
- But you can let them kill me?

283
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:13,002
No. No. Cole, look at me.

284
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:15,360
We're gonna find a way to protect you.

285
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:19,003
You better get back.

286
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:25,878
All right.

287
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:29,442
I'm looking forward to seeing you
in your cap and gown.

288
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:34,843
Mind if I borrow this?

289
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:45,519
- Where did you go?
- I got thirsty.

290
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,964
Want a urine sample to prove it?

291
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:54,118
Your flippant attitude
almost got you killed once before.

292
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:55,927
Remember that?

293
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:59,286
I remember. You saved me.

294
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:06,839
All right, let's review.

295
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:10,088
We control the perimeter.
Re-route foot traffic.

296
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:11,802
I'll monitor security.

297
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:14,967
Once the limo's been cut off, Jaxel
will throw the energy ball and then...

298
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:17,768
No, wait.

299
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:20,563
Let's give Belthazor the honour.

300
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:24,644
What better way to make sure
he's truly back than to have him kill?

301
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:29,488
- Fine. What's the target?
- Why, does it matter?

302
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:35,640
It's time.

303
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:50,804
Nervous?

304
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,083
Me? No. I was just thinking.

305
00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:59,038
Been a while since you've seen
this kind of action, hasn't it?

306
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:02,923
It'll come back to you.
It's in our blood.

307
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:06,083
Yeah, I know.

308
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,760
Just execute the plan, Belthazor.

309
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:12,641
No confusion, no consequences.

310
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:14,885
It's no more complicated than that,
okay?

311
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:27,806
Wouldn't it be nice to save the world
at a decent hour?

312
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:31,519
Well, we have to focus here, because
if we don't pull this off just right,

313
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,600
- Cole is screwed.
- Well, as long as we wait

314
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,999
until the last second,
Cole should be fine.

315
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,922
Let's just hope that killing Pirelli
isn't all they want.

316
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,284
Well, if it wasn't,
he would have told you, right?

317
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,565
I mean, unless you think
he's holding something back.

318
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:45,606
You know what, this is amazing.

319
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:48,848
First Prue can't sacrifice Cole
fast enough.

320
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:51,559
And now you can't wait to sell him out
as a traitor.

321
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:53,447
She was just asking a question,
Phoebe.

322
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:56,169
That she should know the answer to,
we all should.

323
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:58,718
Cole is risking his life for this.

324
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:00,686
The least we can do is trust him.

325
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:13,320
Go.

326
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:21,760
- Well?
- I haven't been able to prove

327
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:24,284
Belthazor's story one way or the other.

328
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:25,888
That's all right.

329
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:29,758
We're about to find out
if he's telling the truth or not.

330
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:52,720
I got it, Mr. Pirelli.

331
00:21:52,889 --> 00:21:55,483
What the hell is the matter with you?
Move your car now!

332
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,965
What are you waiting for? Kill.

333
00:21:59,129 --> 00:22:00,608
Move your car!

334
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:02,282
Or be killed.

335
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,686
Can you hear me?
Hey, can you hear me?

336
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:09,765
What, are you deaf? Did you hear
what I said? Move your car!

337
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:14,599
Now! Where are you going?
Where are you going, damn it?!

338
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:22,604
All right, Leo, go, go, go.

339
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:27,968
Maybe we should take Cole with us.

340
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:29,881
No, he has to look innocent
after the fact.

341
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,324
He's gotta figure out a way
to get out on his own.

342
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:33,968
Come on.

343
00:22:58,129 --> 00:22:59,881
Go get the body.

344
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:09,482
What do you want the body for?
There won't be much left.

345
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:12,886
But even a trace could alert
the humans to the switch.

346
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:16,682
What switch?

347
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:24,003
This one.

348
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:35,962
All clear.

349
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:41,565
- Come on. Get into the car.
- Get me out of here.

350
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:42,838
Go.

351
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:44,567
Good. Go, go, go.

352
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:50,528
Feels great, doesn't it, Belthazor?
Welcome home, brother.

353
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:53,408
You've been missed.

354
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,043
Where's Pirelli's body?

355
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:02,168
- It wasn't there.
- What do you mean it wasn't there?

356
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:10,568
Pirelli's in the basement.
He's fine.

357
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:12,082
Phoebe's sleeping potion worked.

358
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:14,558
Me and my potions,
they solve everything.

359
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:16,447
- Didn't have any problems?
- No.

360
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:18,884
Phoebe wanted to bring home
a souvenir, but otherwise no.

361
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:21,438
I wonder if the kidnapping
made the morning news.

362
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:23,844
- What do we do now?
- I don't know, that's up to Cole.

363
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:27,121
He's gotta let us know
what the demon's next move is.

364
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:29,007
It's no coincidence
that just last night,

365
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:32,047
I changed my mind
and decided to support this merger.

366
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:34,287
Now someone's tried to kill me.

367
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:37,168
That convinces me
that I've made the right choice.

368
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:40,526
This merger will happen.
Thank you.

369
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:45,840
What was that about Cole
telling us everything?

370
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:55,327
If Cole knew about the switch,
he would have told us.

371
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:56,678
Are you sure?

372
00:24:56,889 --> 00:24:59,357
He's back with his brothers now,
maybe he's switched too.

373
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:02,441
Oh, come on. Why all of a sudden
are you off his bandwagon?

374
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:05,322
- What changed?
- The plan blew up in our faces,

375
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:08,168
- that's what changed.
- And Cole is responsible for that?

376
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:11,480
Not knowing about the switch is a
big detail to miss, don't you think?

377
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:13,879
Aside from the whole
he-originally-tried-to-kill-us thing

378
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:15,687
that's coming to mind
right about now.

379
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,921
Okay, but, Piper, Cole's done
a lot of good since then, okay?

380
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:22,121
- We have to give him credit for that.
- Thank you.

381
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:24,479
You have to admit
you're a little worried about him.

382
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:28,119
About his getting killed, yes,
but not about his betraying us.

383
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:31,721
Pirelli is still out cold in the basement.
How are things up here?

384
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:33,362
Getting colder by the minute.

385
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:36,805
Okay, we need to work on a plan,
all right?

386
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,529
We need to be smart,
because Cole is counting on it.

387
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:42,726
So the merger voting is at 11,
that gives us two hours

388
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:45,198
to figure out a way to get the demon
impostor out of there.

389
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:48,322
Anything we do could point Cole out
as their leak.

390
00:25:48,489 --> 00:25:50,445
So we have to let him know
what we're up to.

391
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,358
- Do we?
- Yeah. He deserves to know that.

392
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,002
Let me tell him to get out of there.

393
00:25:56,169 --> 00:25:57,488
How you gonna get him
to meet you?

394
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,920
I slipped him a note at the attack,

395
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:03,120
asking him to meet me
at the mausoleum.

396
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,601
Let me try.

397
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:10,446
Okay. Be careful, and be fast.
And if, for whatever reason,

398
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:12,884
Cole doesn't meet you there,
get back here right away

399
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:15,563
- so we can start working on plan B.
- Okay.

400
00:26:15,729 --> 00:26:18,004
Okay, be safe.

401
00:26:20,489 --> 00:26:24,562
Well, since plan A is going so well,
I'd love to hear about plan B,

402
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:26,208
assuming that you have one.

403
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:29,441
I've got part of it, in the freezer.

404
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:32,166
The freezer?

405
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:36,123
Wait, we're gonna fight
the Brotherhood with Ben and Jerry's?

406
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:39,964
No, with a vanquishing potion made
from Belthazor flesh.

407
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:42,922
You kept that this long?
That's disgusting.

408
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:44,647
What makes you think
that it will work?

409
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:48,358
Well, you said that they were
connected by a blood oath, their blood.

410
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:51,919
So the potion that vanquishes one
should work on the others.

411
00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:56,246
How lucky that we had
the key ingredient in our freezer.

412
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,643
I guess, in the back of my head,

413
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:00,243
I sort of thought that we might
need it again someday.

414
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:16,120
If the real Pirelli shows up here
and exposes us, we're dead.

415
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:17,523
Do you realize that?

416
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:19,168
Someone must have
removed the body.

417
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:20,842
That's the only thing we could figure.

418
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:23,040
That's impossible.

419
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,200
Not if it was done magically.

420
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:28,878
Belthazor.

421
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:35,558
- What do you think?
- Me? I think...

422
00:27:35,889 --> 00:27:37,720
Well, I think Klea's right.

423
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,117
Somebody intervened.

424
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:41,288
Like who?

425
00:27:41,689 --> 00:27:43,441
- How would I know?
- Guess.

426
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,558
- Witches?
- How could witches be on to us?

427
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,168
Any thoughts?

428
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:52,083
We might have a leak.

429
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:59,438
Yeah, I think we do.
A traitor amongst us. Now...

430
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:03,165
...who do you suppose
that could be?

431
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,207
Come on,
you can't think Belthazor...

432
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:07,644
Don't tell me what to think.

433
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:10,323
Give me a break. I'm not stupid
enough to come back home

434
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:13,640
- and betray you all in one day.
- That's not stupid.

435
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:16,721
- That's smart.
- She's right.

436
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:19,807
After all, it's so ludicrous,
who would suspect you?

437
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:23,605
You see, the thing that bothers
me most about this, Belthazor,

438
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,043
are the rumours.

439
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:29,641
The ones that say that while you were
a fugitive, you fell in love with a witch.

440
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:31,601
And now here we are,

441
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:34,801
confronted by the very real possibility
our entire operation

442
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:41,238
has been compromised by,
coincidence of coincidences, witches.

443
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,037
The rumours are true.

444
00:28:49,449 --> 00:28:51,758
- What?
- I loved a witch.

445
00:28:52,969 --> 00:28:56,279
Still do, actually.
At least my human half does.

446
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:00,403
But that was a mistake.
I realize that now.

447
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:03,966
I'd forgotten who I really was.

448
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:07,877
Raynor will demand he die
for his treason.

449
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:11,445
Or he will forgive me for being able
to salvage the operation.

450
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:15,286
I think I can get Pirelli back.

451
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:18,957
- How?
- The witch I was involved with,

452
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:21,927
her sister has the power to freeze.
A witch with that kind of power

453
00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:24,683
could have taken Pirelli from the limo
without us even knowing it.

454
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:27,723
Another coincidence.

455
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:32,565
The witch you bedded, just happens
to be the one who is on to us.

456
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:35,440
Let me prove my loyalties.

457
00:29:37,449 --> 00:29:41,328
Let me go to the witches,
get Pirelli, bring him back.

458
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:44,842
Then you can pass judgement.

459
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:50,847
Are you saving us, brother...

460
00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:54,481
...or leading us into a trap?

461
00:29:58,249 --> 00:29:59,398
Go.

462
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:07,405
If he's telling the truth, help him.
If he's not...

463
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,925
...kill him.

464
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:24,359
- Cole. Oh, my God, I've been so...
- No, don't.

465
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:26,008
It's too dangerous.

466
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,043
What do you mean?
What's the matter?

467
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:31,444
Just trust me. Where's Pirelli?

468
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:33,806
At the manor, in the basement.

469
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:36,519
- So you do have him.
- Yeah, of course.

470
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:39,607
- What's your plan?
- Our plan is to vanquish the demon

471
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:42,647
that took his place,
before the merger vote.

472
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:45,966
No, you can't.
That would be a huge mistake.

473
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:48,047
Why?

474
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:51,158
- Cole, you're scaring me.
- You should be scared.

475
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:53,200
You have no idea
who you're up against.

476
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:54,888
Oh, don't I?

477
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:59,165
Cole, what's happening to you?
What aren't you telling me?

478
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:02,366
I'm telling you to stay out of this.
All right?

479
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:07,284
Don't do anything, just go back home,
wait to hear from me.

480
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:10,686
I mean it.

481
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:23,326
- Hey, how did it go?
- I'm not sure, actually.

482
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:26,521
- What does that mean?
- I don't know, it was strange.

483
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:29,567
He was strange, almost mean.

484
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:33,362
But he doesn't want us to go after
the demon, he wants us to wait here.

485
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:35,082
- What? Why?
- He didn't say.

486
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:38,328
It doesn't make sense.
The whole thing doesn't make sense.

487
00:31:39,209 --> 00:31:40,722
I think he's in trouble.

488
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:43,403
- Either that or...
- Or he's turned.

489
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:46,318
No, I don't believe that.

490
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:48,878
There's gotta be a good reason
Cole's doing what he's doing.

491
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:06,882
- How did they know where we live?
- How do you think?

492
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:11,325
- What is that?
- Demon-be-gone.

493
00:32:18,969 --> 00:32:21,039
- You were right, the potion worked.
- What potion?

494
00:32:21,209 --> 00:32:25,441
Okay, that was way too easy.
Oh, my God, Pirelli. Pirelli.

495
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,367
Cole!

496
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:39,799
What do you think now?

497
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:52,839
All right, we need to get going, the
merger vote's in less than 30 minutes.

498
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:56,001
Why didn't you tell me you kept
some of the potion to kill Cole with?

499
00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:00,082
Well, it's a good thing she did.
It came in pretty handy.

500
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:01,921
Look, Phoebe,
I'm sorry I didn't tell you

501
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:06,002
but the truth is, until recently,
I didn't really trust Cole.

502
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:08,404
I sort of felt like
I had to protect us just in case.

503
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,525
Just in case what,
he tried to kill us?

504
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:12,720
It wouldn't be the first time.

505
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:15,084
Well, it wouldn't.
Look, I know you love him.

506
00:33:15,249 --> 00:33:16,967
And we all know that he loves you.

507
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:20,724
But sending demons to kidnap our
innocent kind of speaks for itself.

508
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:23,763
You were right. We never should have
let him go under.

509
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:28,920
I still think this is all part of
some plan of his. It has to be.

510
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:31,280
Okay, but right now
we need to stick to our plan,

511
00:33:31,449 --> 00:33:33,644
which is to vanquish
the demon impostor.

512
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:36,522
Cole said not to. He said it was
a huge mistake, and I believe him.

513
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:39,318
Okay, but we don't.

514
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:42,444
All right, come on, you guys,
we really have to get going.

515
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:44,998
The vote's three to one, Pheebs.
You coming?

516
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,760
You cost me three of my best demons!
What the hell went wrong?!

517
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:52,925
The witches were more prepared
than we thought.

518
00:33:53,129 --> 00:33:54,448
Another coincidence?

519
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:56,480
- I didn't tip them.
- Did he?

520
00:33:56,649 --> 00:33:58,162
He told the witch to go home.

521
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:01,079
Unless it was some sort of code.

522
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:03,483
It wasn't.

523
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:06,284
Look, the plan was to get Pirelli,
I did that.

524
00:34:06,489 --> 00:34:09,606
- Then where is he?
- Somewhere you can't get him.

525
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:12,086
Not until I'm sure you won't kill me.

526
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:14,325
And how do I know
you really have him?

527
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:16,759
I was there. He has him.

528
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:19,965
And do I trust you anymore?

529
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,483
It's time. I have to get back.

530
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:32,039
But after the vote,

531
00:34:32,209 --> 00:34:34,677
you'd better deliver Pirelli...

532
00:34:35,209 --> 00:34:36,688
...or I will kill you.

533
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:40,567
No, don't.

534
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:42,442
Don't what?

535
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:44,641
Don't go.

536
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:47,081
I know these witches, Vornac.

537
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:49,803
Now I've kidnapped Pirelli,
they'll do anything to stop us.

538
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:53,684
They'll try to vanquish you,
and they have the potion to do it too.

539
00:34:57,009 --> 00:34:59,125
But will they vanquish you?

540
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:08,407
The vote's in, demon guy, you lose.

541
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:10,682
Piper, wait.

542
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,169
- Cole?
- Surprised?

543
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:16,047
What are you doing here?

544
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:21,198
- Where's the demon?
- He sent me instead, might be a test.

545
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:22,444
I think he's on to us.

546
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:25,967
On to us? You make it sound like
we're working together.

547
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:28,843
- Aren't we?
- Who are you kidding?

548
00:35:29,009 --> 00:35:31,569
We should have vanquished you
on the spot. Where's Pirelli?

549
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,082
He's safe.

550
00:35:33,249 --> 00:35:35,558
Cole, where is he?

551
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:37,724
Where else would he be?

552
00:35:38,529 --> 00:35:40,042
The safest place you know...

553
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:45,007
...the mausoleum.
- Isn't that what we agreed to?

554
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:47,564
No, unfortunately it isn't.

555
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:50,208
Phoebe!

556
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:04,567
But how did you know?
Did you know?

557
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:08,007
The safest place that Cole knows
is with me.

558
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:10,080
He said so.

559
00:36:13,009 --> 00:36:14,488
Easy. Easy.

560
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:16,765
I know I'm not very popular
right now,

561
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:19,159
but let the condemned man
have his last words.

562
00:36:20,129 --> 00:36:22,563
I had no choice
but to play it this way.

563
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:24,924
They were so suspicious of me
I had to make everyone,

564
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:27,967
especially you, believe I was evil.

565
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:29,238
Or I was dead.

566
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:31,566
Some of us still think you're evil.

567
00:36:32,249 --> 00:36:34,524
All right, so why did that demon
impersonate you?

568
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:36,083
He didn't trust me.

569
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:38,640
Wanted to find out whose side
I was really on.

570
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:42,200
I knew you wouldn't fall for it.

571
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:45,086
- What about Pirelli?
- I had to make you think

572
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:47,046
I'd actually betrayed you.

573
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:49,999
To give you motivation to kill Vornac
and me.

574
00:36:55,729 --> 00:36:57,162
Forgive me.

575
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,405
I never doubted you.
Well, maybe just a little.

576
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:12,399
You'd better get Leo to the
mausoleum, get Pirelli back here

577
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:14,605
- before the merger.
- Can't you get Pirelli?

578
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:17,886
No. I have to get back.

579
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:21,041
You can't go back now.

580
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:23,602
Just to cover my tracks.

581
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:26,120
I don't want those guys
hunting me down.

582
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:34,688
I'll be out before your graduation
party tonight, I promise.

583
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:46,078
- You saw the witches kill Vornac?
- No. I saw what was left.

584
00:37:46,249 --> 00:37:48,319
So I went to kill Pirelli,
but he was gone.

585
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:50,605
I can only assume
the witches found him.

586
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,363
This is a disaster.
What are we gonna tell Raynor?

587
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:55,560
He wants a full accounting,
you know.

588
00:37:57,289 --> 00:38:02,363
Tell him I warned Vornac not to go,
but he didn't listen.

589
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:03,888
And now I have to go.

590
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:06,000
Go? Where?

591
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:10,441
I still have to find proof
for The Source to clear my name.

592
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:12,361
I can't very well do that here,
can I?

593
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:15,242
See you soon, my brother.

594
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:21,403
You can't go. Raynor wants
a full accounting, from you.

595
00:38:22,449 --> 00:38:24,246
You can fill him in.

596
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:26,286
You know just as much as I do.

597
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:40,405
You were right, Raynor.

598
00:38:42,729 --> 00:38:45,527
Belthazor has much to explain.

599
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:48,005
And much to answer for.

600
00:38:57,689 --> 00:38:59,759
Congratulations, Phoebe.

601
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,927
Why can't we ever throw a party
or have a wedding,

602
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:13,559
or just live our lives
without evil screwing it up?

603
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:17,165
She'll start celebrating
as soon as Cole shows up.

604
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:18,921
What if he doesn't?

605
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:20,966
What if he can't?

606
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:29,361
Look, whatever happens,
he did the right thing.

607
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:32,686
I mean he helped us get Pirelli back
in time to cancel the merger.

608
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:36,524
- He helped us stop the Brotherhood.
- He proved he was good.

609
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:37,878
Yeah, but at what cost?

610
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:41,288
- You can't really think of it like that.
- Why not?

611
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:45,045
Shouldn't I get to protect
one part of my life and say,

612
00:39:45,209 --> 00:39:49,327
"This, magic doesn't screw with,
this I get to keep."

613
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,248
Yes, you should.

614
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:56,005
Last night Cole was back,
and he wanted to strip his powers...

615
00:39:56,569 --> 00:39:58,799
...and I was graduating.

616
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:01,883
Yesterday everything was perfect.

617
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:06,002
And today it's all fallen apart.

618
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:09,517
Where is he?

619
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,398
What happened to him?
