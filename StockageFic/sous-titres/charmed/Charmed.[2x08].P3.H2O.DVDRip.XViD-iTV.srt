1
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:32,361
- Third drowning this year.
- Anyone see it happen?

2
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:34,565
- Is that her little girl?
- Get her away from here.

3
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:37,163
- Don't let her see her mom like this.
- Mommy!

4
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:40,805
Are you Prue?
Your gram sent me to find you.

5
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:43,278
Why don't you come
back inside with me, okay?

6
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,921
Mommy!

7
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:57,160
Mommy!

8
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:12,318
- Hello?
- Prue? Are you still on the road?

9
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:15,042
Yeah, traffic's insane.

10
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:17,763
Some guy called from Buckland's

11
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:20,045
and thought you'd be back
from the estate sale already.

12
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:22,439
I was just calling to make sure
you and my car were okay.

13
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,121
- Yeah. We're fine.
- Oh, that's... That's probably Dan.

14
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:28,041
You know, he does live,
like, 20 feet away.

15
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:30,848
I mean, you guys could get
walkie-talkies, two cans, a string.

16
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,283
Point taken, Mom.

17
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:36,925
All right, look, go talk to your boy.
I'll see you later.

18
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,721
Help me!

19
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:33,238
Help!

20
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,357
Help me!

21
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:39,561
No! It's too late.

22
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,201
It's already taken him.

23
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:45,563
Just call 911!

24
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,757
Yeah.

25
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:31,007
- Pouring.
- Chewing.

26
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:33,242
Can't believe you eat that stuff.

27
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:35,684
You guys are killing me
with cuteness over here.

28
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:39,398
Don't you have somewhere to be?
Somewhere very far away?

29
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:42,600
What do you say tomorrow,
when Jenny's at school,

30
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:45,681
- we have breakfast for real?
- I'll take what I can get.

31
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,328
Nausea?

32
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:50,639
What are you doing home? You said
you were heading to the office.

33
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:52,402
Yeah, things changed.

34
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:55,648
- Dan, I have to call you back, okay?
- Okay.

35
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:58,922
Okay, I saw something...

36
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,647
...or someone...

37
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:03,323
...drown. And it was
anything but natural.

38
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:05,207
On the freeway?

39
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:08,645
- No, up at the lake.
- Oh, wait a minute.

40
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,440
The lake as in the lake?
Where Mom was killed?

41
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:15,327
You said you were stuck in traffic.

42
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:19,319
Yeah, I was, after the lake.
I just go there sometimes to think.

43
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:21,241
You never told us that.

44
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,365
Because I didn't wanna make
a big deal out of it.

45
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:25,042
Anyway, this isn't about Mom,
all right?

46
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:28,440
I saw someone get pulled under.
I tried to help him,

47
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:32,045
but this man stopped me and said,
"It's already taken him."

48
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:33,642
Do you think he knows
what happened?

49
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:36,403
Could. Which means
I need to get to Buckland's

50
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,288
to drop stuff off
and get back up to that lake.

51
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:42,608
Wait a minute, Prue,
aren't you kind of missing the point?

52
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:43,997
How can you think
whatever you saw

53
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:46,125
didn't have something to do
with how Mom died?

54
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:48,280
Look, we need to stop
worrying about the past

55
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,883
and start dealing with the present.
They're reopening camp.

56
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:52,801
I thought they closed it
the summer that Mom...

57
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:56,803
Exactly. And no one has been
allowed in the lake since.

58
00:05:56,969 --> 00:05:58,482
And if there's something in it killing,

59
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,879
then the last thing we need
is a lake full of kids.

60
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:02,846
Well, how do we find the guy
that stopped you?

61
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,284
What about the woman who used
to run the camp? Mrs Johnson?

62
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,519
If she's still up there,
she probably knows who he is.

63
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:09,082
She's still there, same cabin.

64
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:11,719
So I guess you go
up there to think a lot.

65
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,124
I'll meet you guys up at the lake.
I should be there in an hour.

66
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:19,601
Do you really think the thing she saw
has nothing to do with how Mom died?

67
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:22,363
- Nope. You?
- Not a chance.

68
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,727
- What are you doing here?
- Pondering the possibilities.

69
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,198
- Of?
- Redecoration.

70
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:36,918
Where's your flair in this place,
the panache?

71
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:39,319
- The Prue?
- Well,

72
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:41,639
I don't really think that's
any of your business, Jack.

73
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:44,369
Now, if you don't mind,
I have a lot of work to do,

74
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,362
so perhaps you could go annoy
somebody down the hall.

75
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:49,042
Actually, already did.

76
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,279
Signed the dotted line,
they sent me to my office.

77
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:54,088
- Your office?
- Well, it's only temporary, of course,

78
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:56,479
until mine is ready.

79
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,526
Wait, you think
that you're working here?

80
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:01,761
Well, you said we couldn't date
and work together,

81
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:05,888
so since you won't date me,
one out of the two will have to do.

82
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:09,720
And you consider that
proper work attire.

83
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,686
Hey, if you can get away
with wearing that,

84
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,487
I can certainly get away
with wearing this.

85
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:17,279
No wonder nobody gets any work
done around here. You look:

86
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:20,320
Flattery will get you nowhere.

87
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:22,161
Well, got me this job.

88
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:25,480
Okay, look, I have to go take care
of some personal things.

89
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:29,767
So until I get back, let's just employ
a hands-off policy, meaning,

90
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,999
don't touch anything.

91
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:37,918
Tell you what. Take your time. I'll sit
back here and make myself comfy.

92
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:46,405
It's really nice form, but the dismount
could use a little work.

93
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:48,966
Meant to do that.

94
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:57,043
Well, I'm finding it hard to believe
enough time's gone by

95
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,518
for you to have grown up
so much. Here.

96
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:01,921
Oh, look at little Prue.

97
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:04,364
- Nice pigtails, Piper.
- Not fair.

98
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:09,080
No, what's not fair is that I never
got to go to camp with you guys.

99
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:12,803
We heard you were thinking
of opening up the camp again.

100
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:17,642
Was. I thought it was over,
and then today, another drowning.

101
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:21,199
I can't ask the campers
to go swimming in the lake when...

102
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:24,765
We were wondering if you might
help us with something.

103
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:28,239
Prue was up here the other day,
and she mentioned a man.

104
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:30,161
Older, a bit off.

105
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:32,889
I think the word
that she used was "crazy."

106
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,801
We were wondering
if you might know who he is.

107
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,678
Oh, Sam. Only one it could be.
Man's not wired together properly.

108
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:40,601
He showed up
when the drownings started.

109
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,364
And then just stayed here.
No friends, no life of his own.

110
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:48,442
You know, somebody like that, you
have to wonder what he's capable of.

111
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:07,485
Mrs J., you remember my sister Prue?

112
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:12,359
Oh, Prue. Of course I do.
How good to see you.

113
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:16,078
Wow, you're looking more and more
like your mother every day.

114
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:19,363
Actually, it's Piper
who resembles her the most.

115
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:26,602
People see a little of her
in each of us, I think.

116
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:30,764
Of course. Well, will you come
see me again?

117
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:32,647
The old broad gets lonely up here.

118
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:35,926
- I love to see my campers.
- Sure.

119
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,204
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

120
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,597
- Bye.
- Bye.

121
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:48,361
She's not opening the camp, Prue.

122
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,281
Really? So that means
it's just between us

123
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:52,599
and whatever's hiding in that lake.

124
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:56,079
- Any word on the crazy guy?
- His name is Sam, and he lives right...

125
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:02,446
- Hello. This is Prue.
- Hey. How's my favourite auctionette?

126
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:07,285
- Fine. How's my favourite auction ass?
- Oh, nice one.

127
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:10,168
Hey, listen, I just wanted to let you
know that since you're not here,

128
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:12,365
I'm gonna take your 12:00 lunch
with Mr Fujimoto.

129
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,008
No. No, no, no, wait.

130
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:17,320
- Mr Fujimoto is very particular.
- Prue, would you relax?

131
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:21,402
I will take great care of your client,
okay? Later.

132
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:27,849
I just cannot figure out
what this guy's deal is.

133
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,204
That's funny, we were just gonna
ask you the same thing.

134
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:31,597
Excuse me?

135
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:34,644
Every time someone compares you
to Mom, you flinch.

136
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:37,482
- It's a compliment, not a curse.
- Is it?

137
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:40,209
Every single day, I feel like I'm
becoming more and more like her,

138
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:42,121
and every day, it terrifies me.

139
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,359
- Prue...
- I mean, don't you guys see it?

140
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,047
Look at what happened to her and
then look at what's happening to me.

141
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:51,519
No successful relationship with guys,
being responsible for a family

142
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:54,362
and now, because of this
being-charmed thing,

143
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:58,118
the very real possibility of dying young.
It's like history is repeating itself.

144
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:01,087
- Prue, that's all just...
- Coincidence?

145
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:04,919
I thought that we had figured out that
nothing is a coincidence in our lives.

146
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:06,807
Like me being here
when that thing attacked.

147
00:11:06,969 --> 00:11:08,482
It's like I was meant to be here.

148
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:10,640
Well, you're not exactly
meant to be here

149
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:12,959
when you're here every week.

150
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:17,998
All right, look, I just wanna
find this Sam guy,

151
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:22,526
see what he knows about the demon,
vanquish it and get on with our lives.

152
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:23,801
Sam?

153
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:28,683
Be very, very quiet.

154
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,680
We're hunting demons.

155
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:33,287
I guess he's not home.

156
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:45,606
- Oh, my.
- What?

157
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:48,358
- What is it?
- Mom.

158
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:51,089
What is he doing
with a picture of her?

159
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:53,843
- Who is this guy?
- Or what?

160
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:59,608
Okay, he has articles
on every single drowning at the lake.

161
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:05,879
"New York teacher of the year,
Sam Wilder."

162
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:07,368
In 1872?

163
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:11,727
Okay, so this guy is
either 127 years old or...

164
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:13,842
A demon.

165
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:17,081
Named Sam? A demon
named Sam? I mean,

166
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:19,399
can't it just be
his grandfather's certificate?

167
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:21,878
After all, he did save me.

168
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:25,406
What are these? I found...

169
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:28,246
Leo? Hi. What are doing here?

170
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,445
We gotta get out of here.
Sam could be back any minute.

171
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,327
- Wait, you know Sam?
- Come on. We gotta...

172
00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:36,164
We are not going anywhere until you
tell us what you know. Who is Sam?

173
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,083
Sam was...

174
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:41,562
...your mom's whitelighter.

175
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,479
Sam was Mom's whitelighter?

176
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:57,719
Emphasis on "was."

177
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,922
When your mom died,
Sam clipped his wings.

178
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,728
He's mortal now, but once,
yeah, he was...

179
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:06,687
He was a whitelighter.
He looked after your mother.

180
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:08,202
Then he lost our mom.

181
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,087
To the same demon
you're fighting now.

182
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,809
And you knew? This whole time,
he's been living up here while...?

183
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:16,006
I couldn't tell you.
And what would it change?

184
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:20,082
You know, it would only distract you.
Maybe even gotten you killed.

185
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:24,283
You guys were gonna have to face
this thing sooner or later.

186
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:28,007
I'm here to make sure that you do it
with a clear head.

187
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:30,364
Emotions will get the best of you
if you let them.

188
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:34,363
- Well, can you really blame us?
- Leo, he let our mother die.

189
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,727
Leo's right, this isn't about Mom.

190
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,320
And it's not about Sam,
for that matter.

191
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:42,367
It's about a demon who's waiting
till tomorrow for brunch to be served.

192
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:44,201
Mrs J. Is not opening the camp.

193
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:46,041
That doesn't end it, it just stalls it.

194
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,040
You guys are behind
and need to catch up.

195
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:50,279
Book of Shadows, get
a working knowledge of this demon

196
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:51,723
before you face him.

197
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:54,801
Said like an unfeeling professional.

198
00:14:54,969 --> 00:14:56,448
This is personal for us, Leo.

199
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:59,919
Leo doesn't do personal anymore,
he just does his job.

200
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,481
Now that I've done it,

201
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:07,880
guess there's no other reason
for me to hang around.

202
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:14,759
Okay, he's gone.
Now you can explain.

203
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:16,920
- Explain what?
- Why you're acting like all of this

204
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:19,000
doesn't faze you, Prue.

205
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,729
We are talking about
how our mother was killed.

206
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:24,637
Help! Oh, please, somebody!
Help me!

207
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:26,481
Is that Mrs Johnson?

208
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:29,444
Please help me!

209
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,081
Please help!

210
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:39,561
Help me, please. Help!

211
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:41,845
Your hand! Give me your hand!

212
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:45,238
Prue, what are you doing?
We need you!

213
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:49,202
Mommy!

214
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:52,247
Get off the dock! It's her!

215
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:56,319
It's taken her over!

216
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,605
- Oh, my...
- God!

217
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:01,884
Damn it, get off the dock now!

218
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:11,878
Why didn't you listen to me?

219
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:15,246
I told you to stay away from the lake.
It only kills in the water.

220
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,845
Why didn't you listen to me?
Nobody ever listens!

221
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:20,284
We know who you are.

222
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:22,007
You shouldn't listen
to people in town.

223
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:24,444
They'll just tell you I'm crazy.
But I'm not.

224
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,242
We know you worked
with our mother.

225
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:28,320
And lost her.

226
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:32,407
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

227
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,679
And then when I saw you...

228
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:37,647
It's in your eyes. Your mother.

229
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:40,084
You have no right talking about her.

230
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,047
You lost that right when you lost her.

231
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:45,083
Why are we dealing with him?

232
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:46,682
Because we need to know
what he knows.

233
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:48,202
You have to tell us
about the demon.

234
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:49,768
No. No, you can't fight this thing.

235
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:52,443
It's made of water, but it has a...
It thinks.

236
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:55,077
You never know where it's gonna be,
who it's gonna be.

237
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:59,162
Sometimes it takes over its victims'
bodies to lure you to the water.

238
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:02,002
But sometimes it doesn't.
Leave now, please.

239
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:04,444
Forget you ever came here.
Forget you ever knew.

240
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,918
How can we do that?
I mean, it's out there killing.

241
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,602
We can't just walk away.

242
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:10,839
You really wanna know
what I know?

243
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,363
I know you're not strong enough

244
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:16,646
or well-versed enough in your powers
to take this thing on.

245
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:19,960
I know that you have the same power
as your mother, the power to freeze.

246
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:23,280
And you know what happened
when she tried to used it.

247
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,198
And I know you'll let your emotions
get in the way.

248
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,486
You'll lose focus, and you'll lose
your life. That's what I know.

249
00:17:31,129 --> 00:17:34,565
Well, you obviously don't know us
that well, because we're not leaving.

250
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:39,279
Strong, wilful. Just like Patty.

251
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:41,644
I'm nothing like my mother.

252
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:43,880
But you're here.

253
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:46,565
- Just like she was.
- But we'll beat it.

254
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:50,045
Now you have one choice.

255
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,202
You can either get onboard
or get the hell out of the way.

256
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:55,884
The power of three. Okay, okay.

257
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:01,126
If you're gonna do this, then you're
gonna need me to help you.

258
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,166
All right, enough of this.
How do we kill it?

259
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:05,564
You don't.

260
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:13,238
Now, you're gonna go home,
and you're gonna go directly to bed.

261
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:16,526
And when you wake up tomorrow, you
will not remember coming to the lake

262
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:18,919
or discovering the demon
or meeting me.

263
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:26,039
Can't let it happen again.

264
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:43,285
I fell asleep, woke up,
and suddenly it's Thursday.

265
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:46,085
I don't feel so good.

266
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:50,167
- What is that?
- I don't know. I itch everywhere.

267
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:52,325
That looks like the time
Prue got poison ivy.

268
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:54,684
But Prue got poison ivy
at camp, and...

269
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:09,040
You don't look hungry.

270
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:11,167
You look confused.

271
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,201
And you're contagious.

272
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:15,321
- Dan, what are you doing...?
- Breakfast.

273
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:18,648
Me, you, here.

274
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:20,962
Remember?

275
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:22,847
Everything's a little hazy
this morning.

276
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:25,569
Well, is there anything I can do?

277
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:30,889
You could hold that thought.

278
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:35,209
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here? I live here.

279
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:37,883
What are you, checking up on me
and Dan? We talked about this.

280
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:40,483
It has nothing to do with him.
Why aren't you up at the lake?

281
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:41,968
What lake?

282
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:47,448
Look, nobody shut down the camp,
so the kids are on their way there now.

283
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:51,797
- He did it, didn't he?
- Did what?

284
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:53,004
Who did what? Who is he?

285
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:57,407
Sam used a powder,
sort of like a supernatural mickey.

286
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,208
- Must have got it from...
- Mom.

287
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:02,289
Good. It's fading. Now, concentrate.
It's kind of like

288
00:20:02,449 --> 00:20:03,723
remembering a dream.

289
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:07,923
Okay, the lake, the kids,
the demon, Sam.

290
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:11,487
Sam? Why would he do this to us?

291
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:14,368
To keep history from repeating itself.

292
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,847
Oh, just a sec. You guys, scoot.
Go, go, go, go, go.

293
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:28,239
Dan, I know we were
supposed to do this this morning,

294
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:32,004
- but I'm really not feeling up to it.
- Well, I'll cook while you scratch.

295
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:36,398
I can't. There's just some stuff,
family stuff, going on.

296
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,447
Say no more.
I completely understand.

297
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:42,323
- I'd kiss you, but...
- But you're contagious. Tomorrow.

298
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,887
I'm just glad you can tell me things.

299
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:49,286
Well, I feel like
I can tell you anything.

300
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,007
- Except that there's a demon.
- And that you're a witch.

301
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:03,009
- Sorry, that was...
- The truth.

302
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:05,488
We should go get dressed.

303
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:08,766
The only place that you are going,
contagious girl,

304
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:10,567
- Why are you hitting me?
- Is back to bed.

305
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,526
- But...
- But nothing.

306
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:16,443
You just look in that Book of Shadows
for this thing's Achilles heel.

307
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:20,045
- But what if there isn't one?
- Then we're screwed.

308
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:49,926
Okay. How are we doing
in the plan department?

309
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,239
- I think I just got one.
- I love when you take charge.

310
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:54,286
Okay, you know that powder
that Sam used on us?

311
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:55,802
Maybe we should use it on the kids,

312
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:58,437
make them temporarily forget
that they wanna go in the water.

313
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,646
That will keep them safe until we figure
out a way to dehydrate this bastard.

314
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:03,083
- Perfect.
- Right.

315
00:22:04,729 --> 00:22:06,845
- Prepubescent demon food.
- Okay, go.

316
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:10,206
Keep them out of the water.
Tell them anything. I'll deal with Sam.

317
00:22:19,449 --> 00:22:22,247
I knew I should have given you
a stronger dose.

318
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:25,480
Not only did you put my sisters
and me in danger,

319
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:27,685
but you risked innocents' lives.
How could you?

320
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:30,409
I did what I had to
to protect you and your sisters.

321
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:32,207
Not that.

322
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:34,487
This.

323
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:36,162
All these years.

324
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:40,843
How could you just sit here
and watch them die?

325
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,727
People that you were meant
to protect.

326
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:46,848
Well, in case you didn't get the memo,
I'm not one of the good guys anymore.

327
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:48,840
Part of you is.

328
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,082
Part of you always will be.

329
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:54,406
I've done nothing but make your life
difficult. What makes you so sure?

330
00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:56,967
Because you saved me.

331
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:02,681
You still have
whitelighter instincts, Sam.

332
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:06,279
You may have clipped your wings,
but this still gets you. It matters.

333
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:12,925
What matters most
was taken from me 20 years ago.

334
00:23:15,489 --> 00:23:18,049
Then we have something in common.

335
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:22,280
You think I chose to stay here,
to watch?

336
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:24,679
That I get my kicks this way?

337
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:29,166
- I've been waiting for you.
- Why?

338
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:31,399
I knew you'd come.

339
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:34,242
And I had to be here to stop you.

340
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:37,000
To save you.

341
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:40,245
Because you couldn't save Mom?

342
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:47,765
Sam, I need the powder.

343
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,561
And then I'm gonna need
for you to tell me

344
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,321
how Mom was gonna
vanquish this thing.

345
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:55,727
If you're gonna defeat
your demons, Sam,

346
00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:59,359
then you're gonna have to help us
defeat the one out there.

347
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:02,405
We need your help.

348
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:18,727
I'll try and face mine.

349
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:22,479
Question is, can you face yours?

350
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:36,199
Can't find anything.

351
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:37,722
Then you don't
have to stay with me.

352
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:40,005
Looks of sympathy are not
part of your job description.

353
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:41,648
I know.

354
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:43,561
And why didn't
your healing touch work?

355
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:46,402
I mean, you can save a life,
but you can't cure poison ivy?

356
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,161
It's not really up to me.

357
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:51,765
I can only heal when they allow me to,
when I'm meant to.

358
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:53,885
Well, why wouldn't you
be meant to help me?

359
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:58,002
Why wouldn't I be meant
to help my sisters?

360
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:00,364
There's always a reason.

361
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:02,804
Maybe you're meant to be here.

362
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,804
"Dear Sam..."

363
00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:13,844
- Leo.
- What is it?

364
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:17,799
Letters that my mom wrote to Sam.

365
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:21,518
I must have forgotten about them
because of the powder.

366
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:22,838
"Dear Sam, where are you?

367
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:25,682
It's been two weeks since you
were last here, and I wonder,

368
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:29,398
are you all right? Do they have you
off guiding someone?

369
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:34,040
And I wonder when they will send you
back to San Francisco, to me."

370
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:36,165
Is this a...?

371
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:38,399
A love letter?

372
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:44,841
Okay. How about Red Rover?

373
00:25:46,729 --> 00:25:49,448
All right, all right, how about
Thumbs Up, Seven Up?

374
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:52,687
Okay.

375
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:54,758
Lanyards.

376
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,521
This sucks.
We wanna go swimming.

377
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,281
Yeah!

378
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:03,044
Oh, you know, I could have done that.

379
00:26:03,209 --> 00:26:06,519
- Did you get the powder?
- Oh, I got that and more.

380
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:10,559
- You didn't have to bring him.
- Yes, I did.

381
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,484
Okay, you go deal with that,

382
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:14,128
- I'll take care of this.
- Okay.

383
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:19,764
- Piper?
- Piper? I hardly know her.

384
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:22,204
Jack. Okay, well, I'm sort of
in the middle of something.

385
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:24,678
Yadda yadda yadda. Look,
I'm gonna conference Mr Fujimoto

386
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,487
about the carousel horse, okay?
Hold on.

387
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:29,243
- No, no, no, wait...
- Hello?

388
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:31,560
Mr Fujimoto, hi.

389
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:33,202
Miss Halliwell, have you seen it?

390
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:35,121
No, I'm looking at the object

391
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:37,086
- right now.
- How is it?

392
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:39,399
Well, yeah, you can tell
by the jewelled choker

393
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:41,207
that it's an original carousel horse

394
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:44,725
from the 1939 world fair
in New York City, and...

395
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:46,607
And, Mr Fujimoto,
there's another thing

396
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:48,725
you should probably know
about the piece.

397
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:50,481
This is a great piece,

398
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:55,279
and I really think you want to have
the first chance at it.

399
00:26:56,969 --> 00:26:59,961
Okay, good. Good. Well, I'll have
the paperwork sent over today.

400
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:02,689
- Sounds like a good idea.
- All right. Bye, now.

401
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:07,165
So who are you crediting
as the sales agent, Jack?

402
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:10,079
Prue, do you not trust me?

403
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:24,006
Okay. Now, remember, kids,
on your way to bed, water bad.

404
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:28,560
Land good. Water bad. Land good.

405
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:33,686
"Sam, yes, you were clear.
My eyes are open to the difficulties,

406
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:35,805
the risks, but my answer is the same

407
00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:38,039
as it was when you were
still here with me.

408
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:41,645
No one understands me
the way you do. No one can."

409
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:45,279
"What I wouldn't do for
what other people consider ordinary.

410
00:27:45,449 --> 00:27:50,284
Conversation that gets finished,
a night spent uninterrupted,

411
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:52,280
a night with you."

412
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:56,838
It's like I could have written these.

413
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,681
I wish you had.

414
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:00,841
What would it have changed?

415
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:08,198
Looks like this one's
about our water demon.

416
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:10,007
"You can't be with me up at the lake.

417
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:13,002
This demon is too strong,
and I can't risk losing you,

418
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:15,478
not for myself
or the others you protect.

419
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:17,958
They must, as always, come first.

420
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,162
You know I'd never face this demon
if I didn't think

421
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:24,844
I'd be home in time for dinner
to see my girls,

422
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:26,965
to see you."

423
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:31,083
She never came home.

424
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:33,806
When did this happen?
Where was Dad?

425
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:37,087
Your sisters need to know
about Sam and your mom, Piper.

426
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,160
And if this demon is as strong
as she thought,

427
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:43,447
then they're going to need me. But
how can we get up there in time to...?

428
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:47,527
Can you? I mean,
is it breaking the rules?

429
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:50,522
What rules haven't we already broken?

430
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:53,366
I'll have to hold you.

431
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:09,517
It's time, Sam. We need to know.
How was Mom gonna vanquish it?

432
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:13,641
I don't know.

433
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:16,767
I failed, I lost her. Isn't that enough?

434
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:19,560
Whoa, that felt really...

435
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:21,526
All right, laying down now.

436
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:24,366
What are you guys doing here?

437
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,281
- He loved her.
- What?

438
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:28,679
Who loved who?
What is she talking about?

439
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:29,884
Sam.

440
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:33,602
Found the letters, Sam.

441
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,925
Patty and I...

442
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:40,364
Fell in love.

443
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:45,119
In her letter, she told you to stay away,
not to go to the lake.

444
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:47,765
But I did.

445
00:29:48,449 --> 00:29:51,361
I wouldn't have for anyone else.

446
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:53,042
If I had just followed the rules,

447
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,120
not fallen in love,
I never would have been there,

448
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:58,361
I never would have distracted her,
and she never would have died.

449
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:01,766
You loved her,
and you blame yourself.

450
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,599
Well, don't you blame me?

451
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:07,558
Every day, I wake up,
and for just a second,

452
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:10,448
just a second, I think
maybe it didn't happen, maybe...

453
00:30:13,449 --> 00:30:15,758
Yes, I blame myself.

454
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:19,566
We have to see past our emotions
to deal with this, Sam. So do you.

455
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:23,207
Even so, it doesn't change
the fact that I...

456
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:25,724
I didn't see what happened.

457
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:28,881
- I tried to warn her, and she froze me.
- Why?

458
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:31,165
Because she was
trying to protect him.

459
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,849
Protecting was
supposed to be my job.

460
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,639
I couldn't help her,
I don't know how I can help you.

461
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:41,243
I didn't see what happened.

462
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:43,800
I know somebody
who can see anything.

463
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:49,767
No. Wait a minute.

464
00:30:50,489 --> 00:30:54,118
You tiptoe around the subject of Mom,
you deny looking like her.

465
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:56,280
You can't even go
to the end of that dock,

466
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:59,043
because you're afraid
to walk in her footsteps.

467
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:04,283
And now you want me
to relive her last moment?

468
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:07,481
- How is that fair?
- It's not.

469
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:11,559
None of this is,
Mom's death, Sam's guilt.

470
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:13,720
But I'm asking you to help me end it.

471
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:46,085
Hey, look out! Look out!

472
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:04,125
Did you see her?

473
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,322
Lt...

474
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,125
It entered her.

475
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:12,168
It drowned her from the inside.

476
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:16,202
Phoebe, in your vision,
what was Mom doing?

477
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:19,839
She was using something
on the dock, some...

478
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,124
- A wire?
- A power cable?

479
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:27,282
Makes sense. Electricity is the only
thing that separates water particles.

480
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:29,638
So...

481
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:31,888
...what do we do differently?

482
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:34,768
Maybe nothing. Sam,
would Mom's plan have worked

483
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:36,965
- if she had finished it?
- Absolutely.

484
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:40,644
But you said her power, my power,
it doesn't work against this demon.

485
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,960
So that's it.

486
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:50,880
We use Mom's plan
with one difference.

487
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:54,324
The witch at the end of the dock
is not gonna be the one

488
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:56,923
with the power to freeze.

489
00:32:58,489 --> 00:33:00,207
It's gonna be me.

490
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:12,081
Are you ready?

491
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:13,967
Yeah.

492
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:16,848
- You don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

493
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:19,159
Just focus on the demon.
That's what this is about.

494
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,287
Right.

495
00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:25,284
I forgot how good this feels.

496
00:33:26,209 --> 00:33:27,847
Really?

497
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:30,999
How's it feel to be mortal?

498
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:33,879
Why would you wanna know?

499
00:33:52,889 --> 00:33:55,084
Let's go face our demons.

500
00:34:14,729 --> 00:34:16,924
Okay, you in the water...

501
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:20,203
...I know that you've been
waiting for this...

502
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:22,807
...for me.

503
00:34:23,249 --> 00:34:24,967
Well, here I am,
so come and get me.

504
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,599
You took what mattered most to me.

505
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:32,886
And as long as I live,
you will never kill again.

506
00:34:39,529 --> 00:34:41,281
- Look out!
- Prue, behind you!

507
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:43,321
Piper, wait!

508
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:46,318
No!

509
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:52,679
Not her! Take me!

510
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,606
Stay back!

511
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:04,283
Now!

512
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:14,840
No. Sam.

513
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:20,480
It's gone, it's gone.

514
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:24,005
Leo, do something.

515
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,801
What? Why isn't
anything happening?

516
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:32,443
Because it's not meant to.

517
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:36,444
- It's okay. It's time to go.
- No.

518
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:39,402
I did what I've been waiting to do.

519
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:42,322
I kept it from happening.
History won't repeat itself.

520
00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:46,086
- But you're going.
- I'm gonna see Patty again.

521
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:50,445
Don't lose her.

522
00:35:58,009 --> 00:35:58,998
Patty?

523
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:05,767
Patty?

524
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:11,603
Say hi for me. For us.

525
00:36:51,729 --> 00:36:53,481
Jack.

526
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:56,641
I have something to say, okay?

527
00:36:56,809 --> 00:36:59,482
I have worked at Buckland's
for a year and a half.

528
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:01,879
And in that time, I've survived

529
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:03,926
takeovers, near-bankruptcy

530
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:07,206
and superiors from hell
who've tried to kill me.

531
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:10,167
So whatever it is
that you're planning to do

532
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,638
or have already done,

533
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:15,607
nothing, and I mean nothing,
will surprise me.

534
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:18,925
I just need you to sign this.

535
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:22,161
It's the confirmation sheet
on the Fujimoto sale.

536
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:24,126
You list me as the sales agent.

537
00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:27,527
Yeah, well, it was your deal,
wasn't it?

538
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:32,077
You covered for me. I'm surprised.

539
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:35,401
So...

540
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:39,767
...what do you say, as a thank you...

541
00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:44,321
...I take you to dinner?

542
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:46,559
But wouldn't that be breaking

543
00:37:46,729 --> 00:37:49,402
one of Prue Halliwell's
rules of etiquette?

544
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:52,648
I've decided that even though
mixing business with pleasure

545
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:56,643
can have its very
nasty consequences...

546
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:02,368
...it can also bear
some fruitful rewards.

547
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:06,362
So...

548
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:10,687
...what's it gonna be?

549
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:13,886
Nasty or fruitful?

550
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:17,839
Well, that depends on
how you do at dinner.

551
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:29,682
At least fighting this demon
came with a consolation prize.

552
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:35,164
I mean, it didn't bring Mom back,
but these brought her closer.

553
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:38,560
It's a good idea, Pheebs,
making a journal out of Mom's letters.

554
00:38:38,729 --> 00:38:40,799
Yeah, it's not as good
as the real thing, though.

555
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:42,842
Nothing is.

556
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,889
Tea. Want some tea?
I'm gonna go get some.

557
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:55,847
Sure.

558
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:04,845
I don't wanna interrupt.

559
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:09,002
I think I can steep and talk
at the same time. Do you want any?

560
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:14,520
It's just this...

561
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:18,443
This whole situation, you know?
Sam, your mom,

562
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:19,883
those letters.

563
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:24,319
He loved her.

564
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:25,717
Like...

565
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:30,047
Like I love you.

566
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:36,040
Leo, we've been through this before.
We both know how we feel, but there...

567
00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:38,200
There are things...

568
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:39,961
...people involved now.

569
00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:42,764
Can you tell Dan the truth, Piper?

570
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:44,960
That's between him and me.

571
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:47,963
You and I have a job to do.

572
00:39:48,129 --> 00:39:51,041
And I thought we agreed
to try and put that first.

573
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:55,279
So did Sam and your mom.
Look at the outcome.

574
00:39:57,209 --> 00:40:00,440
You're leaving, aren't you?
For good this time.

575
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:03,169
I don't know. But I do know

576
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:06,082
we have to stop
working together, because...

577
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:08,400
...I can't stop loving you.

578
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:13,718
Which means I can't do my job.

579
00:40:15,569 --> 00:40:17,685
And I can't do mine.

580
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:23,723
I don't know how to say goodbye.

581
00:40:25,649 --> 00:40:27,207
Don't.

582
00:40:53,169 --> 00:40:54,887
Dan, what are you doing
at the back door?

583
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:56,880
Well, when I knock
on the front door,

584
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:59,119
I just never seem to make it
through the threshold.

585
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:02,286
You hungry?

586
00:41:03,649 --> 00:41:05,480
Are you okay?

587
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:07,328
Yeah, I'm just...

588
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:08,717
I'm fine.

589
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:11,644
Are you sure?
I mean, you can tell me.

590
00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:16,319
I know. I'm just not very hungry.

591
00:41:16,489 --> 00:41:17,478
Come on.

592
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:23,524
Give it a try.

593
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:26,762
Okay, I'll give it a try.
