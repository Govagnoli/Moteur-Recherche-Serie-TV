1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,278
- Thanks, Suzie.
- Sure, Phoebe.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,352
You've never done this before,
have you?

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,511
Hey, online dating, I mean.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,990
Oh, no, I have.
I have, a couple of times.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,395
It's just... It's not my favourite way
to meet people.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,831
- Really, why not?
- Oh, I don't know.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,953
It's just very impersonal,
you know. Too planned.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,596
Well, I have to say, I've... I've met
quite a few interesting women online.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,397
Really? More interesting
than you tend to meet in person?

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,519
What's this?

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,518
Oh, I'm doing an article
on Internet dating.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,076
Wait. Your profile said
that you were looking for romance.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,670
Yeah. Yeah, it... It did.
And l... I kind of am.

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,790
It's just...
My new boss put me up to this.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,797
I didn't really wanna do it.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,918
I'm sorry. You mad?

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,396
No. No, not at all.

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,190
I still have high hopes
for this evening.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,398
Are you all right?

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,669
Yeah. Just hiccups.

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,198
You wait right here.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,833
No, no, no. Pat Benatar
cannot cancel on me.

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,110
I won't be able to replace her
by this weekend.

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,834
- Piper.
- Look, I know I didn't call to confirm,

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,349
but I was busy creating life, okay?

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,916
Look, just let me talk to Pat.
I know she'd understand, really.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,271
Hello? He hung up on me,
that little cretin.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,989
My date is a demon.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,318
What? That guy?

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,350
- But he's so hot.
- Yeah, hot as in flames-of-hell hot.

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,676
I had a premonition.
He devours his victims. I'm next.

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,077
- Freeze the room.
- My sister, the demon magnet.

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,393
Witches. Damn it.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,838
Thank you.

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,070
Now, if you don't mind, I have to
get back to going bankrupt.

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,748
Scratch that. I have to get back
to fighting with my husband.

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,269
- Oh, another fight?
- Yeah, well, you know.

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,675
New parents, two-career couple,
all that kind of stuff.

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,348
We'll figure it out. Now, you gonna
come home with me

40
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,552
or you gonna try
and salvage this evening?

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,911
No. I think my luck has run out.

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,635
<i>Greensleeves was my heart oF gold</i>

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,196
<i>And who but my
Lady Greensleeves</i>

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,473
<i>Yeah, who but my
Lady Greensleeves</i>

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,035
<i>Alas, my love, you do...</i>

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,754
A little down on my luck, sir.
Could you spare some change?

47
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,638
God bless you.

48
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,957
<i>Greensleeves was all my joy</i>

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,669
<i>Greensleeves was my delight</i>

50
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,316
<i>Greensleeves was all my joy</i>

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,433
Begging your pardon, sir.
I meant no disrespect.

52
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,959
I'll just be on me way.

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,751
You know what I hate most
about leprechauns?

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,356
You're all cowards.
You don't deserve your gift.

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,958
And it'll be my pleasure to take it
from every last one of you.

56
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,830
Tough break, Paddy.

57
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,111
You're just the cutest little
Wiccan thing I ever did see.

58
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,912
Yes, you are.

59
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,032
Hot, hot, hot.

60
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,951
Leo! Freaking ever-useless Elders.

61
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,470
What is taking them so long?

62
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,878
- What? What'd he do, what'd I miss?
- Oh, no, it's not Wyatt.

63
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,877
It's a poem that this guy...

64
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,275
At least I hope it's a guy.
- Just e-mailed me.

65
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,596
I thought you didn't like
the online dating thing.

66
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,872
- Oh, believe me, I don't.
- I'm confused.

67
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,038
Okay, look. I can schedule in
five minutes for a sisterly chat,

68
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,673
but then I gotta go.

69
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,678
I cannot schedule in sisterly chat.

70
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,792
I'm telling you, you got
four minutes and 55 seconds.

71
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,913
- Hi.
- Perfect timing, we were just chatting.

72
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,031
- Anything you need to talk about?
- No, I'm good.

73
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,879
- Good, more time for you. Shoot.
- No, I don't need to talk.

74
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,958
It's not like I have any desire
to go meet this Cyrano 73.

75
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,993
It was just research for that
stupid article Jason made me do.

76
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,879
You said his name without swearing.

77
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,832
Does that mean things
are going better at work?

78
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,032
- Oh, no, he's still driving me crazy.
- Didn't he just give you a raise?

79
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,879
Yeah, but that was just a bribe
so I wouldn't quit.

80
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,911
A woman of principles.
I admire that.

81
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,513
- Gotta go.
- Oh, no.

82
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,109
- Damn it. What happened?
- Bye, baby, I love you.

83
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,912
- Tell her, you got three minutes.
- My sweater shrunk.

84
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,431
Come on,
you've worn tighter things than that.

85
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,949
That is not the point.

86
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,230
The demon blood is not coming out.

87
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,953
I can't keep replacing
all my good clothes.

88
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,354
I'm running out of my savings.

89
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,035
Sister, you are preaching
to the choir.

90
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,279
Yeah, well, at least you've got a job.

91
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,278
You know, I cannot afford
to keep paying for this.

92
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,993
Unless

93
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,232
magic reimburses me.

94
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,874
Hello? Personal gain,
consequences.

95
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,275
Do I need to remind you
of the big-boob fiasco?

96
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,036
No, my back still hurts.

97
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,711
Don't worry, I won't do
anything stupid.

98
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,957
Paige, wait. What are you doing?

99
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,628
- Piper, we've got problems.
- Yeah, I know. You're late,

100
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,832
- and it's your turn to watch the baby.
- Not marital problems.

101
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,678
Demonic ones.

102
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,915
- What's taking him so long?
- Patience, Jada. He'll be here.

103
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,749
Maybe we should try
a little target practice

104
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,110
while we wait.

105
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,034
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't kill my pets.

106
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,710
- Where have you been?
- Gathering nuggets.

107
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,119
My last two.
Do you want them or not?

108
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,194
- Name your price.
- No price.

109
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,597
All I ask is your allegiance in my bid
to take over the Underworld.

110
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,952
Consider this my grassroots effort
at gaining support.

111
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,799
What makes you think
you can buy our support?

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,788
Because in exchange, I'll give you
everything you ever dreamed of.

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,831
Do we have a deal?

114
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,632
- But how do we know it worked?
- Trust me. It's your lucky day.

115
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,398
And there it is.

116
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,438
Sorry, can't.

117
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,313
Okay, remember,
just the messenger.

118
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,513
Why do I have the feeling
Jason Dean's name

119
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,915
- is about to be mentioned?
- He had a few

120
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,396
thoughts
on your Internet dating article.

121
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,875
And he wants the rewrite
by tomorrow.

122
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,511
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,395
There is nothing wrong with this.

124
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,556
Actually, there is.
Didn't you see all the red?

125
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,749
Look, this was your idea.

126
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,871
I didn't wanna write the article
in the first place.

127
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,354
And that's how it reads.

128
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,118
Okay, just because
I didn't wanna write it

129
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,799
doesn't mean
that I didn't do my best.

130
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,151
Is that so? Because it's an article
about online dating,

131
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,952
yet you somehow
devoted four paragraphs

132
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,388
to this week's meteor shower.

133
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,319
Well, I think meteor showers
are romantic, okay?

134
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,238
And quite frankly,
a lot less dangerous.

135
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,998
Just because you've had
some bad experiences

136
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,794
doesn't mean they're all bad.
Besides, you're a reporter.

137
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,629
- You're supposed to be unbiased.
- Okay, I am an advice columnist.

138
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,400
And a very biased one,
especially when it comes to romance.

139
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,836
Oh, and you know all about romance,
do you?

140
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,268
Well, I know what women like.

141
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,994
- Do you, now?
- Yes. We like eye contact.

142
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,873
Hello?

143
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,957
Yeah. And conversation
where you could actually see

144
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,993
the other person's lips moving
and long, late-night walks.

145
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,395
And... And candles and roses...

146
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,477
You don't think you can get that
over the Internet?

147
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,240
No, I don't. I think you can get
CDs over the Internet,

148
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,919
books, a purse maybe,

149
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,872
- but not a date.
- You got any plans later?

150
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,036
You do now.
I'm taking you on assignment.

151
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,754
- What? Where? Why?
- To prove something to you.

152
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,349
Six o'clock sharp. I'll pick you up.

153
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,991
There ain't no other option.
If we stay, he'll come for us all.

154
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,556
But abandoning our realm would
mean abandoning the world as well.

155
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,193
Who'd give out the luck?

156
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,231
That's the bloody world's problem,
if you ask me.

157
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,634
I'm for saving our necks.

158
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,831
There's more than just our necks
at stake here.

159
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,598
Sure, fine.

160
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,951
But we're no good to anybody
if we're dead. Right?

161
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,072
What are we, a bunch of cowards?

162
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,874
Don't forget,
we speak not just for ourselves,

163
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,036
- but for each of our tribes as well.
- Aye.

164
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,151
And I say we stay
and fight the demon.

165
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,476
Fight?
But we ain't got no way to fight him.

166
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,796
- You know that, Shamus.
- That ain't true.

167
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,353
If we all pool our good luck,

168
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,910
then we just might luck into
a way to get rid of him.

169
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,078
Bollocks! Luck's unwieldy.
There's no predicting what it may do.

170
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,479
Who knows, we may end up
even enraging the demon more.

171
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,159
We don't have a choice.

172
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,670
Our place in the world
is at stake here, Finnigan.

173
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,279
Our lands are being plundered.

174
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,598
And our race may be annihilated
by the devil himself.

175
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,070
But we are leprechauns.

176
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,397
Our blood flows green
and our hearts beat gold.

177
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,160
And we can cower in the shadows
no longer.

178
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,636
We must use our luck
to find the light.

179
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,513
- Are you with me, laddies?
- Aye!

180
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,030
Aye! Aye!

181
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,796
<i>Personal loss
Should not be mine</i>

182
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,549
<i>Restore this sweater
And make it Fine</i>

183
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,993
I can't wait to try this
on my credit rating.

184
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,430
You sure that's a good idea?

185
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,432
Wyatt, you should tell your daddy
to not spy on Auntie Paige.

186
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,995
We're only here because his mother
is worried about you.

187
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,872
- Should we be?
- No.

188
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,958
- I'm just settling a few debts, is all.
- By using magic?

189
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,991
Even Wyatt knows
that's breaking the rules.

190
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,873
Listen, Wyatt wouldn't be here
if you hadn't broken the rules.

191
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,912
Okay, that was different.
You know it.

192
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,951
That is a stupid rule,
and so is the one that says

193
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,913
I have to take a vow of poverty
in order to be a full-time witch.

194
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,795
Listen, I'm not trying to get rich quick,
I am just making up for my losses.

195
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,949
But, Paige, please.

196
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,878
Piper and I have enough
to deal with right now

197
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,230
without the consequences
of some spell you cast.

198
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,317
Well, listen, if you and Piper
weren't so busy

199
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,557
sniping at each other all the time,
maybe you would feel differently.

200
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,034
We weren't sniping. We...

201
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,839
Nice try, change the subject.

202
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,515
Paige, there's more important things
going on right now.

203
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,392
The Elders say the good
has been going through

204
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,353
a curious string of bad luck lately and
demons are getting the upper hand.

205
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,835
Maybe you can try working on that.

206
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,913
I have the perfect spell for that.

207
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,756
I just wrote it
to get out of my own predicament.

208
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,949
"'To Find Good Luck':

209
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,798
<i>Finances have run amuck</i>

210
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,149
<i>Creditors I soon must duck</i>

211
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,634
Paige, that's for personal gain.

212
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,478
<i>I cast a spell to Find good luck</i>

213
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,910
<i>And hope my liFe will cease to suck"</i>

214
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,674
Don't tell your mommy
about this, okay?

215
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,553
A witch. It's about bloody time
help got here.

216
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,315
I was beginning to think our luck
wasn't working no more.

217
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,232
- Who are you?
- Shamus Fitzpatrick.

218
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,158
At your service, ma'am.

219
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,276
What am I doing here?
I was just looking for a bit of luck.

220
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,199
So were we.
Our magic must have intersected.

221
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,915
And none too soon, I might add.
We need your help.

222
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,519
We? Who's "we"?

223
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,712
Why, leprechauns.

224
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,713
Leprechauns. Of course. Why would
I think there'd be anything other

225
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,956
than leprechauns needing my help?

226
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,159
Gotcha!

227
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,993
Leprechaun!

228
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,757
Ever date a little person?

229
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,829
- We gotta get out of here.
- Allow me.

230
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,119
Hold onto your knickers, darling.

231
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,914
- Is that...?
- Me very own.

232
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,315
Lucky you.

233
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,474
It's not just gold. It's magic.

234
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,910
Pure luck.
That's what you're looking at.

235
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,190
Of course, it's just a spark
to get things started.

236
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,958
The rest is up to the recipient.

237
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,197
See, leprechauns are like bees.
They pollinate the world with luck.

238
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,628
Sometimes the seeds don't stick,

239
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,115
but other times they grow
into full-blown hot streaks.

240
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,719
Right?

241
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,276
What she said.

242
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,917
See, now can I have some luck?
I think I've earned it.

243
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,192
- Be careful. Not all luck is good.
- She's right.

244
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,392
A nugget can go either way,
depending on our intention.

245
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,195
So you hand out bad luck as well?
Wouldn't that make you evil?

246
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,076
Watch your tongue. How'd you like it
if I started saying witches are evil?

247
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,992
Leprechauns might be tricksters,
but they're definitely not evil.

248
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,111
Like it or not,
the world needs bad luck.

249
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,231
It keeps the natural order in balance.

250
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,594
Finally, a man with a solid head
on his shoulders.

251
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,755
Bad luck helps people
just as much as good luck.

252
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,188
Maybe even more so.

253
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,960
Because of adversity, people learn.
They grow.

254
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,470
Sorry, it's probably Cyrano.

255
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,712
And this must be the demon Saleel.

256
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,399
Yep, that's the wanker all right.

257
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,275
Says here
he's just a low-level reptile demon.

258
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,478
We can vanquish him with a potion.

259
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,114
Great, let's get rid of him
so I can find a band.

260
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,189
I think finding a band
might be easier for you, honey.

261
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,949
- Says here he's pretty elusive.
- You're darn right he is.

262
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,436
Otherwise, we would have heaped
a load of bad luck on him by now.

263
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,596
As it is, we never know
when he's gonna strike.

264
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,956
That's probably what the Elders
are worried about.

265
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,958
Saleel's been stealing the leprechauns'
gold and giving it to other demons.

266
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,039
But maybe with a little good luck
you witches can put a stop to that.

267
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,356
No, we don't need luck.
We're gonna do it our way.

268
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,953
Your way may not work.

269
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,194
Are you with us, dear?

270
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,356
Or are you writing
love notes to your boyfriend?

271
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,960
What is this,
a coven or a daycare centre?

272
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,958
- I got it.
- Don't forget to sanitize the nipple.

273
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,037
People, we're running out of time.

274
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,550
Do I need to start crying like a baby
to get some action around here?

275
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,435
I'm sorry, but my little guy
comes before your little guys.

276
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,959
Yeah, well, without a little luck,

277
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,039
my little guys aren't gonna last long,
lassie. So let's try it my way.

278
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,076
What happened?
What did you just do to me?

279
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,637
Why don't you find out for yourself.

280
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,236
- You're Pat Benatar.
- Oh, good, a fan. What a relief.

281
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,317
- This is my husband, Neil.
- Sorry to bother you.

282
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,636
Our car broke down outside
and our cell phone is dead.

283
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,876
Just our luck, right?
Listen, can we use your phone?

284
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,991
We'd really owe you.

285
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,834
To die for, aren't they?

286
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,508
Mr. Demon. Sorry, all yours.

287
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,193
There was a witch in your realm.

288
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,516
Did you little rodents
run to her for help?

289
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,959
No, I swear. All we did was
pool our good luck.

290
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,879
Of course. Then you must have
lucked into a Charmed One.

291
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,958
Which means the power of three
will be coming for me.

292
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,398
Well, if leprechaun luck
got me into this mess,

293
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,795
I'm quite certain
it can get me out as well.

294
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,958
Yes, let me go
and I'll show you where mine is hid.

295
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,118
That's okay,
I know how to find it.

296
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,871
Who do they think they're fooling?

297
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,038
No one's gonna go anywhere
on those things.

298
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,515
It's just something pretty
for the baby to look at.

299
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,915
Pretty? You humans.

300
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,588
The minute you see a few colours,
you get all excited.

301
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,518
Rainbows aren't for looking at.

302
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,836
If they were,
they wouldn't be invisible.

303
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,871
Rainbows aren't invisible,
we can see them.

304
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,755
Aye, when it rains maybe.
But they're in the skies all the time.

305
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,918
It's how we get around.
We light them up with our shillelaghs.

306
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,789
- That how you find your pots of gold?
- And also our realm,

307
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,877
our home.

308
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,559
What's left of it anyway.

309
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,319
Pat Benatar is in the kitchen
on the phone with her manager,

310
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,876
rearranging her schedule
so she can play at P3.

311
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,640
I am so sorry I doubted you.

312
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,469
Just like a woman.
You have to give them a gift

313
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,875
to get anything in return.

314
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,230
Okay, this is not working.
I can't find Saleel.

315
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,715
That's because we need
something of his to make it work.

316
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,038
What you need is luck, and lots of it.
Not just the spark I can give you.

317
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,913
But the kind you build from.
By taking risks,

318
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,033
- getting yourself on a serious roll.
- A serious roll, huh?

319
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,197
I think I know exactly where I can
get one of those. Hit me.

320
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,114
All right, ready to go?

321
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,439
- Go where?
- Come on, sis.

322
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,198
Come on, where?

323
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,710
Hey. Hey, where's me kiss?

324
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,909
Women.

325
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,512
Well, how about you, darling?

326
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,229
Why not.

327
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,473
For me?

328
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,759
Who's it gonna be?
George Clooney?

329
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,916
Justin Timberlake?

330
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,877
You ready to go?

331
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,277
- That did not work.
- Bollocks! It always works.

332
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,356
- So I take it you don't wanna go out?
- No, you know, it's funny. L...

333
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,597
I can't. Because my cousin
came into town,

334
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,836
and he needs help
with his other cousins.

335
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,634
Oh, don't make a fuss about me.

336
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,592
You two just go out
and have a good time now.

337
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,678
But I really have to stay here
and help you with your problems.

338
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,959
- You two are cousins?
- Yes, we are very distant cousins.

339
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,878
And it's about to get
a lot more distant

340
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,911
if you don't let me
handle this situation.

341
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,317
Well, I would let you handle it
if you weren't handling it all wrong.

342
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,318
You need to go, take some risks
and leave the rest up to luck.

343
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,829
Look, I don't wanna
get in between family stuff,

344
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,157
but it seems as if your cousin
has got it all under control.

345
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,954
- So let's go.
- Oh, good idea.

346
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,959
Where's Piper?

347
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,799
Oh, she had to go.
But she'll be back.

348
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,878
Say, how've you been, Shamus?
Long time.

349
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,675
Don't even try it, Neil.
I already hit you with me best shot.

350
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,677
That's all you get.

351
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,637
And seven. Winner, seven.
Come on, winner, seven.

352
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,275
Paige, there must be $50,000 there.

353
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,319
Sixty is more like it.
But Shamus said to take big risks.

354
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,192
Here we have the craps table,

355
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,356
we've got slots,
we got the big-wheel thingy.

356
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,710
- We can't lose.
- Okay, maybe we should think

357
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,831
- about quitting while we're ahead.
- Quitting?

358
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,235
You girls can't quit.
We're in the middle of a streak here.

359
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,954
Same lucky shooter.
Same lucky shooter coming on a roll.

360
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,878
Piper, I cannot ignore a cowboy.

361
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,196
Besides, I feel something really big
is about to happen.

362
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,595
We just have to hold on
and wait for it.

363
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,913
All right, come on now,
baby needs a new pair of shoes.

364
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,917
And by "baby," I do mean me.

365
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,789
Somebody's smoking.

366
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,430
Will you marry me? Because
that's how much I love you now.

367
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,709
Simmer down, buckaroo.

368
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,918
Look, I've gotta get back
to the actual baby.

369
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,588
And we need to be using
this winning streak to find Saleel.

370
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,994
Oh, just one more roll.

371
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,993
Okay, fine. But we are
not betting it all,

372
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,919
because I can send Wyatt
to college with this.

373
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,033
Listen, the bigger risks we take,
the more luck we have.

374
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,549
Just watch this.

375
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,673
Two. Crap, two. Snake eyes.
Line away.

376
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,234
Where did our luck go?

377
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,958
Snake eyes, that's it.
That's what we've been waiting for.

378
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,118
- No, but we lost everything.
- No, we didn't.

379
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,276
I just figured out a way
to find the demon...

380
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,556
- stration. Demonstration.

381
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,955
She knows what I mean. Come on.

382
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,430
Okay, what are we doing here?
Because I really need to get home.

383
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,232
This shouldn't take very long.

384
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,637
But then again, you're pretty stubborn,
so maybe it will.

385
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,037
Oh, wait a minute. I am stubborn?
I'm stubborn?

386
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,549
- Then what are you?
- Stubborn.

387
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,832
And a control freak.
And pretty arrogant sometimes.

388
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,873
You really know how to take the fun
out of a fight, now, don't you?

389
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,149
Look around.
Tell me what you see.

390
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,079
Why don't you tell me
what you want me to see?

391
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,073
Okay, fine.

392
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,794
I see lots of couples,

393
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,357
and they're kissing and drinking
and dancing.

394
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,118
What I don't see is the point.

395
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,788
Oh, hey, get a room.

396
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,917
Look, this is exactly my point.

397
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,475
Love doesn't bloom
through modems and hard drives.

398
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,999
And, no, that is not a euphemism.

399
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,794
What if I told you all these people
met over the Internet?

400
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,434
Right. Like you would have
any way of knowing that.

401
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,471
I would if I had, say,
started and sold

402
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,716
an online-dating service
a few years ago.

403
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,151
Maybe established an evening
one night a week

404
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,796
for people to get together and meet
in a safe environment like this.

405
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,910
Wait. So you brought
all of these couples together?

406
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,758
They brought themselves together.

407
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,190
My company just made it
a little easier for them.

408
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,836
It's a complicated world, Phoebe.

409
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,880
People have a hard time
finding each other in it.

410
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,195
And even when they do

411
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,871
they sometimes
don't act on their feelings

412
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,196
because they're too afraid.

413
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,393
Yeah, tell me about it.

414
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,432
I admit, online dating isn't perfect.

415
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,470
There are people who use it
for all the wrong reasons.

416
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,831
But most people
are just looking for love.

417
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,189
Just like the rest of us.

418
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,679
Like the rest of us?

419
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,118
You need to get started
on that rewrite.

420
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,556
Snake eyes? So what? I don't get it.

421
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,151
Well, Saleel is a reptile demon,
so we can use them to scry for him.

422
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,158
See, I told you it was good luck.

423
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,918
I guess, but couldn't snake eyes
have been a winning roll too?

424
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,395
You really want it all, don't you?

425
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,034
Well, even luck doesn't bring you
everything on a silver platter.

426
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,593
You have to work
at some things too.

427
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,070
- Hey, did you find the demon?
- Well,

428
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,431
the vanquishing potion is done,
so we're almost there.

429
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,915
- Where's Leo?
- Passed out with the baby, poor guy.

430
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,792
He's more worn out than I am.

431
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,228
So how'd you do?

432
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,829
You must have developed
quite a streak by now.

433
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,951
Yeah, did you win the lottery?

434
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,912
Ed McMahon show up at your house
with a big check?

435
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,949
- Actually, no. Nothing happened.
- What? That's impossible.

436
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,833
Did you take any risks?
Get lucky with that fella?

437
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,952
- What fella?
- I think he's talking about Jason.

438
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,996
And, no, I did not get lucky.
Not that I would want to anyway.

439
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,759
The burned child dreads the fire, eh?

440
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,791
No.

441
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,272
People, we just got lucky.

442
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,789
Maybe it took "snake eyes"
a bit too literally.

443
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,117
- That would be bad luck, right?
- No.

444
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,038
This is.

445
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,873
Oh, no, he's soured your luck.
Hurry, throw the potion!

446
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,878
- Now, what are the odds of that?
- Don't worry. I'll fix this.

447
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,393
Not so fast, little man.

448
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,158
That's my rainbow now.

449
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,833
Charmed Ones, my ass.

450
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,713
We couldn't even save one
leprechaun, let alone all of them.

451
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,831
Well, it wasn't
for lack of trying, Paige.

452
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,713
Yeah. Well, still,
Saleel is a low-level demon.

453
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,833
You know, we had luck on our side,
we had magic, we should have been...

454
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,035
- You all right?
- You okay?

455
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,629
No, I am not all right.

456
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,195
I was supposed to help Shamus,
and instead, I got him killed.

457
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,676
Paige, we were struck by lightning.
We could've never seen that coming.

458
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,871
How am I supposed to help them
when even Mother Nature

459
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,799
- is against us?
- Okay, well, I can't get there right now

460
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,595
so you're gonna have to handle it
yourself. Call an electrician.

461
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,837
There's a power failure at the club.
We're shut down for the night.

462
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,838
Do you have any idea how much
money we're about to lose?

463
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,989
What the hell is happening?

464
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,237
Seems like a bad-luck streak,
and it's picking up steam.

465
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,829
Well, it can't get much worse
than being struck by lightning.

466
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,474
Oh, no?
How about being hit by a meteor?

467
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,469
Take Wyatt out of here.

468
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,830
- But l...
- No. No arguing. Just orb, okay?

469
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,235
You were the only one
that wasn't cursed with the bad luck.

470
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,839
- He's safe with you.
- All right.

471
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,759
Well, I'll take him to Uncle Elders,
he'll be safe there.

472
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,475
- Didn't they ask you not to do that?
- Yeah. But...

473
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,398
...screw them.

474
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,959
All right, we're gonna
have to turn our luck around fast.

475
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,628
Paige, can you use that spell of yours
to find more leprechauns?

476
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,832
No, they pooled their luck
just to make it work.

477
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,634
I wish we knew how to get this thing
to make a rainbow.

478
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,273
Okay, well, since we can't do that,

479
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,948
we're gonna have to turn our luck
around the old-fashioned way.

480
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,278
A little determination, some positive
thinking, a little faith, a little...

481
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,957
As you were saying?

482
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,516
What are you doing?
How dare you summon us.

483
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,358
It's time to pay your debt to me.

484
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,358
I need you to kill the Charmed Ones,

485
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,279
get them off my back
so I can go after more leprechauns.

486
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,549
You're crazy.

487
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,151
- Wait. Let's hear him out.
- I've cursed the witches with bad luck.

488
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,759
Which means
they're vulnerable now.

489
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,871
They should be easy pickings
for you.

490
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,629
If that's the case, why don't you
take them out yourself?

491
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,036
Because they'll be ready for me.

492
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,958
But they won't be ready for you.

493
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,315
Plus...

494
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,232
...I can guarantee that luck
will be on your side.

495
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,713
I got it. I got it. I got it. L...

496
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,998
Okay.

497
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,912
- Vanquishing potion done?
- Well done.

498
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,588
- What happened?
- Big fire.

499
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,994
Did you find anything?

500
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,713
Yeah, I went rummaging
through stuff,

501
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,593
and I found a rabbit's foot,
wishbone,

502
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,109
horseshoe, four-leaf clover.

503
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,754
Here's some salt for that
over-the-shoulder thing.

504
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,520
And the coup de grâce:

505
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,914
A charm bracelet.

506
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,993
Lucky charms, Paige?

507
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,953
It ain't the cereal,
but it's the best I could do.

508
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,912
And what about...?

509
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,359
Phoebe.

510
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,869
Oh, what happened?

511
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,277
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my bruises have bruises.

512
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,639
I missed the step
because I was trying to read my page.

513
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,469
- Walk it off, walk it off.
- Way to go, Cyrano 73.

514
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,719
"I thought I'd try again.
How about Saturday night?"

515
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,712
He is asking me out again.

516
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,592
If you're gonna do it,
I'd go with Saturday,

517
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,791
seeing as how we'll probably
be dead by then.

518
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,515
Wait a minute.
Maybe I should say yes.

519
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,188
Oh, Phoebe,
this is not the time to be dating.

520
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,072
It might exactly be the time.

521
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,909
Maybe this was the risk
Shamus was talking about.

522
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,759
Accepting a date
with a guy that you click with.

523
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,030
That's not necessarily a giant risk.

524
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,238
Well, for me it is.

525
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,795
How do you know for sure
he's not another demon?

526
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,072
I don't know. Therein lies the risk.

527
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,956
Okay. Y-E-S. And enter.

528
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,030
Oh, yeah. I feel luckier already.

529
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,989
Or not.

530
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,389
Energy ball!

531
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,192
No!

532
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,319
Piper.

533
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,958
One witch. Quick quiz,
how many should I have?

534
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,196
- Three.
- Zero!

535
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,553
They should all be dead.
I never asked for prisoners.

536
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,672
You miscalculated.

537
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,871
The others found a way
to turn their luck around.

538
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,196
And Jenna died because of it.

539
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,277
Am I supposed to care about that?

540
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,991
We'll use this witch
to lure the others.

541
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,952
You still have more gold.

542
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,549
We can make ourselves
enough good luck to make them pay

543
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,749
for what they've done.

544
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,993
I have a better idea.

545
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,670
I'll just do it myself.

546
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,998
She's at his lair.
And still alive, thank God.

547
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,189
Okay, we should call Leo.

548
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,913
No, we gotta keep
the baby out of danger.

549
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,237
But Saleel's got luck on his side,
we've got nothing.

550
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,955
No, that's not true.
I think we've turned the tide.

551
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,789
- How you figure?
- Paige, if we could just turn our luck

552
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,672
into a streak, then we can do this.

553
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,199
Okay. We've got a few charms,

554
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,436
and he's got who knows
how much gold.

555
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,876
It's just not gonna cut it.

556
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,593
Unless we combine our own magic
with it.

557
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,433
- Take that.
- Okay.

558
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,353
What are you doing?

559
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,790
I am gonna help you
make this thing work

560
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,549
so maybe you can get a vision off of it.
Maybe you can see Shamus using it.

561
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,109
I can't always get them
on command.

562
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,357
- Sometimes it's just...
- Yeah, I know, luck. Just try.

563
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,039
Okay.

564
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,839
Come on.

565
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,471
I can see him.

566
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,157
- I can see him.
- Come on.

567
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,959
Far out, lady.

568
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,709
Either we leave right now
and try to save what's left of us,

569
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,153
- or we stay and die like the rest.
- That is the choice.

570
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,952
Tell your tribes
to take only what they need.

571
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,118
- We leave at dusk.
- Aye.

572
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,869
It worked.

573
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,994
Witches. What are you doing here?

574
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,834
We're here because we need
your help to save our sister.

575
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,838
- And to save you.
- Right, sure.

576
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,308
Just like they saved Shamus.

577
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,919
- Hurry, laddies.
- No, wait.

578
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,635
Please, you're stronger than that.
Shamus knew it, and so do I.

579
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,149
Shamus Fitzpatrick was a fool.
And look where it got him.

580
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,631
- Aye.
- He was not a fool.

581
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,917
He gave up his life
because he believed saving you

582
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,953
was worth the ultimate price.
Shamus was a hero.

583
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,869
He didn't see leprechauns,
he saw giants.

584
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,992
And he didn't see luck,
he saw power.

585
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,355
Please, you've pooled your luck
once before.

586
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,959
Do it again.

587
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,833
Not for us, but for him.

588
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,314
For Shamus.

589
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,189
For Shamus.

590
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,229
- For Shamus!
- For Shamus!

591
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,078
<i>- For Shamus! For Shamus!
- You did good.</i>

592
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,918
- For Shamus!
- Yes!

593
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,235
For Shamus!

594
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,674
Hi. Okay, hi. Shoo. Go away.
See, I don't like snakes.

595
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,952
At all. Go away. Shoo.

596
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,717
- What are you doing? It's a trap.
- We know.

597
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,433
Piper.

598
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,558
- Go. Go away.
- The Charmed Ones.

599
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,113
It's about time you got here.

600
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,312
Yeah, well, we had to make a little
pit stop somewhere over the rainbow.

601
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,953
What is that supposed to mean?

602
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,039
A leprechaun. Please.

603
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,508
Now, laddies!

604
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,237
No!

605
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,918
A meteor.
That's some real bad luck.

606
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,670
Still tied up here, people.

607
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,516
Here, I think this belongs to you.

608
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,996
Actually, darling, I think
Shamus would want you to keep it.

609
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,476
For all you done for us,
for saving our kind.

610
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,318
Oh, you guys kind of did that
yourselves.

611
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,080
- It was your luck, after all.
- Aye.

612
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,475
But it was your fighting spirit
that sparked it.

613
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,352
The same spirit Shamus had.

614
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,552
I wish I could accept
that compliment,

615
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,230
but I was just looking to be
reimbursed, to tell you the truth.

616
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,953
I felt like

617
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,072
- magic owed me.
- And do you still feel that way?

618
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,997
No. I don't.

619
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,914
Doesn't matter what brings a person,
only what they leave with.

620
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,274
Hey.

621
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,795
Leo, what are you doing here?
Who's watching Wyatt?

622
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,194
I asked Paige to. I thought maybe

623
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,278
you and I could spend
some time together alone.

624
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,391
Sounds great,
but it's a little crazy in here.

625
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,158
I can see that.

626
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,157
Pat Benatar definitely brings in
the crowd, huh?

627
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,669
Yeah, at least I'll go out with a bang.

628
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,997
What do you mean?

629
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,319
Well, I've been thinking,

630
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,954
and I've decided
that I wanna sell the club.

631
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,879
Not because I want to,
but I feel like I have to.

632
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,594
I mean, being a mother/Charmed One/
businesswoman

633
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,997
is just one slash way too many.
Something's gotta give.

634
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,074
But this club is your baby too, Piper.
You can't give it up.

635
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,838
I don't really feel like I have a choice.

636
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,871
I mean, I've been stretched
pretty thin lately,

637
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,991
and I think we're both
feeling the strain.

638
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,632
Yeah. I know. That's...

639
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,990
That's why I asked the Elders
for paternity leave.

640
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,149
It's obviously never been done before.
But they spent time with Wyatt

641
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,032
and realized how important he is

642
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,836
and decided
to break the rules for him.

643
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,349
That's weird. I mean, what happens
to your other charges?

644
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,879
You do have a career too.

645
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,358
We'II, they'll temporarily reassign them.
Except for you guys.

646
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,030
And as for my career,
it's not as important to me as we are.

647
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,952
Honey, I don't think
I can let you do this.

648
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:12,154
Piper, it's one thing
I don't wanna argue about, okay?

649
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,190
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Pat Benatar.

650
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,956
You here on business?

651
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,118
Actually, no, I'm not.

652
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,756
- What are you doing here?
- I'm meeting someone.

653
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,912
- Really? Weird, me too.
- I know.

654
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,912
You're meeting me.

655
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,078
- I don't understand.
- I'm Cyrano 73.

656
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,110
In the flesh, so to speak.

657
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,038
Wait. Phoebe, let me explain.

658
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,558
Okay. Sure, go ahead.
Give it your best shot.

659
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,070
I just knew you'd never go out with me
if I asked you straight, right?

660
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,718
Right?

661
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,349
- Right.
- So I had to find a way

662
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,552
to see if you were interested in me
without putting any pressure on you.

663
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,519
I like you, Phoebe.

664
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,991
I liked you the minute
I laid eyes on you.

665
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,235
And I know you like me.

666
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,955
Or at least the part of me
that brought you here.

667
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,597
Otherwise, you wouldn't have come.

668
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,034
- Jason, I don't know.
- I'm not asking you to marry me.

669
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,078
I just wanna buy you a drink.

670
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,838
Come on,
what have you got to lose?

671
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,998
- Oh, I don't know, my job maybe?
- That would never happen.

672
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,397
Hey, you want Cyrano to disappear,
he's gone.

673
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,592
I promise. Just say the word.

674
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,030
Martini, dirty.
