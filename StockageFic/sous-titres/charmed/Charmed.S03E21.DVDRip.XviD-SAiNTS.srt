0
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:26,167
Why didn't you invite him in?

1
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:27,962
- Who?
- Your date.

2
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,768
The guy you've been smooching
on the porch for the last ten minutes.

3
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:31,918
Eavesdropping, were you?

4
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:33,442
Well, I'm single again,

5
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:36,248
so I have no choice but to live
vicariously through your love life.

6
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:38,479
Wow, I'd pick a better love
life if I were you.

7
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:40,765
Lately, mine's been rated PG
for "pretty grim."

8
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:43,489
That's because no one ever makes
it past the threshold, Prue.

9
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:46,647
I mean don't get me wrong.
I'm glad that you're out there looking,

10
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:48,765
but you can't keep saving
yourself for Mr. Right.

11
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,647
I need more vicarious thrills
than that.

12
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:53,118
I am not saving myself for Mr. Right.

13
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:56,442
I mean Mr. Interesting would do,
or Mr. Personality,

14
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:59,442
or even Mr. Take-My-Breath-Away.
I don't care.

15
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,679
Be careful with the last one.

16
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:05,438
They tend to surprise you
in all the wrong ways.

17
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:10,760
"Cole likes...

18
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,408
...walks in the park,
jazz and fine wine."

19
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:17,367
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Well, Cole's a demon.

20
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:20,248
We write about demons in
the Book of Shadows, don't we?

21
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:23,403
Right, but this kind of stuff?

22
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:25,207
Do you really think that's necessary?

23
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,687
Yeah, if it prepares future witches
in case he attacks, absolutely.

24
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,641
The more that they know about Cole,

25
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:34,528
the better chance they have
of hurting him before he hurts them.

26
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:36,843
Do you wanna talk about it?

27
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:39,239
No, there's nothing to talk about.

28
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,401
I loved, I lost,
and now I'm moving on.

29
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:47,286
- What was that?
- Piper.

30
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:49,643
All right, where is she?

31
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:51,800
In the bunker formerly known
as the basement.

32
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:54,437
I thought she was getting a handle
on her new powers.

33
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:57,601
Yeah, that was before her new powers
got a handle on her. Piper!

34
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:00,237
- What?
- Are you okay?

35
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:01,558
I'm fine.

36
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:06,638
The Christmas decorations are not.

37
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:07,844
Can we come down?

38
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:11,007
No. Stay away from the door.
It's not safe.

39
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:13,683
Piper, that's ridiculous.
We're your sisters.

40
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:16,523
Maybe we should back up
just a little bit.

41
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,167
Jeez, who let the dogs out?

42
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:22,684
- You can't stay down there forever.
- Yes, I can.

43
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:25,124
No, you can't.
You have a club to run and a husband

44
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:26,722
who can't stand to live without you.

45
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:29,403
That's right.
And two sisters who need you

46
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:31,560
to cook for them
and fight evil with them.

47
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:35,399
Okay, do you want her to come up,
or do you want her to stay down there?

48
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,359
What is going on?

49
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:45,968
What was that? What happened?

50
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,848
Nothing. Just relax.

51
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,006
It was only Kit.
Don't blow anything up.

52
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,479
All right, what the hell
is going on out there?

53
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,766
Oh, Cathryn.

54
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:09,644
Oh, Cathryn, my darling.

55
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,766
Misty, stop it.

56
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,480
- Morning.
- Morning.

57
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,684
You're not still writing in there
about Cole, are you?

58
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:27,680
- Nope.
- Good.

59
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,443
I'm actually writing about
his demonic half now.

60
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:34,283
Phoebe, I'm starting to get
a little worried about you.

61
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,043
Oh, don't worry about me,
worry about Piper.

62
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:39,798
Why? Is she still locked
in the basement?

63
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,080
No, she's locked herself
in her bedroom now.

64
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:44,678
Well, at least somebody's improving.

65
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:51,726
Looks like we weren't the only ones
annoyed by the dogs barking last night.

66
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:54,927
It says that there was a record number
of noise complaints.

67
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:58,882
It says here that
at the exact same time,

68
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:01,279
there was a man murdered
in our neighbourhood.

69
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:03,008
Do you mind?

70
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:09,207
No motive, nothing stolen,
nothing to suggest how he was killed,

71
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,280
lots of shattered glass everywhere.

72
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:14,606
You know this isn't gonna work,
you trying to distract me...

73
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:23,006
- What?
- I saw a little girl.

74
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:24,967
She couldn't have been any older...

75
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:28,327
...than 14 or 15. Did you mention
something about shattered glass?

76
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:29,723
Yeah.

77
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:34,324
I think you're right. I think a demon
was responsible for that man's death.

78
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:36,201
And I think I know which one.

79
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:45,082
Pheebs, what are you doing?

80
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,643
If we use the magic-to-magic spell
to summon Cole,

81
00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:52,561
and then we vanquish him...

82
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:57,006
Wait. What makes you think
that Cole is responsible?

83
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:00,685
I was holding the Belthazor page
when I got the premonition.

84
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:05,240
But shattered glass, an old man,
a teenager, that's not exactly his m.o.

85
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:07,127
Then why else would I get
the premonition?

86
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:10,958
I don't know, Phoebe, but I think
you're barking up the wrong demon.

87
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:15,482
Look, I know that he hurt you. But that
doesn't necessarily mean that he's...

88
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:18,959
Prue, I can do this with you
or without you.

89
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,917
Just, please,
get the vanquishing potion.

90
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:26,001
- And what if the potion doesn't work?
- It'll work.

91
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:27,728
It has to.

92
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:47,759
"Magic forces, black and white
Reaching out through space and light

93
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:52,087
Be he far or be he near
Bring us the demon Belthazor here"

94
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:55,202
No!

95
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,560
"Magic forces, black and white
Reaching out through space and light

96
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:02,478
Be he far or be he near
Bring us the demon Belthazor here"

97
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:12,206
Here he comes.

98
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:27,922
Wait a minute.

99
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:30,718
- What happened? Why didn't it work?
- I don't know.

100
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:34,278
Damn it.

101
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:37,759
All right, we're just gonna have to find
the girl another way.

102
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:40,318
Was there anything
in your premonition that might help?

103
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:44,078
Dark alley, late at night, phone booth.
I mean, there's not much to go on.

104
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:48,003
So we'll have to go to the first victim's
apartment and see if anything's there.

105
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:50,080
- Should we get Piper?
- No. Let's not put her

106
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:52,205
any more on edge
than she already is. Come on.

107
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:54,718
Soft inhalation.

108
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,398
Slow, deep exhalation.

109
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:03,966
Be at peace in this moment

110
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:07,087
as you allow your mind to drift...

111
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:11,198
...slow. Breathe as...

112
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:15,806
Leo! You're supposed
to knock, not orb!

113
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:17,402
But I live here.

114
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:21,599
Okay, okay. Just relax.

115
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,760
That's what I was trying to do,

116
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:26,284
and then somebody
made me blow up my guru.

117
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:31,203
No, no, no!
Stay away. I am not safe.

118
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,327
- Piper, come on.
- No, I mean it.

119
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:36,726
My hands are lethal weapons,
and I don't know how to control it.

120
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:38,402
And it gets worse every day.

121
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,401
Well, that's normal.
It took you a while

122
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:43,322
to learn how to control
your freezing power, remember?

123
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:44,558
Freezing is one thing.

124
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:47,368
Blowing up stuff
is another thing altogether.

125
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:50,879
Well, except this time
you're not alone. I'm here.

126
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:54,401
Yeah, but you shouldn't be here.
You shouldn't be anywhere near me.

127
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:55,638
It's too dangerous.

128
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,521
Then how are we gonna go
on our honeymoon?

129
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,642
We're not gonna go on our
honeymoon, we're gonna cancel it.

130
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,640
We are not
cancelling our honeymoon.

131
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:05,004
Well, then tell the Elders to take
this power back.

132
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:06,648
I don't want it.
I'm not ready for it.

133
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:09,568
They wouldn't have given it to you
if you weren't ready. I know that,

134
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:11,606
both as your whitelighter
and as your husband.

135
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:14,004
What if you're wrong?
What if I hurt someone?

136
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:17,121
I just... I feel so helpless.

137
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:19,839
One thing you're not is helpless.

138
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:24,885
You are one of the strongest, most
capable people I have ever known.

139
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:28,407
And don't forget,
I've been around for a while.

140
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,364
Really?

141
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,247
You can handle this, honey.

142
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:35,000
We can handle it together.

143
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:47,399
So, what kind of specialists
are you anyway?

144
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:49,560
Inspector Morris didn't tell you?

145
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:51,602
No, he didn't.

146
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:52,998
Can I pick this up?

147
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:55,239
Sure. Forensics is done here.

148
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:59,600
Are you those psychics we keep
hearing about he was working with?

149
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:03,718
Psychics. Right, that's a good one.

150
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:05,648
Is this the victim's wife?

151
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:07,608
Yeah, she died a couple
of months ago.

152
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:09,681
Neighbours say the poor guy
never got over it.

153
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:12,165
- Any suspects?
- All we know

154
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:16,806
is whoever did it, busted through
that window, although three stories up.

155
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:19,644
- Nobody can figure out how.
- Do you see any scorch marks

156
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,162
by where the body was?

157
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:23,763
I don't think that there would
have been a body...

158
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:27,000
...if that particular weapon
had been used.

159
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:29,364
- Are you from arson?
- No, she was just

160
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:31,043
curious of how he died.

161
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:33,484
He drowned in his own blood,
according to the ME.

162
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:36,487
All his blood vessels just burst
for no reason.

163
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:38,558
Are you feds?

164
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:41,878
Actually, inspector,

165
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:44,126
we're witches. Okay?

166
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,484
We actually think a demon
might have done this,

167
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:48,645
probably my ex-boyfriend.
And if he did do this,

168
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,527
then we have to find him
and vanquish him.

169
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:52,288
Satisfied?

170
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:54,727
That's very funny.

171
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,365
- Okay, are you out of your mind?
- Well, it got rid of him, didn't it?

172
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:09,328
- So, what do you think?
- Definitely supernatural,

173
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:11,047
but was it Belthazor?

174
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:15,285
Well, they must have some
of the vanquishing potion,

175
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:16,928
otherwise, why try to summon me?

176
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:21,727
Perhaps the witch
who loved you wants you back.

177
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:24,360
Humans can be very forgiving.

178
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:27,480
Not this human, not after what I did.

179
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:30,078
If I know her,
she wants to crucify me.

180
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:33,164
And knowing her
is exactly what I wanted you

181
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:36,480
to help me stop doing, Alchemist.

182
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,847
If I'm to fully revert
to my demonic self,

183
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,761
I need to break all ties,
remove all doubt.

184
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:44,763
Transmuting your blood
might make you immune

185
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:47,682
to the witch's potion, Belthazor.

186
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:51,922
But it won't necessarily make you
immune from her pull.

187
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:54,241
That's all right.
If she summons me again...

188
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:56,758
That's not the pull I'm talking about.

189
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:59,888
Your human half
will always be vulnerable

190
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:03,206
to that which makes
all humans vulnerable.

191
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,961
No sorcery can change that.

192
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:13,565
Then do what you can.

193
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:33,482
I'm telling you, it's gotta be Cole.

194
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:37,200
Phoebe, just because you want it to be
him, doesn't necessarily make it him.

195
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,802
This isn't about me and Cole.

196
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:40,118
This is about what I saw.

197
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:42,359
My premonitions are always
directly connected

198
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,645
to what I'm touching at the time.

199
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:46,762
Okay, well, wait a minute.

200
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:50,968
What if the back of your hand
was touching this page?

201
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:54,081
Right? A Banshee, whatever that is.

202
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,524
It's a demon who feeds
on souls in great pain.

203
00:13:57,609 --> 00:14:00,077
Hey, stranger. Long time no see.

204
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:02,359
Well, like you said,
I can't hide forever.

205
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:04,679
Although you guys
should be wearing asbestos suits.

206
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,885
Oh, I think we'll risk it.

207
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:09,319
I just don't want anybody to get hurt.

208
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:12,846
Well, since you can't freeze us,
you probably can't blow us up either.

209
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:16,040
Just keep your hands
where we can see them.

210
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:17,557
All right, so the Banshee.

211
00:14:17,729 --> 00:14:19,845
Well, they're pretty rare.
But what they do is hunt

212
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:21,727
for their victims
with a high-pitched call,

213
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:23,527
something beyond our range to hear.

214
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:26,687
Okay, so then how do they find
their victims?

215
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:28,999
By hearing the inner cry.

216
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:32,559
By zeroing in on the waves of pain
that emanate from the stricken.

217
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,686
Then their call turns
into a scream that kills.

218
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:38,159
Well, that explains the broken
blood vessels and the shattered glass.

219
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:41,127
Looks like it's not Cole after all.

220
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:43,999
So, what do we do, wear earplugs?

221
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:47,885
There is no spell to vanquish
the Banshee,

222
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,439
but there is one
to track the Banshee.

223
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:54,599
Okay, so all we need
is a designated tracker.

224
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:01,928
You're sure about this?

225
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,922
Well, with everything that you
and Piper are going through right now,

226
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:07,319
I don't have much of a choice.
It's just a tracking spell.

227
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,242
- What's the worst that can happen?
- With our history, don't go there.

228
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:13,526
It's almost night, that's when the girl
in Phoebe's premonition was attacked.

229
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:15,361
So let's just do it.

230
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:20,246
"Let a piercing cry that feeds on pain
And leaves more sorrow than it gains

231
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:24,197
Shall now be heard by one who seeks
To stop the havoc that it wreaks"

232
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,323
Prue?

233
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:35,521
Oh, my God.

234
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,322
Prue?

235
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,722
Come on, Prue.
Come on. Come on out.

236
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:56,118
We're still your sisters, you know.
It's...

237
00:15:57,449 --> 00:16:00,680
Jeez, honey, don't sound so sad.
It's gonna be okay.

238
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:03,079
How? How is this gonna be okay?

239
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:05,644
Hands in your pockets.

240
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:09,679
What did you find out?
Why did the spell backfire?

241
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:12,284
- I don't think it did.
- What are you talking about, Leo?

242
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:15,208
Prue is walking around
on all fours and barking.

243
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:18,247
If that's not a backfire, then what is?

244
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:21,208
You're scaring her.

245
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:24,526
All right, all I'm saying is that
you guys cast a tracking spell.

246
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:27,084
And since dogs can obviously
hear a Banshee's call,

247
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:29,922
what happened makes sense.
Prue should be able to track it now.

248
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:32,285
Yeah, if she ever comes out.

249
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:34,123
Prue. Honey.

250
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:37,566
Okay, you can't stay
under there all night.

251
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,526
Okay, if you won't come out for you,

252
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:43,964
will you at least come out
for an innocent?

253
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,041
We can't save that teenage girl
without you.

254
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:56,167
That's a good girl!

255
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,962
That's a good girl!

256
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,926
Who's a good girl?

257
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:03,519
Well, at least we know
she understands what we're saying.

258
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:08,888
- She's such a pretty dog.
- What else did you expect?

259
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,961
A Doberman.

260
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:12,848
Easy.

261
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:15,245
Honey, watch your orbs.

262
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:17,724
So, what do we have to do
to get our real sister back?

263
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:21,797
Once the Banshee's vanquished,
the spell should reverse itself.

264
00:17:24,129 --> 00:17:27,201
Well, what if the Banshee
doesn't show up until, like, next year?

265
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,087
Then... What do we do then?

266
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:31,127
I don't think you'll have
to wait that long.

267
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,678
Banshees have an insatiable appetite
for pain.

268
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,647
- They feed every night.
- Okay,

269
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,720
what do we do once
she finds the demon?

270
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:42,280
I mean, there's no vanquishing potion,
there's no power of three.

271
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:46,200
Oh, my God! Prue!

272
00:17:57,489 --> 00:17:59,286
Prue, stop that. Stop it!

273
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:01,280
No, no, no.

274
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:04,600
Very bad, Prue.
Very, very bad, Prue.

275
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:07,645
Hi, Cujo. Who are you growling at?

276
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:09,925
I'd better go check
with the Elders and see if they

277
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,479
- know how to vanquish a Banshee.
- Don't tell me you're afraid of Prue?

278
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:16,601
Wait a minute. Hold it. What if we find
the Banshee in the meantime?

279
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:19,004
Well, you blew up the last demon
you fought, didn't you?

280
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:20,966
Yeah, but I was trying to freeze him.

281
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:24,207
Just remember what we talked about,
just try and relax.

282
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:29,481
I really wish everybody
would quit telling me to relax.

283
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,567
What is it? What is it?
What is it, girl?

284
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,245
You think she hears the Banshee?

285
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:45,080
Wait! Wait!

286
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:51,327
This is worse than I thought.

287
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:54,846
I never imagined anything like this
could ever happen to us.

288
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,477
All I know is this can't
go on much longer.

289
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:59,719
So, what are we gonna do?

290
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:00,924
Rock, Paper, Scissors?

291
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:04,718
- No way. You already lost.
- Two out of three.

292
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:09,640
This is so humiliating.

293
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,441
Phoebe.

294
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:22,208
Does this mean
what I think it means?

295
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:26,361
- It means I'm off the hook. Prue!
- Wait!

296
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:30,244
Mom, Dad, are you there?
Pick up, please. It's me.

297
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:32,607
Mom. Oh, thank God.

298
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:35,489
I'm so sorry.
I never should have run away.

299
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:37,520
I wanna come home.

300
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:46,479
I don't know,
somewhere in San Francisco.

301
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:04,847
Prue!

302
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:09,441
It's okay. It's okay. Come on.
Okay, run. Run.

303
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:31,518
Piper, now!

304
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:43,280
- You okay?
- I think so, yeah.

305
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:49,520
Prue, no, wait!

306
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:10,802
Oh, God. Oh, no.

307
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:15,048
Don't get up. Just stay there, baby.
You're all right. Good girl.

308
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:17,486
Can somebody
give me a hand here?

309
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:21,085
It's all right. Good girl. Good girl.

310
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,282
Somebody, help!

311
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:28,684
No, Darryl, I realise that you can't
put an APB out for a dog.

312
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:32,478
But couldn't you at least ask the other
cops to keep an eye out for her?

313
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:36,968
Yeah. Okay, that would be great.
Call Piper's cell if you hear anything.

314
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:41,005
Bye. Do you think that the animal
shelters are even open this late?

315
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:44,201
They'd better be, because this
is a disaster. I am very worried.

316
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:48,044
Well, don't worry. We will find Prue,
and we will find the Banshee.

317
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:50,280
At least we saved that girl.

318
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:52,878
Yeah, and how are we
gonna save you?

319
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:56,049
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about how the Banshee

320
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:58,962
zeroed in on you even though
I was the one blowing up things.

321
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,088
- So?
- So,

322
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:03,684
the Banshee seeks out people
who are in great pain.

323
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:07,081
- And apparently it thinks you are.
- Piper, that's ridiculous.

324
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,287
Phoebe, you are not the first Halliwell
to fall in love

325
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:11,928
with a demon and get burned.

326
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:15,525
I know how much that hurts, which
means I know how much you hurt.

327
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:18,482
But I think you're in denial.

328
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:21,648
Okay.

329
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:23,841
Well, if you'll forgive me, Dr. Laura,

330
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:26,558
I have a different demon to worry
about at the moment.

331
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:28,526
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

332
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:30,401
I'm gonna get the Book of Shadows

333
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:32,525
so we can cast
the tracking spell on me.

334
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:35,965
Wait. You wanna turn yourself
into a dog too?

335
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:38,683
Do you know a better way to find
the Banshee and to find Prue?

336
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:40,721
No. But...

337
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:44,239
Then you will mind your business, and
I'm going to get the Book of Shadows.

338
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:33,198
Well, there isn't any shelter open.

339
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:34,882
This is an emergency.

340
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:37,404
Well, there's gotta be some place.

341
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:41,398
Never mind.

342
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:44,282
We lost Prue.

343
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:46,526
- What?
- She ran off

344
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:47,963
after the Banshee attacked.

345
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,767
Wait a minute.
You fought the Banshee

346
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,807
- and you and Phoebe are okay?
- Yeah, fine. Why?

347
00:23:52,969 --> 00:23:56,245
Because the Elders just told me
that Banshees are former witches.

348
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:58,567
- So?
- So the Banshee scream

349
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,118
doesn't kill witches,
it turns them into Banshees.

350
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:07,639
Why, Cole?

351
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:17,848
Piper?

352
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:20,841
Phoebe?

353
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:57,562
Shut her up.

354
00:24:58,689 --> 00:25:00,441
Phoebe, you okay?

355
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:43,122
Are you okay?

356
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:45,287
Am I okay?

357
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:48,481
Prue is a dog,
and Phoebe is a Banshee.

358
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:51,482
I am not even in the vicinity of okay.

359
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,283
How did this happen?

360
00:25:53,449 --> 00:25:54,677
What am I supposed to do?

361
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:56,123
And you could have told me

362
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,928
about the "witches turn
into Banshees" thing a little bit earlier!

363
00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:02,838
- Honey, just try and relax.
- Would you stop telling me to relax!

364
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:07,086
That was Grams' sewing machine.

365
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:09,086
Well, we don't have time
for you to lose it.

366
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:12,925
Well, too bad, because I am losing it,
whether we have time for it or not.

367
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:15,478
Listen to me. We have to save Phoebe
before she hurts anyone.

368
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:17,958
If she kills just one person,
she stays a Banshee forever.

369
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:20,438
Okay, could you give me
all the bad news at once?

370
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:23,203
Do you have to keep doling it out
for dramatic effect?

371
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:26,839
- We have to find Phoebe.
- How without Prue to track her?

372
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:29,199
We'll find a way.
You can do this, Piper.

373
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:31,007
No. Actually, I can't.

374
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:33,239
See, because Prue and Phoebe
are the super witches,

375
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:36,207
and I just tag along and freeze things.
Now I can't even do that right.

376
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:39,401
That's not true.
You're just as strong as they are.

377
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:41,642
I can't do it alone.

378
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,960
You're not alone.
We're partners. Don't you see that?

379
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:50,484
I'm sorry. It's just...
If anything happens to them...

380
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:54,318
Nothing will happen.
We won't allow it.

381
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:57,483
Where do we even begin?

382
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:01,241
Start by taking a deep breath.
That's what your guru said, right?

383
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:05,324
- Leo, that's not...
- Shut your eyes.

384
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:07,765
Clear your mind.

385
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:11,841
Listen to your instincts.
What are they telling you to do?

386
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:18,164
I think I know what to do.

387
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,683
Are you kidding?

388
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:27,887
I'd love to go, but I can't.

389
00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:30,922
The vet said someone had
to keep an eye on the dog.

390
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:35,399
Well, I got a soft spot for animals,
sue me.

391
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,644
No, no tags.

392
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:40,283
Maybe I should write an article
about irresponsible pet owners,

393
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:41,928
make them feel like dirt.

394
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:44,843
Hold it. I gotta go.

395
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:50,965
Hey, what are you doing?

396
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,881
You're supposed to be resting.

397
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:55,438
No, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.

398
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:58,803
No, not until you're better.

399
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:03,808
Yeah.

400
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:38,488
Oh, Ramon.

401
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,686
I was beginning to think
you stood me up.

402
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:55,718
You like the imported stuff.

403
00:28:56,449 --> 00:28:58,167
That's my kind of girl.

404
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:05,008
What is it? What's the matter?

405
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:09,199
You're gonna wake the neighbours.

406
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:11,559
Okay, okay. You want out, I get it.

407
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:15,204
Here, hold on.

408
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:17,447
Hey, come here.

409
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:22,406
Come here!

410
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:24,361
Piper, think this through, please.

411
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,724
You were the one that told me
to trust my instincts.

412
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:29,728
Yes, that was before you said you
were gonna summon Cole, though.

413
00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:31,561
Well, believe me,
it was not my first idea.

414
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,321
Well, then what was your first idea?

415
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:35,559
- Let's do that instead.
- That won't work. This will.

416
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:38,404
The last time Cole was here,
he killed a witch, remember?

417
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,037
That is what this is for.

418
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:43,246
What if he makes his move before
you get a chance to vanquish him?

419
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,361
- I'll freeze him.
- Now you're confident in your powers?

420
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:48,565
Okay, so maybe I'll blow him up.

421
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:50,640
But what if he blows us up first?

422
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:53,204
Well, you're already dead.
What's the difference?

423
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:55,439
The difference is that
I don't want you to join me.

424
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:58,840
Leo, I love you,

425
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:02,126
and it's because of you that I have
the courage to even attempt this.

426
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:04,285
But we don't have any other options.

427
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:06,724
Now, the Banshees target people
who are in pain.

428
00:30:06,969 --> 00:30:08,448
That's why it went after Phoebe.

429
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:10,281
And Cole is the source
of Phoebe's pain.

430
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:13,009
So if we can get him to find her
and eliminate that pain,

431
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:15,160
then we might be able
to get Phoebe back.

432
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:17,599
Do you really think he'll help us?

433
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,282
Feelings like theirs don't go away.

434
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:24,922
We should know.

435
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:35,606
"Magic forces, black and white
Reaching out through space and light

436
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:39,598
Be he far or be he near
Bring us the demon Belthazor here"

437
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:44,847
You rang?

438
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:49,009
Piper? Not the sister
I was expecting.

439
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:51,883
Phoebe's in trouble.
She's been turned into a Banshee.

440
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:54,319
A Banshee? Well, that's different.

441
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:58,168
It happened because she was hurting,
over you.

442
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:00,965
And I think you're the key
to turning her back.

443
00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:02,966
Sorry, I don't do good anymore.

444
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:07,645
- Not even for somebody you love?
- "Loved." Past tense.

445
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,880
I think we've heard enough.

446
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:13,163
Feelings like that don't just die, Cole.

447
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:16,606
Wrong. They died when Phoebe
gave up on me.

448
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:18,487
Now all I can do is return the favour.

449
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:20,958
You've helped us before.
And we have helped you.

450
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:23,637
Oh, is that what you were doing
when you called me this morning,

451
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:27,119
helping me?
Or trying to vanquish me?

452
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:29,400
Piper, the potion.

453
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:34,364
Phoebe loves you, Cole,
and I know that you love Phoebe.

454
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:37,885
All I'm asking you to do is find her
and tell her.

455
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,165
It's over, Piper,

456
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:42,645
- in more ways than one.
- Throw the potion.

457
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:44,726
You're right, Cole.

458
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:46,647
It is over.

459
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:55,039
Surprise.

460
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:00,687
- But...
- Did you really think

461
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:04,160
that I would come here without
magical protection? The question is,

462
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,281
do you have any protection
for yourself?

463
00:32:06,449 --> 00:32:07,848
Don't threaten her.

464
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:10,961
I suggest you orb her
out of here, whitelighter...

465
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:14,244
...before there's nothing left to orb.

466
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,721
- Prue?
- Prue?

467
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:30,925
What's going on?

468
00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:33,279
Phoebe's home.

469
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:05,117
You think she's all right?

470
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:09,078
No, I don't.
Either way, Phoebe's screwed.

471
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:12,283
I meant Prue.
She seems kind of down.

472
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:16,005
Well, she should be.
We're about to lose a sister.

473
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,121
I thought you said Cole
would never hurt her.

474
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:19,688
In self-defence he would.

475
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:21,925
Did you see her?
She was pissed off.

476
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:25,679
On the other hand, if she kills him,
then she's a Banshee forever.

477
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:28,725
This is all my fault.

478
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:33,248
She zeroed in on Cole's pain for her.
I led her to him.

479
00:33:33,449 --> 00:33:35,485
Well, we found Prue.
We will find Phoebe.

480
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:39,045
But how? And what if it's too late?

481
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:41,246
Prue, would you be quiet.

482
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:44,079
Maybe you should try scrying.

483
00:33:48,849 --> 00:33:51,317
She hears Phoebe.
Hurry! Hurry! Go, go, go!

484
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:30,644
Don't make me kill you.

485
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:38,321
Damn it, Phoebe.

486
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:41,084
I love you.

487
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,718
Prue! Prue!

488
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:15,282
Prue?

489
00:35:16,169 --> 00:35:17,682
You're...

490
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:20,166
- My hip.
- What happened?

491
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:21,557
I had a little accident.

492
00:35:21,729 --> 00:35:24,448
Hey, Leo, not that I'm complaining,
but why am I human again?

493
00:35:24,649 --> 00:35:26,162
The spell must have played itself out.

494
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:28,889
Phoebe must not be
a Banshee anymore.

495
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:32,082
So does that mean
Phoebe's alive or?

496
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:38,001
Stay away from me.

497
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:41,687
Just stay away.

498
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,561
- Phoebe.
- I don't wanna hear it, Cole.

499
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:45,725
Yeah, you do.

500
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:49,928
You're not the only one hurting here,
we both are.

501
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,281
That's why we were drawn
into this mess.

502
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:57,207
I tried to deny it too. I tried everything
to break my feelings for you,

503
00:35:57,369 --> 00:35:58,768
even magic.

504
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:00,318
But nothing works.

505
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:03,441
- Doesn't change anything.
- No.

506
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:05,768
It doesn't.

507
00:36:06,569 --> 00:36:09,447
It doesn't change the fact
that I killed a witch,

508
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:12,639
even if I was tricked into doing it.

509
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:16,998
- What do you mean?
- Forget it, doesn't matter.

510
00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:19,285
Yeah, well, maybe it matters to me.

511
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:24,721
Raynor cast a spell.
He made me kill her against my will.

512
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:28,404
And why would he do that?

513
00:36:31,009 --> 00:36:32,840
Because he wanted to turn me.

514
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:36,165
And he knew the only way to do that

515
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:39,004
was to destroy the one thing
that was keeping me good.

516
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:42,482
He knew that my killing a witch
would destroy your faith in me.

517
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:45,723
And he was right.

518
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:52,760
I don't know what to say.

519
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:03,079
There's nothing to say.

520
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:05,247
Like you said,

521
00:37:06,649 --> 00:37:09,880
it doesn't change the fact that I did it,

522
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:13,322
or that we'll always love each other.

523
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:18,043
I guess that's a pain
we'll both have to live with.

524
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:35,682
I sense her.

525
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:37,558
Phoebe's alive.

526
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:39,920
So Phoebe-Banshee...

527
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:41,238
Is Phoebe-Phoebe.

528
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:43,287
Looks like your plan worked after all.

529
00:37:43,689 --> 00:37:45,202
Yeah, but if she had to
vanquish Cole,

530
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:48,247
then she's probably not doing
very well. Why don't you go get her?

531
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:56,237
- What are you doing?
- I think you got fleas.

532
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:58,639
You know what, that's so not funny,
because I think I do.

533
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,288
- I think you do.
- Okay,

534
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:03,681
you have no idea how hard
it was being a dog.

535
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,522
Okay? I mean peeing outside,

536
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:11,599
eating everything and anything,
and just smelling everything.

537
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:14,363
Must have been rough,
no pun intended.

538
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:17,920
Well, at least I got to meet
a really cute guy.

539
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:19,363
You met a guy?

540
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:20,644
As a dog?

541
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:23,642
- How?
- Well, he ran me over.

542
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:47,247
Here you go.

543
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:49,367
Thank you.

544
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:52,565
You know, you might want
to raise the drink prices.

545
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:53,844
Why?

546
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:56,605
The bill from the window-repair guy.

547
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:00,443
Ouch.

548
00:39:00,649 --> 00:39:03,288
Yeah, we really keep
that guy in business, don't we?

549
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:08,722
Are you expecting someone?

550
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:10,481
A certain journalist
with an empty fridge

551
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:12,799
and a soft spot for man's best friend.

552
00:39:14,169 --> 00:39:17,002
He hits you, you hit on him.
It's only fair.

553
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:21,799
Hey, how could I resist a guy who
put up fliers to find me? Excuse me.

554
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:29,604
It's good to see you out.
It's been a while.

555
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:31,407
Yeah, I guess
we're both out of hiding.

556
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:34,998
- I've been wanting to thank you.
- For?

557
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:37,088
Calling Cole.

558
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:40,885
I mean if you hadn't,
I'd probably still be screaming.

559
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:44,326
Yeah, well,
nothing like trusting your instincts.

560
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:45,844
I know what you mean.

561
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:48,883
I think I'm gonna act
on some of my own.

562
00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:51,999
Do I even wanna ask?

563
00:39:52,169 --> 00:39:54,763
I think I made a mistake
giving up on Cole.

564
00:39:55,649 --> 00:39:57,640
I now know why he did what he did.

565
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:00,241
- Phoebe.
- He loves me.

566
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:03,200
Which means that there's still good
in him.

567
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:07,480
I can bring him back. I know I can.
