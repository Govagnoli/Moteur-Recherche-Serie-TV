1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,461
Here's the thing, I have powers,

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:04,880
which means my sister
has powers too.

3
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:07,883
So if the demon that took her
wanted to use her powers for evil,

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,469
the only place he could do that
would be corporate America. So...

5
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,639
So you think this is some kind
of demonic conspiracy?

6
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,432
Exactly. What do you think?

7
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,228
Well, I think if it is,
it'll still be there tomorrow.

8
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,438
Today, you're supposed to pick up
your parents.

9
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,315
- No, wait.
- No, no waiting.

10
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,484
They travelled a very long way
to see you, Billie.

11
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:26,693
Your idea, not mine.

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,570
I think it was a very good idea,
thank you.

13
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,074
- Well, you haven't met them yet.
- Oh, come on. They can't be that bad.

14
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:35,244
No? My father is a robot,
my mother is a wallflower,

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,246
and they haven't talked
about my sister in years.

16
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,122
And that's why
we invited them to dinner.

17
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,542
Trust me, okay?
A little bit of Piper's food,

18
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,419
some nice wine,
and everyone will be able to relax.

19
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,922
Oh, you cannot relax around them,
they're impossible.

20
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,383
And plus, they don't know anything
about witches or magic.

21
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,176
Well, they must have some idea,

22
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,761
especially if you both have powers.

23
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,596
I think we were both adopted.

24
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,432
Let me get back to my theory.
So I have an appointment

25
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,977
with one of those muckamucks
who was kidnapped as a kid.

26
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,814
And I think if I can just get him
to touch this paper I enchanted,

27
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,109
I'll know he's magical,
and then I'll know I'm onto something.

28
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,944
Wait a minute,
how do you know that works?

29
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,696
Well, I tested it on Paige
a few days ago.

30
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,364
Please don't tell her.

31
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:17,119
Okay, here's the deal.

32
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,204
- If you wanna borrow my car, you can.
- Great.

33
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,623
But only if you're going to pick up
your parents, okay?

34
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,125
Not chase some lead.

35
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,961
It can't be as bad as you think,
and you know what, who knows,

36
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,796
- they may even surprise you.
- Surprise me?

37
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,466
They're gonna suck the life
out of this place.

38
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,318
Dominique, everything
is gonna be fine.

39
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,111
Just make sure
you have enough beer,

40
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,280
turn the music up,
turn the lights down low,

41
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,115
and you'll be fine, all right?

42
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,575
All right, I'll talk to you later.

43
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,202
Bye.

44
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,334
- What's that for?
- This is for Leo.

45
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,380
You're videotaping yourself
setting the table for Leo?

46
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,717
Well, when you go away on a long trip,
it's the little things you miss.

47
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:01,056
Yeah, but, sweetie,
he's not on a long trip.

48
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,432
He's frozen.

49
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,268
- Not for long.
- Yeah.

50
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,728
Unfortunately, we don't know
how long it's gonna take.

51
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,983
Precisely my point, okay?
So just, you know, act natural.

52
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,445
Okay, you know what?
I'm just gonna go work upstairs.

53
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,906
Wait, wait, wait.
Is it gonna bother you that much?

54
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,116
Well, yeah.

55
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,411
Okay, no, it's not just that. I'm just...

56
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,288
I'm having a little trouble
with my column.

57
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,914
Really?

58
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,374
Could you turn to the camera

59
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,169
and tell me a little bit more
about that problem?

60
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,756
Well, it's really quite simple.
I don't know what my problem is.

61
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,467
I mean, there's these twins,
and they live together, right?

62
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,720
The girl doesn't know
if she's gonna be able to open up

63
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,598
to her boyfriend because
she's so close to her brother.

64
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,642
All right, so, what do you think?

65
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,937
I have no idea what I think,
and that's the problem.

66
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,689
But I have to come up
with something fast

67
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,400
because my deadline is tomorrow.

68
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,736
Well, I'm sure you'll think
of something, you always do.

69
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,780
Besides, maybe it'll make
for great dinner conversation.

70
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,283
Did Billie go to get her parents?

71
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,743
God, I hope so.

72
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,790
Billie, I feel terrible
about what happened to your sister,

73
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,543
but I'm still not sure
how you think I can help you?

74
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,046
Well, I'm just trying to find
a connection, Mr. Dalvos,

75
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,465
anything that could help me
possibly find her.

76
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:22,638
Maybe you've met or possibly heard
of some of the other kidnap victims?

77
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:26,475
They were found days later,
just like you.

78
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,103
Just so we're clear,

79
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,689
you are not taking this company
public, you got that?

80
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,650
Grant, I'm in a meeting here.

81
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,069
You can lobby behind my back
all you want,

82
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,862
but it's never gonna happen.

83
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,241
See, my father made me chairman,
cousin, not you.

84
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,327
Which means we stay private
just like he wanted us to.

85
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,828
We should talk about this later.

86
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,121
There's nothing to talk about.

87
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,708
You try a power play tomorrow,
I'll crush you.

88
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,089
Please excuse my cousin.

89
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,716
He's been under a great deal
of pressure since his father died.

90
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,678
You know what, that's okay.
I'll just come back later, thank you.

91
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,346
Bye.

92
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,145
She's a witch, isn't she?

93
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,189
You've learned your lessons well.

94
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,483
I've had a good teacher.

95
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,529
Still, it would've been better for you
not to have met with her at all.

96
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,282
You are a heartbeat away
from taking over

97
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,117
one of the country's
most powerful companies,

98
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:29,955
which means now is not the time
to risk getting exposed.

99
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,169
Of course, that is why you have me.

100
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,837
Can you handle her?

101
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,047
I think if I was able
to switch you at birth,

102
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,216
put you in position
to take great power,

103
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,011
I can handle one little witch.

104
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,725
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey.

105
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,895
- Bad timing?
- Oh, no, no, no. It's great to see you.

106
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,901
So how's your brother-in-law?
You heard from him?

107
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,862
No. No, we haven't.

108
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,240
Which you would know
if you returned a phone call.

109
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,869
I did call you...
I didn't call you back, did I?

110
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,288
Paige, I'm sorry.
Work is crazy, I'm sorry.

111
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,792
That's okay, and just so you know,
if it is something else, it's okay.

112
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,503
No, no, no. No.

113
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,963
Look, forget about work.

114
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,882
What are you doing
for dinner tonight?

115
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,300
Actually, I have plans.

116
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:29,056
No, not like that. It's with my sisters
and our friend Billie.

117
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,766
Her parents are in town, so...

118
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:34,311
Good. Afterwards, me and you,
P3, 9:00. Say yes.

119
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,439
Yes.

120
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,693
Nine o'clock, but don't be late.

121
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,120
They ain't never listen to me.
Never listen to me.

122
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,998
Get out the way. Get out of here.

123
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,418
- I'm sure she'll be here soon.
- Yeah.

124
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,851
Hi, guys, I'm so sorry.

125
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,811
- Traffic was horrible.
- It's all right, honey.

126
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,020
- Hi.
- Hi.

127
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,814
I hope you and Dad
weren't waiting too long.

128
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,149
- No.
- Define "too long. "

129
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,193
Well, what a cute little car.

130
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,737
Thanks, it's Phoebe's. She's so great.
You'll meet her tonight.

131
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,656
I mean they're all... They're all great.

132
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,324
- Here, I got it.
- No, Dad, it's fine.

133
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,327
- Are you sure?
- Mom, you squeeze in the back.

134
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,621
Ready? Let's just go.

135
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,587
- Honey, would you...?
- Oh, yeah. Here.

136
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,340
- You guys ready to see my school?
- That's why we're here.

137
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,814
"Am I Too Close to My Twin?"

138
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,065
<i>Wait, what?</i>

139
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,567
<i>I'm sorry, I can't hear you.</i>

140
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:07,404
"Am I Too Close to My Twin?"
You know, my column?

141
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,199
Oh, right. Is it done?

142
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,242
No. See, that's the problem.

143
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,578
<i>I'm having a hard time
coming up with an answer,</i>

144
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:18,582
which is weird considering how close
I am to my sisters, you know?

145
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,587
Maybe a little too close.

146
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,715
<i>That's so weird. Your answers
usually come so easily.</i>

147
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,592
Yeah, go figure.

148
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,845
All right, tell Elise I'm on top of it,

149
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,680
and I'll have the column
in by tonight.

150
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,265
- Okay, bye.
- Where are you going?

151
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,100
- Hey, Piper?
- Yeah.

152
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,229
Is there any way that we could
keep it down just a little bit?

153
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,439
Well, you know, it's for Leo.

154
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,945
Okay, you're right.
I'll just go upstairs and do this.

155
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,863
Or you could help me
get the house ready

156
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,114
for our dinner guests.

157
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,703
Piper, dinner is like four hours
from now.

158
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,413
Are you sure you're doing okay?

159
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,749
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

160
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,126
Why? Because you didn't clean
and prep this much

161
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,129
for your own wedding, that's why.

162
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,090
Piper, you're not dealing.

163
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,175
You're not helping.

164
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,098
Billie. You're really early.

165
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:21,270
Yeah, we decided to drive by
the campus instead.

166
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,188
Can we come in?

167
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,023
Please?

168
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,794
You know,

169
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,965
Phoebe over here
is actually "Ask Phoebe,"

170
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,134
the advice columnist
from "The Bay Mirror. "

171
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,344
Really?

172
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,307
Yeah, that's me.

173
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,020
Actually, I'm working
on a very interesting question

174
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,607
- from one of my readers right now.
- We don't read the advice columns.

175
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,485
Would anyone like more wine?

176
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,988
Oh, well, that reminds me,

177
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:17,492
I have to go meet Henry.
You know, for drinks.

178
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,121
Getting kind of late. If there's anyone
you don't wanna be late for,

179
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,248
that would be a parole officer.

180
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,417
Okay, honey, good luck.

181
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,503
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

182
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:33,592
- Did she say "parole officer"?
- It's not what you think.

183
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,302
- Interesting friends.
- Excuse me?

184
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,055
Well, I think we should be going too.

185
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,848
It was kind of you to invite us.
Thank you.

186
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,517
Wait, wait. No, don't...

187
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,977
And we... You know,
you haven't even had dessert yet.

188
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,604
It's been a long trip.

189
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,065
I need to ask you guys
about Christy right now.

190
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,860
That's not something we talk about
in front of strangers.

191
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,362
We're not really strangers.

192
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,531
No, actually, Dad, they're friends.

193
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,534
Really good friends. And for the record,
you never wanna talk about her.

194
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,827
In fact, I remember a month
after she was taken,

195
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,372
you went back to your pretty little lives
like nothing happened.

196
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:06,041
- But something did happen.
- You were 5, what do you know?

197
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,210
I know you didn't do a damn thing
to try and find her!

198
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:09,419
That's not true.

199
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,047
Okay, maybe we should all just
sit down and...

200
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,549
I told you coming here
was a mistake.

201
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,133
No, the mistake was me thinking

202
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,052
you guys could know
that this hurts me too.

203
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:20,222
- Why do you always do this to us?
- She doesn't care about us, that's why.

204
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,599
I don't care about you?

205
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,519
You guys
are cold-hearted assassins.

206
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,450
Nice shot, babe.

207
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,743
Thanks, hon.

208
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,668
Oh, boy.

209
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,051
Titanium.

210
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,386
The best.

211
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,930
Nice gun. Where'd you get that?

212
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,975
I don't know, but I like it.

213
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,310
Me too.

214
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,396
- What is going on?
- Piper, what did you put in their food?

215
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,691
- Food was in the food, thank you.
- Okay, how do you explain this?

216
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,903
Well, don't look at me,
she's the one that said "assassins. "

217
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,907
- It's a figure of speech.
- Well, apparently not.

218
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:27,623
- Mom, Dad?
- Excuse me?

219
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,250
Who are you?

220
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,628
I'm your daughter... Billie?

221
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,298
Come here. Come here.

222
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,552
Okay, let's talk over here.

223
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,054
You guys just don't mind us,

224
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:45,098
just keep grossing me out
over there.

225
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,476
How did this happen?

226
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,853
I have no idea,
but we have to figure it out fast.

227
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,105
Okay, why don't you two go upstairs
and check the "Book,"

228
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,775
see if you can find anything
that will help them,

229
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:59,446
and I will stay here and keep an eye
on mister and missus there.

230
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:06,078
Well, I don't think it was a spell,
because the words didn't rhyme.

231
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:09,248
But obviously, it had something
to do with the words, right?

232
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,000
- You know, or maybe it was just...
- Me.

233
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,710
Well, no,
it couldn't have just been you.

234
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,672
I mean, that was a pretty
powerful transformation down there.

235
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,174
Well, tell that to these flowers.

236
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,802
This morning they were alive
until I said something like:

237
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,513
"Suck the life out of this place,"
and then they just...

238
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,848
Got the life sucked out of them?

239
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,851
Phoebe, what's happening to me?

240
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,561
Oh, sweetie, I don't know.

241
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,856
Although, I do know of a power
called projection,

242
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,817
and I've never actually seen it,
but I know it exists.

243
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,319
- Projection?
- Lets the witch turn people and things

244
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,364
into whatever comes to mind,
without a spell or a potion.

245
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:44,533
- It's pretty powerful stuff.
- Wait. So you're saying

246
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,368
I just all of a sudden
have this new power?

247
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,537
Well, it kind of makes sense
if you think about it.

248
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,747
Right? I mean, you're growing
as a witch,

249
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,833
and our powers are tied
to our emotions,

250
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,751
and you've been
suppressing those lately.

251
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,254
Well, if I can turn my parents
into something,

252
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:59,590
I can turn them back, right?

253
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,763
Dead flowers, be alive again.

254
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:12,394
Yeah, it takes a while
to get the hang of new powers.

255
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,063
Plus, you're not in the same
emotional state you were downstairs.

256
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,232
Well, how do I get back
to that same emotional state?

257
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,236
I don't know, but when you figure
it out, just be careful what you say.

258
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,696
Hello.

259
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,907
- They're getting away.
- Piper?

260
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,075
Hello!

261
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:31,205
- Oh, my gosh!
- Piper, what happened?

262
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,207
Well...

263
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,710
- I'm sorry.
- Your parents jumped me.

264
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,545
The last time
I invite them to dinner.

265
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,797
- Easy, easy.
- They beat your freeze?

266
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,384
I didn't even have a chance.
They're fast and they're dangerous.

267
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,386
What do you mean?

268
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,640
They said they were going to find
some real action.

269
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,433
What does that mean?

270
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,769
The only action I remember
them looking for growing up

271
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,604
was bowling night.

272
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:58,440
Well, now, apparently,
they're looking for an arsenal.

273
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,459
Hey, Paige, what's up?

274
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,087
Hey. Hi.

275
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,464
I'm supposed to meet my date here.
Has anyone come up

276
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,466
- and asked for me?
- No, not tonight.

277
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,511
Because he was supposed
to meet me 30 minutes ago.

278
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,096
Okay, you're sure?

279
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,139
I'm sure. Sorry.

280
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,271
You're late.

281
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,480
Paige, hi. Where are you?

282
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,984
Well, apparently, I'm being stood up.

283
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,070
<i>- Why?
- Because we need you at home.</i>

284
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:49,908
Apparently, we have
some assassins to save.

285
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,514
Where you hiding
all those things anyway?

286
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,516
Well, I'm all out of ammo now,

287
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,603
but you're welcome to check.

288
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,605
Later.

289
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,024
First we need to stock up.

290
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,318
Ammo for me.

291
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:28,572
- Prada for you?
- Oh, you read my mind.

292
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,657
Thank you.

293
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,410
All right, ladies, so, what is it?
What's the plan?

294
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,078
Well, hello to you too.

295
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,288
Sorry, just got stood up.

296
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:38,499
Not really so much
in the mood for chitchat.

297
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,376
Well, I'm sure Henry has
a perfectly good explanation for that.

298
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,880
Doesn't he always?
Okay, what's going on?

299
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,548
Find my parents
before they kill someone.

300
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:47,883
We're gonna stun them with this,

301
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,302
bring them back here,
and then change them back.

302
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,721
Except we haven't figured out
that last part yet.

303
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:55,224
Yeah, and this isn't working.
Maybe I should use my new power,

304
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,185
turn myself into a target
so they can come after me.

305
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,189
- You know, Billie, this isn't your fault.
- Yes, it is.

306
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:05,609
No, you got emotional and hurt.
It's completely understandable.

307
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,194
Can we make
some of that stun potion

308
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,279
- for me to use on Mr. Henry?
- People, focus.

309
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,573
The longer they're out there,
the more damage they do.

310
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,617
You know, scrying's
not gonna work for them anyway

311
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:14,952
because they're not magical.

312
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,954
No, but they are enchanted.

313
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,790
- Hey, I think I found them.
- Okay, great.

314
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,626
- Piper, take these.
- Oh, no, I can't go.

315
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,086
Why not?

316
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:25,754
Well, the boys.

317
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,215
Sweetie, the boys will be okay.

318
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:29,925
I'll stay here,
don't worry about them.

319
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,637
No, I know, I'm just...
You know, with Leo gone,

320
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,764
I kind of wanna stay close to them.

321
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,731
Okay, I'll go.

322
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,990
We'll be back.

323
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,292
Are they dead?

324
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,086
No, it looks like
they're still breathing.

325
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,010
Looks like your parents
were just toying with them.

326
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,679
I don't know if that's a good thing
or a bad thing.

327
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,598
Bad thing! Throw the potion.

328
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,145
Mom, Dad, we're not trying to hurt you.
We wanna help you.

329
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,314
- Why does she keep calling us that?
- I have no idea.

330
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,815
Paige.

331
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,202
You said you could handle this.
You promised.

332
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,661
Have I ever let you down?

333
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:43,832
No. No, it's just yesterday
I had only one witch to worry about.

334
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,542
Now I've got three.

335
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,836
Not just any three witches,

336
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:49,796
the Charmed Ones.

337
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,550
What? That's who they are?

338
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,886
I don't have the power
to stand up to them.

339
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,013
You don't have the power
to stand up to anybody.

340
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,182
Demonically speaking, I mean.

341
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,184
But you won't have to.

342
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,353
As far as they know, you're human.

343
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,729
They can't touch you.

344
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:09,566
Maybe not, but they're sure as hell
not gonna let us take out Grant

345
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,109
so I can become chairman.

346
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:14,404
We won't have to take him out,
they'll do it for us.

347
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,865
At least
Billie's spellbound parents will.

348
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,993
- How?
- You're going to hire them.

349
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,646
I hear you two are looking
for some action.

350
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,399
I come bearing gifts.

351
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,695
- And who are you?
- Someone who wants somebody killed.

352
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:55,904
Interested?

353
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,540
Everything you'll need
to get through security,

354
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,083
including the weapon,

355
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,210
which I assume
you'll be able to figure out.

356
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,714
- Who's the mark?
- In the envelope.

357
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,592
It won't be easy, and you'll only get
one shot at him.

358
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,844
Plus, the meeting's
in less than an hour.

359
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,930
And what's in it for us?

360
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,057
Whatever you want.

361
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:31,023
We're in.

362
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,579
They still moving?

363
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,831
Yep.

364
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:51,210
Hey, are you okay?

365
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:54,213
Oh, yeah, sure, considering
my parents tried to shoot me.

366
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,423
Well, if it makes you feel better,

367
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,509
they weren't really your parents
when they did that.

368
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,969
I mean, they didn't know
they were your parents,

369
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,972
but they are your parents
is what I'm saying.

370
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,058
Just keep mixing.

371
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,477
I just still can't believe
this is all happening.

372
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:10,062
Well, it's not your fault.

373
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,438
You didn't do anything wrong.

374
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:14,233
I know, but still.
You know, it's so weird,

375
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:17,069
but I can remember them
being like this all the time.

376
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,655
- What, like assassins?
- No, happy.

377
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:23,283
Together, working together, laughing.

378
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,994
But, you know, when Christy
got kidnapped, it all just...

379
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,163
It's the hardest thing
in the world to lose a child.

380
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,290
I know. I know that.

381
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,876
Even though
I may have just been 5,

382
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,378
I miss the way it used to be.

383
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:37,965
I guess it's good to know
they have it in them still.

384
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:39,675
Who knows?

385
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:41,510
Maybe they'll be like that
again soon,

386
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:43,720
after you find Christy.

387
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,014
Piper?

388
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,059
No, she's with the babies,
putting them down for a nap.

389
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,520
Here, I think I know who it is.

390
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:54,481
Oh, and we lucked out
with her parents before,

391
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:56,650
but we need to stop them
before they kill an innocent.

392
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,152
I know, I know.

393
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,076
Henry, hi.

394
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:07,536
Did you get any of my calls?

395
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:09,997
Yeah, I got all your calls.

396
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:13,375
Okay, you're mad. I don't blame you.

397
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,419
I can explain though, all right?

398
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:19,548
There's really nothing to explain.
You stood me up.

399
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:22,509
One of my parolees skipped out.
What was I supposed to do?

400
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,261
- Call me?
- No, I did. I tried calling.

401
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,847
Before, Henry, not after.

402
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,724
Here's the thing.
I'm a big girl, I really am.

403
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:32,227
So if you don't wanna go out with me,
please just say so,

404
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,980
because I'm really not into
the whole game-playing thing.

405
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:36,607
I am not playing any games, Paige.

406
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,359
It's not supposed to be
this hard this early.

407
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,028
I keep feeling there's something off

408
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:42,779
or there's something
you're not telling me.

409
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,240
- Some sort of secret.
- What are you not telling me?

410
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,952
- Don't turn this around on me.
- No, I'll admit, I have my secrets.

411
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,372
Oh, my God, are you married?

412
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,874
No, I'm not married.

413
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,586
Look, we both know you're not
telling me something here, okay?

414
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:02,716
I have trouble getting close
to people, Paige.

415
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:05,552
And I know it doesn't let me off,
but when you're holding back on me...

416
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,721
Paige! We gotta move.

417
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:12,100
So we could get the thing
from the thing for the thing.

418
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,145
Yeah. Okay, well, I have to go.

419
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,065
I'll call you.

420
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:20,025
- You promise?
- Promise.

421
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,201
Sorry, it's just her parents
stopped moving.

422
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:32,830
Right where I was trying to prove
my conspiracy theory too.

423
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,456
What conspiracy theory?

424
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:36,834
The one about my sister
being one of many powerful kids

425
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,377
that was kidnapped by demons.

426
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:40,963
Think "Manchurian Candidate. "

427
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,714
- Which version?
- Does it matter?

428
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,634
I don't even understand what
my parents are doing here anyway.

429
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:48,679
I mean, it's too big of a coincidence
to be a coincidence, right?

430
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,390
Well, maybe there really are demons
at the company,

431
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:52,766
and they know you're on to them.

432
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,519
Maybe they're using your parents
as leverage.

433
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,356
This time you're going, I'm staying.

434
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:00,607
- Wait, but...
- No buts.

435
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,569
We don't know what we're up against.
You have more firepower than I do.

436
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:06,238
- Yeah, but you've got the potions.
- They're only stun potions.

437
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:08,031
So we can make
vanquishing potions.

438
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:10,367
We don't have time,
my parents don't have time.

439
00:24:13,162 --> 00:24:15,289
Look, you can't hole up here
anymore.

440
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,834
And you can't busy yourself
with endless tasks, okay?

441
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,836
You have to get back
out there and fight.

442
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:24,923
For Leo.

443
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:32,264
- They did save a spot for us.
- Oh, yeah.

444
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,476
Just step through.

445
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:41,773
Just change ID for that.

446
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,567
Do you see them anywhere?

447
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:45,277
Nope.

448
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,029
How do you know they're in there?

449
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:50,157
Well, Dalvos is here,
so they have to be close.

450
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:56,955
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

451
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:59,082
Help yourself.

452
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,804
Thank you. Thank you.

453
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,557
Good afternoon, everyone.

454
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:16,892
There's been a lot of talk

455
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,895
about where our company's
going next.

456
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:23,065
Both in terms of our businesses,

457
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:25,275
and in terms
of the broader question:

458
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:29,363
Will Pelham go public
or remain private?

459
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,157
It's this question
I'd like to address today.

460
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:35,160
Now, Pelham is a family company,

461
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:37,871
founded on old-fashioned values.

462
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,249
- Trust, hard work,
- There they are.

463
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:41,625
- And results.
- Two tables from the front.

464
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:44,419
- Well, at least they're okay.
- How are we gonna get them out?

465
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:46,004
We wait.

466
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:50,217
So I think the real question
we should be asking is:

467
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:54,930
Which direction will better serve
these core values?

468
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:59,017
So after much consideration,

469
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,938
I want to reassure everyone
in every division,

470
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:04,898
from microchips to macro-turbines,

471
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:08,360
that Pelham is going to remain...

472
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,074
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

473
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:19,413
Hot!

474
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,957
Something's not right.
Why would they wanna shoot him?

475
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:23,834
Because I wanted them to.

476
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,128
And just so you know,
whether or not you vanquish me,

477
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:28,297
it won't save Mommy and Daddy.

478
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,383
- How do you figure?
- Because the chairman

479
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,593
is still going to die.

480
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:35,554
And they will still
be blamed for his murder.

481
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,767
And afterwards,
our greatest creation,

482
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:44,146
for all intents and purposes,
a human,

483
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:47,274
Rod Dalvos, will take over.

484
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:48,692
And with it,

485
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:52,654
give us the demonic foothold
we've worked a generation to achieve.

486
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,990
And how do you plan
to accomplish all this?

487
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,475
I don't know, it just came to me.

488
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:24,853
I don't know why I had a hard time
with the question in the first place.

489
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,772
<i>But it's brilliant, Phoebe, really.</i>

490
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:28,524
Well, I don't know about brilliant.

491
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,192
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

492
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:33,529
<i>"Sometimes people can rely
a little too much on a sibling</i>

493
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,030
<i>for their emotional needs,</i>

494
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:38,283
<i>not being open to finding love
outside of the home.</i>

495
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:42,079
Sometimes you have to move out
to move on. "

496
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:43,372
How'd you come up with that?

497
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:46,041
Well, let's just say I can relate.

498
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:50,546
And it took me a little while
to figure it out, you know?

499
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:53,674
And some peace and quiet.

500
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:57,886
- We got big problems.
- So much for peace and quiet.

501
00:27:58,053 --> 00:27:59,555
Okay, get that to copy right away

502
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,515
because I don't wanna miss
the deadline.

503
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,308
- All right, thanks.
- Where are the boys?

504
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,353
- They're still napping.
- Okay, I'm gonna take them to Dad's.

505
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,814
I don't want them to be around here.
And just so we're clear,

506
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,817
I'm not ducking a fight,
I'm just protecting my kids.

507
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,612
- What's going on? What happened?
- What's going on is my parents

508
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,906
- just tried to kill someone.
- But they didn't.

509
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,867
Oh, well, thank God for that.

510
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:22,077
Yeah, except for they are
wanted for murder.

511
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:25,164
- They were set up by this demon...
- A human demon.

512
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,166
Yeah, who wants to take over
the company.

513
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:28,834
Back up, a human demon?

514
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:31,670
Yeah, Dalvos, the guy I met?
He hired my parents to kill his boss.

515
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,422
Well, he actually hired the nanny.

516
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:35,591
Wait, the demon has a nanny?

517
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,759
She's really the one
who's pulling the strings.

518
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,136
She's trying to frame my parents.

519
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:40,762
We have to get to them
before she does.

520
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,097
Or the police do.

521
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:45,225
Close to the shooter?

522
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:48,562
- He was right nearby.
- Okay. And then?

523
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,522
He was standing like this,
and he made one shot.

524
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,275
Do you have any idea why anyone
would wanna shoot your cousin?

525
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:57,196
I honestly don't know
why they'd wanna kill Grant.

526
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,364
I mean, I assume it's connected
to their daughter

527
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,116
coming to ask for our help
yesterday.

528
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:02,784
- Help for what?
- Care to elaborate?

529
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:04,453
Help in finding her sister.

530
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,954
I guess she thought since I, too,

531
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:08,624
was a kidnap victim as a child,
we could help.

532
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:12,294
We looked into the possibility,
of course, but when Grant discovered

533
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:14,379
that her parents had spent
the past 15 years

534
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:17,132
searching for their daughter
with no success,

535
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,968
he decided there wasn't really
anything we could do.

536
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:28,352
Obviously, Mr. And Mrs. Jenkins
didn't like that answer.

537
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:38,987
How long before
I become chairman?

538
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:44,827
We wait for a respectable period
of mourning.

539
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,286
After all,

540
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:48,121
we wouldn't want to appear
too anxious

541
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:51,083
or cast unwanted suspicions now,
would we?

542
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,751
All right.

543
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:54,253
Then what do we do?

544
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,129
We take care of loose ends,

545
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:57,965
that's what we do.

546
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,600
Yeah?

547
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:12,646
You'll text me where to find
this loose end?

548
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:14,690
Consider it done.

549
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,526
Yes?

550
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,403
All right.

551
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,530
Where do I find the mark?

552
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,121
How's it going?

553
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,999
Not good. They've split up
and they keep moving around.

554
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,793
Every time the crystal drops,
it jumps someplace else.

555
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,212
Well, maybe they know
someone's looking for them.

556
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:39,548
Well, I think everyone's
looking for them.

557
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:40,799
Where's Paige?

558
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:43,343
She's upstairs trying to find
the demon nanny in the "Book. "

559
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,888
<i>I honestly don't know why
they'd wanna kill Grant.</i>

560
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,389
Hey, how's it going?

561
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:49,057
<i>I can only assume
it's connected...</i>

562
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,185
- Billie!
- What? Did you find anything?

563
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,895
Just this:

564
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:55,189
<i>Help in finding her sister.</i>

565
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:58,317
<i>I guess she thought since I, too,
had been a kidnap victim as a child,</i>

566
00:30:58,483 --> 00:30:59,693
<i>that we could do something.</i>

567
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:03,071
<i>We looked into the possibility,
of course,</i>

568
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,908
<i>but when Grant discovered that her
parents had spent the past 15 years</i>

569
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,076
<i>searching for her without success,</i>

570
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:12,039
<i>he decided there wasn't
really anything we could do.</i>

571
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:15,584
<i>Obviously, Mr. And Mrs. Jenkins
didn't like that answer.</i>

572
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:18,587
This is all over the Internet.

573
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:20,881
They were looking for her,
and they didn't even tell me.

574
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:23,425
Okay, we're gonna find them, Billie.

575
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:25,135
How? Scrying isn't working.

576
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:27,804
You know what?
There might be another way.

577
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:29,723
If Christy and Billie
both have powers,

578
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,100
doesn't that mean their parents
have to be the carriers?

579
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:35,062
- If it's in the blood.
- Right.

580
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:36,271
So wouldn't that mean

581
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,774
that the "Call for a Lost Witch" spell
might work?

582
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:53,705
- Helen.
- Carl.

583
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,041
I had no idea.

584
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:57,459
Me neither.

585
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:58,794
What are we gonna do?

586
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,964
Do we have a choice?

587
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:03,924
You could drop your gun.

588
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:08,762
Or you could drop yours.

589
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,269
This isn't how I wanted it to end.

590
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,229
Me neither.

591
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:22,109
I love you.

592
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:23,777
I love you too.

593
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:28,490
Freeze them.

594
00:32:29,158 --> 00:32:30,951
One move and you die.

595
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,793
Who are you?

596
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,003
Who hired you?

597
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:44,131
Who hired us?

598
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,340
To take us out.

599
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:47,009
We want names. Now!

600
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:50,304
Billie, I don't really wanna blow up
your parents, but...

601
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,306
All right, stop it. This is crazy.

602
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:55,809
You wanna shoot me?
Is that what you wanna do?

603
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:58,478
- Easy, Billie.
- You already lost one daughter.

604
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:01,106
You wanna lose another one too?

605
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,903
Do you wanna pull that trigger,
Mom?

606
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:08,322
It's not gonna bring Christy back,
and that's the one thing

607
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:10,491
you want more than anything
in this world.

608
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:15,537
Why didn't you tell me
you kept searching for her?

609
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:17,623
Don't you think I needed to know?

610
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:20,209
That I wanted to know?
I was just a kid.

611
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:24,254
I was scared and young,
and I didn't know any better,

612
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:27,549
and I thought you didn't care
about me or her.

613
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:31,720
And now, you're all I have left.

614
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:40,521
Oh, Billie.

615
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:45,692
I'm so sorry, baby.

616
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:48,028
Hey, guess what, guys,

617
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:51,406
I think I figured out
how to clear their names.

618
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,200
Did I miss something?

619
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,246
My baby.

620
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:05,212
First, I'd like to thank you all
for coming on such short notice.

621
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:09,216
Trust me, I wouldn't have dragged
you all down here if it wasn't important.

622
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:14,471
I won't be taking
the company public after all.

623
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:16,932
It's staying in the family, private.

624
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,226
Just like Grant and his father
wanted it to.

625
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:21,937
Secondly, I wanted you all to know

626
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:25,315
I'm not going to become
the next chairman after all...

627
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:28,610
...because I'll be going to jail instead.

628
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:30,779
- Did you shoot him?
- What's he talking about?

629
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:33,615
- What does that mean?
- Can you please tell us?

630
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,368
I'm the one who shot Grant,
not that girl's parents.

631
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,787
I just made it look like they did...

632
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:43,250
...because I wanted
to take over the company.

633
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:12,654
You scared me.

634
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:16,992
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong is it's over, Dalvos.

635
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,161
Thirty years of planning gone!

636
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:20,746
What? How?

637
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:23,832
Because the witches
outsmarted us, that's how.

638
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:27,294
They knew they couldn't vanquish you,
so they ruined you instead,

639
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:28,962
destroyed your reputation.

640
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,173
Now we're both ruined.

641
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,635
So, what does this mean?
What do we do now?

642
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,974
We tie up loose ends.

643
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,023
Another day, another demon.

644
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,443
Did they print my speech?
It was a good speech.

645
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,153
Obviously.

646
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,072
Too bad Mary Poppins got away.

647
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,490
Yeah, well, don't worry about it,

648
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:59,952
I'm sure we will be seeing her again
in about 30 years or so.

649
00:36:00,118 --> 00:36:02,830
Oh, we won't be doing this
in another 30 years.

650
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:04,706
They will.

651
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,501
I wonder where we'll be.

652
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:10,379
Well, my guess is
you'll be sitting right there

653
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:13,382
feeding your grandkids with Leo.

654
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:15,384
Let's hope so.

655
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:18,220
Piper, give yourself a break.

656
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,973
It's gonna take some time,
you know?

657
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:23,559
And you have to allow
yourself that time.

658
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:26,061
Sounds like good advice.

659
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:27,896
Did you have any for the twins?

660
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:31,275
Actually, I did.

661
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:35,904
I suggested that she
move out of the house,

662
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,489
get her own space.

663
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:45,873
It's good advice.

664
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:47,708
All right, buddy, let's go.

665
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,084
What do you say?

666
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:51,920
Watch your fingers, fingers, fingers.

667
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,592
Come on, come on, come on.

668
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:59,052
All right, dear.

669
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:15,360
Hey.

670
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:18,572
- Hey.
- Just a question.

671
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:24,286
Why is it so hard for you
to get close to people?

672
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:28,123
You don't
beat around the bush, huh?

673
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,919
Well, I figure since you stood me up,

674
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:34,213
I can ask anything I want.

675
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:37,049
I'm not mad or anything like that,
I was just curious.

676
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:38,967
I don't know.

677
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:43,180
I think because I grew up
in foster homes,

678
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:44,765
you know,
and I just bounced around.

679
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:48,060
It made me not trust.

680
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:51,396
You know, whenever I would get close
to somebody, they would leave.

681
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:54,399
I mean, really, I would leave.

682
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:58,821
So now, it's years later,
and whenever I like someone...

683
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,825
I'm sorry.

684
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:06,245
It's that fight-or-flight thing.

685
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:11,500
There's nothing to be sorry for.

686
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:15,003
And just so you know,

687
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:17,840
you don't have to run from me.

688
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:30,561
You two...

689
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,690
You fought like cats and dogs,
you know.

690
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:39,486
You were as wildly different
as any two kids could ever be.

691
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:42,531
And you were inseparable.

692
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:45,868
- We were?
- Oh, yeah.

693
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:50,873
Of course, Christy loved
to get you in trouble, a lot.

694
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:54,376
It took your father and me a while
to figure that one out.

695
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:56,044
She was very sneaky that way.

696
00:38:57,254 --> 00:39:00,090
You know, I don't remember
that much about her.

697
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:04,136
There's little moments
and things here and there,

698
00:39:04,303 --> 00:39:06,388
but most of what
I remember of her, I loved.

699
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:09,224
Oh, honey.

700
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:14,563
She adored you.

701
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:17,649
She was very protective of you too.

702
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:21,028
Nobody could pick on you
except her.

703
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:25,324
Why didn't you tell me
you kept looking for her?

704
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:27,117
I don't know.

705
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,120
We should have.

706
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:34,666
We just didn't know what to do.

707
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:37,878
When it happened,
we were devastated.

708
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:41,757
Maybe it was wrong for all of us.

709
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,926
But we made the choice
to try and make life

710
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:46,053
as normal as possible for you.

711
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:49,264
Your father thought

712
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:52,851
- if we just didn't talk about it...
- Mom, you know what?

713
00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:55,187
It's okay.

714
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:56,605
I understand.

715
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:02,694
Did you know Christy was a witch?

716
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:05,614
I mean, that I was?

717
00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:07,282
Just like your grandmother.

718
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:12,287
I guess it skipped
a generation, huh?

719
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:13,622
Yeah, lucky you.

720
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:15,749
No, lucky you.

721
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,919
You have a very special gift, Billie.

722
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,797
One that you are meant
to do great things with.

723
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:23,465
I know that.

724
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:26,718
Just embrace it.

725
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:30,138
I'm gonna find her, Mom.

726
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:32,891
I promise.

727
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,193
Well, maybe this will help.

728
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:46,113
It's Christy's diary.

729
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:49,366
We never could figure out
what the last entry meant.

730
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,285
Maybe you can.

731
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:53,996
Be safe.

732
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:07,092
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, baby.
