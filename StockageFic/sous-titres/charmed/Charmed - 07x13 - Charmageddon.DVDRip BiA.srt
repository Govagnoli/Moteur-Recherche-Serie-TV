1
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,722
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,310
Look at them all, Leo.

3
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:22,898
Without knowing why,
things just seem better to them,

4
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:27,486
even though they don't yet realise
that everything is different.

5
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,155
Of course there will be
a transitional period.

6
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,407
But soon, they will begin
to understand

7
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,827
they no longer have to worry
about evil, security, conflict,

8
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,621
that this world is here to stay.

9
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,582
- Is it not what we spoke of, Leo?
- It's impressive.

10
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,794
And you know, the only threat to Utopia,

11
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,881
to all that we've created here
is conflict.

12
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:53,053
And that, Leo,
we simply cannot abide.

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,307
I don't know, it's just the way
the sisters reacted, especially Paige.

14
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,934
She grieves.

15
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,020
I know, but not the way
she's supposed to.

16
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,649
It's just... It doesn't seem right.

17
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,569
Well, things are different, Leo,
to be sure.

18
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,738
But look around you now.

19
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,616
Is not everyone better off?

20
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,995
Are not the sisters better off?

21
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,746
I don't know.

22
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,499
Then you must go to them, Leo.

23
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:27,171
They're the people who mean the most
to you. See for yourself. Understand.

24
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,508
It's all good, Leo. It's all genuine.

25
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:35,262
But once you're satisfied,
it is important that you return to us.

26
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,889
Important? Why?

27
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,016
After the death of one of our own,

28
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,810
the collective has been
drained of power.

29
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:45,105
- You feel it too, do you not?
- Yes.

30
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,941
So the sooner you're reassured,
satisfied,

31
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,235
the sooner you can join us

32
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,113
and help us maintain all of this.

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,158
We have much work to do, Leo.

34
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,784
What kind of work?

35
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,454
You'll see, when you're ready.

36
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,706
You'll sense where to find us.

37
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,087
Please calm down, sir.

38
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,756
Harold, get back in the car.

39
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,091
The light was yellow,
just like last time!

40
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,220
- What, do you guys have it out for me?
- Harold, please!

41
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,472
No! It's police harassment!

42
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,349
I want your name and badge number!

43
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,753
- It's ready.
- So is this.

44
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,427
Butter?

45
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,351
Hey, you're breaking the flow. Move it.

46
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,019
- Sorry.
- Where you been?

47
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,772
Making sure everything
went all right.

48
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,233
- Why wouldn't it be?
- How you guys doing?

49
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,235
Are you kidding? I feel great!

50
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,154
Better than I have in, God,
I don't even know how long.

51
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,406
Six and a half years,
but who's counting?

52
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,659
We haven't been out
in the real world yet.

53
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,828
- If it feels like it does in here...
- We have no complaints.

54
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,623
We're gonna celebrate,
have a little party.

55
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,209
- A party? Today?
- Yeah, why not?

56
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:55,504
Maybe you wanted to make sure
everything worked all right.

57
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,756
Leo, it works, better than we expected.

58
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,467
Besides, we have a lot
of catching up to do.

59
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,096
I'm not sure I know how
to socialise with normal people.

60
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,516
You'll be fine. Especially since
no demons will be attacking.

61
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,853
- They're still out there.
- They're all on the run.

62
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,982
Come on, just enjoy it.
We have you to thank for all this.

63
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,026
- How's Paige?
- Better, I think.

64
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,196
It's gonna take her some time.
Kyle meant a lot to her.

65
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,491
But it does help her to know
he's gone on to a better place.

66
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,078
- Is she upstairs?
- At Kyle's apartment getting stuff.

67
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,582
I think I'm gonna go to work
and check out the real world.

68
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,251
All right, well, I'm gonna go
check on Paige.

69
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,004
Okay, you two. But don't be late.

70
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,276
Hey, how you holding up?

71
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,195
Good, considering.

72
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,448
I'm not really sure what to do
with all of this stuff, though.

73
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:09,203
- That's not your responsibility, is it?
- No, but he doesn't have a family.

74
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,789
It's just so odd that he's gone.

75
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,666
I really miss him.

76
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,876
Good.

77
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,212
I mean, that's normal.

78
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,715
You don't want to go around
just having it all be glossed over.

79
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,427
No. But still, I am happy for him.

80
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,721
I mean, he is in a better place.

81
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,556
And the thing is,

82
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,268
he would really want me to enjoy
this new world.

83
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,604
Well, he died trying to stop it.

84
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:38,315
Well, that's why I owe it to him
to be happy.

85
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,525
Of course.

86
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:43,237
I have to go home and get ready
for the party. You gonna come?

87
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,072
I think so.

88
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,324
Great. I will see you there, sir.

89
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,595
You've been weakened, Avatar,

90
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,098
by the death of one of your own.

91
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,440
We both have the same problem,
you and I.

92
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,485
Neither of us trusts this new world.

93
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,114
We're both gonna have to do
something about it.

94
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,829
Phoebe, what are you doing here?

95
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:37,457
I just came by to see how things
were going. How are things going?

96
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:41,795
They aren't. And that's good.
Have you seen today's paper?

97
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,007
Thinnest one we've ever had.

98
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,010
There's no crime,
no corruption, no scandal.

99
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,596
It's like people have been taking
happy pills.

100
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,141
Thank God the obits are up.
Otherwise, we'd just have a one-sheet.

101
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,351
So things are just
getting better, huh?

102
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:00,230
I'm all for that. But I've been working
here so long, I don't believe it.

103
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,357
- Something always happens.
- Maybe.

104
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:06,153
Or maybe it's a shame when we
don't trust when good things happen.

105
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,988
What a nice thought.

106
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,908
Now you should write
about that in your next column.

107
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,535
Best advice you
could give your readers.

108
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,370
Okay, but I gotta go home to do it.

109
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,207
Tell Oliver I'll e-mail it to him
around six-ish.

110
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,376
Oliver. That's the only bad thing
that happened today.

111
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:25,005
Well, not bad for him, of course,
just for us.

112
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,215
What happened?

113
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,551
I got a call from his family
about an hour ago. He's gone.

114
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,387
- It happened early this morning.
- Oh, my God.

115
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:36,099
He was such a troubled young man.
I hoped he could turn things around.

116
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,726
Yeah, me too.

117
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:41,939
Well, at least we can take heart
that he's in a much better place now.

118
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,985
Yeah. I guess so.

119
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,364
Mind telling me where we are?

120
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,700
An ancient tomb in an ancient pyramid

121
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,246
where no one, especially not
the Avatars, are gonna look for us.

122
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,457
- Why bring me here?
- To show you the truth,

123
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,627
why you never should have
turned your back on the Elders.

124
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:07,506
And to decide whether or not you're
willing to help me stop the Avatars.

125
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:08,966
Why would I help a demon?

126
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,260
It is by far the better of your options.

127
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:14,346
You could either work
to change things back,

128
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,015
or you can repeat
the mistakes of the past.

129
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,604
The Avatars were here before,
thousands of years ago,

130
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,649
when people believed
in magic and demons.

131
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:30,153
The Avatars promised to rid them
of evil on that level, same as now.

132
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,282
They were more or less successful.

133
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,200
They remade the world,

134
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,995
but they never told people
of the ultimate costs.

135
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,414
The dog-headed figure,
is that a demon?

136
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,457
Actually that's a jackal's head.

137
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:46,503
He is Anubis, the Egyptian guardian
and protector of the dead.

138
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,798
There's a price to pay for Utopia.

139
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:55,345
A price that you suspect
but don't yet know about.

140
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:59,099
They knew about it,
and they rose up against the Avatars

141
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,977
- and stopped them the first time.
- Maybe, but I...

142
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:06,481
Agent Brody realised the danger
that the Avatars pose too.

143
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,483
He was willing to help me
weaken them

144
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,612
so that I could bring you here,
so that you could help.

145
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,531
He was willing to sacrifice
everything to stop them.

146
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,784
- Brody was crazed.
- Brody was right.

147
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,204
You know, deep down,

148
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,790
that there is something very wrong
with this world, Leo.

149
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,252
Something you never foresaw
in your own myopic zeal

150
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,171
to try and make it all better.

151
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:33,217
People have no free will anymore.
At least not completely.

152
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,762
The Avatars now dictate their destinies.

153
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:39,848
And you let it happen.

154
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,226
The question is,
are you willing to fix it?

155
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:46,063
To do what, get back what we had before?
Fight your kind again?

156
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,233
Well, nobody said the system
was perfect, did they?

157
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,902
But it's better than this, isn't it?

158
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,029
Decide for yourself and decide soon.

159
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:57,574
If we are to work together,
we're gonna have to move quickly.

160
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,552
Leo. Welcome.

161
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,638
How are the sisters? Content, I trust?

162
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,014
They seemed okay.

163
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,767
What is this place?

164
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:27,354
This is where we maintain Utopia.

165
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,940
Come.

166
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,321
These are the others.

167
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,867
You've felt them
though you haven't yet met.

168
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,244
What are they doing?

169
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,288
Monitoring for conflict.

170
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,175
I don't understand.

171
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,427
In bringing this all about,

172
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:02,764
we've modified the way people think,
their belief systems,

173
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,852
so that they can more easily accept
a world without evil.

174
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,229
So that they wouldn't keep
looking for it.

175
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:13,066
So that the demons who remain
couldn't influence them into evil acts.

176
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:18,447
Unfortunately, however, some have
already been damaged beyond hope.

177
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:21,950
Their inner demons
sometimes surface,

178
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,745
causing... conflict.

179
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:29,875
And when that conflict passes a certain
threshold, we must deal with it.

180
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,127
To protect Utopia.

181
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,650
Wait. You killed them.

182
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,903
We removed them.
The one for the many.

183
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,616
We have an obligation to maintain
the world that we've created, Leo.

184
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:07,204
We can't let anything threaten it,
and we won't.

185
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,261
Wow!

186
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,346
Wow!

187
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,224
No, no! No! No touchie-touchie.

188
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,476
I just want to make sure
it's not poison.

189
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,855
No, I want everything to be perfect.
We've waited a long time.

190
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,649
Piper, everything is perfect.
It looks amazing.

191
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,776
I can't believe you did all of this.

192
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,863
When I'm not mixing
vanquishing potions all the time,

193
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,324
I tend to get a lot more done.
I forgot how much I like cooking.

194
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,034
We're all good.

195
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,537
Yeah, as long as Leo
makes it to the party.

196
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:52,166
- I thought he was going to Paige's?
- She came back without him.

197
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,042
She's upstairs getting ready.

198
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,962
Well, maybe he had
some Avatar stuff to do?

199
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:01,133
I hope the Avatars don't keep him
as busy as the Elders did.

200
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,719
I don't think he'd put up
with that, Piper.

201
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:08,223
He created this better world so that
you guys could be together as a family.

202
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,017
Still, I worry.

203
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,687
And next to cooking,
that's the second thing you do best.

204
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,523
Hey.

205
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,734
Hey, how you doing?

206
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:21,153
Better. Thanks.

207
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,072
Yeah. I am really looking forward
to this party.

208
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,200
You know, take my mind off stuff.

209
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,411
I just need to remind myself
Kyle's in a better place.

210
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,456
Yeah, that's what I have
to remind myself.

211
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:37,044
This guy at work, he just went away.

212
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,421
It was really unexpected.

213
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,257
Well, I'm sure it must all be
for the best, you know.

214
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:45,761
- Otherwise, it wouldn't have happened.
- Right.

215
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:48,055
You go help the kids get dressed,

216
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,390
and you can help me in the kitchen.

217
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,227
Come on, chop-chop,
we have a party to throw.

218
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,275
I'm concentrating.

219
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:03,487
- Yes, I'm sorry. This is important.
- So is this.

220
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:06,532
Somewhere in these drawings
is the key to the potion

221
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,408
Brody used against the Avatars.

222
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,954
Well, I'm glad to see that
you're using your energy wisely.

223
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,166
But the others are restless. They don't
wanna sit around and die like dogs,

224
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,878
while we wait around
for the help of someone good.

225
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,800
- Are you questioning my plan?
- No. Not at all.

226
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,844
Zankou, we're demons!

227
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:32,307
We need to stand up and fight them on
our own, not just sit around and wait.

228
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,767
That's just the point.

229
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,645
We can't fight on our own.
We don't have the power.

230
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:40,691
Like it or not, our fate rests with Leo.

231
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:45,195
Yeah? Then we'd rather die than leave
our trust in the hands of an Elder.

232
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,697
Then we will surely die.

233
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:52,661
You tell the others that they do
as I say, when I say it,

234
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:56,582
or the Avatars will be the least of
their problems. You understand me?

235
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:57,875
Yes.

236
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,752
Now leave. He's coming.

237
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,090
Welcome back, partner.

238
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,009
We're not partners.

239
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,678
Oh, no?
Then what are you doing here?

240
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,764
- I'm still not so sure.
- Ah, yes, you are.

241
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,475
That doesn't change the fact

242
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,854
everything I told you about
your precious Avatars is true.

243
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,856
You want to stop them as much as I do.

244
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,942
I'm not so eager to bring demons
back into the world.

245
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:27,446
Ah, but there's the rub.
Which world is worse?

246
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,824
Which is the greater evil,
mine or theirs?

247
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:34,203
I know taking destiny
out of people's hands is not right.

248
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,038
I couldn't agree more.

249
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:38,040
Let's make something clear.

250
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:42,127
If we succeed, we'll still be enemies,
and I can make you a promise

251
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:46,381
it will only be a matter of time
before good defeats evil.

252
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,134
Well, we'll have to see about that,
won't we?

253
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:54,097
Now if you're finished with
the macho posturing, let's get to work.

254
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,519
The problem is,
even if I decipher these,

255
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,855
we'll still need the Charmed Ones
to prepare the potion.

256
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,900
They won't go against the Avatars.
They wanted this.

257
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,902
Not if they discover the catch.

258
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,822
Not if they realise that the Avatars
alone decide who lives or dies.

259
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,075
You know the sisters better than I do,

260
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:16,203
but I doubt even they want that.

261
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,039
Which means you're gonna
have to get them to see

262
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,458
what the Avatars don't want them to see.

263
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:26,129
Even if it will take you shocking them
with another terrible loss.

264
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,845
Okay, you wait there.

265
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:36,932
We are gonna have so much fun today!

266
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,477
You're gonna meet so many
new friends at the party.

267
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:43,188
But you can't orb, okay?
You have to promise me.

268
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,816
We don't want to scare
the guests away, got it?

269
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,278
Like that.

270
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,904
Phoebe, we need to talk.

271
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,367
Yeah, you need to get ready for
the party before your wife kills you.

272
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,452
Figuratively speaking, of course.

273
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:00,497
- That's what I'm talking about.
- What are you saying?

274
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,417
What you said,
you felt you had to qualify it.

275
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,002
Qualify what?

276
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:07,963
The Avatars and what
they've done to everybody.

277
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,757
Everything's better.
You made everything better.

278
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,887
That was a mistake. I realise that now.
I need you to realise that,

279
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,806
before what happens to Brody
happens to again.

280
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:20,726
- Leo, you're scaring me.
- Good, you need to be scared.

281
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:24,313
It's the only way you're gonna
understand the truth and feel it.

282
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:28,609
You can help Piper and Paige understand,
use your powers to feel the loss,

283
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,111
to see what the Avatars
are doing is wrong.

284
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:34,239
Leo, this is what we all wanted.
What's going on?

285
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:42,164
- You'll see.
- What... what are you doing?

286
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:46,960
Leo, you can't just...

287
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,883
- What are we doing here?
- I need you to get a vision.

288
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,844
I need you to see what really
happened to Agent Brody.

289
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,764
I know what happened.
He's moved on to a better place.

290
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:02,809
Maybe so, but it doesn't change
the fact that somebody killed him.

291
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,953
Oh, my God. She killed him.

292
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,831
Yes. The Avatars
don't want you to know that.

293
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,625
They don't want you to know
why people disappear.

294
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,378
- Why are you doing this?
- Because it's the truth.

295
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:32,714
They changed you so you couldn't
feel the true pain of death.

296
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,343
They want it to seem like a good thing,
so you don't even question it.

297
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,971
- No.
- And it's gonna happen again, Phoebe,

298
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:43,100
as soon as they decide somebody in
the world is creating too much conflict.

299
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,811
Leo, we're not going back
to the way it was.

300
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,856
We tried it for seven years,
and it just didn't work.

301
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,233
- Phoebe...
- No, Leo, listen to me, okay?

302
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,235
We made the world a better place,

303
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:57,030
and we're gonna live in it
just the way it is now.

304
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,323
Do you understand?

305
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:09,168
We just need to give him
more time to understand.

306
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,961
We're running out of time.

307
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,589
If he turns them,
everything could be lost.

308
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,884
I think it's time we face the facts.

309
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:42,409
Would you just stop fussing
and enjoy yourself already?

310
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,995
- I can't. I'm worried.
- About what?

311
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,706
Look, everybody seems
to be having a great time.

312
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:50,375
I didn't even know
we knew this many people.

313
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:53,712
I'm worried about Leo.
He should have been here by now.

314
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,464
Where the heck is Phoebe?

315
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,383
She got the boys ready,
and then she just took off.

316
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,638
Maybe they're together. Maybe you don't
know how to have a good time anymore.

317
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,348
Is that a challenge?

318
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:06,058
If it works.

319
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,436
There. You happy?

320
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,525
- I need a drink.
- Hey, what's the matter?

321
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:18,320
I don't want to talk about it.
I just want to have a good time.

322
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:22,574
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

323
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:24,660
Hey.

324
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,830
All right, then, I'll go mingle.

325
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:31,708
Leo, come on, what's wrong?

326
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,837
- It's complicated.
- It's the Avatars, isn't it?

327
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:39,299
If working for them is gonna be as
complicated as working for the Elders...

328
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,634
It's not that.

329
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:41,969
Then what is it?

330
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,514
Okay, you know what?
I don't want to know.

331
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:49,017
We're here to celebrate our new life
with no magic and no demons,

332
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,479
so why don't we just enjoy it?

333
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:56,108
Leo, did you hear what I said?

334
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,530
Are you listening to me?
What is the matter with you?

335
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:05,284
Forgive me, Piper. If there was
another way to do this, I would.

336
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,952
What are you talking about?

337
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,745
I have to fix a mistake.

338
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,914
I love you.

339
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:14,543
- Leo!
- Everyone, get down!

340
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,174
Oh, no.

341
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,969
Paige, the children!

342
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,525
Die, Elder, die!

343
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:58,212
Don't let them make you
forget why I'm doing this.

344
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,506
It's supposed to hurt.
Go to the Book.

345
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:03,550
Remember all the losses.
Then go to Zankou.

346
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,177
Wait, Zankou?

347
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:17,648
Piper, you all right?

348
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,776
I don't know. I guess so.

349
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,737
I'm really sorry about Leo.

350
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,989
Yeah, me too.

351
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:28,826
But at least he's gone on
to a better place.

352
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,792
I'm so sorry things
got out of hand, guys.

353
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,378
Don't you think that was all
a little weird?

354
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:43,006
It was kinda touch-and-go for a second,
when the demon attacked.

355
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:44,591
But it all worked out okay.

356
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,261
Still, it seemed a little,
I don't know, off.

357
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:50,055
I certainly wasn't expecting
any more attacks,

358
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:52,599
but thank God Leo was there
to take care of it.

359
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:56,019
It would have been nice if Leo
didn't have to go to a better place

360
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,438
- in the process, you know.
- I know, but...

361
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:03,485
What he did, he did for his family,
and for that I will always love him.

362
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,406
Paige, can you make sure
the boys are okay?

363
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:11,076
It's really impressive that you can stay
so calm after such a shock.

364
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:14,288
I'd be freaking out if I thought
there were more demons.

365
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,665
I'd like to think
those days are behind us.

366
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:21,044
I can't make them stop.
They're so upset.

367
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:24,339
We're all upset about demons
being in the house.

368
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,009
Do you really think
that's why they're crying?

369
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:29,928
- What else would it be?
- Okay, Mommy's coming!

370
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,727
- You okay?
- I don't know.

371
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:40,063
It's like Kyle, you know.
It's really a big deal.

372
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,815
We're never gonna forget him.

373
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:46,069
Don't let them make you forget why
I'm doing this. It's supposed to hurt.

374
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,322
Never forget.

375
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,575
I have to check the Book of Shadows
for something.

376
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,460
Come on, Phoebe.

377
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:12,137
Remember all the losses.

378
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:15,098
No!

379
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:34,952
No, no!

380
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:40,290
Oh, my God.

381
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,963
It's okay. Oh, my gosh, I can't get 'em
to calm down. Even Piper couldn't.

382
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,631
I can. Where's Piper?

383
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,466
She's in the kitchen.

384
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,763
Piper, I really need to talk to you.

385
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,474
The Avatars didn't tell us
everything up front.

386
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,893
- What?
- Pain, grief, mourning.

387
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,688
These are all things
we're supposed to be feeling

388
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:05,524
when we lose someone
we love, like Leo.

389
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:07,150
Leo?

390
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:09,862
Phoebe, he's moved on
to a better place,

391
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:13,949
and if you don't mind, I'd rather not
dwell on such a painful memory.

392
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:18,495
Okay, but if he's in a better place,
then why are the boys crying right now?

393
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:22,457
It's not because of demons. They
were practically raised around them.

394
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,793
- Yes, well, but...
- Piper, listen to me.

395
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,296
Leo is dead. The Avatars killed him.

396
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,174
The boys are just too young
to feel it the way we do,

397
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,134
the way we were programmed to.

398
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:34,720
Programmed? Phoebe,
what's gotten into you?

399
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:38,891
This is what Leo was trying to show us.
Leo allowed the Avatars to kill him

400
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:42,144
so that we could understand
what's going on here.

401
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:45,147
- I don't wanna hear this.
- I know you don't,

402
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:46,607
but listen to your boys.

403
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,318
That's pain, and it's real.

404
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:51,820
- Phoebe, stop.
- Piper, how can you not see it?

405
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:55,657
You're okay with all this
because you wanted to be with Leo.

406
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,618
And now they've taken him away?

407
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,509
Why? Why would they do that?

408
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:16,220
Because Leo caused conflict.

409
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:21,016
And this is the only way
they could keep Utopia going.

410
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:29,608
You better have a good reason
for bringing me here.

411
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:32,945
- I don't want to be here.
- And that's exactly why we are here.

412
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:36,406
Paige, Kyle died,
and now it's time that you feel it.

413
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:40,118
I felt it! And it
would have felt a lot worse,

414
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,955
if I didn't know he'd gone on
to a better place.

415
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:46,667
Well, that's the thing.
It should have felt a lot worse.

416
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:50,295
The Avatars made our pain
go away after they killed Kyle.

417
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,425
I had a vision of him dying

418
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:56,760
when I touched this.

419
00:27:56,927 --> 00:28:00,180
He attacked one of the Avatars
with his potion,

420
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:01,390
and she killed him.

421
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:03,267
Do you remember that, Paige?

422
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,143
Why are you doing this to me?

423
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:09,022
He died right here, in your arms.

424
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:13,402
I saw it, I felt it, and now
you have to feel it too.

425
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:15,404
It's the only way we can stop them.

426
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:18,115
- I don't want to.
- You have to.

427
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:20,701
Just like I did.

428
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,540
I don't want to.

429
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,544
It's okay.

430
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,507
Why did they do this?

431
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,176
To give us what we wanted.

432
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:39,428
What we thought we wanted.

433
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:43,932
What do we do now?

434
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:46,185
We're gonna do what Leo said...

435
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:49,313
...and go find ourselves a demon.

436
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:07,164
Sorry to interrupt but...

437
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:08,707
What is it?

438
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:13,712
Well, the others sent me
to find out what we're gonna do.

439
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:16,590
- Do?
- I just mean...

440
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:22,596
Well, the Elder is dead.
The plan has failed.

441
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:26,433
Shouldn't we... retreat?

442
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,684
Not yet.

443
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:30,896
You said if the Elder
couldn't turn the sisters,

444
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:32,940
- there is no...
- I know what I said.

445
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,651
I also know that Leo wasn't stupid.

446
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:39,613
He wouldn't have given his life unless
he knew something would come of it.

447
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,116
Unless it was merely the act
of a desperate man.

448
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,370
I'm just saying,

449
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:48,956
the Avatars could move on us
at any time.

450
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:53,752
If we are gonna run,
we should go soon.

451
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:59,633
Perhaps you're right.

452
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:02,970
We should retreat.

453
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,347
I'll let the others know.

454
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:17,943
What's the matter, Zankou?
Chicken?

455
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:28,245
Good thing you girls got here
when you did. I was about to leave.

456
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:31,039
- To go where?
- To live to fight another day.

457
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,876
You won't if you don't tell us
what we want to hear.

458
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:37,713
Save it. You need me.
That's why Leo sent you.

459
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,090
Glad to see he
didn't die in vain after all.

460
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,384
- Get to the point.
- The point is

461
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:45,304
Leo was working with me,
same as Agent Brody before,

462
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,765
- to undo what has been done.
- Kyle was working with you?

463
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:51,310
How do you think he
was able to kill an Avatar?

464
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:54,855
He realised then that
the combined force of good and evil

465
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:56,982
is our only chance
to stop the Avatars.

466
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:01,320
You have a greater reason for wanting
to do that than we do, survival.

467
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,405
True, but you obviously want it too.

468
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:06,909
Otherwise, we wouldn't even
be having this conversation.

469
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:11,038
Now you go ahead and talk amongst
yourselves. I'm not going anywhere.

470
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,542
I'm not so sure about this.

471
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:19,379
I don't think we have a choice.
We're running out of allies.

472
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,632
- We can't work with a demon.
- Leo did.

473
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:25,260
- Yeah, look where it got him.
- That was the Avatars, not Zankou.

474
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:29,389
So how do we know he's not picking us
off one by one? What if this is a setup?

475
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,767
Well, he helped Kyle get rid
of an Avatar.

476
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:34,603
They're who he's really after,
and so are we.

477
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,022
Okay, fine. So, what if this works?

478
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:39,858
Where does that leave us,
fighting demons again?

479
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:42,069
- Is that what we really want?
- Is this?

480
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,696
Just because we wanted it
doesn't make it right.

481
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:48,200
Kyle knew it was wrong. He knew
the Avatars couldn't be trusted.

482
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,661
- I just didn't believe him.
- Neither did we.

483
00:31:50,828 --> 00:31:53,038
Still, we can believe
in him now. Leo too.

484
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:56,667
We can finish what they started,
so they didn't die in vain.

485
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,297
So, what's the plan?

486
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,342
The plan...

487
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:08,095
...is for you to make
a very special potion.

488
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:20,315
- What's the matter?
- I can't find the sisters.

489
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:23,610
- None of them?
- I don't understand. I just had them.

490
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:26,155
They'll have to surface
sooner or later.

491
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:27,781
You got that right.

492
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:41,170
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- What are those?

493
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:44,006
- You know what they are.
- And you know what he is.

494
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:47,968
- What is the meaning of this?
- We don't have anything to explain.

495
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:50,637
We're not the ones
going around killing people.

496
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:53,765
We only did what was
necessary to maintain Utopia.

497
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:58,395
- A loophole you forgot to tell us?
- It was never our intention to deceive.

498
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:01,064
We merely gave you the world
you asked for.

499
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,817
Except for the fact
you were killing people.

500
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,569
Their fates are regrettable.

501
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:10,532
But I guarantee you that fewer people
by far will be lost under our rule

502
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:13,410
than under the chaos of good and evil.

503
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:16,622
With good and evil people
knew what they were dying for.

504
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:20,334
And given the choice of what we had
and what you're offering...

505
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:21,793
Now we know what "it" is.

506
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,339
- We'll take our free will back any day.
- Hear, hear.

507
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:29,218
You'd seriously be willing

508
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:32,054
to give up peace of mind,

509
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:35,182
the normal life you so covet,

510
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:37,434
to go back to the way things were?

511
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:40,062
To fighting the likes of him again?

512
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:42,439
Warts and all.

513
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,485
They're not ready for us.

514
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:49,279
Perhaps not.

515
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:51,740
But they will be someday.

516
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:57,037
What we want for the world
is worth waiting for.

517
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:01,792
Very well. We will use
what remains of our power

518
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:05,796
to rewind time to when Utopia began.

519
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:08,799
Does that mean Leo will be alive again?

520
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:11,134
- Of course.
- And Kyle?

521
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:15,097
That, unfortunately,
is beyond our powers.

522
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:16,515
Are you kidding me?

523
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:20,352
You can bring everyone
that you have killed back to life,

524
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,479
but Kyle is beyond your powers?

525
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:25,065
The further something
recedes into the past,

526
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:27,192
the more power it takes to reverse it.

527
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,821
We can either bring back
Agent Brody

528
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:33,323
or return the world to the way it was,

529
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,284
but I'm afraid we cannot do both.

530
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:45,669
Put the world back.

531
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:55,304
I'm sorry this didn't work out,
for your sakes as well as ours.

532
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,014
Touching.

533
00:34:57,181 --> 00:34:58,599
I'm gonna miss you guys.

534
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:40,682
What the hell? Did you just
dump your coffee on me?

535
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:44,019
What are you talking about?
You spilled yours on me!

536
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:46,688
Why, you moron,
you dumped your coffee on me!

537
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:53,695
- This is totally your fault.
- My fault? You hit me!

538
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:57,324
Yeah? All I'm saying is you better
have some good insurance!

539
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:59,368
I'm gonna call the cops on your ass!

540
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:03,330
Oh, please, give me your ID.
Where's your insurance?

541
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:07,459
- Where's your insurance?
- Where's yours? Mine is right here!

542
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:12,005
I'm gonna call my lawyer, okay?
I'm gonna sue this whole city.

543
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:15,801
Wow, I've never been so excited
to hear the sounds of people arguing.

544
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:17,177
Tell me about it.

545
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,765
It's good to be back...

546
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:25,686
...warts and all.

547
00:36:51,837 --> 00:36:54,006
- Leo?
- I'm in here.

548
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:58,093
Oh, thank God.

549
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,180
It's okay. I'm all right.

550
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:05,392
Wow, you kinda really scared me
this time.

551
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:10,314
That was the plan.
I was banking on you saving me.

552
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,775
Okay, well, next time come up
with a different plan.

553
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,694
Next time.

554
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,491
So wait, you remember everything,
even though you technically died,

555
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:23,619
but then you didn't,
because time rewound, so...

556
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:25,746
- Am I making any sense?
- Yeah.

557
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:29,041
I remember everything
because I was unaffected by the spell.

558
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:32,503
You remember everything
because you broke it. Time rewound,

559
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:35,714
- but we still experienced it.
- Headache forming.

560
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:39,801
All that matters is that we fixed it,
regardless of the consequences.

561
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,887
Consequences? You mean Kyle?

562
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,889
No, I mean the Elders.

563
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:47,184
I went against them
and sided with the Avatars.

564
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:50,729
- I can't go unpunished.
- Yeah, but everything you did,

565
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:54,483
you did to make the world a safer place
for everyone, including us.

566
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,320
I don't think they're gonna see it
that way. No matter what I did...

567
00:37:58,487 --> 00:37:59,947
What we did.

568
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:05,202
Whether it was well-intentioned or not,
it's gonna cost me.

569
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,121
At least it didn't cost you your life,

570
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:11,458
which at this moment is
the only thing I'm concerned with.

571
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:15,629
I don't want to lose you ever again.

572
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:43,157
Bye.

573
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:47,202
Hello, Paige.

574
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:50,789
Kyle?

575
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:53,250
Careful. That used to mean
a lot to me.

576
00:38:58,338 --> 00:38:59,590
Is this really you?

577
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,676
In the flesh, more or less.

578
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:05,762
- I saw you die.
- That's right. You did.

579
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:10,267
But as you know,
sometimes it doesn't end there.

580
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:15,522
Are you a Whitelighter?

581
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:19,610
Feels kind of weird.

582
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:24,114
But at least I can still feel.

583
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:26,492
How?

584
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:30,913
I guess the Elders decided I must have
done something good with my life,

585
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,500
which is a relief,
considering the mess I made of it.

586
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:36,752
You didn't make such a mess.

587
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:40,130
Come on. I got a little crazy there
at the end, didn't I?

588
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:45,302
A little crazy.
But you did save the world.

589
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:47,763
Hence the reward.

590
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:53,268
- I just wish I could...
- Paige, it's not your fault.

591
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:56,480
I understand now my life was
supposed to end the way it did.

592
00:39:56,647 --> 00:40:00,025
How it did. It was my destiny.

593
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,072
Just like it was our destiny to meet.

594
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:07,199
To fall for each other.

595
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:09,451
To lose each other?

596
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:13,872
Who says we're not gonna
meet again?

597
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:29,137
Take care of that for me, will you?
