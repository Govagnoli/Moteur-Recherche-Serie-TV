1
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,134
Here you go.

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:18,352
- Max! Hey!
- Don't move, don't breathe, just listen!

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,812
We're gonna borrow your kid.
We need him just for a day.

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,606
If you're smart, you won't
call the cops.

5
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,067
We'll have him home safe
and sound Monday morning,

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,693
ready for school.
Do you understand?

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,695
- Yeah, yeah.
- Just our little secret, right?

8
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,363
Yeah.

9
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,742
Dad! Dad!

10
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,790
Can I just say
I am actually enjoying this?

11
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,417
Because you're not
doing anything.

12
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,587
Not true. I have painted my fingers
and my toes.

13
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,382
I just hope that this doesn't fall
under the personal gain category.

14
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,218
How could it?
A good witch is a clean witch.

15
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,764
Yep, I think we should spring clean
like this more often.

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,807
You go, girl!

17
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,116
Good job, Prue.

18
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,952
Oh, look, more toys.

19
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,038
I told you Grams
wouldn't throw them away.

20
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,374
Yeah, but we will. Why don't you
put that stuff in the discard pile.

21
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:28,796
- Wait, what's in there?
- Stuffed animals without eyeballs.

22
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:34,927
Dollies that look like they've been
through the mill once or twice.

23
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,015
And lookie here,
Miss Phoebe's diaries.

24
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,935
The place where I kept all my secrets.
Give me those.

25
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,650
- What?
- The place you kept your secrets?

26
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,403
Phoebe, you could never
keep a secret.

27
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,280
Oh, that is so not true.

28
00:01:54,488 --> 00:01:56,616
Okay, maybe Prue's
surprise birthday party.

29
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:58,492
Guess again.

30
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,119
You knew?

31
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,497
Phoebe, you swore
you wouldn't tell her.

32
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,750
I'm sorry, okay?
It was an accident.

33
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,337
- I say we keep all the toys.
- Subject changer.

34
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:12,006
For our children, for our future.

35
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:15,259
- That's a good idea.
- Well, you can get rid of mine.

36
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,846
What?

37
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,724
It's just that, you know, we live
in a world with so much violence,

38
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,517
and then you add the evil demons,

39
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:26,145
and it's a pretty scary place
to raise kids in.

40
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,148
Besides, I don't really think
I'm cut out to be a mom.

41
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,109
How can you say that?

42
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,779
Why don't we have this conversation
later? Like, say, in five years?

43
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:37,406
Good.

44
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:41,160
I think dinner's burning.
Phoebe, lend me a hand.

45
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:44,997
Don't look at my diary.

46
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:56,884
You try anything, you're dead,
and so is your old man.

47
00:02:57,092 --> 00:03:00,637
- You got that, kid?
- Come on, ease up on him, Mickey.

48
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:02,473
Kid's not stupid.
Are you, Max?

49
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:06,560
You're gonna do just like we tell you,
and everything's gonna be fine, right?

50
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:09,771
Yeah, you better be right about him,
or me and you got problems.

51
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:13,817
Look, that kid is a living,
breathing, winning lotto ticket.

52
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:16,820
All I know is my kid brother said
somehow, like magic,

53
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:19,406
he turned off the arcade alarm system
from across the street

54
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:21,533
and got them inside.

55
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:23,493
I don't believe in magic.

56
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,664
So we test him out.
If we don't like what we see,

57
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:29,666
we cut our losses.

58
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:46,850
Piper, Phoebe, get in here.

59
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:49,352
What is it?

60
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,188
Oh, no, not again.

61
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,149
What's it saying?

62
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,860
Help Max.

63
00:05:44,216 --> 00:05:47,553
So maybe Max is a ghost.
I mean, after all, that is a spirit board.

64
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,888
A ghost who needs our help?
I don't think so.

65
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:51,932
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

66
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:54,476
What if it's just someone
in trouble crying out?

67
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:58,272
Well, it would have to be someone
with powers. That's not exactly AT&T.

68
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,315
"Help Max." That's not a lot to go on.

69
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:04,111
Yeah, there's nothing really you can do
unless he sends another message.

70
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,029
What, are you on hold or something?

71
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,740
It's Harry, the new chef at Quake.

72
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:12,911
He threw out all my Henckel knives.
Apparently, he prefers Forschners.

73
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:16,123
- You follow any of that?
- No.

74
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,501
Look, we wouldn't have gotten
the message if it wasn't important.

75
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,379
- Okay, so, what do you wanna do?
- Maybe go see Andy.

76
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:25,048
See if he knows anything about
a Max needing help.

77
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:27,259
Can you say "long shot"?

78
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:30,595
All right, you're obsessed.
I accept that.

79
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:32,723
<i>I'll thumb through the
Book of Shadows,</i>

80
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,808
see if there's anything
on spirit board SOSs.

81
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:37,561
- Okay, and maybe Piper can...
- Look, wait,

82
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:40,981
I'm the manager. If I say
I want Henckels, then I want...

83
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:42,899
Hello?

84
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,527
The jerk hung up on me.

85
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:49,573
Okay, how can I help you two?

86
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:52,742
I think we got it under control.

87
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:57,455
Okay, then I'm going to Quake
before Harry does any more damage.

88
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:08,800
Ding-dong.

89
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:11,344
Leo, you're back.
Come in.

90
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:13,346
It's so good to see you.
How are you?

91
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:15,140
Better now.

92
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:18,768
- How are you, Piper?
- I'm better now too.

93
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:21,855
- Leo!
- Hey, stranger, good to see you.

94
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:24,315
- Yeah, what brings you back?
- Phoebe.

95
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:27,652
You know, the chandelier
in the living room keeps flickering.

96
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:31,656
- Yeah? Well, I'll get my tools.
- Oh, no, no, take your time.

97
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:34,200
Attic, remember?
You have some reading to do.

98
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:35,910
Right.

99
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:39,664
Is that a spirit board?

100
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:41,457
This?

101
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:46,796
Yeah, it is. I'm just taking it to the
auction house to have it appraised.

102
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:49,006
So I'll call you if I hear anything.

103
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:51,634
I'll be at the restaurant.

104
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:54,846
- Do you have to go now?
- Yeah, sort of.

105
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:56,973
But I'll be back soon.
I promise.

106
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,933
Can you wait?

107
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,935
Sure.

108
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:09,026
So glad you're back.

109
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,365
Okay, let me get this straight.

110
00:08:14,573 --> 00:08:17,159
You think a guy named Max
might be in some kind of trouble,

111
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:20,538
but you have no idea why.
You've never met him

112
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:24,917
and really don't have any idea
who he is. Is that about right?

113
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:27,795
Okay, fine.

114
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:30,756
See, I had a dream last night.

115
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:36,053
And in my dream, my sisters
and I were cleaning the attic

116
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,349
when we found
this old Ouija-type board.

117
00:08:40,516 --> 00:08:46,855
And the pointer started to move
until it spelled out, "Help Max."

118
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,235
That's it.

119
00:08:56,782 --> 00:08:59,243
You know, I hear a lot of stories
in my line of work,

120
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,414
but yours are always
very entertaining.

121
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:06,500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

122
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:09,378
Sorry...

123
00:09:09,586 --> 00:09:12,172
...nothing on anyone named Max.

124
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,716
- Thanks for checking.
- Any time.

125
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:19,596
- Okay.
- Okay.

126
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:22,766
- Bye.
- Bye.

127
00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:29,773
Harry.

128
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:33,860
Hey, you must be Pippy.

129
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:35,362
Piper. And...

130
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,948
You know, your voice doesn't
do you justice.

131
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:40,409
You're actually attractive.

132
00:09:41,118 --> 00:09:44,246
You cannot come into this restaurant,
throw away all of our knives

133
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:47,249
and refuse to make
the house specialty...

134
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:49,459
That is not a proper chef's uniform.

135
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:51,294
Will be. I'm a trendsetter.

136
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:54,714
In fact, I decided to change the menu,
so I threw out all the old ones.

137
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:57,801
Now, my crab ravioli,
there's a specialty.

138
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:02,847
- Straight from Eden.
- You threw out all the menus?

139
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:07,727
Hey, complain to your sister Phoebe.
She's on line one.

140
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:10,730
You're fired!

141
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:14,609
Oh, attractive and feisty.

142
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,947
You can't fire me,
because you're just a manager.

143
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:22,200
Unless you'd rather be
the executive chef.

144
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:36,089
Take that.

145
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:44,764
Sounds like a real piece of work.
He has a nice voice, though.

146
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:48,476
- What's he look like?
- A complete and total jerk.

147
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:51,354
- Is Leo around?
- Yeah, he's working away.

148
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:53,856
<i>He wants to know when you're
gonna get back, though.</i>

149
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:56,317
I think it might be a while.
Maybe I should talk to Leo.

150
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:58,277
Sure, hold on a sec.

151
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:01,114
- Oh, my God!
- Phoebe!

152
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:06,452
- Let me call you back.
- Phoebe, wait, I can explain.

153
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:09,830
- You are a warlock, aren't you?
- No.

154
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:13,084
Wait, think about it. If I was
a warlock, and I wanted to hurt you,

155
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:16,254
don't you think I would've done it
the last time I was here?

156
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,839
Okay, good point.

157
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:24,178
But still, most normal handymen use
ladders to fix chandeliers.

158
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,847
- Are you a witch?
- No.

159
00:11:27,056 --> 00:11:28,724
Then what are you?

160
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:36,107
These are the blueprints
to the microchip plant.

161
00:11:36,273 --> 00:11:39,110
The main security panel
is in this room here.

162
00:11:39,318 --> 00:11:41,987
All you gotta do is switch the
system off. Start with zone one,

163
00:11:42,154 --> 00:11:44,114
ending up with zone five, okay?

164
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:47,034
- You got it?
- I can't.

165
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:50,371
My mom made me promise never
to use my power for bad things.

166
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,374
<i>Yeah, you ever read the book When
Bad Things Happen to Good People?</i>

167
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:57,378
Look, I got it, Mickey.
You broke into the arcade, right?

168
00:11:57,753 --> 00:11:59,463
This isn't any different, man.

169
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,340
I mean, we're not even
gonna take anything.

170
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:04,093
We just wanna see
if you can actually do it.

171
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:10,140
Look, I'm really sorry about what
happened to your mom, okay?

172
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:11,683
It's a tough break,

173
00:12:11,892 --> 00:12:15,395
but you wanna make sure something
doesn't happen to your dad, don't you?

174
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:14,371
Well, I'll be damned.

175
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:18,291
I don't know how you did that,
but I gotta say, I'm very impressed.

176
00:13:20,585 --> 00:13:22,170
Hey!

177
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:24,380
No!

178
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,642
I really don't know what to say.
I mean, up until today,

179
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:38,394
I thought you were a handyman.
Now I find out that you're a...

180
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:40,855
- Whitelighter.
- A whitelighter.

181
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:45,443
- What exactly is a whitelighter?
- We're really just messengers, guides.

182
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:49,656
Think of us as guardian angels
for good witches.

183
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:52,450
Your tea's cold.

184
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:58,456
Well, you are handy.

185
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:03,252
So all this time, you knew
who we really were?

186
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:07,632
I was sent here to watch over you and
your sisters when you got your powers.

187
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,509
You know, help out wherever I could.

188
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:12,261
- Sent by who?
- "Whom."

189
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:15,556
They're a group of elder whitelighters.

190
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:17,808
They're known as the Founders.

191
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:21,145
You were never supposed to find out.
I screwed up and got caught.

192
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:25,191
So, what, you're here again
to help us out with something else?

193
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,693
Actually, I'm here
to help a boy named Max.

194
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:32,907
- Max? Wait, that's...
- The spirit board. I know.

195
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:36,369
See, Max is a budding good witch,
new to the powers,

196
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:38,788
but he's very young
and vulnerable.

197
00:14:38,954 --> 00:14:40,623
And he's in serious trouble.

198
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:42,833
Someone wants to take advantage
of his gift.

199
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:45,377
- So why don't you help him?
- I did.

200
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:49,256
I made sure that Prue received his cry
for help. That's why I was sent here.

201
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,842
That's all I'm supposed to do.
The rest is up to Prue.

202
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:53,886
Yeah, but Prue doesn't know
anything about him.

203
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:57,723
- She doesn't know he's a little boy.
- Well, she will.

204
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:00,142
In the meantime,

205
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:03,395
you must help me keep my secret,
or I could get in trouble, okay?

206
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:06,315
Piper and Prue can never know
what I really am.

207
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:11,320
Me, keep a secret?
Hello, wrong Halliwell.

208
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,574
Wait, you have to tell Piper.

209
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:17,367
If I know her, she's gonna think...

210
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:20,496
I know, I know,
and that's where I need your help.

211
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:25,292
You see, whitelighters and witches
aren't allowed to fall in love.

212
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:28,670
It's like humans and angels aren't.

213
00:15:29,213 --> 00:15:32,174
But I did. I fell in love with Piper.

214
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:36,053
And I know how much
she cares about you.

215
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:40,307
It isn't fair to keep her in the dark.

216
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,393
But I have to keep this secret,
so somehow

217
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,521
I have to tell Piper that
I can never see her again,

218
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:49,483
and I can't tell her why.

219
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:52,819
You don't need my help, Leo.

220
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,155
You need a miracle.

221
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,498
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

222
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:11,171
Why don't you just sit there.

223
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,425
That's perfect. So, what's up?

224
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:18,428
I've got some interesting information
about a boy named Max.

225
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:21,097
- A boy?
- Named Max, yes.

226
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:24,309
- Whoa.
- It's curious, huh?

227
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,728
Very.

228
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:31,483
Earlier today, a microchip plant was
broken into, but nothing was taken.

229
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,194
Stranger still, the alarms
on the inside were turned off

230
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,947
before the front door
was opened on the outside.

231
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,954
So, what does this have to do
with this boy, Max?

232
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:49,542
Well, security cameras picked up
a car in the parking lot

233
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,836
with a boy in the back seat...

234
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:57,425
...matching this photo taken
at an arcade last week,

235
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,680
where a couple of kids snuck in
in much the same way.

236
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,807
Same boy, Max Franklin.

237
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:10,313
Do you know who was
in the front seat?

238
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:15,735
Just that they shot and wounded
a security guard at the scene.

239
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,363
This boy's in serious trouble, Prue.
This is not a dream.

240
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:22,742
I need to know what you
know about this.

241
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:24,827
Well, I mean, why would
I know anything?

242
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:27,538
I think that you need
to talk to his family.

243
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:30,207
I did. His father.

244
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:33,085
He pretended not to know
anything either.

245
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:35,671
Told me the boy was out of state
visiting grandparents,

246
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,715
will be back tomorrow.

247
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:40,301
But something's wrong.

248
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:43,220
He wanted to tell me something,
but he was scared.

249
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,806
He was afraid to say anything.
What are you writing?

250
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,601
Nothing.

251
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:51,270
I'm just doodling.

252
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,565
You're not gonna tell me
anything, are you?

253
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,992
One day, I'm gonna figure out
your secret, Prue.

254
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:07,453
Count on it.

255
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:21,008
Telephone.

256
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,513
- Hello?
- Hey. Look, Max is a boy, Piper,

257
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,891
- and he's been kidnapped.
- What?

258
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:31,935
Yeah, I got another message
on the spirit board. I have to help.

259
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,062
I think we should call the police.

260
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:36,023
Andy's already been here,

261
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,941
and I think I have an idea
of what to do.

262
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,068
Okay, so you've got
everything under control?

263
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:42,696
No, everything's not under control.

264
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,450
I need crab for my ravioli
because someone threw it away,

265
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,536
and I just got five more orders,
Pepper.

266
00:19:00,547 --> 00:19:02,799
- Mr Franklin?
- Yes?

267
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:07,387
My name's Prue Halliwell.
I need to talk to you about your son.

268
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:11,558
Sorry, you have to leave, okay?

269
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:16,062
Look, I know that he's been kidnapped,
I know that he's in trouble.

270
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:18,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

271
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:20,233
I think you do.

272
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,153
What I don't understand is
why you won't talk to the police.

273
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,073
Please, you gotta leave,
all right? Thank you.

274
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:30,076
Unless you can't talk to the police.

275
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:31,828
The kidnappers won't let you.

276
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,247
That's why you wouldn't say
anything to Trudeau.

277
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:39,294
Look, I don't know who you are,
but I'm begging you...

278
00:19:39,502 --> 00:19:42,088
- I can help.
- No, no...

279
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,800
...you can't, all right?
Goodbye.

280
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:47,343
Mr Franklin.

281
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,976
Dear God.

282
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:05,069
Thank you.

283
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,033
Hi, I know you guys have
been waiting a long time.

284
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:14,662
Hey, have you heard from Prue?

285
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:18,708
Yeah. She's got everything
under control. I'll be right back.

286
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:22,170
It's actually good we have
a few more minutes.

287
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:24,213
We could go over your plan.

288
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,883
You know, what you're
gonna tell Piper.

289
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:28,968
Oh, well...

290
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:31,929
...I thought I'd tell her that...

291
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:33,598
...you know, as much as I love her,

292
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:37,852
and as much as I'd like to stay
in San Francisco, I can't.

293
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:41,647
And I don't know how long my work
will keep me away.

294
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,150
No, no, what you just said
to her was,

295
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:46,736
as much as you'd love to stay
and have sex with her,

296
00:20:46,902 --> 00:20:50,573
you've got a wife and kids in
another part of the country. Try again.

297
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:55,578
Piper...

298
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:59,081
...you know how much
you mean to me,

299
00:20:59,248 --> 00:21:01,917
and more than anything,
I wish things could work out,

300
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:06,005
but they can't, and no one
is more sorry than me.

301
00:21:06,171 --> 00:21:07,506
Translation:

302
00:21:07,673 --> 00:21:09,758
"I've found someone
I like even better."

303
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:13,721
- I'm completely confused.
- Look, Leo it's not that complicated.

304
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,182
Okay, just avoid the following:

305
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,809
"We can still hang out."

306
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,311
"I don't deserve you yet."

307
00:21:21,478 --> 00:21:25,315
"I need more 'me' time
before we can have 'we' time."

308
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:27,234
And my personal favourite:

309
00:21:27,526 --> 00:21:29,987
"It's not you, it's me."

310
00:21:30,154 --> 00:21:32,406
Whatever you do, don't start off
the conversation with,

311
00:21:32,573 --> 00:21:36,076
"We need to talk."
Other than that, you'll do fine.

312
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,587
Then they hit me, and I passed out.

313
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:51,049
I've been out-of-my-mind
crazy ever since last night.

314
00:21:51,216 --> 00:21:53,760
Should I go to the police?
Should I do what they say?

315
00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:55,595
They promised to bring him back,

316
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:58,515
but after what the police say
happened this morning...

317
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,977
I don't even know if he's all right.

318
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,980
No, I know that Max is
okay right now.

319
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:08,692
If he wasn't, he couldn't have
sent me that last message.

320
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,406
So I take it you're a witch too, huh?

321
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:16,783
Is that what your son says he is?

322
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,704
What Paulette, my wife,
said he is. It's what she was.

323
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:24,082
You know, it would have been a hell of
a lot easier to handle her family secret

324
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:26,334
had it been revealed a lot sooner.

325
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:29,170
Maybe she was afraid
of how you'd react.

326
00:22:31,715 --> 00:22:35,218
Maybe she was afraid that you
might not accept her or love her.

327
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:38,888
Speaking from personal experience?

328
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:40,598
Yes, I am.

329
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:46,146
Yeah, Paulette, she had to tell me.
She was running out of time.

330
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,481
She passed away three months ago.

331
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:52,277
Then suddenly, Max,
he starts having these powers.

332
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:55,071
I don't have a clue what to tell him,
what it all means.

333
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:59,659
Then he uses it and nearly gets
busted at an arcade, and now this.

334
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:02,579
- I'm sure that Max...
- Do you have any children?

335
00:23:02,745 --> 00:23:04,080
No, but...

336
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:07,125
Then you couldn't possibly understand
what I'm feeling.

337
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:11,462
Still, I'm sorry...

338
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,466
...about what happened to Max
and your wife,

339
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:18,344
but if you could just find
a way to forgive her...

340
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:20,430
Forgive her.

341
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,640
She should've told me.

342
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:27,228
Maybe if she had I would have
been better able to protect Max.

343
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:32,066
Do you know anybody who owns
an auto shop of any kind?

344
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,193
Why?

345
00:23:34,402 --> 00:23:36,529
I think your son was trying
to send me a clue.

346
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:38,573
No, I...

347
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:43,202
Although, I think Max's friend Danny...

348
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:45,746
His brother works at one
over in Oakland.

349
00:23:45,913 --> 00:23:48,708
Is Danny the friend that broke
into the arcade with Max?

350
00:23:50,626 --> 00:23:52,086
Got an address?

351
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,393
- Max?
- Who's there?

352
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,062
My name is Prue.
I'm here to take you home.

353
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:13,857
- But how'd you find me?
- I had a chat with your friend Danny.

354
00:24:14,024 --> 00:24:16,110
Look, your dad, he's waiting for you.

355
00:24:16,318 --> 00:24:17,945
- You know my dad?
- Yeah.

356
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:20,281
Hey, who the hell are you?

357
00:24:26,495 --> 00:24:29,331
- Come on, we need to hurry.
- You have powers?

358
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:31,250
Yeah, I'll explain them
to you in the car.

359
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:34,294
I can't leave.
They'll kill my dad if I do.

360
00:24:47,015 --> 00:24:48,600
Nap time's over. Wake up.

361
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:50,602
I got a little surprise for you.

362
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:52,604
- Max, are you okay?
- He's fine.

363
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:55,482
- Look, don't worry.
- I said, he's fine.

364
00:24:56,358 --> 00:25:00,946
Now, before you go trying to pull any of
that magical hocus-pocus crap again,

365
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:02,864
I wanna show you something.

366
00:25:04,324 --> 00:25:06,952
- What is it?
- All that matters is what happens

367
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,912
when I flip that little switch.

368
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:13,375
Now, I flip that little switch, and
Max here takes a nap, a long one.

369
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,836
- Mickey, why don't...?
- Shut up.

370
00:25:28,932 --> 00:25:33,186
Plastic explosive. Little trick
I picked up in Corcoran.

371
00:25:33,395 --> 00:25:35,438
Prison system's very educational.

372
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:38,066
Mickey, he's just a child.

373
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:40,068
He's already proven
he's not going anywhere.

374
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:42,862
If you're gonna wire anyone,
wire me.

375
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:45,740
What is it with you?
What are you, magicians?

376
00:25:45,907 --> 00:25:48,243
Freaks of nature?
Aliens? What?

377
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,537
Witches.

378
00:25:59,587 --> 00:26:02,048
- You okay?
- I'm scared.

379
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:04,175
I know.

380
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:09,681
Just do as they say,
and everything will be fine.

381
00:26:10,014 --> 00:26:11,432
They need you, remember?

382
00:26:11,975 --> 00:26:14,644
I'm sorry I got you into this.

383
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:17,480
I'm sorry I have these stupid powers.

384
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:19,732
No, Max.

385
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:23,277
Don't ever be sorry about that.

386
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,239
It's a gift.

387
00:26:26,656 --> 00:26:29,909
It's like being a musician
or an athlete.

388
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:32,495
It's a pain.

389
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:34,455
I'm a freak.

390
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:36,582
My dad hates it too.

391
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,377
He hates me.

392
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:42,672
No, he doesn't.

393
00:26:43,464 --> 00:26:45,758
He just doesn't understand it, that's all.

394
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:48,010
It's new to him too.

395
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,932
Don't worry, Max.

396
00:26:54,892 --> 00:26:57,853
I won't let anything happen to you.
I promise.

397
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:00,689
Okay?

398
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,777
- Okay.
- Okay.

399
00:27:08,197 --> 00:27:11,700
You really think it's necessary,
wiring the kid like that?

400
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:13,869
You saw what that chick did.

401
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:18,958
Pretty cool, actually.
It might come in handy tonight.

402
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:21,835
It's the only reason
she's still breathing.

403
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:34,848
Sorry, small mutiny in the kitchen.
Where were we?

404
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:38,143
Piper, there's something
I need to tell you.

405
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,854
- Yeah?
- Look, forgive me,

406
00:27:41,063 --> 00:27:44,024
but I could be summoned at any
moment, so I have to tell you this now.

407
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:47,653
I can't...

408
00:27:49,404 --> 00:27:51,532
I can't...

409
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,327
I can't believe how much I missed you.

410
00:27:56,912 --> 00:28:00,123
Well, Leo, I missed you too,
but what do you mean, summoned?

411
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:04,252
- Summoned where?
- Hey, Piper.

412
00:28:04,544 --> 00:28:08,048
No respect, I can live with, okay,
but where the hell's my coriander?

413
00:28:08,256 --> 00:28:10,509
Okay, that's it,
I'm ending this now.

414
00:28:10,676 --> 00:28:13,220
Oh, my gosh. You know.

415
00:28:13,428 --> 00:28:15,305
Of course I know.
The whole restaurant knows.

416
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:17,432
Didn't you hear him scream
across the room?

417
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:20,268
- I thought it was a secret.
- Phoebe...

418
00:28:20,477 --> 00:28:22,020
It'll probably be in the newspaper.

419
00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:25,732
No, it can't be. Look, Piper,
he never meant to hurt you.

420
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:29,402
Phoebe, please. You haven't
even met the maniac yet.

421
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:31,446
What's gotten into you?

422
00:28:34,407 --> 00:28:36,117
She's talking about the new chef.

423
00:28:36,326 --> 00:28:39,245
Oh, right.

424
00:28:39,412 --> 00:28:41,081
So does that mean
she took your news well?

425
00:28:41,665 --> 00:28:44,417
That means she doesn't know.
I can't tell her, Phoebe.

426
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:47,128
I can't stand to think about it,
much less talk about it.

427
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:49,589
Here's something else
you might not wanna think about.

428
00:28:49,756 --> 00:28:52,175
Piper said that Prue had
everything under control.

429
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:54,844
Well, I can't find her.

430
00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:01,059
Say hello to Mickey Jackson.

431
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:05,104
Security cameras digitally enhanced
for your viewing pleasure.

432
00:29:05,271 --> 00:29:06,773
But Jackson's a
convicted bank robber.

433
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:08,650
Why is he breaking
into a microchip plant?

434
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:12,320
And stealing squat. Good question.

435
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:16,240
A better one would be how he broke
into the plant in the first place.

436
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:18,409
High tech's not exactly his style.

437
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:20,953
Unless this was just a dry run.

438
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,082
Maybe Mickey's looking
to do bigger and better things.

439
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:26,167
Like another bank?

440
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:28,878
Like a big bank.
It's a leap, I know.

441
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:31,631
Agreed, but why the kid?

442
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:34,842
How's he fit into this?

443
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:38,304
<i>- Trudeau.
- Hey, Andy, it's Phoebe.</i>

444
00:29:38,513 --> 00:29:40,097
Have you seen Prue
since this morning?

445
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:43,476
No, as a matter of fact, I was about
to ask you the same question.

446
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:46,020
- Really? Why?
- Because I think she knows something

447
00:29:46,187 --> 00:29:47,813
about a boy named Max.

448
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:50,024
<i>Do you?</i>

449
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:54,904
Yeah, oh... Oh, that's my call waiting.
I gotta go. Could be Prue. Bye.

450
00:29:56,822 --> 00:29:57,865
Anything?

451
00:29:58,032 --> 00:30:00,660
No, I can't reach either Max
or Prue telepathically.

452
00:30:01,327 --> 00:30:03,329
Does that mean they're in trouble?

453
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:05,456
Who's in trouble?

454
00:30:05,664 --> 00:30:07,792
Oh, the 49ers.

455
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:11,337
No secondary. They need
a really good draft pick next year.

456
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:17,009
Well, I'm gonna go into the kitchen
and see if I can get in touch with Prue.

457
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:18,636
Carry on.

458
00:30:22,348 --> 00:30:24,099
Alone, finally.

459
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:29,229
Don't have to worry about any more
interruptions from Harry. He quit.

460
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:34,818
Okay, not the enthusiastic response
I was hoping for.

461
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:41,241
Look, Piper, I've been searching all day
for an easy way to tell you this.

462
00:30:43,952 --> 00:30:45,662
Phoebe?

463
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:49,374
Phoebe, I know you're
not in the kitchen.

464
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:53,504
That is so weird.
I was just on my way back.

465
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:57,466
Is Leo about to tell me he doesn't
wanna see me anymore?

466
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,725
You'll have to ask him.

467
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:14,608
And that's the problem. I fell in love
with you, and I shouldn't have.

468
00:31:14,816 --> 00:31:16,735
- You're married?
- No.

469
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:18,862
Engaged?

470
00:31:19,154 --> 00:31:24,534
I'm involved,
but it's not the way you think.

471
00:31:24,743 --> 00:31:28,538
The truth is, is that I led you on and
made you believe I was coming back.

472
00:31:29,122 --> 00:31:31,208
Leo, you are back.

473
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:34,628
Yeah, but I have to leave again now,

474
00:31:34,794 --> 00:31:38,548
and it's not because I want to, though.
It's because I have to.

475
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:41,051
I'm sorry.

476
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:43,261
That's okay.

477
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:46,222
- It is?
- Yeah.

478
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:49,059
I mean, Leo, you're a nice guy,
and I like you a lot,

479
00:31:49,225 --> 00:31:54,147
but let's face it,
you're geographically undesirable.

480
00:31:54,356 --> 00:31:56,483
I mean, you said you live
really far away, right?

481
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:58,276
Yeah, pretty far.

482
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:02,322
Well, I try never to get involved
with guys I can't see regularly,

483
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:04,449
so don't feel bad.

484
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:08,036
I mean, I understand.
Really, I do.

485
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:22,508
- So how'd she take it?
- Not bad.

486
00:32:26,137 --> 00:32:29,932
Oh, excuse me, but I have to go.

487
00:32:30,266 --> 00:32:31,893
Leo, where are you going?

488
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,605
I have to leave now.

489
00:32:41,944 --> 00:32:45,490
So the thing is,
once Max shorts out the alarm,

490
00:32:45,656 --> 00:32:49,577
we've got three minutes till the guards
realize there's a signal interruption.

491
00:32:49,744 --> 00:32:52,622
Just make sure the kid knows
what he's supposed to do.

492
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:56,542
And keep an eye on that girl.
I don't trust her.

493
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:02,131
Has anything like this
ever happened to you before?

494
00:33:03,507 --> 00:33:05,760
Not exactly like this.

495
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:09,513
- Usually, the demons that I have to...
- Demons?

496
00:33:10,014 --> 00:33:13,768
Your mom didn't get to tell you much
about being a witch, did she?

497
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:18,022
No. I had just found out about
my power when she died.

498
00:33:20,107 --> 00:33:23,360
You know, my mom died
when I was young too.

499
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:25,863
I know how much it hurts.

500
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,824
And it doesn't ever really go away.

501
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,953
I didn't even know that
my power was coming.

502
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,832
I've had to figure it out all by myself,
which means so can you.

503
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:41,045
- Especially with your dad's help.
- He'll never understand.

504
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:43,422
Max, you have to help him understand.

505
00:33:43,964 --> 00:33:46,216
You sound just like my mom.

506
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:51,138
Well, I care a lot about you too.

507
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:54,141
I wish you could be my mom right now.

508
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:58,896
So, what is your power anyway?

509
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:01,857
Mom called it psychokinesis.

510
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:04,902
It means I can move things I can't see.

511
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:10,240
All right, remember, just do everything
I say, and nobody gets hurt.

512
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,867
Let's roll.

513
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:15,037
- Max?
- Dad.

514
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:17,414
Hold it. Hold it.

515
00:34:17,581 --> 00:34:19,541
Don't shoot. I'm unarmed.

516
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,251
Nobody else knows you're here.

517
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,712
I found you the same way she did,
through your brother.

518
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,547
Your brother?

519
00:34:25,756 --> 00:34:28,508
- Gordon, they have him wired.
- Shut up!

520
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:33,138
- Dad.
- It's all right, son.

521
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:36,892
Look, man, I'll give you
anything else you want,

522
00:34:37,058 --> 00:34:41,396
just let me have my boy, please.

523
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:49,696
All right, David, go put them in the van.

524
00:34:50,113 --> 00:34:51,698
Do it.

525
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:56,244
My son.

526
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:58,580
Max?

527
00:34:58,788 --> 00:35:00,248
Max?

528
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:05,170
Please, man, let him go.
I beg you, please, he's my son.

529
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,338
Let him go. I beg you, please...

530
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:09,966
Sorry.

531
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,980
Drive.

532
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:44,459
All right, it'll be just like
this morning, Max.

533
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:49,881
That's where the alarm panel is.
You know the rest.

534
00:35:50,673 --> 00:35:54,427
- What are you looking at?
- What are you gonna do to my dad?

535
00:35:56,137 --> 00:36:01,309
Max, the sooner this is over,
the sooner we can get to him.

536
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:03,519
We need to hurry.

537
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:30,713
- Okay.
- Out.

538
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,334
We got two minutes.

539
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:11,753
All right, you get the cash.
I'll watch them.

540
00:37:21,888 --> 00:37:23,932
Use your power.

541
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:35,485
I don't want you two getting any ideas.

542
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,913
What the hell are you doing?

543
00:37:52,377 --> 00:37:54,212
That's the vault!

544
00:37:55,463 --> 00:37:57,215
Put it down!

545
00:37:58,675 --> 00:38:00,385
Hold it right there!

546
00:38:00,677 --> 00:38:02,012
Drop it!

547
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:09,978
Big mistake.

548
00:38:14,983 --> 00:38:16,526
Yeah, right back at you.

549
00:38:24,534 --> 00:38:27,287
- Come on.
- Shouldn't we wait for the cops?

550
00:38:27,453 --> 00:38:30,665
- Explain everything?
- No, we cannot explain without telling.

551
00:38:30,832 --> 00:38:33,376
And you have to protect yourself
by protecting your secret.

552
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:36,004
We really need to get back
to your dad, okay?

553
00:38:54,522 --> 00:38:55,857
Paulette.

554
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,826
It's not time to be with
your wife, Gordon.

555
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:08,661
It's time to be with your son.

556
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:10,621
But...

557
00:39:21,716 --> 00:39:23,509
Raise the boy well.

558
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:25,678
Heed Prue's advice.

559
00:39:50,786 --> 00:39:52,705
Dad. You okay?

560
00:39:52,913 --> 00:39:55,708
Max. Oh, I'm fine, Max.

561
00:39:55,874 --> 00:39:58,377
Thank you, God.
Thank you! Thank you!

562
00:39:58,544 --> 00:39:59,878
Oh, you're all right.

563
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:02,339
But I saw you get...

564
00:40:03,006 --> 00:40:05,008
You're not bleeding.

565
00:40:05,676 --> 00:40:07,386
It's a miracle.

566
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:09,429
Thank you.

567
00:40:09,888 --> 00:40:11,807
Thank you for protecting my son.

568
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,893
I'm just glad it worked out.

569
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:19,147
Raise the boy well.

570
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:22,985
What?

571
00:40:25,195 --> 00:40:27,739
There's somewhere we need to go.

572
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:32,786
I'd like you to come with us.

573
00:40:48,552 --> 00:40:51,304
Max, I was so busy being angry
at your mother for leaving,

574
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:55,058
for not telling me her secret,
your secret.

575
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:58,395
It was like a weight on my heart.

576
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:03,608
I hope you both can forgive me.

577
00:41:33,346 --> 00:41:35,807
Can you believe that?
Dad's old train.

578
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:39,352
I can't believe you. You get mad at me
for chasing monsters on my own.

579
00:41:39,852 --> 00:41:43,356
Well, I figured that I could handle it
when I realized they weren't demons,

580
00:41:43,523 --> 00:41:45,441
but I probably should've
asked for help.

581
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:47,902
Even though that kills you.
And it almost did.

582
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:49,779
Live and learn.

583
00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:53,449
Yeah, you didn't even get
to say goodbye to Leo.

584
00:41:53,658 --> 00:41:56,077
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I don't know. It's weird,

585
00:41:56,244 --> 00:42:00,248
I felt like he was holding
something back from me.

586
00:42:00,414 --> 00:42:01,874
Holding back? What do you mean?

587
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:06,462
Who knows? It just seemed like
he wasn't telling me the whole story,

588
00:42:06,629 --> 00:42:09,674
like he had some secret
he was afraid I couldn't handle.

589
00:42:09,882 --> 00:42:12,051
Well, that's his call.

590
00:42:13,678 --> 00:42:17,223
Assuming that he had a secret.
Might not have.

591
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,724
What are you talking about?

592
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:21,102
Okay, okay, you don't have
to beat it out of me.

593
00:42:21,268 --> 00:42:22,603
Leo is a whitelighter.

594
00:42:22,812 --> 00:42:24,689
They're sort of guardian
angels for witches.

595
00:42:25,272 --> 00:42:27,525
And they're not supposed
to get involved with witches,

596
00:42:27,733 --> 00:42:31,278
but Leo couldn't help it. He fell in love
with you, and that broke all the rules

597
00:42:31,487 --> 00:42:32,988
and got him in all sorts of trouble.

598
00:42:33,155 --> 00:42:37,785
And even though he'll love you forever,
you will probably never see him again.

599
00:42:42,623 --> 00:42:47,169
What? Phoebe, that's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

600
00:42:48,712 --> 00:42:50,631
Oh, God. Don't be so silly.

601
00:42:50,798 --> 00:42:54,259
- That's me: Silly.
- I'm gonna go get some more tea.

602
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,012
Yeah, you know, Pheebs,
with an imagination like that,

603
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:59,390
you should be writing
children's books or something.

604
00:42:59,598 --> 00:43:00,974
No, but I didn't...

605
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:05,938
...even think of that.
That's a really good idea, Prue.

606
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:11,443
That stays here.

607
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:15,322
Wait, I thought all of the toys were
going to the Salvation Army.

608
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:20,202
Well, like you said, we should
save some for our children.

609
00:43:20,494 --> 00:43:23,997
Do I sense a hormonal shift here?

610
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,625
It's no big deal.

611
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:28,669
I've just had some time to think.

612
00:43:28,877 --> 00:43:30,796
Yeah, in all that spare time of yours?

613
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,800
And I realize that I do want kids.

614
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:36,635
I think I'll make a great mom.

615
00:43:40,555 --> 00:43:43,392
So did you save Max...

616
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:45,936
...or did Max save you?
