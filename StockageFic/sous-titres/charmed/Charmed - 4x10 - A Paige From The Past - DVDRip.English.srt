1
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,114
Is this the way you treat every driver
with a busted headlight?

2
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,511
No, just the ones without lD.

3
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,272
Now, I've convinced Lopez
not to cite you.

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,908
But no more driving
without a license.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,911
- Am I free to go?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,036
- Finally.
- Finally?

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,270
- I mean, thanks.
- Finally?

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,432
You think I need this?
You see this assignment board?

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,593
It's full of cases, open cases
that I should be working on.

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,512
Instead, I'm cleaning up
after your mess.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,669
I don't like it either.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,070
I have to clean up
after the sisters' messes.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,470
I'm trying to fit in as a human,
but I got no lD, no job--

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,073
Does anyone say,
"Thank you, Darryl."

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,514
--store without getting arrested.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,113
- It just sucks!
- Sucks!

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,117
- You good?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,994
Me too.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,714
Oh, my God, Cole. How's my car?

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,589
It's fine.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,115
That was the first and the last time
you borrow my car.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,033
Got it? Good. Let's go.

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,111
Being human was supposed
to make my life easier.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,555
- It's getting worse by the minute.
- I know the feeling.

25
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,312
I swear, Phoebe
was closer to marrying me

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,391
- when I was still a demon.
- To be honest, Cole,

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,949
getting busted by the cops isn't
the best way to win her over.

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,314
Oh, Piper, gosh.

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,119
I'm sure Cole already feels like
a big enough loser. I know I would.

30
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,793
Oh, thanks a lot.

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,999
Oh, God.

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,798
It's about to explode.

33
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,313
Come on.

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,509
It's stuck.

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,791
- I got it.
- Paige!

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,474
Careful. Hurry,
before someone sees us.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,989
What happened to you?

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,278
Paige!

39
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,991
Cole, why are you being so vague?

40
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,639
I only asked you
where you were going.

41
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,597
And I told you, I'm going to get a life.

42
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,797
See, now, that's the vague part
I'm talking about.

43
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,269
The last time you left like this,
you went and got a gun.

44
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,839
I'm not getting a gun.

45
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,191
Okay, then, please,
tell me what's wrong.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,036
It's just-- I need action.

47
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,195
I kind of thought we were
doing okay in that department.

48
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,794
Not that kind of action, Phoebe.

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,633
I went from all-powerful demon
to mere mortal overnight.

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,156
You are not mere. Baby,
you are anything but mere.

51
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,788
Next to the Charmed Ones,
I'm a potted plant.

52
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,918
But last night, pulling that woman
out of that car felt so good.

53
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,593
That's because you're a good man.

54
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,399
Well, I won't last as one without
a reason to get up in the morning.

55
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,913
You have me.

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,115
I'm a reason.

57
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,430
That's all I have, Phoebe.

58
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,390
And I'm not even sure I have that.

59
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,313
Am I the world's
biggest bitch or what?

60
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,078
Too easy.

61
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,392
Cole vanquished his demon half.

62
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,552
He gave up everything
he has ever known for me.

63
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,359
And I can't muster up
a simple yes to marriage.

64
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,191
You're not the marrying type.

65
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,555
Or so you keep telling yourself.

66
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,153
But you think I am?

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,430
I think you're afraid.

68
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,355
Of what?

69
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,509
Cole's humanity.

70
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,148
He was actually a much safer
boyfriend when he was a demon.

71
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,153
Even though he could rip
your throat out with his teeth.

72
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,555
You wanna explain that to me?

73
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,154
Well, on some level

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,356
you knew that it couldn't last,
a demon and a witch.

75
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,475
But now that Cole is a human,
the safety net's gone,

76
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,312
and for the first time
in your relationship

77
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,152
the future lies in your hands.

78
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,189
Yeah.

79
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,352
Okay. I don't wanna analyze me
anymore. Let's try somebody else.

80
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,115
- How's Paige feeling this morning?
- No idea.

81
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,192
She flew out the door this morning
like nothing happened.

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,430
So we still don't know
why she froze up?

83
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,670
- Nope.
- That is so weird.

84
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,594
I mean, she can handle demons now,
but she can't handle a car wreck?

85
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,837
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,070
If you put your nose any deeper
into that coffee cup,

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,593
you're gonna need a snorkel.

88
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,592
What do you know?

89
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,197
Paige told me something
in confidence.

90
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,313
Okay, but it's kind of
a dangerous time for us.

91
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,516
If she freezes up again
at the wrong moment,

92
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,240
are you gonna be sorry
you didn't tell us?

93
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,069
- Paige's parents died in a car wreck.
- Oh, my God.

94
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,593
When did that happen?

95
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,951
About eight years ago
when she was in high school.

96
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,111
She never really dealt with it.

97
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,069
Of course not. How do you deal
with something like that?

98
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,990
And plus she was
a teenager and all alone.

99
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,352
So maybe we could
help her deal with it.

100
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,718
No, I'm not family.
I'm from social services.

101
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,758
I was just calling to see
how she was after the accident.

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,518
Thank God.

103
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,275
Okay, I'll just call back
and check in on her.

104
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,519
Thank you.

105
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,911
Hi. Got a minute?

106
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,478
No. I'm busy, guys.

107
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,631
We just wanna talk.
It's kind of important.

108
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,792
Yeah? So is my work. Maybe later.

109
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,712
Paige, it's about
what happened last night.

110
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,632
- Not right now.
- Paige, we're your sisters.

111
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,155
I said, not now!

112
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,113
Paige.

113
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,519
We know about your parents.

114
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,509
We're worried about you and we
want you to know that you're not alone.

115
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,908
And we're here for you.

116
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,957
Fine, but just not here, okay?

117
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,953
I'll just tell my boss I have to leave.

118
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,995
We'll talk at home.

119
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,752
- Got a minute?
- Whatever it is, no.

120
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,709
- You see this assignment board?
- Well, that's why I'm here.

121
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,950
If you've got such a heavy
caseload, let me help you.

122
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,839
- Oh, you wanna help?
- Yeah.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,390
Great. You can help me by following
that little exit sign right there.

124
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,553
That's it. You wanna fight?

125
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,598
Because without the ability to throw
energy balls, I think I can take you.

126
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,069
Look, just relax, all right?
I need to get back in the game.

127
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,356
- What game?
- The good versus evil game.

128
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,999
It's all I know.

129
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,918
Oh, wow.

130
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,838
You wanna be a cop?

131
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,111
I worked for the DA's office.
I know the law.

132
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,396
I'm a former demon.
I know the streets.

133
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,228
- You wanna be a cop?
- I wanna help with your investigations.

134
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,356
- As a cop?
- On my own.

135
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,476
Of course, the DA investigators
are still after me,

136
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,234
but you could close that case,
clear my name, get my identity back.

137
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,879
- And I could--
- No! No, no.

138
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,029
Now you're talking crazy.

139
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,749
No. What's crazy is me sitting around
the manor all day with nothing to do.

140
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,273
All I got in my head,

141
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,193
all I could do with it going
to waste. Now, that is crazy!

142
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,199
Captain.

143
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,597
Mind if I get my office back?

144
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,034
No, sorry.

145
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,112
We'll talk about this later.

146
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,399
Excuse me.

147
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,513
So I wasn't the ideal
high school student, you know.

148
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,995
I skipped classes, partied
all night with my friends.

149
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,277
Pretty much anything
they wanted to do I was up for.

150
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,515
Sounds like somebody else I know.

151
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,838
What I mean to say
is that high school

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,709
is a time of searching and figuring out
who you are for everybody.

153
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,035
Yeah, but I was cruel.

154
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,397
Especially to my mom and my dad.

155
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,430
The day they died, I told them
they weren't my real parents.

156
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,435
Which is stupid because
it wasn't even how I felt.

157
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,874
I mean, just because I'm adopted

158
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,632
didn't mean they weren't
my real parents,

159
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,678
because they were.

160
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,912
Well, you were just feeling lost,
and you made a mistake.

161
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,231
I made so many mistakes,
you know, but I got through them.

162
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,109
And I changed, and so have you.

163
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,039
Not in time.

164
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,189
What do you mean?

165
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,192
It was family night.

166
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,316
Just something we did every week.

167
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,517
And my dad

168
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,359
Ieft the fire station early
to pick up my mom and l.

169
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,397
Your dad was a fireman?

170
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,749
Yeah.

171
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,071
And I started bitching

172
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,710
how I was too old for this
and how it was super lame.

173
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,877
And he just lost it.

174
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,110
He was so angry with me.

175
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,795
He was so angry with me.

176
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,073
He didn't--

177
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,596
He didn't see the car that swerved...

178
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,518
...into our lane.

179
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,398
And...

180
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,556
...the next thing I know,
I'm on the pavement.

181
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,790
The car's on fire.

182
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,115
I still don't know why...

183
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,871
...I survived and they didn't.

184
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,631
But you can't blame
yourself for that.

185
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,792
Well...

186
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,678
...I feel guilty every single day.

187
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,992
I know it's hard,

188
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,513
but you gotta try and move forward.

189
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,670
How can I move forward, Piper?
I killed my parents.

190
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,714
What do we do?

191
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,077
How do we help her deal with
something that happened in the past?

192
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,792
Send her back to it.

193
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,473
Okay, wait. So I don't get it.

194
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,835
You wanna summon
the ghost of the past?

195
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,991
From where, the fiction shelf?

196
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,869
Dickens didn't make that stuff up.
He was visited by a malevolent spirit.

197
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,909
Doesn't malevolent mean bad?

198
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,997
Clyde's not the friendliest
ghost that I know,

199
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,799
but he is the only one who helps
the living visit their past.

200
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,997
Clyde? The malevolent
spirit's name is Clyde?

201
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,434
Yeah, he doesn't like it either.

202
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,670
Wait, we're using
bad magic to time travel.

203
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,432
Should I be worried
about any of those

204
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,556
- personal gain issues?
- Not at all.

205
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,996
You're only going back to learn
why your parents died. That's all.

206
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,352
Everyone ready?

207
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,079
Don't we need a summoning spell?

208
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,634
No, Clyde only ignores them.

209
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,394
There's only one way
to get Clyde down here.

210
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,188
Clyde!

211
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,839
Get your butt down here,
you fetid worm

212
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,877
from the bog of eternal stench!

213
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,589
You gotta make him mad.

214
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,832
Your mother was a chunky
substance from a djinn's cesspool!

215
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,439
And she smelled bad too.

216
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,679
Leo!

217
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,751
I was with a client!
1 969, Woodstock.

218
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,433
Hendrix was on-stage!

219
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,433
This better be good.

220
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,036
I need you to take Paige here
back to the day of her greatest pain.

221
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,235
A job?

222
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,231
Why didn't you just say so
in the first place?

223
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,558
Not a job. A favour.

224
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,755
- I don't do charity work.
- You owe me, Clyde.

225
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,070
Or do I need to remind you
of your client that I healed?

226
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,800
The one you returned from
the past on the edge of a cliff?

227
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,633
I believe there were
32 broken bones.

228
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,155
All right, all right. I remember.

229
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,673
Are you sure you wanna do this?
I only open the door to the past.

230
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,831
I don't guarantee no safe trip.

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,592
Obviously.

232
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,354
Yeah. I need to do this.

233
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,829
Fine. You guide her.

234
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,750
I won't be able to hear your call.
You guys will be on your own.

235
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,592
We'll be okay.
Just take care of Paige.

236
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,517
Just don't look down.

237
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,473
How's about you two?

238
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,517
Care for a little trip to the past?

239
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,477
See it all a second time.

240
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,595
My rates are steep but fair.

241
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,552
Can you take us back
to meet John Lennon?

242
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,950
- No.
- No, no. Right.

243
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,549
- We'll pass.
- Suit yourself.

244
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,590
If you ever need
my services, just yell.

245
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,709
We need to be here
when Paige gets back.

246
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,239
Yeah.

247
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,073
I'll cook dinner and we can
just hang out for a while.

248
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,550
I hope this plan works.

249
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,717
So do l.

250
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,359
Don't worry, Frankie,

251
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,030
I'll find you a body too.

252
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,318
Rough ride. You okay?

253
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,995
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm all wrong.

254
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,878
Oh, my God. I saw Scrooged.

255
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,792
I'm supposed
to come back as a ghost,

256
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,520
not a ghost with braces?

257
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,516
You're meant to relive the experience,
not to observe it, Paige.

258
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,114
Yeah, but I just wanted
to come back

259
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,793
and sit on the sidelines

260
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,476
and make sarcastic comments
about my lack of style.

261
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,319
Just take a look around, Paige.

262
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,153
Hey, you're right.
I was cool even then.

263
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,109
Philip Lewiki gave this to me.

264
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,191
My first love.

265
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,955
- Can I call him?
- That's not why we're here.

266
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,876
- What do I do?
- Open the door.

267
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,714
Dad?

268
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,633
Are you ready for school?
You don't wanna miss your ride.

269
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,196
What's with all this?

270
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,351
Is that smoke I smell?

271
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,149
Are you smoking in here?

272
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,832
I don't know how much more
of this your mother and I can take.

273
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,791
- Wait. Wait, where are you going?
- To talk to my dad.

274
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,349
Did you see that look in his eyes?
I can't believe I hurt him.

275
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,671
Rules first. To find
what you came here for,

276
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,070
you need to follow the same path
you took eight years ago.

277
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,310
- What if I don't remember?
- I'll guide you.

278
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,233
You're the only one that can see me.
Just don't forget the goal.

279
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,834
You're here to learn what happened
the night your parents died.

280
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,470
I understand. Thank you, Leo.

281
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,112
Step aside.

282
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,192
Why? What did she do this time?

283
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,873
She was smoking again.

284
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,874
This time in her bedroom.

285
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,268
And when I went in,

286
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,035
she had the nerve to give me
this big hug like I wouldn't get mad.

287
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,358
She told me she quit smoking.

288
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,557
Oh, yeah, right. Just like
the time she quit drinking

289
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,517
and passes out at another
one of those parties.

290
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,318
I had to go pick her up
and bring her home.

291
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,796
School called yesterday. You know,
she's cutting her classes again.

292
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,919
She's not gonna get into college
she keeps this up.

293
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,117
Oh, well haven't you heard?
She's not going to college.

294
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,118
Well, we'll see about that.

295
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,957
I changed my mind, Leo.

296
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,872
I can't go in there.

297
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,110
They think I'm awful.

298
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,878
I was awful.

299
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,318
It's all right.

300
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,232
You can do it.

301
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,034
Just remember why you're here.

302
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,232
Mom.

303
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,960
Oh, my God.
I've missed you so much.

304
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,358
- What's got into you?
- What did I tell you?

305
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,876
You guys, I have
an announcement to make.

306
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,600
Starting now,
I'm turning my life around.

307
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,512
You're not borrowing the car.

308
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,958
- No, I mean it.
- Yeah,

309
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,839
Iike you meant it when you said
you were gonna stop cutting classes?

310
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,511
Mom, you understand me.

311
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,592
- You've gotta believe me.
- Oh, so now I'm Mom?

312
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,591
Last night we weren't even
your real parents.

313
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,315
No, you are!

314
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,871
I was just saying that...

315
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,278
...to hurt you.

316
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,116
- Did you feed the cat?
- Yeah.

317
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,472
You guys, I am not a screwup.

318
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,271
I promise I'll change.
I promise I will go to college and...

319
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,032
Oh, please stop.

320
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,949
- Please, we need to talk.
- Well, you are right about that.

321
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,238
And we are going to talk
about everything tonight at dinner.

322
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,713
Dinner?

323
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,632
The family dinner.

324
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,870
Paige, be careful.

325
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,073
Please, we really need
to talk before we drive.

326
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,995
Oh, Paige, that's your ride.

327
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,638
You have to follow the events
of the day, Paige. No exceptions.

328
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,553
I don't think I've ever
cooked for Paige before.

329
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,109
I hope she likes pork roast.

330
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,276
Just out of curiosity,

331
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,268
do you think that I am
a natural beauty or is this like

332
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,795
- one of those gym bodies?
- Oh, Phoebe, please,

333
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,518
Iike you haven't always
been beautiful.

334
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,877
Oh, that's good, because
I hate lifting heavy objects.

335
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,111
What is with the Blanche DuBois?

336
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,830
Phoebe, hi.

337
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,073
Oh, if you're not the most,
to say the least.

338
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,270
Did I miss something?

339
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,149
Yeah. Me.

340
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,199
I think this sister's night
is a good idea.

341
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,676
I mean, there's still so much
we don't know about Paige...

342
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,433
...yet.

343
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,273
Oh, boy.

344
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,591
Hey! What is the matter
with you two?

345
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,875
That is for Paige.

346
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,353
Sorry, ma'am, we're starving.

347
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,550
In so many ways.

348
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,311
Well, go to lunch.

349
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,631
Good idea.

350
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,119
Let's cut out, Lulu.

351
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,512
All right, enough with the pet names
and the accents in the kitchen

352
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,750
and could you come up
with something better than Lulu?

353
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,273
It sounds like a poodle.

354
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,434
Are you making fun of my girl?

355
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,155
My Frankie is so protective.

356
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,919
Frankie?

357
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,673
- And Lulu?
- Hi, we're ghosts.

358
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,835
And we've been waiting
for about 50 years to finish a job.

359
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,231
So now if you'll excuse us--

360
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,631
I can't believe I remember
the combination.

361
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,950
I used to live out of this locker.

362
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,279
My pager.

363
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,192
You had a pager in high school?

364
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,590
Get with it, Leo, it is the '90s.

365
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,159
Michelle Miglis.

366
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,231
Oh, I can't deal
with her drama right now.

367
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,999
Michelle.

368
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,355
Remember your whole
peppermint schnapps theory?

369
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,438
- No.
- You know,

370
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,192
how you can't tell it
from a breath mint?

371
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,590
You're wrong. I got so busted.

372
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,320
Oh, sorry.

373
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,238
You drank at high school?

374
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,992
What are you,
my guide or my judge?

375
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,674
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

376
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,274
Whatever. I got grounded
for two weeks.

377
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,556
My mom pulled the whole
estrogen-fest thing.

378
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,598
- I swear to God, she's so damaged.
- She's not damaged.

379
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,239
You're right, she's beyond repair.

380
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,231
No, Michelle,
she's not beyond repair.

381
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,517
She's just trying to set boundaries,
and believe it or not, you need them.

382
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,511
So maybe you should just lay off.

383
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,996
I mean, God, how would you feel
if she died tomorrow?

384
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,710
Jeez, Paige, morbid much?

385
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,072
Wait for me.

386
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,198
Although the Magna Carta
was a document of great importance

387
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,749
to England and
the American colonies,

388
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,708
it originally granted concessions
to few but the baronial families.

389
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,793
The vast majority of England

390
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,669
would remain without an active voice
in government for another 700 years.

391
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,794
The seeds of the Magna Carta
were planted in 1 21 5

392
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,428
- when an assembly of barons...
- You don't want Donny. Trust me.

393
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,353
He winds up bagging groceries
for a living and driving a Camaro.

394
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,912
I love Camaros.

395
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,389
Would you girls please
hold it down back there.

396
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,788
I'm trying to teach.

397
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,155
But nobody's listening.

398
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,155
Yeah, I know.

399
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,880
That's why all you delinquents
are in this class.

400
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,073
The Magna Carta may have
remained legally inconsequential

401
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,355
had it not been resurrected...

402
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,317
This is ridiculous.
I have to get out of here.

403
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,709
I know the feeling.

404
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,599
No. You don't understand.
It's my last day with my parents.

405
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,157
Okay, what are you babbling about?

406
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,669
Excuse me, Mr. Martin?
May I have a bathroom pass, please?

407
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,274
Don't even think about it.
You have to follow the same path.

408
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,548
- What is the problem, Miss Matthews?
- I am tired of wasting my time here.

409
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,631
Well, I'm sorry if I'm boring you.

410
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,552
No, I'm not talking to you,
Mr. Martin.

411
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,109
- Who were you talking to?
- Yeah, really. Who?

412
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,192
- Paige.
- This is stupid. I just--

413
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,635
This is all just a bad memory.
I need to get out of here.

414
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,750
Miss Matthews,
you will sit down and be quiet

415
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,990
and wait for the bell to ring
just like everyone else!

416
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,037
Go, go, go.

417
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,679
Sit down, Miss Matthews!

418
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,354
- No, I won't.
- Paige, don't do this.

419
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,999
Go, go, go.

420
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,039
Going somewhere?

421
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,599
Busted, baby.

422
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,080
Where are we going to, man?
All right. All right.

423
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,559
Did you find anything?

424
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,473
Yeah, there was a Lulu
and Frankie in the database.

425
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,789
Some crazy young couple.

426
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,315
They robbed a series
of jewellery stores in the '50s.

427
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,040
They killed three people
before they were gunned down.

428
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,437
- I knew they were criminals.
- Who?

429
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,911
The ghosts that possessed
Phoebe and Cole.

430
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,470
Will you please not use
the G word around here.

431
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,598
Okay, fine. But we need to find
them before they finish their job.

432
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,789
What job?

433
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,349
They must have some sort
of unfinished business here on Earth,

434
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,909
and they either can't
or won't move on until it's done.

435
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,071
- You know this?
- Well, they didn't take me aside

436
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,676
and share their plan with me,
but it's how most ghosts work, Darryl.

437
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,316
You know, I told you
no creepy talk in the precinct.

438
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,471
Would you just keep down
the creepy talk.

439
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,551
Darryl, I'm sorry,
but what do you want me to say?

440
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,154
My sister was just possessed
by a supernaturally born killer

441
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,596
and my husband is in 1 994, and l
do not mean in the fashion sense.

442
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,591
He time-travelled back
with my other sister.

443
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,830
So the only one left
to help me is you.

444
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,635
Gee, thanks.

445
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,509
Darryl, you know what I mean.

446
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,830
What if they hurt somebody?
What if they kill somebody?

447
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,718
Then Phoebe and Cole
will take the fall.

448
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,315
Look,

449
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,710
the data says that Lulu and Frankie
were gunned down here

450
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,108
outside of a jewellery store.

451
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,111
Maybe that's the job
they were trying to finish.

452
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,549
One security guard.
Armed, right corner.

453
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,709
Got him.

454
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,316
Two female customers.

455
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,673
Can I help you?

456
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,035
We're looking for
a diamond engagement ring.

457
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,555
You came to the right place.

458
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,120
They're all so beautiful,
I don't know which one I like best.

459
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,396
You'd like the biggest one, baby.

460
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,950
Oh, there, that one.

461
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,350
That's the one I want, baby.

462
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,717
Excellent eye for quality.
It's a perfect solitaire.

463
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,111
I don't know.

464
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,670
The cut looks a little...

465
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,115
...off.

466
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,672
Oh, no. I can assure you.

467
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,070
You look like a regular guy.
Could I ask your opinion?

468
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,237
I just wanna know...

469
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,550
...can I borrow your gun?

470
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,518
You stupid?

471
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,434
Move over, baby.

472
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,116
We're back.

473
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,112
I gotta hand it to you, Lulu.

474
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,793
This body's a live wire.

475
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,675
The guy digs action, I can sense it.

476
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,271
This woman loves the feeling
of this diamond on her finger,

477
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,431
although, she'd never cop to it.

478
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,117
Let's split, baby.

479
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,354
Oh, no. Is he okay?

480
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,158
Looks like it was just his leg.

481
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,278
We're too late. They did it.

482
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,237
Hold on just a second.

483
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,559
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

484
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,595
- What went down here?
- Weirdest thing, inspector.

485
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,036
They could've cleaned this out.
And all they take is a diamond ring.

486
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,429
That doesn't make any sense.

487
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,830
Looks like your ghosts
still have unfinished business.

488
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,390
Okay, we gotta find them
before they kill somebody.

489
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,711
But, first, is there
a surveillance tape?

490
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,993
Yeah, it's over there.

491
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,149
Oh, no.

492
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,873
Piper.

493
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,755
You froze the crime scene.

494
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,239
You cannot freeze a crime scene.

495
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,795
Well, I did.

496
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,633
Okay, we gotta protect
Phoebe and Cole.

497
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,438
So start wiping fingerprints.

498
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,591
Look. No! No, no.

499
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,196
Look, I am sick and tired of you

500
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,430
and your entire
dysfunctional family unit.

501
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,759
I will not falsify evidence. I'm a cop.

502
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,353
Okay, cop,

503
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,671
do I need to remind you that
you bailed Cole out of jail last night?

504
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,229
So?

505
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,595
So I was wondering what
you were gonna tell your captain

506
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,671
when he sees Cole
on their surveillance tape.

507
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,155
What are you waiting for?
Go get the damn tape.

508
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,833
- I cannot believe I am doing this.
- It's for a good cause.

509
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,471
Check his pockets.

510
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,719
All right, look, that's everything.

511
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,999
Okay.

512
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,479
Back in position.

513
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,392
- You good?
- Yeah.

514
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,559
Thank you, officer.

515
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,554
- lnspector?
- Yeah.

516
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,109
I thought you'd like to know,
a couple fitting the description

517
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,748
just hit a bridal store on 4th.
Stole a dress.

518
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,832
- A what?
- You know, a dress.

519
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,831
A wedding dress.

520
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,679
Go figure.

521
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,469
First, they're all over
each other at the manor,

522
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,473
then they steal a ring
and now a wedding dress?

523
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,793
Frankie and Lulu's
unfinished business isn't criminal.

524
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,313
It's matrimonial.

525
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,879
They wanna get married.

526
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,388
Do you people have any
normal weddings in your family?

527
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,190
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.

528
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,474
You okay?

529
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,756
No, Leo, I'm nowhere near okay.

530
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,150
My time here is running out.
I haven't done anything.

531
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,914
- You've done enough.
- I haven't done anything.

532
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,992
I came back here to stop feeling guilty,
only now I feel guiltier than ever

533
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,991
because I know what
a damn disappointment I am.

534
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,388
Is that what you believe?

535
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,869
Hello, have you been watching
or eating popcorn?

536
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,349
My mom and my dad
think I'm a total failure.

537
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,069
I'm not.

538
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,238
I can't let them die thinking that.

539
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,194
In fact, I'm not gonna
let them die at all.

540
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,314
You can't change history, Paige,
only learn from it.

541
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,234
I am not letting them
get in that car tonight, Leo.

542
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,636
Yes, you will. And if you
break any more rules--

543
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,119
Screw the rules, Leo.

544
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,750
Oh, is that the teenager
talking or the adult?

545
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,671
The reason we journeyed to the past
was so you can learn from it.

546
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,559
You see where breaking
the rules has gotten you so far?

547
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,632
They're my parents.

548
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,398
I have to do something.

549
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,552
- I'm sorry to barge in like this.
- That incident in class today

550
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,280
was the last straw, Paige.

551
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,318
I'm suspending you from school.

552
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,955
- Just for that?
- Just for that?

553
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,759
For cutting classes, starting fights,

554
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,196
smoking on campus,
possession of alcohol.

555
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,074
I swear I don't turn out like this.

556
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,433
Unfortunately, your actions
speak a lot louder than your words.

557
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,831
It looks bad, I know, but it doesn't
turn out this way. I promise.

558
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,150
I get a degree in social work,
I help others,

559
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,390
I even get into Berkeley
thanks to high test scores

560
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,596
and a powerful essay
on the death of my--

561
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,671
Well, let's just say a powerful essay.

562
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,592
Mom and Dad,
you've got to believe me.

563
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,318
How can we do that, Paige?

564
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,630
We've seen your act
too many times.

565
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,916
Please, just look at me
as though you actually saw me.

566
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,757
I'm not who you think I am.

567
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,551
How do you know what we think?

568
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,392
Because I can see it in your eyes.

569
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,832
Disappointment. And, okay, yeah,
I deserve it. I do.

570
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,475
All I can say for myself is that I'm...

571
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,239
...searching. And one day
I will find myself.

572
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,152
- Paige--
- Let me finish.

573
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,439
I'll find myself because of you two.

574
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,398
You've shaped who I am.

575
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,599
I am not a bad daughter.

576
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,754
You did not raise a bad daughter.

577
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,359
I'm good.

578
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,349
I just...

579
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,636
...wish you could see it.

580
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,713
Sweetheart,

581
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,313
of course we can see it.

582
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,355
What?

583
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,839
We know you're good.

584
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,914
We've always known.

585
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,312
But we also know that
you're lost and that scares us.

586
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,596
And there's nothing
in the world that we want more

587
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,718
than to help you find your way home.
We just don't know how.

588
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,357
I think you just did.

589
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,836
I will stand by my word.

590
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,599
You promise?

591
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,114
I promise.

592
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,355
You guys, can we--?

593
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,750
Can we just stay in tonight
and not go to the restaurant?

594
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,148
We still have to talk.

595
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,039
Yeah, we will, just at home.

596
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,351
Okay. Let's go home.

597
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,395
What?

598
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,354
Well, what's it gonna be tonight?
Should we have pizza?

599
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,033
I kind of miss Mom's cooking.

600
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,152
Like you don't have it every night?

601
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,472
You shouldn't do this, Paige.
You can't change the past.

602
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,439
I already did.

603
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,033
Did you say something, honey?

604
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,474
No, nothing.

605
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,993
You don't know what you're doing.

606
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,914
Yes, I do.

607
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,195
Watch out!

608
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,393
No!

609
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,992
Let go of me!

610
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,593
I have to save them!

611
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,911
It's no use. Paige, they're gone.

612
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,231
No. Why did you
bring me back here?

613
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,833
Why?

614
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,110
I thought I could stop the accident.

615
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,748
You couldn't stop the accident
because it was never your fault.

616
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,912
It was my fault.

617
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,036
It was my fault.

618
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,634
They would've died anyway.
It was their destiny.

619
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,555
Just like it was your destiny
to be saved by magic.

620
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,911
That's how I got out of the car.

621
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,469
I orbed out.

622
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,318
That's right.

623
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,316
I could always orb?

624
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,995
Magic's always been inside of you.

625
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,959
It saved you because you were meant
to do great things with it,

626
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,032
and you have, and you will.

627
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,159
Don't you see?

628
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,836
This is what you came back here
to find, what caused the accident.

629
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,191
Why you survived it.

630
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,476
You need to forgive yourself.

631
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,675
It doesn't matter.

632
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,878
It doesn't matter.

633
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,712
They'll never know...

634
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,792
...how much I loved them.

635
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,918
They'll never know what
good parents they were.

636
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,189
- How many more chapels we got?
- That was the last big one.

637
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,793
There's one more
in the neighbourhood.

638
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,949
What if they're not there?

639
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,680
Then we expand our search
to the entire city.

640
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,793
Do you take this woman
to be thy wedded wife,

641
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,235
to love, comfort and honour

642
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,311
in sickness or in health,

643
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,677
for sorrow or joy,
so long as you both shall live?

644
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,675
I sure do.

645
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,356
I'm gonna take good care
of her this time.

646
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,749
You okay, Frankie?

647
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,071
Yeah. It's just this guy's
all jumpy inside.

648
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,435
Almost like he wants
to get married as much as I do.

649
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,913
I know what you mean.
This one's, like, quivering inside of me.

650
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,158
What are you waiting for? Continue.

651
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,829
Right.

652
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,195
Do you, Lulu,

653
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,952
take this man to be
thy wedded husband--?

654
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,156
I object to this union!

655
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,672
I didn't call for any objections.

656
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,273
Yeah, well, I still object.

657
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,516
You two are not frozen.
Why are you not frozen?

658
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,591
Well, I know I'm not
the most technically minded,

659
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,557
but I would think it would
have something to do

660
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,676
with the fact that we're ghosts.

661
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,149
- I warned you, witch.
- Freeze!

662
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,751
Put the gun down slowly.

663
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,592
Damn!

664
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,199
Don't worry, baby. We'll try again.

665
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,999
Next time we'll get it right.

666
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,434
Cole.

667
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,915
Cole.

668
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,469
- Leo!
- I had no choice.

669
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,278
I know.

670
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,154
Get him out of here
and call an ambulance.

671
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,235
- What happened?
- Look, I'm a cop. Come with me.

672
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,993
Oh, please, don't die.
Please, don't die. Leo!

673
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,039
Clyde!

674
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,675
Get your ass down here,
you son of a bitch!

675
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,236
Bring back Leo now.

676
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,717
Cole's been shot.

677
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,589
Step away, Phoebe.

678
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,752
Frankie! Lulu!

679
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,953
Where do you think you're going?

680
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,509
Well, it's an unfortunate slip-up.

681
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,069
I told you, it's a dangerous journey.

682
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,635
You never answered
the chaplain's question.

683
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,190
I never answered your question.

684
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,592
Ask me again.

685
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,599
Will you marry me?

686
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,908
Yes.

687
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,475
I will.

688
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,879
Thank you, guys.

689
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,635
Just no weddings
till we vanquish The Source.

690
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,157
- Apple cider?
- Apple cider, yes.

691
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,269
Paige,

692
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,590
you haven't told us,
and we've been dying to know.

693
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,519
What happened in your past?

694
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,437
Well, I found out I was
not responsible for the accident.

695
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,034
Of course you weren't.

696
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,595
Then what's the matter?

697
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,159
I just--

698
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,949
It makes me sad
that my parents won't see us

699
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,192
or what I've become.

700
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,396
Actually, that's not quite true.

701
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,715
Leo?

702
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,956
Let's just say that I owe Clyde now.

703
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,398
We know who you are, honey.

704
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,709
Who you've become.

705
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,276
We've been with you
every step of the way

706
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,192
and we're so proud of you,
sweetheart.
