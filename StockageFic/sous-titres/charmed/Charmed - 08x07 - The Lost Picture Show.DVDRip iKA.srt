1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,425
All right, come on.

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:09,968
Come on, come on.

3
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,930
Billie?

4
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,806
Oh, hey.

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,767
Hey, what are you doing?

6
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,852
Scrying.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,146
At 7 in the morning?

8
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:24,816
Well, actually,
I've been doing this all night long.

9
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,736
I'm just trying to find my sister.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,781
Now that I know a demon took her,
I have to try, right?

11
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:31,990
Billie...

12
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,201
I know, I know he's got
a 15-year head start on me,

13
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,495
but, you know, I just figure,
if I keep doing this,

14
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,330
then sooner or later...

15
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,831
You think she's still alive?

16
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,542
She has to be.

17
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,751
Okay, here's the thing.

18
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:46,129
If she's alive, we'll find her.
I promise you that.

19
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,924
But you can't let yourself
become obsessed with this.

20
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,843
I can't exactly let it go either.

21
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,387
But you don't want it
to consume your life.

22
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,763
I know, it's hard.

23
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,349
Aren't you supposed to be at school
or something?

24
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,602
No, I can't focus on anything,
not school right now especially.

25
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,313
I think maybe going to class
would be a good thing for you.

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,774
No, I can't. What if there's a demon
and I'm not here?

27
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,150
I can't help out.

28
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,363
I don't see any demons.
Do you see any demons?

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,968
Time to make room for another.

30
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,898
What the hell?

31
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,150
Where am I? What's going on?

32
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,693
You're out of time, J.D.

33
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,904
You're no longer useful to me.

34
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,906
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

35
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,347
Oh, my God!

36
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,350
Is he still alive?

37
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,019
I think so.

38
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,604
Call 911.

39
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,290
Hey there, can I borrow your car?
Mine's running on fumes.

40
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,500
Sorry, mine is too.

41
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,336
- What? I just filled it up.
- Well, now it's empty.

42
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,088
Honey.

43
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,923
- Yeah?
- No, we're out of honey.

44
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,677
Put it on the list.

45
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,016
Well, much as I'd like to stay here
and watch you two snipe at each other,

46
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,143
I don't want to be late
for my interview.

47
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,769
What interview?

48
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,606
Oh, social services.
I'm gonna try to get my old job back.

49
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,942
- Why?
- Why? Because I like it, that's why.

50
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,944
I only quit because of
the whole magic thing

51
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,863
but now that we've got Billie
to help out...

52
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,364
I think that's great.

53
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,325
Hey, maybe you can help me
adopt a child.

54
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,784
- What?
- Well, yeah.

55
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,496
I'm sort of thinking that adoption
might be my only option at this point.

56
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,207
But, Phoebe, that's ridiculous.

57
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,792
Why? What's wrong with adoption?
You were adopted.

58
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,878
That reminds me, we need eggs.

59
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:16,173
Oh, eggs I have,
it's the sperm I'm missing.

60
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,716
Gross.

61
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,637
I'm just saying, I can't just sit back
and wait for love to find me.

62
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,930
I gotta hurry up.

63
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,723
At least, according to my tea leaves.

64
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,475
Tea. Leo?

65
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,644
Tea, you already told me.

66
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,646
- Sniping.
- I wasn't sniping.

67
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,898
Oh, my God, that's perfect.

68
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,525
What?

69
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,485
Why didn't I think of that before?

70
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:37,945
Gotta go.

71
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,572
How did I wind up
the only sane one here?

72
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,324
You're telling me.

73
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,743
So do you want me to go
to the store with you?

74
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,161
No, you should...

75
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:51,291
I think you should pick up the kids.

76
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,501
No, I got it.

77
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,711
It's fine, I got it.

78
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,630
Thanks.

79
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,681
Hey, you're not just gonna leave
like that, are you?

80
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,474
I tried to help clean up but...

81
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,601
No, no, no,
I'm not talking about the milk,

82
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:10,811
I'm talking about you two.

83
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,356
You've been walking around on pins
and needles for over a week now.

84
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,233
Why don't you guys just talk?

85
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,570
You know, no offence, Paige,
but it's really none of your business.

86
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,948
Actually, it is, because I live here too
and this is affecting us all.

87
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,784
Look, we know you guys
have this epic destined marriage,

88
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,995
but it doesn't mean
that you're immune to problems,

89
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,248
especially with everything
that's gone on lately.

90
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,000
- I know.
- Well, if you know,

91
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,918
then why don't you
do something about it?

92
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,672
I've tried. We've tried and it always
just ends up in an argument.

93
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,134
Well, I don't know. Why don't you try
seeing a marriage counsellor?

94
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,553
We tried that once too, remember?

95
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,971
Try somebody else.

96
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,639
Try another one.

97
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,224
You guys owe it to yourselves.

98
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,020
I don't think you're gonna have
much problem getting that job.

99
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,730
Unless I get there soon,
I am going to.

100
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,149
So please, just go talk to her.

101
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,650
Please?

102
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,991
Hello, Paige.

103
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,327
It's good to see you.

104
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,204
Sam?

105
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,747
Sam?

106
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,249
Don't you mean "Dad"?

107
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:25,636
Multiple abrasions, bruises,
concussion, yet no internal bleeding.

108
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,388
He's a lucky kid, although
we haven't been able to ID him yet.

109
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,182
So for now, he's a John Doe.

110
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,976
Have the authorities
been notified yet?

111
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,979
Yeah, like over an hour ago.

112
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,775
Well, when he comes up from the ER,
best put him in a private room,

113
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,818
until we find out who he really is.

114
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,196
- All right, Doctor?
- Vaklav.

115
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,949
I'm filling in for Dr. Winfield.

116
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:54,957
His name is
Jonathan David Williams...

117
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,417
...though he goes by J.D.

118
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:02,381
He's my charge, a future whitelighter,
or he was supposed to be.

119
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,218
- Yeah, and?
- He disappeared in 1955.

120
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,887
I have heard nothing
from him since.

121
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,265
Not until he was hit by a car
this morning

122
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,975
and rushed to a hospital.

123
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,310
- Well, how old is he?
- The same age as he was then.

124
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,271
He hasn't aged a day.

125
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,690
I don't understand it either, Paige,
but I gotta believe

126
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:23,068
that whoever or whatever
made him disappear 50 years ago,

127
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,112
doesn't want him found now.

128
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,197
Which is why I need your help.

129
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,825
You're a whitelighter,
why don't you orb him to safety?

130
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,494
Many people have seen him,
it would raise too many questions.

131
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,372
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Help me get him out of there.

132
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,915
Maybe cast a little spell.

133
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,042
What, I'm the only witch you know?

134
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,753
- You are my daughter.
- Genetically, maybe.

135
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,132
I can't do this right now,
I'm late for a job interview, okay?

136
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,342
An interview?
Why do you need a job?

137
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,760
You're a witch, a whitelighter.

138
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,097
Maybe if you came around
more than once every three years,

139
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,099
you would know this
about your "daughter. "

140
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,476
Look, I'm sorry, Paige.

141
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,478
I just...

142
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,190
I didn't want to intrude.

143
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,775
Whatever, doesn't matter.

144
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,403
I'll call Phoebe,
see if she can help, okay?

145
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,780
Paige, can't Billie do it?

146
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,532
I'm kind of in the middle
of something,

147
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,951
and isn't she our magical go-to girl?

148
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,287
No, she was up all night
trying to find her sister,

149
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,122
which is why I was hoping that you...

150
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,166
Would you describe me
as gregarious?

151
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,627
No, I would describe you as evasive.

152
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,045
Where are you anyway?

153
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,714
I'm just exploring my options.

154
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,467
<i>- But don't worry, I'm not committing.
- Not committing to what?</i>

155
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:30,844
- How we doing?
- Oops, I gotta go.

156
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,804
Phoebe, Phoebe.
Who's gonna help Sam?

157
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,806
You know what, I don't know.
He's your dad.

158
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,725
No, he's not.

159
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,812
- Sorry.
- What'd she say?

160
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,317
Okay, here you go.

161
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,487
So, what's next?

162
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,822
Next we try to match you up
with the perfect donor.

163
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,658
Do you think I'm gonna get
to meet him?

164
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,203
This isn't a dating service,
Ms. Halliwell.

165
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,579
It's a sperm bank.

166
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,873
Right.

167
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,083
Right.

168
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,835
<i>I blame you for this, you know.</i>

169
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,004
You're the one that had
to open your big yap to Leo.

170
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,256
<i>Remember what happened</i>

171
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,591
<i>the last time we went
to marriage counselling?</i>

172
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,511
Jeez, I was just trying to help.
Don't go if you don't want.

173
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,221
Oh, no, we're going now.

174
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,182
Only this time, we're going to some
magical quack that Leo knows.

175
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,851
He's not a quack, he's a soothsayer.

176
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,061
Like I said. Which way?

177
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,106
So wait, you're not gonna help me
get Sam's charge out of the hospital?

178
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:26,567
No.

179
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,944
Why don't you try Agent Murphy?
Maybe he can help you.

180
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,697
If he had enough clout
to get our identities back,

181
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:33,615
<i>he should be able
to help you out with this.</i>

182
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,033
What about my job interview?

183
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,952
I don't know, don't ask me,
ask your dad.

184
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,787
He's not my...

185
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,291
Never mind.

186
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,334
Shall we go?

187
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,715
Any idea where this soothsayer
is hiding?

188
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:52,801
No, I just know
that he hangs out here.

189
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:56,847
Okay, and how exactly
do you know this guy?

190
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,349
From my whitelighter years.

191
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,559
Look, trust me, all right?

192
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:03,270
He's helped plenty
of magical couples over the years.

193
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,397
Leo, I don't know about this.

194
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,941
It's worth a try, isn't it?

195
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,402
Actually, you know what?
We've been through worse.

196
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,113
And we should be able
to fix this ourselves.

197
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,741
Okay, but we haven't, have we?

198
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:18,368
You know what? We're just
a little out of sync, that's all.

199
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,661
It happens.

200
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,664
There's nothing wrong with getting
some outside help once in a while.

201
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,166
We owe it to ourselves.

202
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:29,213
Flowers are not so much different
from marriages, really.

203
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,924
If you don't tend to them...

204
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,092
...nourish them...

205
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,261
...they wither.

206
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,773
Three-thirty is perfect.

207
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,401
Thank you so much for rescheduling,
I really appreciate it.

208
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,861
Okay, bye.

209
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,780
I don't understand
why we couldn't orb here.

210
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,698
- It would have been faster.
- Want my help?

211
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,368
- Drive like everybody else.
- We're not like everybody else.

212
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,245
- Speak for yourself.
- Paige?

213
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,288
Oh, sorry we're late,
really horrible traffic.

214
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,208
Of course,
that could have been avoided.

215
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,710
Sam, Agent Murphy.
Agent Murphy, Sam.

216
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,088
Long story short,
Sam's charge was hit by a car.

217
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:12,381
He's here in the hospital.

218
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:15,259
We need you to check him out
before something bad happens to him.

219
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,718
Wow, that was short.

220
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,805
Hold on a sec. Wait, your charge?

221
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,975
Sam's basically a guardian angel.
We call it a whitelighter.

222
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,644
- Like Paige is.
- But I wanna be a social worker.

223
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,771
But that isn't
what you were born to be.

224
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,773
Don't make me regret saving you
years ago.

225
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:31,483
You two related or something?

226
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,943
- No.
- Yes.

227
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,613
Anyway. Okay, we need you to get
J.D. Out of here as soon as possible

228
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,240
before this demon comes for him.

229
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,492
Demon? What demon?

230
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,286
I'll take it from here.

231
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,079
There's my charge, there's J.D.

232
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,587
Dirty boots.

233
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,672
Doctors don't wear dirty boots.

234
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,260
Freeze! Don't move.

235
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,901
What happened?

236
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:27,206
Okay, why would a demon
take him out of 1955

237
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,083
only to try to kill him now?

238
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,963
He must have gotten something out
of keeping J.D. Alive all these years.

239
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,882
Yeah, but what?
And why hasn't he aged?

240
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,885
That's creepy
even by our standards.

241
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,596
Now you know why I came to you.

242
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,932
Well, just heal him,
maybe he'll know something.

243
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,935
- No, I don't want him awake.
- Why not?

244
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:52,147
Because he'll wake up 50 years
in the future, that's why.

245
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,565
I don't want him to freak out.

246
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,192
He'll take off, I know him.

247
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,945
I barely got him to trust me
before he disappeared.

248
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,072
I thought you said
he was a future whitelighter.

249
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,782
Yeah, if I can keep him
out of trouble,

250
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,993
which I obviously haven't done
a very good job of.

251
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,622
Well, I've surrounded this room
with crystals so he's safe here.

252
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,083
It'll give us some time to figure out
who this demon is.

253
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,418
But how? We didn't get
a good look at him

254
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,504
and if there's nothing
in the "Book of Shadows... "

255
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:16,839
Agent Murphy
might have leads.

256
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,049
He told me this wasn't
the first case he'd heard of

257
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,301
where someone just vanished
into thin air.

258
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,388
What part of the government
does he work for exactly?

259
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:26,890
The super creepy part.

260
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,394
Look, he's helped us out
with some magical problems.

261
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,312
Okay, we trust him, he trusts us.

262
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,817
I'm gonna go talk to him,
see what he knows,

263
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,528
- and I'll call you, okay?
- The whitelighter way?

264
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,823
No, Sam, the regular way.
Answer the phone if it rings.

265
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,327
<i>Their wings old and tired,</i>

266
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,414
the two butterflies clung
to a broken branch.

267
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:53,167
And together,
they floated down the river,

268
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:59,464
each breathing life into the other
as they made their final journey home.

269
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,217
Yoo-hoo, anybody home?
Earth calling.

270
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,427
Come on,
give him a chance.

271
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:06,972
I have, for the last 52 minutes
and 23 seconds.

272
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,475
- So, what, that's it? Time's up?
- You think?

273
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,644
You stopped listening to each other.
It's common.

274
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,148
Look, I didn't wanna come here
in the first place, okay?

275
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,567
Our problems are not magical, Leo,

276
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,569
- they're normal.
- They were caused by magic,

277
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:22,613
- that's why we're here.
- No, we are here

278
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,741
because you didn't care what I wanted.
You just cared what you wanted.

279
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,743
How many times a day
do you have sex?

280
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,745
A day? What, are you crazy?

281
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:33,290
No wonder you wanted to see him.
Are you kidding me?

282
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,626
Really. Hang on.

283
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,464
Oh, shucks, look.

284
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,758
Family emergency, gotta go.

285
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:47,930
Just remember,
it is always darkest before the dawn.

286
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,165
What the hell?

287
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,544
- Leo?
- Piper?

288
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,716
Yup.

289
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,134
Nope.

290
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,053
Nope.

291
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,555
This one is not right either.

292
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,182
But we've been through
over 50 donor candidates so far.

293
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,393
Yeah, I know.

294
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,145
Maybe I'm just not being specific.

295
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,190
What I need is a little girl
with brown eyes,

296
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,734
sandy blond hair, little button nose,

297
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,362
that likes to save innocents,
you know.

298
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:48,699
Kicks butt,
works well in groups of three.

299
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:49,950
I mean, that's all.

300
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,119
- That's all?
- Yeah.

301
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,538
Miss Halliwell...

302
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,415
Oh, you know what,
call me Phoebe.

303
00:15:56,582 --> 00:16:00,085
And please, I mean,
we're talking sperm here, right?

304
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:01,628
Phoebe...

305
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,339
...I don't think specifics
are the problem here.

306
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:08,343
I mean, let's face it,
you have an incredibly specific image

307
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,846
of who you want your little girl to be.

308
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,015
Too specific, actually.

309
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,767
Oh, to be honest...

310
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,604
...she doesn't have to have
the little button nose, okay?

311
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,273
We specialize in helping
to create families here.

312
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,525
We're dedicated
to promoting an open approach

313
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,320
to helping anybody who wants
to start a family but can't.

314
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,197
And I totally respect that.

315
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,698
I mean, that's why I'm here.

316
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,366
But...

317
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,243
...we're not a substitute for love.

318
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,455
I've been doing this
a long time, Phoebe.

319
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:40,709
And I know from experience
that when someone can't find a match,

320
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,169
they don't really want to.

321
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,506
What they want

322
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,633
is outside these walls, not inside.

323
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,458
Paige, where are you?

324
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,545
Sam? Sam.

325
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,175
It's okay, J.D.

326
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,761
You just go back to sleep. You rest.

327
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,014
But what...

328
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,433
What happened?

329
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:42,688
Oh, God.

330
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:46,817
Close your eyes.

331
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,695
Go on.

332
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:51,697
Trust me.

333
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,086
I feel better.

334
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,173
How?

335
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,925
- What's going on?
- It's a long story.

336
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,052
But you still need to rest, okay?

337
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,888
It's important,
you've been through a lot.

338
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:19,349
Okay, but what happened?

339
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,894
Where am I? How'd I get here?

340
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,187
What do you remember?

341
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,064
Well, I remember
getting nailed by a car.

342
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,733
Before that.

343
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,738
I don't know, I...

344
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,909
I was at the drive-in.

345
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,621
<i>It was the middle of the flick
Rebel Without a Cause.</i>

346
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,290
I went to get a soda and...

347
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,000
- And what?
- I don't know.

348
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:49,087
Some creep
scared the hell out of me.

349
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,423
Took a flash photo, blinded me.

350
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,218
Next thing I know,
I'm inside somewhere and he's...

351
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,511
He's what?

352
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,055
What did he do?

353
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,893
Yeah, I must have bashed
my head in pretty good.

354
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,438
Stay put.

355
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:09,858
Piper, the soothsayer
must have done this for a reason.

356
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,528
I am not gonna spend the rest
of my life tinkling standing up.

357
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,280
Actually, guys don't tinkle, we...

358
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,950
Hey, you guys, will you knock it off?
You're driving me crazy.

359
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,993
Look, either you find the spell
to reverse this

360
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,913
or you find a magical
divorce attorney.

361
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:26,667
Hey, Sam, how's it going?

362
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,919
Wow, that's quite a handshake,
Piper.

363
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,838
That's because I am Piper
and that's Leo.

364
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:33,507
Yeah, it's a long story, don't ask.

365
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:36,802
We'll be upstairs,
we've got a few things to work out.

366
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,137
Gee, you think?

367
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,890
And Paige thought Billie
could help you.

368
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,101
- She's really good...
- Upstairs, mister.

369
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:50,899
So I'm pretty much caught up here

370
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,734
but I charge 10 bucks an hour
to babysit.

371
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,236
- Babysit?
- Yeah.

372
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,737
That's what I'm doing here,
right?

373
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:58,740
It's not exactly a demon hunt
but in for a penny, in for a pound, huh?

374
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,535
Okay, look, I need to find Paige.

375
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,203
I need you to look after J.D.

376
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,873
Do not let him out of the house.

377
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,958
If he finds out what year it is,
he'll go crazy.

378
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,043
Okay, fine,
I'll just cast a spell on him.

379
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,253
No, no spells.

380
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,755
He doesn't know anything
about magic, and he can't either.

381
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,008
He's had more than enough magic
used on him already.

382
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,552
Fine, 12 bucks an hour.

383
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,054
When you find Paige,
tell her I've a midterm to study for

384
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,140
and a sister to find.
She owes me big for this.

385
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,267
- This is so ri...
- Hey, baby.

386
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,856
What's shaking?

387
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,400
No charge.

388
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,540
What the hell is taking so long?

389
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,417
Where'd you come from?

390
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:51,835
- I just got here.
- Yeah, well,

391
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,379
- you wouldn't have if you'd orbed.
- I didn't want to orb.

392
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,256
Which is why I had to.

393
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,425
- J.D.'s awake.
- Who's with him?

394
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,636
Billie. I don't know how long
she'll keep him

395
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,054
from figuring out where he is.

396
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,056
Did he say anything
about what happened?

397
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:07,392
Not much, just that somebody
took a flash photograph of him.

398
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,727
Nearly blinded him.

399
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,939
Flash photo, huh?

400
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:15,651
Wasn't one of the last victims seen
with a photographer?

401
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:38,298
What a cool television.

402
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,927
Where are the ears?

403
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:43,470
The ears?

404
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,473
Yeah, you know. Antennas.

405
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,476
Oh, the antennas, right.

406
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,562
It doesn't... This thing's
been broken for ages.

407
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,730
Why don't we sit down and chat?

408
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,607
Boss.

409
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,318
Did you just say boss?

410
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,487
Are you from a different country
or something?

411
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,532
- No, why do you ask?
- Because you don't seem to know

412
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:06,535
much about ours.
Plus, the way you're dressed.

413
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,831
Yeah, okay, let's talk
about something else. So...

414
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,958
- Where are you from, J. D?
- Where's Sam?

415
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,752
Sam, he went out on an errand,
he'll be right back.

416
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,004
Hey, what are you doing?

417
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:20,424
What, you want one?

418
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,510
No. Hello? Cancer.

419
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,597
What are you talking about?

420
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:28,932
Oh, jeez.

421
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,143
- What is that?
- This is nothing.

422
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,187
This is just...
It's a new musical device.

423
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,564
My dad's an inventor.

424
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:40,360
- What's going on around here?
- Wait, J.D., I can explain.

425
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,321
Yeah? I'm listening.

426
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:46,366
Okay, well, maybe I can't explain,
or at least I'm not allowed to, but...

427
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,702
Look, all I can promise you
is that you're safe here.

428
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:50,996
Safe from what?

429
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,000
Oh, gee.

430
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,468
Where am I?

431
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,764
J.D., it's okay. No, wait, let me try...

432
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:10,390
Hold on.

433
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,267
Piper, Leo!

434
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,103
I cannot believe this.

435
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,192
So beautiful.

436
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,569
She was an angel.

437
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:27,866
I've racked my brain trying
to understand what happened.

438
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,743
Thirty years.

439
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,578
It all feels like yesterday.

440
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:38,544
I just hope and pray
that she'll come back to me again.

441
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:42,673
You mentioned in the police report
that you saw a flash of light.

442
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,092
Any idea what that was
or where it came from?

443
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,344
The camera, I assume.

444
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,055
She was having a picture taken
for her mother's birthday.

445
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,890
At a photography studio?

446
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,309
- Yes.
- Do you remember where that was?

447
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:57,896
It was somewhere over on Knob Hill
but it's not there anymore.

448
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:00,065
And that's the last you saw of her.

449
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,525
Yes.

450
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:03,068
What about the photographer?

451
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:04,820
Anyone ever track him down?

452
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:09,241
They tried, I tried,
but it's as if he disappeared too.

453
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,203
Your demon, maybe?

454
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,664
Think you can find that studio?

455
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,166
Yeah.

456
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,752
Excuse me.

457
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,757
She wanted to be a teacher.

458
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:30,596
She had such a good heart,
always helping others.

459
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,849
She sounds like a wonderful girl.

460
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:35,976
I still miss her.

461
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:41,356
A father never stops
loving his daughter.

462
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:49,948
Yeah.

463
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,284
All right, I gotta go, bye.

464
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:55,621
So it turns out that studio
used to be a few blocks away

465
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:57,581
from where your friend
was hit by that car.

466
00:24:57,748 --> 00:25:00,584
Which means the demon
might reopen for business.

467
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,127
What, taking pictures?

468
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:03,921
Stealing lives.

469
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,715
I think we should handle this.

470
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,467
What? Why?

471
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,720
Well, in case you don't remember,
firearms and fireballs don't mix.

472
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,306
Maybe we should call your sisters,
just in case.

473
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,850
I think I can handle
one lousy demon alone, thank you.

474
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,101
But what if you can't?

475
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:20,145
Oh, what,
are you worried about me?

476
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,940
We should get going.

477
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,778
What am I supposed to do?

478
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:41,416
Am I dead?

479
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,002
No, but you're gonna be
if we don't get out of here.

480
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:45,546
Unreal.

481
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,589
J.D., I'm telling you, okay,
we have to go.

482
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:49,007
We can't...

483
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:50,425
Did you see that?

484
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,761
It didn't make a sound,
like right out of "Buck Rogers. "

485
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:56,265
It's a hybrid. It runs on battery.

486
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:57,683
Battery, why?

487
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,394
Are you kidding?
With gas at three bucks a gallon?

488
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:02,896
Three bucks?
No way, it's like 25 cents...

489
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:10,821
Hey, it's okay, it's all right.

490
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:13,073
They're not gonna hurt you,
it's just a cop.

491
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,117
A cop?

492
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:16,577
I don't understand.

493
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:19,538
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

494
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:23,417
November 6, 2005,
but that's not possible.

495
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:24,793
Is it?

496
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,044
What else could it be?

497
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,507
Look, I know this is a lot to handle,
okay? I don't know what to tell you.

498
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:33,218
All I can say is Sam can explain this
to you in a safer place.

499
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:35,929
- So we should go.
- My dad.

500
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,556
I gotta see my dad.

501
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:43,562
Hey, watch the face will you, Leo?

502
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:44,813
I just got a peel.

503
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,733
Would you please just try
to find a spell to change us back?

504
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,985
I know what I'm doing, Piper.

505
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:52,571
People who know what they're doing
don't cause explosions.

506
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:54,740
You know, it's one thing
to have my wife

507
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:56,950
constantly criticize everything I do.

508
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,495
It's another thing when you do it
from my own body.

509
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:01,580
Well, since I figure
you'd never listen to me,

510
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:03,248
you might listen to yourself.

511
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:07,044
No romantic dinners,
no walks on the beach,

512
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:08,795
there is no way
I can be inseminated.

513
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:11,590
I tried, I just couldn't do it,
it didn't feel right.

514
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:13,467
- That's gross.
- No, what's gross

515
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:16,678
is me pushing the issue
because of some stupid premonitions.

516
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:19,640
You know? I want love first.

517
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,266
I want what you guys have.

518
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,101
Not today you don't. Trust me.

519
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,020
Why, what's going on?

520
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:27,523
Talk to your sister.

521
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,441
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

522
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,026
Did Wyatt switch you guys again?

523
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:34,279
No, it was a marriage counsellor.

524
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:38,826
Actually, it was a gardener,
and it was Leo's fault.

525
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:41,620
Okay, that's too weird.

526
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,455
Never mind, we'll figure it out.

527
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:45,707
How's Billie doing downstairs
with J. D?

528
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:49,962
- There's nobody downstairs.
- What?

529
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:56,301
Hey, are you all right?

530
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:58,303
They said that...

531
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,889
...my dad...

532
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,643
...just died.

533
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,146
Oh, God, J.D., I'm so sorry.

534
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:11,358
They said he was 93 years old.

535
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,571
Ninety-three, how could that be?

536
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,322
He had nobody left.

537
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,034
Not my mom, my brothers.

538
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,661
They said he buried me
50 years ago

539
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:25,414
even though he never stopped
looking for me.

540
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,668
I mean, how could he bury me?
I'm still alive!

541
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:32,254
I know, I know. We are gonna
figure this whole thing out.

542
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,174
Listen, look at me.

543
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:38,260
J.D., listen, you can trust me, right?
You know you can trust me.

544
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:42,222
I'm gonna tell you something you're
not gonna believe, but you have to.

545
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:45,517
It's the only way this whole thing
is gonna make any sense to you.

546
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:47,352
Okay.

547
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,690
What happened 50 years ago to you,

548
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:55,360
whatever is going on,
Sam is figuring that out.

549
00:28:55,527 --> 00:29:00,449
All I know is, whatever it is,
it has something to do with magic.

550
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:03,202
- Are you crazy?
- No, I'm not. It's real.

551
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:06,079
Okay, just like what the demon did
to you, that's real.

552
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,957
And that he's trying to kill you,
this is all very real.

553
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,795
Look, I know this is hard
to handle, okay?

554
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,881
Believe me, I'm new at this myself.

555
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:20,552
I just found out a week ago
that a demon kidnapped my sister.

556
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:24,556
Believe me,
I know what you're going through.

557
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,767
At least, I kind of know
what you're going through.

558
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:29,394
Just don't run away from me,
I can protect you from this.

559
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:31,063
I promise.

560
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,205
Anything?

561
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:49,790
No.

562
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:53,502
Maybe we should take something back
to try and scry for him.

563
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:57,756
Everything all right?

564
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,675
Can you feel that?

565
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:03,303
Feel what?

566
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:08,183
The pain, innocents.

567
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,435
I can sense them, they were here.

568
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:13,772
Future whitelighters,
that's what he's after.

569
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:16,942
This could be a trap,
you've gotta get out of here.

570
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:19,653
No, I'm not a future whitelighter,
I am a whitelighter.

571
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,196
But you're not embracing it.

572
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,782
Otherwise, you'd sense it too.
That makes you vulnerable.

573
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,117
No, that makes me sane.

574
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,327
Look, you've gotta stop
fighting this, Paige.

575
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,496
You gotta stop fighting yourself.

576
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:32,124
Whether you like it or not,
you are my daughter,

577
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,542
which makes you a whitelighter.

578
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:35,169
It's about time
you accepted that.

579
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,628
The hell it is.

580
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:39,965
Look, for your information,
my father, my real father,

581
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:41,842
the one who raised me, loved me,

582
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,136
and took care of me
until the day he died,

583
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:46,471
was a firefighter, not a whitelighter.

584
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:49,433
So how dare you show up here
and act like you're my dad.

585
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,310
Because I have news for you,
you're not.

586
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:05,407
Paige?

587
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:11,580
Daughters, they tend
to outlive their fathers.

588
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:12,831
Grieve longer.

589
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:17,336
Wait. Don't.

590
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:18,754
Smile.

591
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,856
Any luck finding J.D. And Billie?

592
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:40,234
No, because Leo won't let me try.

593
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,861
Because Piper's powers
are still in her body.

594
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:45,531
But the knowledge
of how to use them isn't.

595
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:47,783
Oh, yeah?
Wanna see me freeze you?

596
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,661
- Like you even know how.
- Okay, okay, okay.

597
00:31:50,828 --> 00:31:53,038
- What the hell is going on here?
- Well, first of all,

598
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:55,624
- we're in each other's bodies.
- Well, yes, obviously,

599
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,292
but the question is why.

600
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,378
Stupid gardener.

601
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:02,089
- He's a soothsayer.
- He's a quack.

602
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:03,882
Okay, well, whatever it is,

603
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:06,385
I think he knows exactly
what he's doing.

604
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:08,554
Come on,
every shrink wants couples

605
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,556
to walk a mile
in each other's shoes, right?

606
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,266
This guy just did it literally.

607
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,395
- Well, it's not working.
- Isn't it?

608
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,897
Look, you've only been
in Piper's body a few hours

609
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:21,441
and already,
you see what she has to juggle.

610
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:25,487
You know, being the breadwinner,
a mom, a Charmed One.

611
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:27,072
- See?
- And you.

612
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,866
You finally get a good understanding

613
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,243
what it feels like to be Leo
and not have any powers,

614
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,412
and to be married to a witch.

615
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,414
He has to do all the legwork
around here,

616
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:37,583
pick up all the slack,
it's a thankless job.

617
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,171
You guys have forgotten
how great you are together.

618
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,006
Everybody wants what you have.

619
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,925
Trust me, I want what you have.

620
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,428
Don't take it for granted.

621
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:53,265
She's right.

622
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:54,766
I know.

623
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:57,477
We need to find more time
to spend together, Piper.

624
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:58,687
Just the two of us.

625
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:00,856
- So we can talk.
- And listen.

626
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,821
- We're back.
- Oh, thank God.

627
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,114
Thank the shrink.

628
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:10,616
Now hurry up and find Billie.

629
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,453
There's no need for that.

630
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,206
J.D. Needs to talk to Sam.

631
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:23,629
What do you mean
he knows everything?

632
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:26,465
I thought Billie was supposed
to wrangle him.

633
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:30,552
Yeah, I'm here
but I'm not seeing Sam.

634
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:35,641
Well, just have J.D. Call him,
he's his charge.

635
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:38,101
All right, all right already.

636
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:40,020
Criminy.

637
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:43,982
Sam?

638
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:47,236
Looking for someone?

639
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:49,530
Who are you?

640
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:52,157
Well, not to be defined by my work,

641
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:55,744
but let's just say,
I like taking pictures.

642
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:57,955
Tripod.

643
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,501
Tell me where Sam is.

644
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:05,337
Oh, you love your father
more than you think,

645
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,923
which means
you'll miss him terribly.

646
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:11,093
You see, I'm an expert in pain.

647
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,303
It's my bread and butter, really.

648
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,514
I feed off it.

649
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:27,860
- What do you want?
- To keep my collage complete.

650
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:32,197
When J.D. Escaped,
I was forced to take Sam.

651
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:36,118
If you want
to see your father alive again,

652
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:37,578
bring me J.D.

653
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:42,791
We don't swap innocents,
the demon must know that.

654
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,877
Well, he wasn't after J.D.

655
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:47,504
He was just a loose end,
someone that got away.

656
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,548
Someone that he wants to finish off.

657
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:51,466
Well, he's got who he really wants.

658
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:54,136
- Sam.
- Yeah, thanks to me.

659
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:55,762
I should have listened to him.

660
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,598
Maybe you didn't want to.

661
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:02,227
Hey, what's the problem?
If he wants me, let him have me.

662
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:05,147
Well, the problem is,
he's gonna kill you.

663
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:06,899
I got away from him before, didn't I?

664
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:08,567
Yeah, how did you do that?

665
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:11,069
Something I learned from my dad.

666
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:12,362
Hey, it works every time.

667
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:14,239
No, not this time, it's too dangerous.

668
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:16,492
Well, it doesn't matter, I owe him.

669
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,076
He turned my life around.

670
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:21,079
I don't know what
I would have done without him.

671
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:25,626
Why don't we take this up to the attic
and see what Leo's come up with.

672
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,546
We'll be back.

673
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,132
Well, what about Sam?

674
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:34,343
Oh, they'll figure something out.

675
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:37,429
- Where do you think you're going?
- Where do you think?

676
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:39,097
Look, I can't let you...

677
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:42,434
Hey, you know
I can stop you this time.

678
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:47,105
Billie, I have to go.

679
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:49,107
You know, besides,
this isn't my time anymore.

680
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:50,442
What are you talking about?

681
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:54,279
Look, everyone I've ever loved,
ever known, is gone now.

682
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:55,781
I'm not supposed to be here.

683
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:59,535
- But you are here.
- Yeah, by some strange twist of fate.

684
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:01,620
My time has passed.

685
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:04,790
But Sam's still got a family,
he's still got friends.

686
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:06,458
He can still help people.

687
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,627
But you're here for a reason,
I believe that.

688
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:11,171
Well, maybe it was to do this.

689
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:12,881
To do good.

690
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:15,300
Or maybe it was just to meet you.

691
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:18,095
J. D...

692
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:19,847
Promise me something.

693
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:22,224
You won't waste your whole life
looking for your sister

694
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:24,142
like my dad wasted his
looking for me.

695
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:26,478
I don't understand. I don't...

696
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:45,539
I was lucky to know you, Billie.

697
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:55,340
Sam?

698
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:00,596
Sam.

699
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,851
You let Sam go. You got me now.

700
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,854
Still, I need Sam
to complete my collage.

701
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,856
Just like I needed you.

702
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,566
But not anymore.

703
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:15,777
- If you don't free him, the sisters...
- Will never find me.

704
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:20,699
Once I've taken care
of my last loose end.

705
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,717
Billie, it's not your fault.

706
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:40,844
Yes, it is.

707
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:43,055
I should have stopped him.

708
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:46,058
If you could have, you would have.

709
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:47,809
He didn't want you to.

710
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:49,686
It's just so unfair.

711
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:52,648
Why would J.D. Come back
after all this time just to die like this?

712
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:55,234
We can't save every innocent.

713
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,654
We're witches, not gods.

714
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:00,906
I promised to protect him.

715
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,493
Promises can be tricky.

716
00:38:04,827 --> 00:38:07,579
Sometimes, you just have
to let things happen

717
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:09,832
in their own time.

718
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:11,458
In their own way.

719
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:16,755
Everything happens for a reason.

720
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:24,012
Paige, you're not gonna find Sam
that way.

721
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:25,931
Oh, yeah? Watch me.

722
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:27,599
How do you know
he's even in the city?

723
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:29,726
You don't know who the demon is.

724
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:31,645
You're right.

725
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:35,732
You make a vanquishing potion,
the strongest one we've got.

726
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:40,404
You know, there is
another way to find Sam.

727
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:42,322
- Yeah, how?
- Call him.

728
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:44,950
I already tried that, thanks.

729
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,286
You called for Sam.

730
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,121
I think you need to call
for your father.

731
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:51,206
He's not my father.

732
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:54,918
He's not your only father,
but he is still, in fact, your father.

733
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:56,628
You're connected.

734
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:58,297
At least as a whitelighter.

735
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:02,634
Dad?

736
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:11,768
Paige.

737
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,986
Okay, everybody, let's back up.

738
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:23,155
We're gonna have some company.

739
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:27,576
Oh, I don't understand.

740
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:32,164
How did you free them?

741
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:35,334
I didn't. She did.

742
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:38,837
I guess my whitelighter side
is stronger than I thought.

743
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:48,180
- Smile.
- No!

744
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:57,898
I think I'll have this one framed.

745
00:39:58,357 --> 00:39:59,650
What about them?

746
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:16,792
You may as well show up.

747
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:20,003
I know you're lurking
around here somewhere.

748
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:24,550
Nothing wrong with those
whitelighter instincts of yours.

749
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:28,887
Figured you'd wanna talk.

750
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:32,266
Actually, I wanted to apologize.

751
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:34,142
For?

752
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,894
For being so hard on you.

753
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:38,897
- Paige, look, you don't have to...
- Actually...

754
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:44,236
...I do. I guess I hadn't
realized how much,

755
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:47,739
you know, it hurt me,
the whole not showing up thing.

756
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:51,076
I don't blame you.
I should have come by long ago.

757
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:54,329
But out of deference...

758
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:57,875
...to your real father's memory, I...

759
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,754
Not exactly sure how I fit in.

760
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:08,760
Well, I think there's room
for both of you in my life.

761
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:15,434
Agent Murphy managed to track down
all the innocents' families?

762
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:16,643
Yes, he did.

763
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,772
I think it's safe to say Mr. Sawyer
got the shock of his life.

764
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:22,691
It'll be a tough adjustment.

765
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:24,193
Better late than never.

766
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:26,904
Yeah, unfortunately, not for J.D.

767
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,697
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

768
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:30,407
Might have taken him
an extra 50 years,

769
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:33,619
but I think he finally managed
to prove himself a future whitelighter

770
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:37,039
by saving another, you.

771
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:40,834
See you around?

772
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:43,295
Definitely.
