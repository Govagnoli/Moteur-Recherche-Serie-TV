1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:06,798
You know, your time-travel section
is due for a serious overhaul.

2
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:10,719
I mean, I can find
more information Googling.

3
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,597
- Googling?
- Never mind.

4
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,809
Any luck with that spell yet?

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,978
You mean since the last
two minutes you asked me?

6
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,730
I'm just getting a little nervous here.

7
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,106
My birthday, it's in two days.

8
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,150
And if I'm not out of here
before I'm born...

9
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,611
Something bad that you don't
know about could happen?

10
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,446
I just don't wanna take any chances.

11
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:33,492
Besides, I came here and did what I
had to do, and that was to save Wyatt.

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,993
Now it's time for me to go home.

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,624
- Sooner than you might think.
- Oh, no.

14
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,210
- No, no, no. Not yet. You're early.
- Oh, relax.

15
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,129
I'm just getting a jump on things.
I'm not in labour.

16
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,507
I'm sending some stuff
back to the house.

17
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,843
Just don't scare me, okay?

18
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,678
What's the matter?
Isn't the spell ready?

19
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,347
I think it's ready.
This should work.

20
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,474
Should work? What do you mean?

21
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,476
There are no guarantees
with time travel, Leo.

22
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,728
You should know that
better than anyone.

23
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,317
Sorry. There's always a chance
that something might go wrong.

24
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,653
All right, we're not taking
any chances.

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,530
We might have to.
I'm running out of time.

26
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,740
No, I'm not sending you
through a one-way portal

27
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,409
unless I know
where you're gonna land.

28
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,827
Well, you can never be certain.

29
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,997
Unless, of course, you went too.
And even then...

30
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,835
All right, let's just forget the spell
and start to work on that potion again.

31
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:28,046
But the spell has a better chance
of working. It's the power of three.

32
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,798
Yes, but if something goes wrong,

33
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,884
he'll have extra potion
and he can come back.

34
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,844
I agree, it sounds safer.

35
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,846
So why don't you guys
get to work on that.

36
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,347
Paige, can you orb these home?

37
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,349
Just squeeze them
in the nursery or something.

38
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,893
Nursery.

39
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,021
- You did clean out the nursery, right?
- Yeah.

40
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,732
No. I was working on the spell,
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:50,986
Well, you better hurry, or else baby
Chris will be sleeping in your room.

42
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,322
Yeah, don't worry. I'm all over it.

43
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:58,869
- Okay.
- Don't forget diapers. Lots of diapers.

44
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,829
Okay, gotta get out of here.

45
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,343
They prepare to send the boy home.

46
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,350
It's time.

47
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:25,229
For our plan to work,
we have to get the sisters...

48
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,898
And Leo and Chris out of the way.

49
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,735
Don't worry, we will.

50
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,135
Okay.

51
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,514
Hello, Phoebe. Excuse me, Phoebe.

52
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,849
Hello.

53
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,809
Hey, Mrs. Noble, what's up?

54
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,146
What's up is you've parked
in my driveway again.

55
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,024
Yeah, unfortunately there's
nowhere else to park.

56
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,526
So I should suffer?

57
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,611
Piper's bringing home
the baby in a couple days,

58
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,946
and I did a little shopping.

59
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,907
This is getting to be a real problem.

60
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,617
You know what?
Just do me a favour.

61
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,661
Let me run inside
and put these bags down,

62
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,412
then I'll come outside
and move the car.

63
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,211
You called the patrol guy?

64
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,588
This is the third time
this week you blocked me.

65
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,591
Yeah, well, if your dumpster
didn't take up half the block,

66
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,052
then I wouldn't have to park
in your driveway.

67
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,471
This is against
neighbourhood-association rules.

68
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:05,889
Excuse me.

69
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:10,519
Can you write her a citation for that
ugly eyesore dumpster over there?

70
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,771
Homeowner's got a permit.

71
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:14,690
I don't have time for this.

72
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,157
Oh, look at how cute.

73
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,452
I remember when baby Wyatt
used to fit in here.

74
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,956
This is not cute.
This is the bassinet from hell.

75
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:35,794
- You know how to put this together?
- No, that would be a Leo thing.

76
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,589
I still can't believe
we're bringing home a baby.

77
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,091
Yeah, well, this baby's
not gonna have anywhere to sleep.

78
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,760
I know. What made us wait so long
to do this baby room?

79
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,763
We were busy trying to keep Wyatt
from turning evil.

80
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,517
Here, let me help you.

81
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,935
You know, which I'm glad we did.

82
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,563
But it just means that
he's gonna need a bedroom.

83
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,524
Yeah, well, even if he was evil,
we'd need another bedroom.

84
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,236
Yeah, but now with everybody coming
home, plus one, we're a room short.

85
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,654
I guess I can sleep
on the couch.

86
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,699
I just really think we need to focus
on the baby right now.

87
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,409
Well, and on getting Chris home.

88
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,077
Oh, remember him?

89
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,872
You know, the nephew?
The one you've been avoiding?

90
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,207
I am not.

91
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,585
Okay, so why weren't you helping
Gideon and I with the spell?

92
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,296
Because I was helping Leo
trying to find the burdock root.

93
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,798
It was very hard to find.
It's back-ordered everywhere.

94
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,844
You're right. You know what, we're just
gonna get Chris a new bassinet.

95
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,096
I'm gonna miss him too, you know.

96
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,600
It sucks.

97
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:36,730
I mean, I know he's going back
to a better future and all, it's just...

98
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,316
We're just getting to know him,
you know?

99
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,817
I know.

100
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,697
I forgot to move my car.

101
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:53,247
- Sheila.
- It's getting to be a habit, isn't it?

102
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,082
Me showing up a wreck.

103
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:02,214
I mean, we never fight,
that's the thing.

104
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,384
At least, we never used to.

105
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:10,931
But lately Darryl's just been
so on edge, you know?

106
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,432
Any idea why?

107
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,768
Actually, I was hoping
you might know.

108
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,478
Me?

109
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:20,357
I went to his work the other day,
just to say hi,

110
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,361
and I saw an arrest warrant
on his desk for Chris.

111
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,239
- Chris? Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

112
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,658
I even asked about it,
if he was gonna make it go away.

113
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,076
That's when he just lost it.

114
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,995
He told me to stay out of it,

115
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,414
and stay away from you girls
from now on.

116
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,168
Did something happen
that I don't know about?

117
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:42,671
A couple of weeks ago,

118
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,550
Darryl got really scared
when he was trying to cover up for us.

119
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:50,721
And we felt horrible, you know,
but obviously it really affected him.

120
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,806
Enough not to cover for Chris?

121
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,392
He got really scared.

122
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,062
Maybe you just need
to give him some time.

123
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,482
Yeah, but that doesn't help you
right now, and it doesn't help Chris.

124
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,447
Look, I love Darryl,
and I know this is eating him up inside,

125
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,782
but you girls are like family to us.

126
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,828
You don't turn your back on family.

127
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,212
I wonder how different
the future's gonna be.

128
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,340
How much different
my life is gonna be.

129
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,843
I just want you to get home safely.

130
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,888
Now, remember,
if anything seems different,

131
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,017
you have another vial of this
to get back right away.

132
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,855
You worry too much, you know that?

133
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,607
I'll be fine.

134
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,484
I'm your father.

135
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,069
It's my job to worry.

136
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,656
Listen, when you get back there,
take it easy on Wyatt, okay?

137
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:51,949
You can't hold a grudge.

138
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,160
Hey, as long as he's
not ruler of all evil, I'm cool.

139
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,912
I'm serious.

140
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,331
He's gonna be different. Good.

141
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,625
He's not gonna remember he wasn't.

142
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,378
If you really wanna change the future,
start with a clean slate.

143
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,172
Okay, okay. I get it.

144
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,924
How about you?

145
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,717
You starting with a clean slate?

146
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,886
- How do you mean?
- Like you and Mom.

147
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,933
I'd like to know where you two are
headed before I go back. That's all.

148
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,270
It's complicated. I'm an Elder.
I made a commitment.

149
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,689
So? It's not like you haven't
broken the rules before.

150
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:25,190
I'm living proof of that.

151
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,363
We'll see.

152
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,157
We have enough of this stuff,

153
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,577
if you wanna try a dry run
before everybody gets here.

154
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,953
What do you think?

155
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,416
Yeah. Let's do it.

156
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,761
That should have worked.

157
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,142
I'll get you home, buddy. I promise.

158
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,774
We're gonna figure this out.

159
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,235
You gotta keep your head up.

160
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,708
That potion almost certainly
would have worked.

161
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,294
We stopped them just in time.

162
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,839
Though it wasn't supposed to hurt.

163
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,679
Shall we?

164
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,440
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

165
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,027
At least now they'll be forced
to use our spell.

166
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,237
The sooner, the better.

167
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,032
Wyatt's magic grows stronger
by the day.

168
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:02,162
- That much power in one being...
- Is bound to turn him...

169
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,206
- Evil.
- Good.

170
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,044
We have to get those that protect him
out of the way.

171
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,171
Starting with Leo and Chris.

172
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,176
Gideon?

173
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,681
Hey, it looks like we're gonna need
that spell after all.

174
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,601
- Is there an echo in here?
- It's poor acoustics.

175
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,521
Have Piper gather her sisters
and I'll get the spell.

176
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,690
Okay. You know, I don't
understand what happened.

177
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:33,402
- That potion should've worked.
- Like I said, time travel is tricky.

178
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,445
You will still be escorting your son?

179
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,906
Well, I think so.
I think it's safest, don't you?

180
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,408
Absolutely.

181
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,702
Gather everyone together.
I'll be right along.

182
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,253
Here they come.

183
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:57,092
- Darryl. Hey, Darryl.
- Darryl, stop.

184
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,095
- We just need to talk to you.
- We have nothing to talk about.

185
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:03,974
Look, Chris is going home today,
to his future home.

186
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,475
Yeah, and we were hoping,

187
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,187
you know, that you could find it
in the goodness of your heart,

188
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,898
even though we know
that you're mad at us,

189
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,775
to, you know, just throw away
his file.

190
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,403
The one with the little
arrest warrant in it?

191
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,532
Apparently I haven't
made myself clear.

192
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:25,287
I am done covering for you. Done.
Now, excuse me.

193
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:26,622
Darryl, think about it, okay?

194
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,374
The cops are gonna come for Chris,
and what are they gonna find?

195
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,001
A little itsy-bitsy baby.

196
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,588
And then they're gonna find us,
which risks exposure.

197
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:39,426
Well, you should have thought of that
before you broke Chris out of jail.

198
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,181
Inspector Sheridan thinks that Chris'
breakout was an inside job.

199
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:47,267
Which, if I'm not careful,
could point back to me.

200
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,479
I've got a family to think
about too, you know. Great.

201
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,276
- Inspector Sheridan.
- Have you seen Chris lately?

202
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:57,986
Chris who?

203
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:00,280
When you have a minute.

204
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,289
At least Chris isn't gonna
have to deal with her in the future.

205
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,503
- Where are Phoebe and Paige?
- I'm sure they'll be here soon.

206
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,713
Soon? Soon is when
Dad and I have to go.

207
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,215
Dad? What do you mean...?

208
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,842
Wait, you're gonna go too?

209
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,719
Just long enough to make sure
he gets where he needs to be.

210
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,430
And when exactly were you
gonna tell me about this?

211
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,307
I told him he didn't have to come.

212
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,309
- I don't need him.
- No, it's too dangerous.

213
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,521
Last time you went through a portal,
you were almost dinosaur kibble.

214
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,274
- I have to go.
- You're right, it is dangerous.

215
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,027
But not as dangerous as leaving
Wyatt alone while I'm in labour.

216
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,780
I'll be back. I promise.

217
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,328
Sorry, I just wanted to go over
the spell one more time.

218
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,831
- Make a few tweaks.
- Tweaks? Let me see that.

219
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,420
Finally. Where have you two been?

220
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,630
Sorry, we were a little held up.

221
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,008
But we're here now,
so let's get this show on the road.

222
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,844
You know, the clock's a-ticking.
Ticktock, ticktock.

223
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,013
Since when are you in such a hurry
to say goodbye?

224
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,808
Well, since something happened with
the thing and the thing with the thing.

225
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,773
There's a warrant out
for Chris' arrest.

226
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,235
- What?
- Yeah, tried to get Darryl to bury it,

227
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,613
but he's not really
on our side anymore.

228
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,741
This is bad. If I leave and they
can't find me, they'll come after you.

229
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,994
That's okay. We've been through
worse, we'll get through this.

230
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,079
We'll figure it out.

231
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:35,083
And if you get back to the future and
we're in jail, you just bust us out.

232
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:44,176
You just go back to that beautiful,
peaceful world that you helped create.

233
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,225
- I'm really gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.

234
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,937
Here comes the hugging part.

235
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,951
Thank you for coming here.

236
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:12,955
I love you.

237
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,957
I love you so much, Mom.

238
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:20,128
Now, go on. Hurry. And be safe.

239
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,300
- Thanks for all your help.
- You did a noble thing in coming here.

240
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,471
Be good.

241
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,434
In this place and in this hour

242
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,312
We call upon the ancient power

243
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,857
Open the door
Through time and space

244
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,776
Create a path to another place

245
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,968
Where are we?

246
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,019
I have no idea.

247
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,322
Something's gone wrong.
Don't let them leave.

248
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,414
Are you out of your mind?

249
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,666
Follow me.

250
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,712
- What the hell was that all about?
- I'm not sure.

251
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:47,424
You're not sure? Chris just tried
to kill me and you're not sure?

252
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,301
We were supposed
to send him to the future,

253
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:50,802
not turn him into a darklighter.

254
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,846
Excuse me, people,
those were black orbs.

255
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,723
Where did they get black orbs from?

256
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,352
Okay, breathe. Breathe, Piper.
You don't wanna go into labour yet.

257
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,561
Well?

258
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:02,439
Well, perhaps the spell
wasn't specific enough.

259
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:03,899
Meaning what?

260
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:08,779
Meaning it worked, obviously,
it opened up a portal,

261
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:13,575
not to another time,
but to another world.

262
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,118
A parallel world.

263
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:19,873
And not just any parallel world,
one that's the exact reverse of ours.

264
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,044
- Reverse like what, reverse like evil?
- Precisely.

265
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,381
You see, it's all part
of a grand design.

266
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:31,009
A universe destined
to maintain balance.

267
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:35,931
Light and dark, yin and yang,
good and evil.

268
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,100
For good to prevail in this world,

269
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,603
then an equally evil world
must also exist.

270
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,565
- That's quite a faulty design, isn't it?
- No, it's not, Paige.

271
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,066
Balance is everything.

272
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,652
Without it, the cosmos doesn't spin.

273
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:52,865
Are you telling me that when our
Leo and Chris stepped in there,

274
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,409
their evil selves stepped out?

275
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,161
Yes, it's a mirror world.

276
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,246
Whatever happens there,
happens here.

277
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,748
So our Leo and Chris
are in their evil world.

278
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,501
- Well, we gotta go get them.
- You can't go get them.

279
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:05,752
You're not going anywhere.

280
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,047
Besides, what about those evil fellows
that just came through here?

281
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,382
We'll go get them later.

282
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,886
Actually, I think you should
go after them now.

283
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,179
Why?

284
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,765
Because for every second
that they're in our world,

285
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,352
they risk throwing off the balance
by doing something evil.

286
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,071
You ever see anything so good?

287
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,615
It's disgusting.

288
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,493
Can you believe the liquor stores
are closed in the mornings here?

289
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:38,744
What's up with that?

290
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:42,080
Didn't stop you from
kicking down the door to get in.

291
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,957
Why didn't you orb in?

292
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,210
What's the fun in that?

293
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:54,092
Strange. Everything seems the same
but kind of different, you know?

294
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:58,055
It's cleaner, it's happier,
it's more civilized.

295
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,599
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

296
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,685
This place makes me sick.

297
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:05,479
I gotta get out of here.

298
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:09,525
Gives you an idea of what kind of
awful saccharine future I came from.

299
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,735
Why I had to come back
and change it so bad.

300
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:14,571
And I'll always be
proud of you for that.

301
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:18,534
You saved Wyatt from turning good.

302
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,828
You gave us a second chance.

303
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:24,790
The least I could do is get you back
to your future, back to evil.

304
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,500
Thanks, Dad.

305
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,086
First we gotta get back
to our world, though.

306
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:30,754
We're gonna need
the power of three.

307
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:34,842
Well, we can't trust those
Pollyanna witches, they're too good.

308
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:40,013
God, who do I have to kill
so we can get out of here?

309
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,267
I think I might know somebody.

310
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,188
Somebody we can use
to force the sisters to help us.

311
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,321
I don't understand. If they're
just like our Leo and our Chris,

312
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,032
then why do we need
a crystal cage to trap them?

313
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,285
So they don't try to kill us again,
for one thing.

314
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,370
Yeah, I don't think they
were trying to kill us.

315
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,998
I think that they were
just surprised, like we were.

316
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:09,001
Yeah, well, I am not taking
any chances.

317
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:11,420
- Hey, did you get any hits yet?
- No, nothing.

318
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,672
They must not be
doing anything evil.

319
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,302
Yeah, well, if Gideon's right,
it's just a matter of time.

320
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:22,264
Besides, we wouldn't want the cosmos
to stop spinning, would we?

321
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:25,100
It's so weird to think that there
are evil twins of us out there

322
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,394
doing the exact same thing
as we are right now.

323
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:30,397
I can't think about that.
It hurts my brain.

324
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,108
I got them.

325
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,741
What the hell's wrong with you?
I'm a cop.

326
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,494
- Pretty wimpy-looking one, too.
- Nothing like our Darryl.

327
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,414
I think that's the cheapest suit
I've ever seen.

328
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,042
What's the matter, huh?
Girls not paying you enough?

329
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,336
Paying me?
What has gotten into you?

330
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:55,589
Let's just say I don't like you
coming at me in either world.

331
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,553
This almost isn't any fun.

332
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,725
I don't care if you are under
some kind of spell.

333
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,477
Come any closer, I'll shoot, I swear.

334
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,063
Gun.

335
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,194
- Now, this is fun.
- Not yet.

336
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:19,154
We still need him for leverage.

337
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:21,156
He's no good to us dead.
Not yet, anyway.

338
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,124
See, this is
the crazy-ass kind of stuff

339
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,044
that makes me not wanna have
anything to do with you people.

340
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:36,004
- Who are you talking to?
- Us.

341
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:40,551
That's not gonna stop us.

342
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,178
No, but this will.

343
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,474
- Son of a bitch.
- No.

344
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,728
Nice firepower, Leo.
I didn't know you had it in you.

345
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,189
Don't go anywhere.

346
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,318
- Stay away from me.
- Let us take you to Gideon.

347
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,612
- He can heal you.
- No. Stay away.

348
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:03,407
- Darryl, please.
- I said, no, damn it. Leave me alone.

349
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:06,493
I don't wanna have anything to do
with you anymore, do you understand?

350
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:11,456
Well, I don't think
that helped our cause any.

351
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,546
My Charmed Ones
will be joining you soon.

352
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:20,591
- Are you certain you can keep...
- Mine away?

353
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,593
Absolutely.

354
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,261
I told them to wait at the manor

355
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:27,806
for the good Leo and Chris
to come to them.

356
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,225
I'm taking your knight.

357
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:36,440
I knew you'd do that.

358
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:42,487
- So the next move, of course, is...
- Piper.

359
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,991
Once she's in labour,
we'll have a clear shot at the boy.

360
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:49,620
If we impress upon her the extent
of the danger her sisters are in...

361
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:53,040
- It will expedite matters.
- But everything has to happen quickly.

362
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:57,127
We're tinkering here with the grand
design, risking its tenuous stability.

363
00:22:57,294 --> 00:23:01,381
By creating an imbalance of power
on one side, I know.

364
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:05,135
But it's a far greater risk
to allow Wyatt to grow up...

365
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:08,472
To threaten both worlds. I agree.

366
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:18,941
I like the way you think.

367
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,902
Gideon?

368
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,614
- No echo.
- A good sign.

369
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,536
They can never know
we were behind this.

370
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,996
They won't.

371
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,462
Did you catch them?

372
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,297
Yeah, stuck them in a classroom.

373
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,174
And, you know, they can't
orb out of there.

374
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,510
They're a little feistier
than the real Chris and Leo.

375
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,804
I don't know how we're
gonna get them to cooperate.

376
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:51,056
Yeah. Well, I'm sure
your evil counterparts

377
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,350
are anticipating exactly
the same problem,

378
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:56,061
since, other than morality,
you're one and the same.

379
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,856
How does that help us figure out
what we're supposed to do?

380
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,776
Perhaps you should
trade yourselves.

381
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,320
You go into their world,
they'll come into ours.

382
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:08,031
You can each retrieve
your respective Leo and Chris.

383
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,784
Kind of makes sense.

384
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,537
And what about
your evil counterpart?

385
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,289
Will he be hip to this plan?

386
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:20,169
I have every confidence that he will
be waiting there exactly as I am here.

387
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:25,090
But remember, good or evil,
we're all after the same thing:

388
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:29,678
Leo and Chris returned
and the cosmic balance restored.

389
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:31,805
Get Piper.

390
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,058
We're gonna need
the power of three.

391
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,536
Okay, where is everybody?

392
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:57,539
Isn't Piper supposed to be here?

393
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:58,749
This is weird.

394
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,584
I don't think we should be here.

395
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,586
We should get out of here.

396
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:08,967
What are you doing?

397
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:12,137
You're not supposed to be here.

398
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:18,936
Why didn't they come through?

399
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,230
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

400
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:28,153
Easy. Piper, try to relax.

401
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,407
We wouldn't want you to go into
premature labour, now, would we?

402
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:45,254
You have no idea what you've done.

403
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:51,009
By coming here, you may have thrown
both worlds irreversibly out of balance.

404
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:54,012
Okay, well, doesn't killing us
sort of do that too?

405
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:57,724
Don't be ridiculous.
If I'd wanted to kill you, I would have.

406
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,353
I was just caught off-guard.

407
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,231
Well, you need to relax there, tiger.

408
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:08,193
It's a different world here, Pheebs.

409
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:11,029
One filled with distrust.

410
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:13,907
Even amongst allies.

411
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,910
I don't understand.
Where are your Paige and Phoebe?

412
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,997
Out looking for your Leo and Chris.

413
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:21,665
They were supposed
to bring them here.

414
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:25,961
Well, your Leo and Chris are at our
magic school waiting to be rescued.

415
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:28,672
Yes.

416
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:30,966
Okay, this is just one big mess.

417
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:34,303
What happened to the whole
yin-yang business?

418
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:35,804
It's been thrown off.

419
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:39,766
Possibly as a result of
the exchange of Leo and Chris.

420
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:45,147
Two worlds that mirror each other
when they're in balance.

421
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,691
And they no longer are.

422
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:51,820
Okay, if it's already bad, what's
gonna happen now that we're here?

423
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,822
With both sets of sisters
on the same side,

424
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:55,782
the balance is dangerously at risk.

425
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,827
We have to work quickly to correct it.

426
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:02,915
If you are suggesting a plan, don't.

427
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:04,958
We've got it covered.
You don't worry about it.

428
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,376
We need to find his Piper.

429
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,630
If you do, she'll probably kill you.
She's evil, remember?

430
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,841
And she's got a terrible temper,
worse when she's pregnant.

431
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,303
Yeah, that's not much
different in our world.

432
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,555
- Trust us, we can handle it.
- Yeah.

433
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:21,850
Your instincts are right
to distrust me.

434
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:24,728
I am evil, after all.

435
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,023
But we both want the same thing.

436
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:30,484
There's a little problem with that,

437
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:33,028
because your girls didn't uphold
their end of the bargain.

438
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:36,990
- They did not find our guys.
- But you will.

439
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:39,201
You know them.

440
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,703
Know how they think.

441
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:46,875
Okay, so we're gonna bring you
your Chris and Leo, and then what?

442
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:49,336
You'll have our Piper
for a power of three spell.

443
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,464
She'll know it's the only way
to get her men back.

444
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:56,009
And if you encounter
your counterparts, be careful.

445
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:57,845
They will kill you.

446
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:13,277
- Give it up, lady.
- Hey, my purse. Come on.

447
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,038
Okay, this place isn't just evil,
it's ugly.

448
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,874
Oh, I don't think they're home.

449
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,418
And I don't wanna go in there
to find out.

450
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:32,129
The Charmed Ones working for evil.
Who would have thunk it?

451
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:35,424
Well, I'm with you,
especially after Gideon's little warning.

452
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:37,926
Hey!

453
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:43,265
I don't think Chris and Leo would
have gone into that house either.

454
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:46,226
Maybe they went to see Darryl,
like their counterparts did.

455
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:47,936
I think we should talk to Darryl.

456
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:50,606
I don't think if Darryl wants to talk
to us in the good world,

457
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,566
he's not gonna talk
to us in the evil world.

458
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:55,527
That's it. Come on, come on.
That's it. Hey.

459
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:06,580
Hey, maybe he will
if he thinks we're them.

460
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,665
Okay, I really think we need
to get out of here.

461
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:10,042
What are you doing?

462
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:12,544
Let's see if this works
in the parallel world.

463
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:14,588
It does.

464
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:17,883
Hi, can I have Lieutenant Morris,
please?

465
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,092
Hey.

466
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:22,596
Lady, you want me to give her a
second citation, it's gonna cost you.

467
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:25,182
Why, you greedy son of a...

468
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:28,352
- Haven't I given you enough already?
- Hey, don't give me that.

469
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,937
Hey, leave her alone.

470
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:36,193
I wasn't really gonna
give you that citation.

471
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:46,870
We must be some badass
witches in this world.

472
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:51,750
Yeah, remember that for when
we meet up with badass Darryl.

473
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,406
Well, looks like everybody's
enjoying themselves.

474
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:24,199
Including Darryl.

475
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:30,914
Okay, just remember,
we're used to this.

476
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:35,544
Right. Think mean, think nasty.

477
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,216
Hey.

478
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:45,345
It's all right, let them through.

479
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:49,057
I knew you'd show up
sooner or later.

480
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:50,601
How's Sheila?

481
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,940
It's all right, honey.
I'll be here all night.

482
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:00,861
Sheila who?

483
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,953
Leo and Chris, where are they?

484
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:12,831
Where are they?

485
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:16,293
Last time I saw them,
they were at the police station.

486
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,338
Me and my boys were trying
to give Chris what he deserved.

487
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,673
But Leo orbed him away.

488
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,675
Never seen them run
from a fight before.

489
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:25,552
- Where'd they go?
- If I knew,

490
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,262
you think I'd be here waiting for you?

491
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:30,891
Where you been, anyway?
Undercover in the underworld?

492
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:33,810
- Why?
- Bright, happy colours?

493
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:35,771
Not exactly your style.

494
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,982
Get away from me. I don't want
Sheridan to see me with you.

495
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:40,400
She's been all over my ass.

496
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:53,372
Don't get up.

497
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:56,750
Now what?

498
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:59,086
I think maybe we're looking
at this all wrong.

499
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:00,963
Maybe we all are.

500
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,256
Come again?

501
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:07,052
Well, listen, if Darryl won't help
Leo and Chris because he's evil,

502
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:10,055
then they'd have to go to someone
who's good, right, to help them?

503
00:32:10,222 --> 00:32:13,350
Okay, yeah. But who's not evil here?
Where are the good guys, they hiding?

504
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:15,727
Yeah, in the underworld.

505
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:19,648
Think about it.
Reverse it, who's good here?

506
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,066
Demons.

507
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:23,277
Right. And if I know Leo,

508
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:28,365
he would have gone after the
most powerful good demon there is.

509
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,493
You're right.

510
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:36,498
I know the truth of all your hopes

511
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:41,211
because I can feel your
greatest hope inside here:

512
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:44,339
The hope to one day return home.

513
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:49,344
Oh, and of course your presence
here gives me great hope.

514
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:54,600
The hope that someplace there
really is a different kind of world.

515
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:57,936
A world where the greater good,

516
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:03,609
the goodness of the heart, prevails.

517
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:09,364
- Is he for real?
- He must be.

518
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:13,452
Demon of fear in our world
must be the demon of hope here.

519
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,913
Question is, do you have
enough power to send us back?

520
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,832
Oh, alas, no, I do not.

521
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,835
Not if you were brought here
by the power of three.

522
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:26,840
But, however, hope springs eternal.

523
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:31,595
So I may be able to persuade
the sisters of my world to help us.

524
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:35,224
All simply by relying...

525
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,810
...on their greatest hope:

526
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:42,105
The hope to reunite
with your counterparts.

527
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:45,817
And then...

528
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:52,157
...maybe you will be able to return

529
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,910
to your time before it's too late,
as you hope.

530
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:56,829
Don't touch me.

531
00:33:58,247 --> 00:33:59,748
Oh, thank God.

532
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:02,000
Quickly, orb away.

533
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,419
I will deal with them.
I've done it before.

534
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:06,713
No, that's okay.
They're the good ones.

535
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,258
Trust us, they're not evil.

536
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:11,552
No, but we are.

537
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,269
Breathe, dear. In long, out short.

538
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:24,356
One in, three short.

539
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:26,859
In, three out.

540
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,610
Where are my sisters?

541
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,905
Gideon's trying to find them, dear.
Just try to focus on the breath.

542
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,115
In...

543
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,827
- What happened?
- Her water's broke.

544
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:38,245
She needs to get to a hospital.

545
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,247
- Did you find them?
- No, not yet.

546
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:43,083
But you can't wait any longer.
It's not safe.

547
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,418
Go, hurry.

548
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:46,920
Somebody has to stay with Wyatt.

549
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:54,845
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

550
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,487
- Nice knuckles. Brass?
- No, Tiffany's.

551
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:15,449
- What a waste of a nice blue box.
- What did you say, witch?

552
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:17,784
Okay, look, we didn't
come here to fight.

553
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,704
- We just came to get Leo and Chris.
- Well, so did we.

554
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:23,248
Fine, you give us ours,
we'll give you yours.

555
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:25,709
Right, like we can trust you.
You're good.

556
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:29,046
Wait, you can't trust us?
Who are the evil ones here?

557
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:30,923
Come on, ladies.

558
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:34,259
Have some hope.
We can work this out peacefully.

559
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:35,886
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

560
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:38,055
We'll take care of you later.

561
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:41,892
We're gonna have to make a move.

562
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:43,936
The longer the worlds
are out of balance...

563
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:47,189
- The worse the damage is.
- We have to get everyone back.

564
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:49,316
Problem is there's no talking
to those witches.

565
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:51,109
I wish I could just vanquish them.

566
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:53,570
Me too, but that'll really
screw up the balance.

567
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:55,072
We're gonna have to settle for...

568
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,991
Knocking them out so we can
get Leo and Chris out of here.

569
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:00,369
Good.
We'll orb out and grab them...

570
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:01,703
- From behind.
- Perfect.

571
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,674
- That sucked.
- All right. I'll take mine, you take yours.

572
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:22,641
Arrow.

573
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:23,892
Arrow.

574
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,576
Arrow.

575
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,287
- Rock.
- Rock.

576
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,039
Get down.

577
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,543
No one can win.
They're too evenly matched.

578
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,919
Well, they think alike.

579
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,006
- Boulder.
- Boulder.

580
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:55,841
No, no.

581
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,519
We don't have time for this.
I gotta get back and get you home.

582
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:10,772
When Gideon said something could go
wrong, I don't think he knew how wrong.

583
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:14,193
- You said Gideon?
- Yeah, why?

584
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:18,864
Because just maybe he did know
how wrong it could go.

585
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:36,590
That won't protect you for long,
my boy.

586
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:38,550
Not for long.

587
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:57,736
Boulder.

588
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:04,368
What do you mean?
Gideon is after Wyatt?

589
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:09,039
He was desperately hoping
to eliminate Wyatt.

590
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:29,226
- Piper. Hello?
- Piper. Hello?

591
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:32,104
Where the hell are you?
I'm in labour.

592
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:33,939
Get your ass down here.

593
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:36,400
- Is she okay?
- She's in labour.

594
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:39,444
Who's that? You've got an echo.
What the hell is going on?

595
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:41,572
- I'm on my way.
- I'm on my way.

596
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,701
- We have to go get Piper.
- And Wyatt.

597
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:53,917
Wanton powers in this blade, yield

598
00:38:54,334 --> 00:39:00,174
Penetrate that which would shield

599
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:27,034
I'm truly sorry,

600
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:30,370
but this is for the greater good.

601
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:51,600
We call upon ancient lore

602
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:53,519
To punish with the power of four

603
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:56,063
Strike down this threat
From both there and here

604
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,775
Make him suffer and disappear

605
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:03,779
- Wyatt, thank God.
- Wyatt, thank God.

606
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:15,541
Did you give that bad man Gideon
those wounds?

607
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:18,710
Well, looks like Wyatt
can handle himself.

608
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:22,381
Yeah, but for how long?

609
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:24,341
Gideon's one of the most
powerful Elders.

610
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:26,218
If he wants him dead,
he'll find a way.

611
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:28,595
- I can't believe it was Gideon.
- He's still out there.

612
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:31,181
If he wasn't vanquished here,
he wasn't in our world either.

613
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,310
What we need to do is get everybody
back in the right place.

614
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:39,064
- Fix this whole nutty balance...
- Fix this whole nutty balance thing.

615
00:40:40,524 --> 00:40:41,859
I'm with you.

616
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,735
We don't have the power of three.

617
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:46,738
- No, but we do have...
- The power of four.

618
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:02,421
At least we're still alive.

619
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:05,382
Only because we barely
made it back here in time.

620
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:07,593
Still, we healed each other
and we can try again.

621
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:09,970
Especially now that we can
breach Wyatt's shield.

622
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:12,389
But the sisters know about us now.

623
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:14,892
Worse, the imbalance has caused
a shift in both worlds.

624
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:17,060
Which we should be able
to use to our advantage

625
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:20,063
to distract them
whilst we complete our task.

626
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:26,487
We created the imbalance,
we should be able to repair the shift.

627
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:30,449
And when we do, we'll make sure
that the sisters forget everything.

628
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:39,750
Here's my brave little guy.

629
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:43,295
Quick, the portal's closing.
We gotta get their men through.

630
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:45,130
I'll get them.

631
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:46,965
Hey, buddy. I gotcha.

632
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:49,760
Okay, if the evil Piper's in labour,
our Piper must be too.

633
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,638
- We gotta get to the hospital.
- Okay, we have to get the bag.

634
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,442
- Hey there. How you doing?
- Hi.

635
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:08,070
Okay, this is really strange.

636
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:13,033
- Hi, neighbour.
- Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo, ladies.

637
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,119
Yoo-hoo. I've been waiting for you.

638
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:19,164
Mrs. Noble, hi.
I was just coming out to move the car.

639
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:23,585
Oh, no, you're a busy,
busy, busy girl.

640
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:28,382
Yeah, see, it's our sister, Piper,
she's in labour. We're all a little crazy.

641
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,843
And I won't park there again,
I promise.

642
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:33,595
That's right. I know you won't.

643
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:38,684
Wrongs must be righted.

644
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:41,061
Help!

645
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:43,188
Have a super day.

646
00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:46,150
Help! Help, somebody. Help!

647
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:49,153
Please. Someone?

648
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,698
Someone, help.
Please, someone.

649
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:54,408
Someone?

650
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:56,451
Help, someone, help!

651
00:42:56,618 --> 00:43:00,414
Leo. Leo!

652
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:02,040
Someone help!

653
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:04,042
Please, someone!

654
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:06,044
Leo!
