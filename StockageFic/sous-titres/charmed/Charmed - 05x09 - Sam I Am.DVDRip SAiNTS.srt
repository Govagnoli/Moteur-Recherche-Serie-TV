1
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,555
You're mad. I'm late, I know.

2
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,140
Oh, God, no, not at all.
Don't worry about it...

3
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,768
Good, because I'd hate to spend
the weekend in Big Sur arguing.

4
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,897
- What?
- You and me. Driving down the coast.

5
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,899
Radio on, top down.

6
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,861
All you have to do is say yes.

7
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,906
That sounds really great, but...

8
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,534
But that's not a "yes."

9
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:20,831
It's just that this isn't
really going to work.

10
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,793
Okay, we could reschedule.

11
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,922
Not the weekend, us.

12
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:32,718
I'm really sorry.

13
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,973
Yeah, me too.

14
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,642
Oh, there he goes.

15
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,562
I really thought that one
was a keeper.

16
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,648
Why? Because he was
cute and funny

17
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,151
and oh, yeah, don't let me
forget, deliciously yummy?

18
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,278
That's the second guy
in a row she's dumped.

19
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,572
Third. But who's counting?

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,490
So do you think she has
commitment issues

21
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,451
or do you think she's
just too picky?

22
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,162
I don't know. I'd love to speculate,
but I gotta go.

23
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,625
Piper, if you haven't noticed, The
Flaming Lips are playing at your club.

24
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,918
My... My favourite group.

25
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,879
I know, that's why you're not gonna
scare them when you go backstage.

26
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,088
- Okay?
- Okay.

27
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,883
I gotta go home because I gotta
interview magical nannies tomorrow

28
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,052
- and I gotta prepare.
- Wait, magical nannies?

29
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,887
You mean like Mary Poppins?

30
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,388
One could only hope, but no.

31
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,600
Leo has arranged for us to
meet supernatural creatures

32
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,602
that have child-care experience.

33
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,271
- Creatures?
- And it's not like I can call a service

34
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,815
and ask for a nanny to watch over
my little Charmed One

35
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,026
while I go off and
slay slimy demons.

36
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,570
That's a good point.
But don't you think it's a little early

37
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,198
for you to be looking for nannies?
You're not even showing yet.

38
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,742
- Except for your boobies.
- I'm telling you, they are large

39
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,702
and they are definitely in charge.

40
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:45,666
But at least something is normal about
this pregnancy. Okay, I'll see you.

41
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,543
I just... Can... Can l...?

42
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,131
- Breaking up is such a downer.
- Yeah, honey,

43
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,425
well, practice makes perfect.

44
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,264
Well, you know,
I mean if it's not right, it's not right.

45
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,016
Why wasn't it right?

46
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,562
I don't know, I could just kind of tell
it wasn't really going anywhere

47
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,064
so I thought I'm gonna
cut this one off at the pass

48
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:13,193
before it gets messy
and he likes me too much.

49
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,946
Okay. If you say so.

50
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,117
At least you don't have to worry
about if he's gonna attack again.

51
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:24,079
- Is that some sort of Cole segue?
- Well, now that you mention him...

52
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,082
...he hasn't contacted me in a while.

53
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,750
That's a good thing, right?

54
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:32,588
Yeah, it is for me. I'm just worried
about the rest of humanity, you know.

55
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,757
Cole doesn't just do nothing,
which means he's up to something.

56
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,468
And now that he knows that
we're definitely not together anymore,

57
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,096
I'm afraid that "something"
might be evil.

58
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,361
Get out of the way!

59
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,573
Where do you think you're going?

60
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,493
You're not going anywhere.
Get down!

61
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,246
Nobody move! Everybody get
their hands where I can see them!

62
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,415
Let's go!

63
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,253
All your valuables, all your money!
Hurry up! Watches, wallets...

64
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,346
Come on, nothing's changed.
Give me the money! Hurry up!

65
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,441
Hey, what's going on here?

66
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,953
We've been waiting
for this moment, Cole.

67
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,248
Yes, welcome.

68
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,645
Hey, lady! I'm trying to make
a good impression here.

69
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,314
Put it down, put it down,
put it down!

70
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,483
On the nannies?

71
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,903
Yeah, I want the best.
And the best don't work for slobs.

72
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,738
- We are not slobs.
- Oh, really?

73
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,158
How come I spent all night cleaning
potion stains off of the ceiling?

74
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,118
That's gazpacho, not potion.

75
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,496
Well, you know what,
blenders have lids.

76
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,498
Piper, you need to relax, okay?

77
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,752
I will relax when Leo gets here.
We haven't had a chance to prepare.

78
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:02,005
What's to prepare? You're a Charmed
One, your reputation precedes you.

79
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:05,509
Oh, you mean how evil barges in here
all hours of the day and night

80
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:09,596
hell-bent on killing us? Not exactly
an ideal working environment.

81
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,184
Oh, finally! I was afraid
that the Elders drummed up

82
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,937
one of their last-minute
"it can't wait" assignments.

83
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,607
- Can't it wait?
- No, it can't wait.

84
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:25,112
But it's not for me, it's for Paige.
You're getting your first charge.

85
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,864
Are you serious?

86
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,575
Well, the Elders aren't exactly
known for their sense of humour.

87
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:34,121
That is so great! I am now Paige
Matthews, whitelighter-witch.

88
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,165
- I'm a hyphenate.
- Wait a minute.

89
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,542
Since when are you psyched
about whitelighter duty?

90
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,211
Well, it is half of who I am.

91
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,047
Who's my charge gonna be?
Is it a whitelighter-to-be?

92
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,425
A philanthropist? A doctor?

93
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,595
- Not exactly.
- Oh, wait, don't tell me.

94
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,555
It's a young girl. A witch.

95
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:56,185
She's just coming into her powers.
Oh, my God, I can totally relate to that.

96
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,437
You ramble when you're excited.

97
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,982
- Sorry.
- All I can tell you about your charge

98
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,527
is that he is a good man
who's lost his way.

99
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:09,698
- And why is that all you can tell her?
- Because the Elders want Paige

100
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,658
to figure the rest out for herself.

101
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,994
Yeah, see, you're being vague.

102
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,580
Your charge's name is Samuel.

103
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,123
Samuel.

104
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,419
Good, strong, biblical name.
Okay, where do I find him?

105
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,087
The Elders aren't sure.

106
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,466
But they think that you should
be able to sense his location.

107
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:28,967
So wait a minute.

108
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,802
If the Elders have
lost track of him,

109
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,930
why do they suddenly think
Paige can find him?

110
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:37,017
Well, the Elders have complete
faith in Paige's abilities. So do I.

111
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,395
All we have to do is trust
that they know what they're doing.

112
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,357
How are you supposed to trust people
that don't answer your questions?

113
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,653
Okay, enough, Negative Nancy.
You just scurry back to your tidying.

114
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,572
I don't want anybody to rain
on my whitelighter parade.

115
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,034
Paige? Piper?

116
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,330
Hey.

117
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,249
- What is it?
- We have a demon to vanquish.

118
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,334
Paige, what did you do
with the vanquishing potion

119
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,794
- that you made for Cole?
- Cole?

120
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,796
- I tossed it.
- You tossed it?

121
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,590
Yeah, it wasn't strong enough.
I tried it on that letter opener

122
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,009
that had Cole's blood on it,
but it barely even dented it.

123
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,428
Well, you have to figure out
a way to make another one

124
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,013
that's strong enough, and fast.

125
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,349
Hang on a second, lady.
What are you talking about?

126
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:21,603
Last night, two guys held up
a bar and a vigilante killed them.

127
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:24,356
Sounds more like you need
an arrest warrant, not a potion.

128
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,441
Not when the vigilante is tall,
dark and handsome

129
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,902
and can send people flying
with the wave of a hand.

130
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,362
That doesn't mean it's Cole.

131
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,573
Did I forget to mention
the scorch marks?

132
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,367
- That means it's Cole.
- Why don't you...?

133
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:39,663
Let me handle this. Phoebe,
being that I'm also a whitelighter,

134
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:43,584
I just want to warn you that maybe
you shouldn't jump to conclusions

135
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,253
and you should have
all the facts before you act.

136
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,131
Actually, you're right.

137
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,217
- I am good at this.
- But you better start working

138
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:57,264
on the potion. Because if I'm right
about Cole, our truce with him is over.

139
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,404
I told you last night, leave me alone.

140
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:18,410
Last night, you crossed the line.
The power inside you has grown.

141
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,205
You have nowhere else to turn,
except to us.

142
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,874
I won't turn evil.

143
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,753
Good and evil are such
useless categories.

144
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,839
Endlessly embattled,
neither side ever winning.

145
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,218
Gets rather boring, don't you think?

146
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,595
Then what are you?

147
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,680
The Avatars.

148
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,266
Avatars of what?

149
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,061
Force and power.

150
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,107
And we don't have to limit ourselves
to choosing between good and evil.

151
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,401
We can drive them both.

152
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,237
What's that got to do with me?

153
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,781
We are only a few.

154
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,284
But we are preparing to wield
a power, the likes of which

155
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,286
this world has never seen.

156
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,957
And we want you to be a part of it.

157
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,088
Let me make myself clear.

158
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,799
I want nothing to do with you.

159
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,350
You can't fight us, Cole.

160
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,853
It is futile to try.

161
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,231
Sooner or later, you will join us.

162
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,191
It is...

163
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,485
...inevitable.

164
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,286
Back to your old self again, huh?

165
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,329
Get out of here.

166
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,498
Did you kill two people last night?

167
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,208
I don't have time for this.

168
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,085
Well, you better make time for this.

169
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,131
I can't be good, I won't be evil.
What do you want from me?

170
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:55,507
I want an answer.

171
00:11:56,508 --> 00:12:00,220
Yes. I killed those two criminals.

172
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:05,475
And you want to know something
else? It was easy. It felt very natural.

173
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,855
Is that what you wanted to hear?

174
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,025
You just don't get it, do you?

175
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,862
They weren't only two criminals.
They were two human beings, Cole.

176
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,866
Spare me the judgmental crap.

177
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,369
You have no idea what
I'm going through right now.

178
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,331
No, I don't, and I don't want to know.

179
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,374
Then why are you still here?

180
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,168
I'm here to warn you.

181
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,297
If you kill another person,
good or evil...

182
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,925
...I will vanquish you.

183
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,011
You really think you have
the power to vanquish me?

184
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,180
Try me.

185
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,396
I might just do that.

186
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,733
If this is where I was supposed
to find my charge,

187
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,819
you might have told me
not to wear my Jimmy Choos.

188
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,279
Jimmy who?

189
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,948
My shoes?

190
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,200
Men.

191
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:08,956
So I'm guessing my "wealthy
philanthropist" theory was wrong.

192
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,167
I told you he was a lost
soul and needed saving.

193
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:16,380
Yeah, this definitely looks like a place
where lost souls would hang out.

194
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,842
Probably also some rats,
some roaches...

195
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,344
...and human waste.

196
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,181
- At least my cover will work.
- Cover?

197
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,142
Social worker. Well, I have to tell
Samuel something.

198
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,687
Well, in this case, I don't think
you're gonna need a cover.

199
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,608
- In this case?
- Well, every case is different.

200
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,487
Piper's right, you are being evasive.

201
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,327
- I feel something. I think he's close.
- You're sensing him?

202
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:51,456
No, it's more like a magnetic pull.

203
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,714
- Stay out!
- Good luck.

204
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:02,426
- Where are you going?
- Nanny interviews.

205
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:14,396
Oh, great. This is just great.

206
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,152
You're strong. For a girl.

207
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,530
Thanks. I think.

208
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:28,368
Well, here we are.
Home sweet home.

209
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,162
It's a dump.

210
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,663
No.

211
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,207
It's...

212
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,417
..."shabby chic."

213
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,462
It's a shabby dump.

214
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:43,008
Well, how about some coffee?

215
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,470
How about you leave me alone?

216
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,518
Maybe you just want to talk.
You know, I'm a really good listener.

217
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,980
What part of "alone"
don't you understand?

218
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,565
Okay.

219
00:14:58,774 --> 00:14:59,900
Maybe some other time.

220
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:04,363
But if you need help, of any variety,

221
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,367
just call this number,
and I'll be there.

222
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,912
Okay? I'll be right there to help you.

223
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:16,708
I can't believe the Elders
finally tracked me down,

224
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,961
with a novice, no less.

225
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,838
Wait a second, you know?

226
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:25,217
A little advice:
You need to work up a cover.

227
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:28,053
Didn't you read
the whitelighter manual?

228
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,305
There's a manual?

229
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:34,601
I can't believe the Elders sent
a newbie out after me.

230
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,354
Well, I can't believe
the Elders saddled me

231
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,190
with a cranky old drunk
as my first charge.

232
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:50,284
You've got spunk, I like that.
Now go away.

233
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,996
No, I will not go away.

234
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,832
I may be new at this, but I was
sent here to guide and protect you

235
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,418
and that is exactly what I am
going to do. Like it or not.

236
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,212
No!

237
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,509
- Duck!
- Sorry, I don't cook.

238
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,721
Cooking, that's a no. Okay, got it.

239
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,849
And only light housecleaning.

240
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,352
Oh, that's okay,
because Piper's a neat freak.

241
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,440
If you don't mind,
I have a few questions of my own.

242
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,985
Oh, of course you do.
Well, yeah, please.

243
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:29,781
Am I expected to protect the baby
from the incessant demon attacks?

244
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,577
I'd say "incessant" is a bit
of an overstatement.

245
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,121
You are a Charmed One, correct?

246
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,583
Yes, but that won't affect
your job here.

247
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:44,171
- Won't it?
- No, honey, it won't.

248
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,509
Whitelighters,
they're such pessimists.

249
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:52,721
Demons, you see, demons rarely
attack us in the house so...

250
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,767
- Darklighter, incoming!
- This is highly unusual.

251
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,065
Samuel!

252
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:13,992
Consider my application withdrawn.

253
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:17,162
- Damn it!
- Don't touch it!

254
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,039
It's poisonous to you too.

255
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,626
Is that who I think it is?

256
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:27,548
- Mom's whitelighter.
- And Paige's father.

257
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,683
It's okay, you're gonna be okay.

258
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,686
This can't be happening.
I can't be losing my first charge.

259
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:44,439
You're not. Everyone with
whitelighter blood, back up.

260
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:47,734
Leo, I can't believe you didn't tell me

261
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:51,113
- he was a whitelighter.
- Paige, just try and stay calm.

262
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,948
Calm? The Elders sent me
to protect someone

263
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,325
- without telling me who he was.
- I'd say that's a bit

264
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,869
of an understatement.

265
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:59,204
Is there something else
I should know?

266
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,504
Okay.

267
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,720
Paige, go get the Book of Shadows.

268
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,597
Why, we know it was a darklighter.

269
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,682
No, there was something
different about that guy.

270
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,517
You just go get the book.

271
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,603
Fine.

272
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,860
You all right?

273
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,947
- I'm still alive, aren't I?
- Long time no see.

274
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:42,789
Piper. Phoebe. How you been?

275
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:47,461
Last time we saw you, you were riding
into the afterlife with our mother.

276
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,463
What happened?

277
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,508
They made me a whitelighter again.

278
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,385
And I screwed up, again.

279
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,639
I guess I never got over...

280
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,432
Losing your daughter?

281
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,268
Yeah, that's the one.

282
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,316
I've gotta get out of here.

283
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:13,278
Don't. She's your whitelighter
for a reason.

284
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:16,365
- The Elders are trying to help you.
- By reuniting me with the child

285
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:17,908
they forced me to give up?

286
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,662
You knew about this supernatural
Jenny Jones reunion, didn't you?

287
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,997
I was sworn to secrecy.

288
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,000
It doesn't matter.

289
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,127
No, hey, wait a minute.

290
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,796
Aren't you forgetting someone?

291
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:33,632
Like that girl upstairs
that's trying to save your life?

292
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,761
- She's better off without me.
- This isn't right.

293
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,472
I'll tell you what's not right.

294
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,724
The Elders setting me up.

295
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,893
You forced them to.

296
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,562
When you stopped
using your powers,

297
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,356
you fell off the radar. They had to
find you through a blood relative.

298
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,776
I never wanted to be found.
Least of all by her.

299
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,362
Don't you think she at least
deserves to know the truth?

300
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:57,322
The truth?

301
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:03,162
That her birth father, the whitelighter,
is a two-time loser and a drunk?

302
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,754
She doesn't need to know that.

303
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,180
Where's Samuel?

304
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,473
He... He orbed out.

305
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,809
What, you just let him?

306
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:29,479
We couldn't stop him.
Did you find anything in the book?

307
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,273
No.

308
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,609
Well, we're pretty sure
that he's a tracker.

309
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,861
They're stronger
and more powerful

310
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,613
than the darklighters
you've dealt with.

311
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,532
And they go after fallen whitelighters,
especially those who

312
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,576
are a step away
from losing their wings.

313
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:45,370
Okay, if you knew all that,
why did you send me for the book?

314
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,706
Because I didn't know that.

315
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:50,209
Sorry. So we're gonna need
a vanquishing potion.

316
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,337
Why don't you two get started on
that and Leo and I will go find Sam.

317
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:56,465
Well, wait a second, he's my charge.
I'm gonna go look for him.

318
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,718
Well, he's been orbing a lot longer
than you have. You might lose him.

319
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:02,221
I have a better chance
of finding him than you do.

320
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,265
So here, we're gonna go.
We're going.

321
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:18,487
Get up. What's wrong?

322
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:21,698
Lose your hearing along
with your arm? I said get up.

323
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,116
I can't!

324
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:26,912
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

325
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,707
You're not the only one
with problems.

326
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,460
What do you want?

327
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:36,046
A way out. And you're it.

328
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:39,258
You are gonna help me
destroy the Charmed Ones.

329
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:41,051
I'm not going anywhere near them.

330
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,720
Well, look at it as...

331
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,556
...payback.

332
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,732
Okay, now you know
where I'm from.

333
00:21:55,899 --> 00:22:00,612
I'm gonna tell you what I want.
First, we go after the witches.

334
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:03,073
Then we get that decrepit
whitelighter you're looking for.

335
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,785
- I want that whitelighter dead now.
- Patience.

336
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:10,622
One of the witches
is his long-Iost kid.

337
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,876
Kill her, and he'll be begging to die.

338
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,587
Well, what now?

339
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,631
Well, you're gonna need
some extra firepower,

340
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,009
and I'm gonna give it to you.

341
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,720
What do you get out of this?

342
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,807
Let's just say I'm looking
for a showdown.

343
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:36,982
Thought you lost us, did you?

344
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,818
We knew you'd be back
sooner or later.

345
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:44,364
What is with you people?
Can't you take a hint?

346
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,824
We need to talk.

347
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:49,828
I don't want to talk,
I want to be left alone.

348
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,706
Why else do you think
I've been orbing all over creation?

349
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,958
Well, chickening out comes to mind.

350
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:57,586
Sam, I know it hurts.

351
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:01,965
Oh, you know? How?
How can you?

352
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:04,259
L... I know loss.

353
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:08,805
The hubris of a whitelighter,
thinking we know everything

354
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,350
just because of who we are.
Well, that is crap!

355
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:15,354
Now, you got a point there.
So why don't you help us understand.

356
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,064
You want to understand, do you?

357
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,819
Well, you hold that precious
little baby of yours in your arms...

358
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:28,242
...and you love her more than
you ever loved anything in the world...

359
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:33,914
...and then you give her to someone
else to raise and grow up with.

360
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,500
You and Mom did
that to protect Paige.

361
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:39,795
Didn't work, did it?

362
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:44,299
As soon as she found out who
she was, a witch, a Charmed...

363
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:50,722
It was just a matter of
time until I lost her again.

364
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,267
And I couldn't handle that!

365
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:58,063
Look, it doesn't matter.

366
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:01,817
Just leave, please.

367
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:03,694
Pretend you never found me!

368
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,612
It does matter, Sam.

369
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:08,866
The darklighter is not gonna
stop until he kills you.

370
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,785
Maybe that's my destiny.
Do you ever think of that?

371
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,037
Come on, that is a cop-out
and you know it!

372
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,417
You really think the Elders brought
you and Paige together

373
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,669
so she could watch you die?

374
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:23,755
Look at you.

375
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:27,426
Of all people, defending the Elders.

376
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,679
Hey, they may not be
on my Christmas list,

377
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:33,182
but that doesn't mean they don't
usually have a good reason

378
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,017
for doing the things that they do.

379
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,519
Like telling you
you couldn't marry Leo?

380
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:40,397
I said usually.

381
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,610
Look, if you don't want
our help, that's fine.

382
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:49,489
But maybe this isn't about you.
Maybe this is about helping Paige.

383
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,828
Helping Paige.

384
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:56,788
With what?

385
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,666
Knowing where she
comes from, for starters.

386
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:08,550
So you don't know him at all?

387
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:12,804
You know, we run into a lot
of people in our line of work.

388
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,515
Okay, once again, not an answer.

389
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,476
Can you pass me the
cardamom, please?

390
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:22,356
Okay, I'm just gonna
take a guess now.

391
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,274
Let's see, maybe the
Elders gave him to me

392
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:28,779
because he's a lost cause that
they couldn't pawn off on anyone else.

393
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:33,033
- Toadflax.
- Just tell me if I'm hot or cold.

394
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:38,664
Okay. Maybe the Elders thought
you would actually learn something

395
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:40,165
from working with him.

396
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:41,750
Like what, how to give up?

397
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:44,586
No, I think you pretty
much got that down.

398
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:48,090
Okay, passive-aggressive,
what does that mean?

399
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:52,052
Come on, Paige, you know
you're pretty quick to judge people.

400
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,137
- Like who?
- Trevor.

401
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:59,184
Okay, Trevor is an orange,
my charge would be an apple.

402
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:01,103
I fail to see the connection.

403
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,522
Okay, take my word for it.

404
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:07,693
You need to give Samuel another
chance. It's important, for you both.

405
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:10,737
Okay, enough with the cryptic.

406
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:14,575
Tell me what you know and please,
don't change the subject.

407
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,035
Okay.

408
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,955
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

409
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:27,462
Sam was...

410
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,050
...Mom's whitelighter.

411
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,804
That would make him...

412
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,724
Your biological father.

413
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,563
Oh, honey, are you okay?

414
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:47,524
Great, I'm just great.

415
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,362
I just don't quite see
why the big secret.

416
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:54,323
Why couldn't anybody tell me?

417
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:57,034
I should have told you.

418
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,789
I'm sorry.

419
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,172
I was hoping we could talk.

420
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,927
Go ahead, honey,
I'll finish the potion.

421
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:19,139
Yeah, we can talk.

422
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:22,809
I'm here for you if you need me.

423
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:39,034
You hate me, don't you?

424
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:42,371
Why should I?
You're a stranger to me.

425
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,207
That's a perfectly fair statement.

426
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,085
Spoken like a true whitelighter.

427
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,837
But not a father.

428
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,005
I had a father.

429
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:56,051
One who made me proud to be
his daughter. And it's not you.

430
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:59,388
I haven't made you
very proud, have I?

431
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:02,933
No offence, but I don't know you.

432
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,434
And I actually haven't spent

433
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,979
a lot of time over the years
thinking about you.

434
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:09,231
Well, maybe you should.

435
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:11,608
After all, I'm the one
that gave you up at birth.

436
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,987
That has to have caused
you some pain.

437
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:21,451
Hey, nice job, you guys.

438
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,539
- What do you mean?
- Sam's in there talking to Paige.

439
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,749
- What?
- That's impossible.

440
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,334
Sam refused to come back.

441
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:35,090
You can pretend all you want
that it hasn't affected you.

442
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:37,009
But we both know better than that.

443
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:40,971
How would you know? Who the
hell do you think you are anyway?

444
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,099
- Paige.
- That's not Sam.

445
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:48,270
- What are you talking about?
- She's talking about this.

446
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,108
You son of a bitch.

447
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:58,071
Wait, it gets better, all right? Ronan!

448
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,785
- What happened?
- He's immune.

449
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:05,746
Not to this.

450
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,683
Let's go.

451
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:51,458
You can't stop the bleeding,
can you?

452
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:53,752
Just try and rest.

453
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:00,050
- How's Leo doing?
- He's been better.

454
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:03,679
I can't believe Cole would go this far.

455
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:06,515
Yeah, and why now,
what's the occasion?

456
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:08,475
Because he's pure evil.

457
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:12,896
Yeah, but it's just not smart.
And good or evil, Cole is usually smart.

458
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:14,815
Well, he's obviously lost his mind.

459
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,110
I mean, he killed two people
yesterday in public.

460
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:21,613
I've been thinking about
the vanquishing potion.

461
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:24,616
Maybe if you mixed three
different ones...

462
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:27,202
No, you're gonna be able
to make the vanquishing potion

463
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,955
just as soon as we figure
out a way to heal you.

464
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:33,167
We gotta find Sam.
He's our only chance.

465
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:36,712
So now I'm screwed.

466
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,255
Don't think like that.

467
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:45,929
Why? Sam bails, that's what he does.
This time won't be any different.

468
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,599
It's different because now
you're the one that's hurt.

469
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:53,937
So you gotta find him. And I'll go
get him and bring him back here

470
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:56,190
and Phoebe will stay
with you and Leo.

471
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:57,858
You can't go alone.

472
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,902
No, I'm not alone.

473
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:03,906
Apparently the baby here
prefers Mommy to be indestructible.

474
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:06,533
That's a good point. You go.

475
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:11,079
It's up to you, you gotta sense him.
Concentrate.

476
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:42,110
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

477
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,613
What are you doing here?

478
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,741
Protecting him from you.

479
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:51,453
I kept up my end of the bargain.
You said I could have him.

480
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:58,877
This isn't about you. Or about him,
for that matter. It's about me.

481
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:03,131
What difference does it make to you
whether the whitelighter lives or dies?

482
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:06,510
I need him alive, so he can heal
the witch and their whitelighter.

483
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:08,428
Heal them?

484
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,347
You wanted me to help you kill them.

485
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:12,891
Because I want them
to come after me.

486
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:17,312
You kill Sam, they'll come
after you and I can't have that.

487
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:20,983
You never had any intentions
of letting me kill him, did you?

488
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,986
Walk away, Ronan.

489
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:28,490
Why? So you can shoot
me in the back?

490
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:32,035
You're smarter than I thought.

491
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,669
Sam.

492
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:48,093
Sam. Sam, wake up.

493
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:49,970
No, leave me alone!

494
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:52,514
Listen to me.
Paige and Leo need you.

495
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,267
The darklighter shot them.
You need to heal them.

496
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:03,025
I don't know, it's been so long.

497
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:04,568
Well, there's no one else.

498
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:06,028
You have to do it.

499
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:08,113
Look, if you think you've
screwed up in the past,

500
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:10,824
now would be a good time
to start making amends.

501
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:18,499
He'll be here soon.

502
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,502
He will, just hang on.

503
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:31,345
Oh, God.

504
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,821
- What's the problem?
- I can't.

505
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,531
What? Try again.

506
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:54,284
It's no use. This is my punishment.

507
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:57,037
No, you will not sit there
and drown in self-pity

508
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:58,789
while Paige and
my husband die.

509
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:04,253
Don't you think I want to save them?
For God's sake, this is my daughter.

510
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:06,296
You can't heal her
because you gave up.

511
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:09,675
Everything I touch, I hurt.

512
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:14,263
All I wanted was a life for her,
free from magic and demons.

513
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:17,266
No, it was not. Paige saved us.

514
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:19,101
She's the reason
I am still standing here.

515
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:20,894
She brought this
family back together.

516
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:23,897
She's done so much good.

517
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:26,817
All the pain and anger that you've
been holding on for so many years,

518
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:30,237
you've got to let it go.
It's time to let it go.

519
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:36,326
Paige, I am so sorry.

520
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,371
It's okay.

521
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,258
What happened?

522
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:55,095
I think you just healed yourself.
Now Paige.

523
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:21,538
Thank you.

524
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,502
Okay. Thanks, later. Leo, now.

525
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,235
Piper, you okay?

526
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:53,153
The baby?

527
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:57,574
Oh, she's fine. I don't think
we have to worry about her at all.

528
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:00,577
I'll explain later.

529
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:05,916
I'm gonna go get started on those
potions. We have a Cole to vanquish.

530
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,845
So you think this is gonna work?

531
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:20,514
These are at least as strong
as the ones we used on The Source,

532
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:23,559
- so yeah, I think.
- But you can't be sure?

533
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:26,436
I can't be sure of anything
until I try it.

534
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:28,272
- That's not good enough.
- Phoebe...

535
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:31,775
I want him dead. I want this over with.
And if this doesn't work,

536
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:33,485
we may not get a second chance.

537
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:35,320
Got it. Kill him, dead.

538
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:37,281
Dead.

539
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:40,576
I have a thought.

540
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,122
No other potion has
been able to destroy this

541
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,999
since Cole's blood
has been protecting it,

542
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:50,586
but if these potions are
as strong as I think they are

543
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:53,714
then a little will go a long way.

544
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:13,066
On three?

545
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,736
No. Me, then you, then Phoebe.

546
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:35,464
Are you sure you want to do this?

547
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:38,258
How can you even
ask me that question?

548
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:21,343
If this doesn't work,
you'll have nowhere else to turn.

549
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:23,428
It'll work.

550
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:29,393
But what a waste. Especially when
you could have so much more.

551
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,770
I don't want any more.

552
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:34,189
You're not even curious?

553
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:49,288
Stand up.

554
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:52,124
I said stand up.

555
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:05,345
Come to vanquish me, have you?

556
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:09,683
- Where's your hit man?
- Oh, you know those darklighters,

557
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,935
they're just so difficult to work with.

558
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:15,397
Can't even kill a lousy whitelighter,
let alone you.

559
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:17,107
But you could have.

560
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:19,568
Bastard.

561
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,454
Phoebe, come on.

562
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:38,420
- I know what you're doing.
- Phoebe, throw the potion.

563
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:41,632
You never really wanted to kill us,
did you?

564
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,051
- What are you talking about?
- He could have killed you

565
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:46,386
back at the manor.
He had you alone.

566
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:51,058
But you needed all of us to survive
for your plan to work, including Sam.

567
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:54,269
- Phoebe, have you lost your mind?
- No, you said it yourself.

568
00:39:54,436 --> 00:40:00,108
It wasn't a smart plan.
Unless you didn't really want to kill us.

569
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:03,987
You wanted us to be
so blinded by hate

570
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:06,782
that we couldn't see
what you were really up to.

571
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:11,036
Well, that's the only way out for me.

572
00:40:12,663 --> 00:40:14,581
And you want it too, so...

573
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:17,584
Yeah, but on our terms, not yours.

574
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:21,129
We won't help you commit suicide.

575
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,633
You already have.

576
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:44,361
Oh, my God.

577
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:51,243
I don't understand.
That should have worked.

578
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,036
Then why didn't it?

579
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:56,748
They knew it wouldn't work.

580
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:58,792
Who knew?
What are you talking about?

581
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:04,882
You can't vanquish me.

582
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:07,009
Nobody can.

583
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:26,820
So...

584
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,782
...what are you gonna do now?
I mean, about Cole.

585
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:38,790
I don't know. It's a little scary, being
that he's basically indestructible now.

586
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:42,461
Well, I'm sure you girls will handle it.

587
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:48,926
Paige.

588
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:53,096
I want you to know
that giving you up

589
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:55,724
was the hardest decision
I ever had to make.

590
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,227
Your mother too.

591
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:01,104
If we could have done it over, we...

592
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,106
We wouldn't have done it.

593
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:06,109
But we weren't
supposed to be together.

594
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:11,281
A baby. We were afraid
the Elders would find out.

595
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:13,867
It's okay.

596
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:18,455
I understand, I really... I do.

597
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:21,333
It still has to have hurt you.

598
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:27,673
I used to think that you
did not matter to me at all.

599
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:29,883
That if I never met you...

600
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:33,262
...my life would be perfectly fine.

601
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:36,515
I guess...

602
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:39,434
...the Elders knew better after all.

603
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:43,647
When you gave me up,
you made a choice

604
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:47,234
that gave me the most amazing gift.

605
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:53,824
You see, I got to have
these tremendous parents,

606
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:58,912
and we... We loved
each other fiercely.

607
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:03,667
But now I have
this whole new life...

608
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:06,211
...with my sisters.

609
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:10,591
What about everything
that goes with it?

610
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:13,844
I choose to be a witch.

611
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:16,638
I could have walked away.

612
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:19,141
But I didn't.

613
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:23,478
And now I'm a whitelighter, to boot.

614
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:29,860
That's my girl.

615
00:43:43,749 --> 00:43:46,877
- Any luck?
- Yeah, that little elf? Got a big mouth.

616
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:48,754
All the nannies
cancelled their interviews.

617
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:52,674
Oh, great. Well, if magical
nannies won't work for us,

618
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:55,677
and regular ones are out of the
question, then what are we gonna do?

619
00:43:56,386 --> 00:44:00,224
Well, it's a good thing we have
a few months. We'll figure it out.

620
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:04,269
Hey, how did it go?

621
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:07,689
Good. Difficult, but good.

622
00:44:07,856 --> 00:44:09,608
He's a good man.
It'll be good for you guys

623
00:44:09,817 --> 00:44:12,236
- to get to know each other.
- I think I'm a little burnt out

624
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:15,197
on the whole "emotional
roller coaster" thing right now.

625
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:19,868
Maybe I deserve a nice drive down
the coast. I think I'll call Trevor.

626
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:22,621
Oh, that guy. Yeah, that guy
that you just dumped.

627
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:27,668
Well, maybe I'll also rethink that
whole "dumping perfectly nice guys

628
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:30,003
before I give them a chance" thing.

629
00:44:30,254 --> 00:44:33,465
I guess meeting Sam made me
realize I kind of still have

630
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:36,468
some abandonment issues
I might want to work through.

631
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,973
Anything from you over there
in the peanut gallery?

632
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:44,226
I'm sorry, I'm just freaking out.

633
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,896
Having an invincible ex-husband
is making me really nervous.

634
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:52,025
Well, the good thing is we've got
someone invincible of our own.

635
00:44:52,943 --> 00:44:54,528
I got you covered.

636
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:56,822
For now.
