1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,349
In this night and in this hour
I call upon the ancient power

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,995
Bring back my sister

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,788
Bring back the power of three

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,596
Power of the witches, rise

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,349
Course unseen across the skies
Come to us who call you near

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,511
Come to us and settle here

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,551
Blood to blood, I summon thee

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,956
Blood to blood, return to me

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,709
Piper?

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,919
Prue?

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,952
Sweetie, it's 4:00
in the morning.

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,792
What are you doing?

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,079
You're bleeding.

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,788
I don't understand
why magic can't fix this.

15
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,949
Why it can't bring Prue back. It's not
like we haven't cheated death before.

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,555
I don't understand why this time
is any different.

17
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,392
Because Leo can't heal the dead,
Piper. You know that.

18
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,270
There's other magic,
magic that we've used before:

19
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,274
Scrying, calling a lost witch,
reversing time...

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,476
Like, the Book just deserted us,
and deserted Prue.

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,598
And I don't understand why.

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,835
We lost our sister.

23
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,790
How can we ever understand that?

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,992
We have tried every magical way
to bring her back.

25
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,435
But we can't.

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,275
She's gone.

27
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,152
I just... I thank God
that I didn't lose you too.

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,472
We have to get some rest.

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,274
Prue will never forgive us
if we look bad at her funeral.

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,509
Social Services, can I help you?

31
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,232
Printing.

32
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,479
South Bay Social Services,
may I help you?

33
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,189
Paige, you find that study yet?

34
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,748
- Paige, did you hear me?
- Yeah, it's in the printer.

35
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,595
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- What do you mean, go? Go where?

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,148
Paige! Hey, Paige!

37
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,275
- Can I get you anything?
- Oh, no, thanks, sweetie.

38
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,558
Look who's back.

39
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,839
Cole.

40
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,470
I was afraid you weren't
gonna make it to the funeral.

41
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,195
Well, l...

42
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,033
I can't make it. Or shouldn't, anyway.

43
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,589
The Source has every demonic
bounty hunter looking for me.

44
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,269
Yeah, so, what else is new?

45
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,874
This is different.
Saving you makes it different.

46
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,075
It makes me a traitor.

47
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,919
He's not gonna stop
until he finds me.

48
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,798
I don't want that happening
at Prue's funeral.

49
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,951
- So we'll protect you.
- You can't protect me.

50
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,475
Why not? We're still witches,
aren't we?

51
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,154
Yeah, but you're not
the Charmed Ones anymore.

52
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,717
He's right.
Without the power of three--

53
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,557
I don't understand. Isn't it harder
to track a demon in a cemetery, Cole?

54
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,919
You have to go.

55
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,631
I need you there.

56
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,869
Hey. How are you holding up?

57
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,319
Okay.

58
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,595
- It's sweet of you to stop by.
- Had to.

59
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,035
Besides, you should know
they're assigning Prue's case

60
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,111
- to another inspector.
- What case?

61
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,352
"What case?" Are you kidding?

62
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,590
Prue and a prominent doctor
were killed here, Leo.

63
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,558
Made a lot of press.
People want answers.

64
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,755
Important people.

65
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,071
So, what's this guy gonna find, that
it was some kind of demonic hit man?

66
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,559
- Give me a break.
- He might.

67
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,790
Look, you don't know him like I do.

68
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,554
He'll keep looking
until he finds something.

69
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,438
- Believe me.
- I'm not worried.

70
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,989
Well, I am. I saw what happened
when they were exposed as witches.

71
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,909
Time may have reversed itself,
but it still cost Prue her life.

72
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,308
Would you people mind?

73
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,155
For God's sake, we're burying
my daughter today. Can't this wait?

74
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,829
Piper?

75
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,475
Honey...

76
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,355
...we have to go.

77
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,673
I don't wanna go.

78
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,438
Why not?

79
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,989
Because if I go,

80
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,155
that'll mean that Prue's
really not coming back.

81
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,792
And I don't think I can handle that.

82
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,830
We can handle it together.

83
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,035
She's been there my whole life.

84
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,791
I've always had a big sister.

85
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,150
And I don't know how to live
without one.

86
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,878
Piper.

87
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,830
Why didn't you save her?

88
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,917
- I tried.
- But you didn't.

89
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,311
Why didn't they let you
save her too?

90
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,518
The Elders?

91
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,068
They couldn't.
They don't have that kind of power.

92
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,119
Then what the hell good are they?

93
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,149
It's okay to be angry.

94
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,798
I'm not angry. I am pissed off.

95
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,999
Don't you understand?
You healed the wrong sister.

96
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,874
You saved me
because I'm your damn wife,

97
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,674
and you should have saved her
because she was the best,

98
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,875
because she...

99
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,478
You should...

100
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,476
Why did they put us through
so much

101
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,598
for it to end this way?

102
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,559
May I be seen?

103
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,635
- Have you found Belthazor?
- No, something else.

104
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,076
Something more important, perhaps.

105
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,992
Nothing is more important.

106
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,279
Not even the Charmed Ones?

107
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,432
- The Charmed Ones are dead.
- Not all of them.

108
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,514
One gone ends the threat.

109
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,877
Of course, if you had foreseen
that a whitelighter

110
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:10,149
was going to help Belthazor
save his witch, they'd all be gone.

111
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,719
Be grateful I don't turn you
into a snake.

112
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,953
Yes, but then how would you see
into the future without me?

113
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,317
Without the Charmed Ones
to worry about anymore,

114
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,074
I may not need to.

115
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,874
Well, in that case, you better
keep me around

116
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,996
a little while longer.

117
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,955
What do you see?

118
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,351
I see...

119
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,031
...a witch's call on the spirit winds.

120
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,952
I see...

121
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,991
...another.

122
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,190
"--that which belongs
to fellowship and love,

123
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,988
that which belongs
to the circle

124
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,994
remains with us.
The wheel turns.

125
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,631
As life is a day,

126
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,189
so our sister has passed
into night.

127
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,751
Nothing is final.

128
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,559
And we who remain behind know
that one day we will once again

129
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,871
share the bread and wine
with our sister."

130
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,270
Oh, blessed spirit,

131
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,755
we bid you farewell,

132
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,358
for you await a new destiny.

133
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,157
I'm so sorry for your loss.

134
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,238
Thank you.

135
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,156
How did you know Prue?

136
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,352
- From work?
- No, just...

137
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,030
Just from around.

138
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,795
You know.

139
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,033
Have we met somewhere?

140
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,951
No, I don't-- I don't think so.

141
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,109
Anyway,

142
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,114
my condolences.

143
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,473
Thank you.

144
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,395
- Phoebe?
- Phoebe.

145
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,352
- Are you all right?
- I saw him.

146
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,830
- The demon that killed Prue.
- Shax?

147
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,752
- What was he doing?
- He was killing that girl.

148
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,831
- What girl?
- The one I was just talking to.

149
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,718
We gotta go find her.

150
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,309
Go, go!

151
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,675
Stop it.

152
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,079
Stop it, stop it, stop it, damn it!

153
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,439
This is Prue's funeral,
for God sakes!

154
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,229
Can we at least bury her in peace?
Is that too much to ask?

155
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,155
Thank you.

156
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,150
- I don't see her anywhere.
- Who?

157
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,038
The girl from my premonition.

158
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,913
Phoebe,

159
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,271
- you need to be more careful.
- I'm sorry.

160
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,113
Are you sure you don't recognize her
from anywhere?

161
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,150
Well, she did look familiar,
like I've seen her somewhere before.

162
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,515
But somehow we have to find her
before night falls,

163
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,756
- or else--
- Honey, what are you doing?

164
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,636
- I'm cleaning.
- You don't clean. You hate cleaning.

165
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,314
I know, but it's better
than falling apart, isn't it?

166
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,952
Maybe you should just try
and focus on the girl.

167
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,473
She was attacked on a rooftop?

168
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,870
Yeah, one with a helipad.

169
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,832
But it wasn't a tall building,

170
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,070
although there were a lot of
taller buildings around it.

171
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,470
Okay, so we just need to figure out
which building it was

172
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,870
- before Shax does.
- And do what exactly?

173
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,880
You can't defeat Shax,
not without the power of three.

174
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,958
Well, you and Prue did.

175
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,997
That's because Prue
was the strongest.

176
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,874
Trying to do it without her
would be suicide.

177
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,318
Yeah, but-- Maybe so, but I got that
premonition for a reason, Piper.

178
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,438
That girl is our innocent,
so we have to try and save her.

179
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,636
Says who? Why do we have to?

180
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,518
- Piper.
- What?

181
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,877
Do you really expect us to keep doing
this stuff after what happened?

182
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,634
To keep risking our lives? Do they?

183
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,792
- Piper, keep your voice down.
- No, Leo, I won't.

184
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,191
I don't wanna do this anymore,
okay? It's-- It's over.

185
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,673
You can tell them we buried
their precious Charmed Ones

186
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,308
when we buried our sister.

187
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,675
No, leave her be.

188
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,799
She needs to be alone.

189
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,470
Look, I don't know
where we go from here.

190
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,154
But I do know
that I can't let that girl die.

191
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,755
Especially not by the same demon
that killed Prue.

192
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,911
The question still remains:
How are you gonna stop Shax

193
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,469
without the power of three
to say the vanquishing spell?

194
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,396
I'm hoping that a demon and a witch
fighting together might be enough.

195
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,153
Interested?

196
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,314
Why not? Beats sitting around here

197
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,755
waiting for the next bounty hunter
to attack.

198
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,316
I appreciate you coming over.
It means so much to the girls.

199
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,472
Dad? Excuse us, Aaron.

200
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,234
- We have to go. Will you be okay?
- Go where?

201
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,229
Trust me, you don't wanna know.

202
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,516
Phoebe, Victor?

203
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,039
Sorry about this, but lnspector Cortez
insisted on meeting today.

204
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,919
I just wanted to extend
my deepest sympathies.

205
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,793
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

206
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,957
I'll get the car.

207
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,758
- Where's Piper?
- Upstairs.

208
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,639
- She's not feeling well.
- Understandable.

209
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,597
I lost a sister once myself.

210
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,433
I know how hard it is.

211
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,150
We're gonna find the monster who
did this to your sister, Miss Halliwell.

212
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,912
I promise you this.

213
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,315
Something I said?

214
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,513
No.

215
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,798
Just the word "monster."

216
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,638
Well, that's what he was.

217
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,756
How else do you describe
somebody so vicious?

218
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,157
We gotta stop him
before he strikes again.

219
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,034
I couldn't agree more.

220
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,758
If you'll excuse me, inspector.

221
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,196
I know what a difficult time this is
for you and your sister, Miss Halliwell,

222
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,237
- but we really need to talk.
- But not now.

223
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,513
Of course. Sorry.

224
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,994
I am a witch, damn it.
I've summoned people before,

225
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,038
and I'm going to summon Prue
whether you like it or not.

226
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,794
No more playing games,
no more being the good witch.

227
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,918
I want to talk to my sister.
I need to talk to my sister.

228
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,469
At the very least, you owe me that.

229
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,834
Hear these words, hear my cry
Spirit from the other side

230
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,355
Come to me, I summon thee

231
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,193
Cross now the great divide

232
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,633
- Grams.
- Hello, my darling.

233
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,835
How are you?

234
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,470
How am l? Are you kidding?

235
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,631
Do you guys not get the news
up there?

236
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,239
- I meant, how are you holding up?
- Not very well.

237
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,634
I'm a little lost.

238
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,396
Why didn't you come before
when I called after--?

239
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,836
I couldn't, Piper. I was busy.

240
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,551
You were busy?

241
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,354
I was with Prue.

242
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,471
Of course you were. Right.
Well, that would make sense.

243
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,074
Is she okay?

244
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,113
Your mother and l
are helping her through this.

245
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,395
But how is she?

246
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,073
I'm not allowed to tell you now,

247
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,800
just like you're not allowed
to see her,

248
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,758
at least not for a while anyway.

249
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,758
Why?

250
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,357
Because seeing Prue right now,
speaking to her,

251
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,919
keeps her alive for you,

252
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,238
which keeps you from being able
to move on with your life,

253
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,791
to continue your destiny.

254
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,873
What destiny?
Okay, it's over, it's done.

255
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,998
Prue is gone, and l...

256
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,953
I know, sweetie, I know.

257
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,479
But if there's one thing you've
learned over the last three years

258
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,915
it's that there's always
a reason for everything.

259
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,313
Which means there's a reason
for this too.

260
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,233
Your destiny still awaits.

261
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,391
Blessed be.

262
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,995
Anything?

263
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,475
Unfortunately, since the last attack,
Belthazor has been very elusive.

264
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,677
Leave Belthazor
to the bounty hunters.

265
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,273
What about the other?

266
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,870
Her future's becoming
much more clear.

267
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,749
And it appears...

268
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,033
...short-lived.

269
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,155
Wasn't that good?
That was good, huh?

270
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,718
- You all right?
- Me? Yeah.

271
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,869
Why?

272
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,953
Well, you just seem a little quieter
than usual, that's all.

273
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,437
What makes you think
I'm not like this all the time?

274
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,353
Well, we've been dating
for a month now,

275
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,919
so I think I'd know.

276
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,599
- Hey, can we get a couple longnecks?
- Sure.

277
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,876
Make mine a mineral water, please.
Thanks.

278
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,795
So much for how well
you know me, cowboy.

279
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,154
I don't drink.

280
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,473
I used to have kind of a problem
with certain liquids.

281
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,831
Lots of problems, actually,

282
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,792
but that's all behind me.

283
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,758
- Do you want to go someplace else?
- No. No, no, no. I like it here.

284
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,758
Gosh, I should, I've been coming to P3
for the last year or so, on and off,

285
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,909
I mean, ever since--

286
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,672
Ever since what?

287
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,474
Oh, no, never mind. It's boring.

288
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,275
All right, but if I tell you
all about Paige

289
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,352
and you use it against me,

290
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,717
I will get out my voodoo doll
and make you sorry you're a man.

291
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,597
So my sad story is that I'm adopted,
only it's not so sad,

292
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,309
because I loved my parents.
God rest.

293
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,590
So after they died,
I went searching for my birth mother,

294
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,716
hoping to get some answers.

295
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,555
I went to the police station, found
the church where I was dumped at.

296
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,308
I checked around. I figured she must
have lived near there, you know?

297
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,630
Even thought I might have been...

298
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,715
...related to the Halliwell sisters
for a minute,

299
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,997
but their mom died a long time ago,
so I gave up on that.

300
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,275
Well, did you ever try to meet
the sisters, ask them about it, or...?

301
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,591
Yeah, right. "Hi, I think your mom
abandoned me at birth.

302
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,638
What's for dinner?"
No, I don't think so.

303
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,358
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

304
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,635
You're welcome.

305
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,509
So that... That still doesn't explain
why you keep coming here.

306
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,672
Well, one of the sisters
owns it, so...

307
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,598
I don't know, I guess I just
kind of feel connected somehow.

308
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,634
That's why I went
to the funeral today.

309
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,039
I just kind of felt like I had to.

310
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,274
Okay, I sound certifiably insane now.

311
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,192
Good job, Paige, way to go.

312
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,152
Don't hurt me, okay?

313
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,238
I can't handle any more right now.

314
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,995
Come on.
I have something to show you.

315
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,079
Here.

316
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,719
Thanks.

317
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,871
I think this is the right place,
but maybe we should try

318
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,996
one of the other rooftops
just to make sure.

319
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,628
Or maybe we should follow your
first instincts and stay right here.

320
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,314
Okay, but what if I'm wrong?
That girl will get killed.

321
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,995
You can't save every innocent,
Phoebe. Or stop every demon.

322
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,750
Yeah. Well, I have to stop this one.

323
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,556
I just hope that by me saying
the vanquishing spell,

324
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,393
it wounds him enough
that you can take him out.

325
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,474
I got a better idea. How about
you and me go someplace.

326
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,200
You know, drop off the face of
the earth. Disappear.

327
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,556
Don't tempt me.

328
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,475
Things have changed, Phoebe.

329
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,198
We can't pretend
we can go on like this.

330
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,430
It's only a matter of time
before The Source finds me,

331
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,830
which means every minute
you're with me, you're in danger.

332
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,834
I've lost too much already, Cole.

333
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,919
I'm not losing you too.

334
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,115
Looks like your instincts were right.

335
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,434
- We gotta shimmer over there.
- And tell her what?

336
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,637
That a demon's about to attack?
I think we should stay right here.

337
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,996
Aren't you afraid
that we're gonna get caught?

338
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,799
I like an element of danger.

339
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,231
Oh, look at the stars.

340
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,913
They're so beautiful.

341
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,996
They make me feel free.

342
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,595
All right. Any ideas?

343
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,989
A couple.

344
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,151
I mean about what we do now.

345
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,880
I mean, we can't just keep watching.
It's just not right.

346
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,315
You're right. We shouldn't
just keep watching.

347
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,391
Okay, very good.

348
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,229
Shane!

349
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,194
She orbed.

350
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,079
She orbed. Did you just see that?

351
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,275
Come on.

352
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,715
- What the hell?
- Get out of here. Hurry, go!

353
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,108
Go!

354
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,039
Say the spell, damn it!

355
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,589
Evil wind that blows
That which forms below

356
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,910
No longer may you dwell
Death takes you with this spell

357
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,433
Cole!

358
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,232
- That was too close.
- It's okay, I'm all right.

359
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,910
It's your innocent I'm worried about.

360
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,795
Are you sure she orbed? Are you sure
it wasn't something else?

361
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,430
Leo, she disappeared.
Bright white shiny thingies came,

362
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,795
and then she reappeared.
What else could it be?

363
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,837
- It just doesn't make any sense.
- Why not?

364
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,558
Why would Shax
want to kill a whitelighter?

365
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,994
Maybe he doesn't know
she is one.

366
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,390
Right, The Source sends out
his personal assassin,

367
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,675
but doesn't know who he's after?

368
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,475
Is it possible that she didn't know
she's a whitelighter?

369
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,629
No, why?

370
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,075
Because she acted as if she didn't.
She acted just as surprised

371
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,959
- as we were when she orbed out.
- That doesn't make any sense either.

372
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,032
Okay, why don't you go up and ask
the Elders what does make sense

373
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,350
so we don't go
risking our lives again.

374
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,237
I'll be right back.

375
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,436
Maybe I should go to the other side
and see what I can find out.

376
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,235
- No.
- I'll be careful. Nobody will see me.

377
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,311
Besides, it could be good for me
to go back down,

378
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,675
confuse any bounty hunters
that might be trying to track me.

379
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,593
Don't worry.

380
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,637
I won't disappear on you.

381
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,720
Hey, you okay?

382
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,151
Yeah, sure, why not?

383
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,197
We could have another funeral
tomorrow.

384
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,955
I mean, all the dishes are out, and
we pretty much know who to invite.

385
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,155
Piper.

386
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,869
Just tell me one thing.

387
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,429
Are you insane,
or are you just plain stupid?

388
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,518
We buried Prue this morning,

389
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,116
and you go off tonight
and nearly join her.

390
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,272
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- I was trying to save an innocent.

391
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,158
No. You were trying
to get yourself killed,

392
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,835
which is what this family does best,
is get killed.

393
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,757
Isn't it obvious by now
that our only destiny is to die?

394
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,115
And you are making it
way too easy for them, Phoebe.

395
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,874
You are just walking right into it.

396
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,431
I am so sorry.

397
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,789
I cannot handle anything right now,

398
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,952
and I certainly cannot handle
losing another sister.

399
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,191
- Paige.
- Hey.

400
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,995
What happened?

401
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,715
Shane, I feel so bad.
I just got scared and I ran.

402
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,872
- Well, of course.
- Are you all right? What did they say?

403
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,190
It's no big deal,
just a little concussion.

404
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,353
- Oh, no.
- No, I'm gonna be fine.

405
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,229
They wouldn't be releasing me
if I wasn't, right?

406
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,674
I'm just glad you're okay too.

407
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,591
Yeah, well, physically anyway.

408
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,871
Did you talk to the cops yet?

409
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,393
- No, why?
- Why?

410
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,394
They wanna find out who attacked us,
that's why. I told them you saw him.

411
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,070
- You did what?
- Well, you did, didn't you?

412
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,988
Did you?

413
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,158
- Who are you?
- lnspector Cortez, Homicide.

414
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,958
I'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

415
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,078
Wait, Homicide?
No one was murdered.

416
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,959
Well, based on the m.o., if it's
the same perpetrator I think it was,

417
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,269
that just makes you lucky.

418
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,829
He killed two people
last week, violently.

419
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,395
One of them a young woman
who looked a little bit like you.

420
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,959
Prue.

421
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,953
Prue Halliwell.
Did you know her?

422
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,912
No. No, not really.

423
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,750
Well, in a way you did, right?

424
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,117
What way was that? Were you friends
of hers, a friend of her sisters?

425
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,832
No, not friends.

426
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,913
Then what?

427
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,790
Okay, look. I know
you know something.

428
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,279
I can see it in your eyes.

429
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,152
Just like I know
they know something too.

430
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,198
If you're trying to protect them
in any way, I'll find out.

431
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,030
Well, in that case, they have
nothing to worry about.

432
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,710
You rest up. I'll be back.

433
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,434
Excuse me.

434
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,238
Here, this should help.
It's chamomile.

435
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,674
I had three cups.

436
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,633
Thanks.

437
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,993
Doesn't seem real, does it?

438
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,789
No.

439
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,115
What are we gonna do
with all of her stuff?

440
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,191
And what are we gonna do
with her car?

441
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,112
I don't know.

442
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,395
Sell it, I guess.

443
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,832
- Unless you want it.
- No.

444
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,278
We're gonna get through this,
you know.

445
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,512
We just have to stick together.

446
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,755
- Well?
- Well, they don't know

447
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,196
anything about her,
so she's definitely not a whitelighter.

448
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,998
Then why can she orb, Leo?

449
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,998
They can't explain it.

450
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,476
Wait a minute. How is it possible
that they don't know--?

451
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,673
Sorry I took so long. I had to dodge
a couple of bounty hunters.

452
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,195
- Did you find anything out?
- You have no idea what I found out.

453
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,396
The Source doesn't think
she's a whitelighter at all.

454
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,835
In fact, he thinks she might
be another...

455
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,070
...Charmed One.
That's why he put Shax on it.

456
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,639
He thought he ended
the power of three.

457
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,598
Now he's worried this girl
may somehow reconstitute it.

458
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,758
No, but that's not possible.

459
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,717
Is that possible?

460
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,917
- Piper?
- Piper?

461
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,795
What's going on?

462
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,394
I'm going to ask Grams
what's going on, actually.

463
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,959
Grams?

464
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,032
"Your destiny still awaits," she says.

465
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,952
"There's a reason for everything,"
she says.

466
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,475
So it's time to summon
her transparent butt back here

467
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,870
and find out exactly
what that reason is.

468
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,190
- Okay, Piper, but what makes you--?
- Hear these words

469
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,555
Hear my cry
Spirit from the other side

470
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,076
Come to me, I summon thee
Cross now the great divide

471
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,518
Piper, why are you calling?

472
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,796
Phoebe... What's going on?

473
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,750
Grams, why does The Source think
that the Charmed Ones

474
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,797
can be reconstituted?

475
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,350
I-- I don't know
what you're talking about.

476
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,268
You know what, Grams? You were
a lousy liar when you were alive,

477
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,998
and now as a ghost, you're worse.

478
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,435
If you know something, Grams,
you have to tell us.

479
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,669
We deserve to know.

480
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,719
I can't. I'm sworn to secrecy.

481
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,438
By who?

482
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,589
By me.

483
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,635
By me.

484
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,398
Mom?

485
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,877
You can't just walk in here like this.

486
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,873
- Search warrant says I can.
- What the hell are you looking for?

487
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,952
Do you really expect me to believe
you don't know, inspector?

488
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,949
Follow me.
And keep your voice down.

489
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,274
We didn't tell anybody
because we were afraid

490
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,556
that there would be reprisals,

491
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,477
afraid that you girls would be denied
your powers, your birthright.

492
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,240
It happened after your father
and I were divorced,

493
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,789
when Sam and I were together.

494
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,109
Sam?

495
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,157
Her whitelighter.

496
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,880
Apples don't fall far
from the forbidden tree, I see.

497
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,478
Go on.

498
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,870
You were both toddlers.

499
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,112
You just thought Mommy
got a little fat.

500
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,512
You never knew I was pregnant.

501
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,673
- I was the only one who knew.
- And Sam, obviously.

502
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,875
Well, yes, of course.

503
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,953
We wanted to keep the baby...

504
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,075
...of course, but Mother--

505
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,232
Well l-- I knew it would be
disastrous.

506
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,313
You know, before you and Leo,
Piper, it wasn't just forbidden,

507
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,994
it was unthinkable for witches
to be with whitelighters,

508
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,390
I mean, let alone have children
with them.

509
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,357
So that's why we had to--

510
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,398
- Why we decided...
- Yes.

511
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,239
...to give the baby up.

512
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,153
Sam and I took her to a local church
as soon as she was born.

513
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,191
And we asked the nun there
to find a home for her.

514
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,996
And she found one,
a very, very good home.

515
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,149
Yes.

516
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,914
Explains why the Elders
didn't know about her.

517
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,313
All right, hold it.
Wait just one minute.

518
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,474
Are you telling me that that girl,
our innocent, is really...

519
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,953
...our sister?

520
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,913
Your baby sister.

521
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,630
- Their baby half-sister.
- But by my half,

522
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,199
which makes her a sister witch.

523
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,392
Well, actually, not yet anyway.

524
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,075
Not until all three of you
are here together by the book,

525
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,514
just like before.

526
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,598
Charmed...

527
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,758
...again.

528
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,877
And I thought my family
was screwed up.

529
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,754
Well, I'll be damned.

530
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,552
Darryl, do something.

531
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,432
He's a cop, Piper.
And he's got a search warrant.

532
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,751
And believe me, I've found
what I've been searching for.

533
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,957
Don't move. I'll shoot.

534
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,836
- And so will l.
- Cole.

535
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,070
Okay, inspector,
just put the gun down.

536
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,553
There is a very good explanation
for all of this.

537
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,351
Feel free to chime in
anytime, guys.

538
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,954
My whole life, I suspected
evil magic was real.

539
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,516
That there was something more.

540
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,956
I've seen too many horrible things
in the job to suspect otherwise.

541
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,152
Not the least of which are
the two murders that happened here.

542
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,637
- Wait, are you accusing us--?
- I've just begun to accuse you, lady!

543
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,279
All right, fine, you caught us.
Congratulations.

544
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,237
So, what are you going
to do about it? Shoot us?

545
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,279
Easy, Grams. Not all of us
are dead, remember?

546
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,829
All right, look. You can't arrest us.
Especially not them.

547
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,833
- Nobody will ever believe you.
- Maybe not at first.

548
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,150
I'm putting this whole place
under constant surveillance.

549
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,594
I'm taping your every move.

550
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,679
Sooner or later, I'll catch you
doing something supernatural.

551
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,519
And then--

552
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,158
Think you've been through
enough today, huh?

553
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,799
Thank you.

554
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,192
Darryl, go, get out of here. We don't
want you to take the fall for this.

555
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,554
No. It's okay.

556
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,474
No, it's not. This is our problem.
He wants to expose us, not you.

557
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,631
Let us take care of this. Please?

558
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,151
If you need me, you know
where to find me, huh?

559
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,992
Doesn't solve your problem.
He's gonna wake up eventually.

560
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,957
You just bought yourself some time.

561
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,112
Which you're gonna need,
especially if you wanna save your...

562
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,549
Sister?

563
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,794
Well, what are you waiting for?
Just write a spell. Get rid of him.

564
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,355
Get rid of him?

565
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,115
Well, you know what I mean.
Dump him somewhere. Anywhere.

566
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,430
With all the witches in this room,
we ought to be able

567
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,875
to do something with him.
I mean, just start rhyming.

568
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,674
Take him back, take him away
Remove him now, don't let him stay

569
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,036
We call the spirits to help undo

570
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,317
And send him off to...

571
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,915
... Timbuktu

572
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,718
Whoa, it worked.

573
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,237
Timbuktu? You sent him
to Timbuktu?

574
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,154
All right, well, it was the only thing l
could think of that rhymed with "undo."

575
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,079
Don't worry. I'll... I'll find him.

576
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,553
Okay, well, this is way too much
for me to handle. Way too much.

577
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,188
Nobody can blame you
for being angry, sweetie.

578
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,272
Angry? Yeah, I'm angry.
I'm confused.

579
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,590
And you know what?
This-- This is just crazy.

580
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,035
You cannot float in here
after all these years

581
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,431
and go, "Oh, gosh, I forgot.
By the way, you've got a sister."

582
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,352
Especially not today of all days.

583
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,232
I know it's a lot, sweetie,

584
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,038
more than anybody
should have to deal with.

585
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,555
But you're going to have
to deal with it.

586
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,472
The best way you know how.

587
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,913
Losing Prue,
learning about another sister...

588
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,478
...this is your path.
It's your destiny.

589
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,155
Get angry at it, cry about it,
but don't fight it,

590
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,189
or it'll consume you.

591
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,232
Come on, Patty.

592
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,236
The rest is up to them.

593
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,476
I can't sense where she is because
she's technically not a witch yet.

594
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,234
All right, so all we have to go on
is that church that Mom mentioned

595
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,516
- and the nun.
- Let's just get one thing straight:

596
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,954
I am only doing this to save her.

597
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,430
I'm not remotely interested
in reconstituting...

598
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,194
...the Charmed Ones.

599
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,956
I... The door was open.

600
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,999
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be here.

601
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,588
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.

602
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,436
We were just coming to look for you.

603
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,830
- You were?
- Yep.

604
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,355
Come on in. Welcome. I'm Phoebe.

605
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,273
- And this is--
- Piper.

606
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,590
I know. I've been to your club.
It's pretty great.

607
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,636
Thank you. And you are...?

608
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,989
Paige. My name is Paige.

609
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,554
Another P. Imagine that.

610
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,031
It's nice to meet you.

611
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,594
Okay. What was that?

612
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,955
I think that means
you're supposed to be here.

613
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,708
- Run! Get upstairs!
- Leo!

614
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,871
What are we doing?
What is that thing?

615
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,996
We'll explain later.

616
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,232
Okay, just say this spell
out loud with us, okay?

617
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,512
- Spell? What are you guys, witches?
- And so are you, we hope.

618
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,071
Well, we're about to find out.

619
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,320
Evil wind that blows
That which forms below

620
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,393
No longer may you dwell
Death takes you with this spell

621
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,199
It's not enough.

622
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,588
Shax was just the messenger.

623
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,312
- We gotta get The Source.
- The source of what?

624
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,198
Of all evil.

625
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,588
What have you guys
turned me into?

626
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,118
- Paige.
- Wait.

627
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,876
My assassin failed.
The witch is alive.

628
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,270
Yes, I know.

629
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,273
You told me her future
was short-lived.

630
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,714
You told me--

631
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,429
I told you only that it appeared
to be short-lived.

632
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,315
Seeing into the future
is not always exact,

633
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,675
especially when magical forces
are at play.

634
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,310
The power of three is strong.
She'll be almost untouchable

635
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,869
now that she's united
with her new sisters.

636
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,315
Once the bond is formed perhaps.

637
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,675
But it has yet to.

638
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,070
Which means she's vulnerable,

639
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,674
easily swayed.

640
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,316
Forty-eight little hours.

641
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,597
The window of opportunity agreed to
eons ago by both sides

642
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,034
to protect free will.

643
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,396
The great flaw in the grand design.

644
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,676
She hasn't chosen
the other side yet.

645
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,990
Well, she's young, confused.

646
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,549
Doesn't know which way to turn.

647
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,110
You must seduce her
into using her powers for evil.

648
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,590
Then she will become evil.
And that's even better than killing her.

649
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,990
Which, of course, you could still do.

650
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,431
You need to get close to her.

651
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:47,311
Read her soul, corrupt it,
and she's yours.

652
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,879
And, you.

653
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,556
You need to see the future
more clearly, Oracle...

654
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,316
...for your own future.

655
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,389
What the hell? Who are you?

656
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,037
For now, I am you.

657
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,991
Oh, my God, the most horrible thing
just happened to me.

658
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,392
I can't explain--

659
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,677
It's okay, honey. I'm here now.

660
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,798
It's okay.

661
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,911
I don't understand how you
can keep healing innocents

662
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,798
but you can't figure out a way
to heal yourself.

663
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,077
Well, it's kind of hard to heal myself
when I'm knocked out.

664
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,471
Leo, how's it possible for an angel
to even get knocked out?

665
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,710
I mean, you are, after all,
technically dead.

666
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,791
Three years together,
and now you're asking questions?

667
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,474
Well, I think the more
appropriate question

668
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,791
is how does a whitelighter
get somebody knocked up?

669
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,836
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, what do you think it means?

670
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,238
If this is about Paige,
I swear the Elders had no idea

671
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,789
that she even existed.
Or that she was your sister.

672
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,918
- Sister witch.
- Half witch, half whitelighter.

673
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,672
Let's not forget that little surprise.

674
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,674
I still can't believe that Mom
kept that a secret from us.

675
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,035
Well, it sounded like she didn't
have much of a choice.

676
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,918
We're her daughters.
She could have found a way

677
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,514
to share that information with us.

678
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,952
That better not be another
long-lost relative.

679
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,510
- Hi, Piper.
- Hi there.

680
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,435
- Where's Cortez?
- Who?

681
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,433
Inspector Cortez,
the one I hit over the head.

682
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,268
The one you said you would
take care of. He's missing.

683
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,910
Police inspectors are not supposed
to be missing. Where is he?

684
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,629
- Well, I kind of sent him to--
- Timbuktu.

685
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,233
It rhymed with "undo."

686
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,275
Timbuktu.

687
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,749
- It's okay. Cole went to get him.
- Cole?

688
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,914
- Cole.
- Wait.

689
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,190
Damn bounty hunters.
They're like gnats.

690
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,315
Where's the inspector?

691
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,152
Don't worry, I found him.
Moved him to a place

692
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,790
he can't tell a soul what he saw.
Literally.

693
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,190
What do you mean?
Where did you put him?

694
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,835
In the basement?

695
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,355
No, I think he means
a little bit further down than that.

696
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,909
Cole, he's a cop.
He's one of the good guys.

697
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,832
He's also the one who can
expose them as witches.

698
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,673
I'd think that you, above anybody,
would want to avoid that at all costs.

699
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,876
Not at that cost.
We have to save him.

700
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,992
Save him? What do you mean,
save him? What--? What's going on?

701
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,469
You know what? We are gonna
take care of this whole mess.

702
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,676
- Wait a sec, hold--
- You don't worry about it.

703
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,875
All right.

704
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,999
Okay, maybe you can talk
to the inspector, reason with him.

705
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,037
And what if he can't?
What if you two get exposed?

706
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,078
What's to say the same thing won't
happen to you that happened to Prue?

707
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,239
Well, it's a risk we'll have to take.

708
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,709
You know what, there's another risk
you guys have to worry about.

709
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,598
On the way back, I heard gargoyles.

710
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,513
Gargoyles? You mean,
like, statues?

711
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,513
That's only in their resting state.
They come alive to ward off evil.

712
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,148
In this case, I think they're trying
to ward off The Source.

713
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,355
I think he's surfaced.

714
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,675
Wait, what?

715
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,914
He's here? Now? Where?

716
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,594
I don't know. Could be anywhere.
Or anyone.

717
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,749
He probably came for Paige.

718
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,471
But she doesn't stand a chance
against him.

719
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,198
She doesn't even know
what her power is yet.

720
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,158
Leo, we don't stand a chance
against him.

721
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,435
Not without Prue.

722
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,231
But you might with Paige.
The new power of three.

723
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,918
Can you sense her?

724
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,952
I don't think so. She's too new.

725
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,953
Well, then we just have to start with
the church Mom was talking about.

726
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,873
- Piper--
- What? Phoebe,

727
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,271
I'm not crazy about it either,
but we can't just do nothing. Not now.

728
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,317
Mom wouldn't want us to.

729
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,436
And neither would Prue.

730
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,438
Oscar, what's the matter,
sweetheart?

731
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,750
It's okay, I'm home.

732
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,433
Maybe he doesn't like me.

733
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,034
Don't be ridiculous.
He's always liked you.

734
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,918
Well, aren't you gonna tell me
what happened last night?

735
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,674
No, it's nothing.

736
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,994
Seemed like something to me.
You were pretty scared.

737
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,835
Let's just say that when I wanted
to find out who I was,

738
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,514
I didn't want to find out
I was a freak.

739
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,558
- Can we just talk about this later?
- Of course.

740
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,873
Hey...

741
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,275
... I never got a chance to thank you
for taking such good care of me.

742
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,075
Oscar.

743
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,874
Listen, I should get to work anyway.

744
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,032
I'm in enough trouble with the boss
as it is.

745
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,118
Well, I know how badly
you want to be there

746
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,236
for that placement hearing.

747
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,795
- How did you know about that?
- Well, you told me, remember?

748
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,709
Little boy, abusive dad.

749
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,348
You said nothing gets under
your skin more than that.

750
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,236
Right, okay.

751
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,958
Make yourself at home.
Stop by for lunch if you feel up to it.

752
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,439
Count on it.

753
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,518
Help me!

754
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,556
You. Stay away from me!

755
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,876
- Stay away!
- We're here to save you.

756
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,715
- You're the one who put me here!
- No, no. Actually, that was just me.

757
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,871
Hoping you'd change your mind
about the girls. Have you?

758
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,554
Killing me is the only way
to keep me from trying to stop you!

759
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,278
We're not gonna kill you, inspector.

760
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,233
But what you don't understand
is that by exposing the girls,

761
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,118
you're not stopping evil,
you're helping it.

762
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,349
Oh, yeah, right.

763
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,513
You do understand
that if we take him back, it's over.

764
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,598
I'll lose Phoebe.
And you'll lose Piper.

765
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,955
- Take my hand.
- No.

766
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,438
Take my hand.

767
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,273
Where else can I take you
that's worse than this?

768
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,831
- So how's Aunt Julie?
- Much better.

769
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,116
- Yeah?
- Thank you, dear, for asking.

770
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,157
Is her hip any better?

771
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,189
Jake and Carol Grisanti
for Mr. Cowan?

772
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,430
Okay. I'll let him know you're here.

773
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,473
I'm sorry. Say that again.
I got distracted.

774
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,995
He'll be with you in a few minutes.

775
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,033
I'm gonna go wash up, all right?

776
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,668
What do you want?

777
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,753
Oh, God.

778
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,549
Hey, before you go,

779
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,358
- can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

780
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,114
Do you guys still go to that church
that Mom and Dad used to go to?

781
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,510
- Yeah, we still go.
- Is there still a nun

782
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,272
called Sister Agnes there?

783
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,274
- lsn't she the one who found you?
- Yeah, right, the one that found me.

784
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,908
- Have you spoken to her?
- No, no, I haven't spoken to her,

785
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,957
but something's come up.
I think I should.

786
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,352
Uncle Dave, I gotta go.
I'll call you back, okay?

787
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,636
- Okay, I love you, Paige.
- Yeah, I love you too.

788
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,311
- Mr. Cowan.
- Hey, look, Paige, I got this, okay?

789
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,675
But you can't let that little boy
go home with that jerk.

790
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,991
Paige, number one, you don't know
for a fact he's abusing the boy.

791
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,355
And number two,
this is none of your business.

792
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,517
You are an assistant,
not a social worker.

793
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,558
That's because you're too cheap
to make me one.

794
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,800
Phoebe, I think I found the...

795
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,791
The church.

796
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,275
Phoebe?

797
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,311
What are you doing in here?

798
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,033
You remember the time I borrowed
this from Prue without asking her?

799
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,429
Which time?

800
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,790
When my boyfriend's cat peed on it.

801
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,357
She got so mad, I thought
she was gonna have a stroke.

802
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,515
But the funny thing was...

803
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,597
...she got mad at you,

804
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,479
because she thought that you
were the one that borrowed it.

805
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,269
And you never told her the truth.

806
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,797
She never knew it was really me.

807
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,075
I miss her so much.

808
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,318
I know.

809
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,358
Me too.

810
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,556
I was wondering
when you were gonna let go.

811
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,837
I was just-- I was trying to-- Thanks.

812
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:04,359
--stay strong, you know,
keep it together for you.

813
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,719
And then I put all my energy
into trying to save Paige

814
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,156
because I figured only one of us
could break down at a time.

815
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,470
Otherwise we'd both be useless.

816
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,830
I'm scared, Piper.

817
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,238
I am really, really scared.

818
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,279
She always took the lead.
She was...

819
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,559
She was our big sister.

820
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,600
How are we supposed to go on
without her?

821
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,034
How are we supposed to go up
against The Source without her?

822
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,391
I don't know.

823
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,358
But I do know that we can't let
the bastard get Paige either.

824
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,709
So no matter what we think or feel,
she is our sister.

825
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,879
And sisters protect each other.

826
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,432
- What's happening?
- Nothing's been decided.

827
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,830
- We're gonna meet again tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

828
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,638
You can't let him go home
with that kid.

829
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,949
I can and I am.

830
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,556
Look, Paige, you weren't in there.
He was very persuasive.

831
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,676
Persuasive? What about
the police report?

832
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,398
What about the counsellor's
recommendations?

833
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,710
Look, Paige, I know
how you feel about these cases.

834
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,155
But we can't make a decision
based on what you think.

835
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,754
We have to base it on fact.
Right now, we don't have enough yet.

836
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,433
I'm sorry.

837
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,593
You got a problem, lady?

838
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,550
Yeah, I do. I got a problem
with people who hit their kids.

839
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,188
- Come on, Jake, let's just go.
- Wait, wait.

840
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,749
Listen, I can do
whatever the hell I want to...

841
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,679
...and there's nothing
you can do to stop me.

842
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,954
- Where do you think you're going?
- Church.

843
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,876
Can you give me a hand?
I think that he must have slipped.

844
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,958
Excuse me?

845
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,590
- Are you Sister Agnes?
- Yes.

846
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,196
- And who might you be?
- I'm Paige. Paige Matthews.

847
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,709
You might not remember me.

848
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,077
I probably changed a little bit
since you last saw me

849
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,913
on August 2nd, 1 977.

850
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,392
Does that ring any bells?

851
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,956
Oh, dear Lord.

852
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:38,157
I was just about your age
when they came.

853
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,874
They?

854
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,873
My mother and my father?

855
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:48,037
They came in a swirl
of bright white lights, just like...

856
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,319
...angels.

857
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,912
White lights? What do you mean?

858
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,510
Well, that's how they appeared,
with you in their arms.

859
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,789
I was stunned.
I didn't know what to think.

860
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,874
They said you were in great danger.

861
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,430
That they had no other choice
but to give you up

862
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,914
to protect you.

863
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,832
- Danger? What kind of danger?
- Well, they didn't say.

864
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,512
But I could tell from their pain
that it must be very real.

865
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,599
They asked me to find you
a good home,

866
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,478
a safe home,

867
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,313
and to keep their secret...

868
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,753
...until you came looking.

869
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,278
But how could they know?

870
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,520
Because you come from them,
my dear.

871
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:42,075
As wonderful and precious
as your adoptive parents were to you...

872
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,990
...you still come from angels.

873
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,436
They asked me to save this for you
for this day.

874
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,391
It's what they bundled you up in.

875
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,755
Your mother had only one request:

876
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,275
That your name begin with a P.

877
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,674
- Yes, may I help you?
- Hi.

878
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,956
Hey, what's up?
We need to get you out of here.

879
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,155
What did you do to her?

880
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,239
Oh, she just froze her.
She'll be fine.

881
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,756
Yeah, lucky I didn't blow her up.
My powers have been a little off lately.

882
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,399
Piper.

883
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,710
- Is that our blanket?
- No, that's mine.

884
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,359
- Leave me alone.
- All right, jeez.

885
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,555
Paige.

886
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,153
Paige.

887
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,915
Paige.

888
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,075
- Stop, or I'll freeze.
- She's a witch, you can't freeze her.

889
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,073
- She doesn't know that.
- Will you please just leave me alone.

890
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,719
Look, we know
what you're going through.

891
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,633
We went through the same thing when
we first found out we were witches too.

892
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,349
Look, you just gotta trust us.
Somebody very, very bad is after you.

893
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,392
Trust you? You just froze a nun.

894
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,073
How do I know
you're not the bad ones?

895
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,038
- Well, if we are, then you are, sister.
- Piper.

896
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,668
What? Fine, then you try.

897
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,072
You have a magical power,
you know.

898
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,196
At least, if you're really
a Charmed One, you do.

899
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,158
And the sooner you learn it, the sooner
you'll be able to protect yourself.

900
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,639
- I have a power?
- According to the prophecy,

901
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,951
the third sister has the power
to move things with her mind.

902
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,109
Like Prue could.

903
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,156
- How does it work?
- You concentrate on an object,

904
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,038
Iike that candle right there.

905
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,959
And then you just wave your arm
at it.

906
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:36,078
Or you could squint your eyes.
She used to squint her eyes.

907
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,793
Maybe I'm not one of you after all
if I can't even make that candle--

908
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,120
So perhaps the whitelighter
in her makes it work differently?

909
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,355
Half-breed.

910
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,071
She better be here, Oracle.

911
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,516
- I'm running out of time.
- She is. Don't worry.

912
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,953
No!

913
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,195
What is that?

914
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:17,955
I don't know.

915
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,910
- Paige.
- Shane?

916
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,475
What's the matter?
My God, what happened?

917
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,039
I don't know. Something's after me.

918
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,235
- Paige.
- Paige.

919
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,789
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Paige, come back!

920
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:42,039
- What the hell was that?
- Good question.

921
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,231
Look, we didn't have
to bring you back, you know.

922
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,515
We could have just let you rot.

923
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,148
- Cole, I don't think this is helping any.
- Like your way is.

924
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,239
Cortez, where you been?

925
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,709
- Operations.
- This is lnspector Cortez.

926
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,757
I need a surveillance team,
round the clock.

927
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,831
- I'll take one shift.
- What are you doing?

928
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,070
What I said I'd do
before you clipped me from behind.

929
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,037
You're making a big mistake,
inspector.

930
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,792
You have no idea what you're doing.

931
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,795
- You wanna bet?
- Something's wrong.

932
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,075
Piper's calling.

933
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,276
Just so you know,

934
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,238
whatever pain you put Phoebe
through because of what you're doing

935
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,233
will be nothing compared
to the pain I put you through.

936
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,674
You understand?

937
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,350
Cortez, you there?
What's the address?

938
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,318
1 329 Prescott Street.

939
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,757
Phoebe and Piper Halliwell.

940
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,434
They're murder suspects.

941
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,953
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

942
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,838
Come on. Come on.

943
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,597
- I got four guys who can do it.
- Yeah, thanks.

944
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,548
- Hey, listen, Cortez.
- Let go of me.

945
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,308
You make me sick.

946
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,516
How long have you been
covering up for them, huh?

947
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,389
How many other murders have
you ignored just to protect them?

948
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,869
You're a disgrace to that shield,
my friend.

949
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,916
You think this is the first time
I have risked my career for those girls?

950
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,196
My life, my family?

951
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,958
They're the best people
I've ever met.

952
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,753
They'll do more good
than you'll ever know.

953
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,794
- And it cost them their sister.
- Hey, hey, inspector, ease up.

954
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,950
- You all right?
- I'm good, I'm good.

955
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,759
Yeah.

956
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,873
So The Source was there
at the church?

957
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,077
Well, the gargoyles weren't
exactly whistling "Dixie," Leo.

958
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,278
Plus, something pretty powerful
knocked us on our asses.

959
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,635
But if he was there,
why didn't he try to kill Paige?

960
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,916
Maybe he didn't want to go up
against the Charmed Ones.

961
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,312
No, it doesn't make sense. He knows
that Paige is new to her powers.

962
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,152
If ever there was a time to attack...

963
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,119
Wait a minute.

964
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,549
What if he's not trying
to kill her anymore?

965
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,551
What if he's trying to lure her
to his side?

966
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,188
Translation, please?

967
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,669
- The mythological window.
- There's a window of opportunity,

968
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,398
- an opening.
- Forty-eight hours.

969
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,758
Right, 48 hours where
a nascent witch who hasn't chosen

970
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,515
to use her power for good or evil yet
can be swayed either way.

971
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,750
Wait, so all he has to do
is cast a spell on her?

972
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,718
No, he can't. It has to be her choice,

973
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,950
but he can tempt her, entice her.

974
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,678
If he gets her to use
her powers for evil--

975
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,559
She becomes evil forever.

976
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,917
Who makes up
these cockamamie rules?

977
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,869
Oh, never mind.

978
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:23,237
Okay, so we have less
than 24 hours to get to Paige

979
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,913
and no idea how to find her.

980
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,078
But I'll bet The Source does.

981
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,839
Here.

982
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,513
Thanks.

983
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,793
I'm so sorry to involve you in all this.

984
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,598
All of what?

985
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,433
Paige...

986
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,798
...what's going on?

987
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,631
I don't know.

988
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,155
I'm so confused.
I don't know what to do.

989
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,719
Hey.

990
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,471
You don't have to know.

991
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,596
You're safe here...

992
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,673
...with me.

993
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,630
I'll take care of you.

994
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,670
Sure you don't want me
to turn Belthazor loose on Cortez,

995
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,875
just for a minute or two?

996
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,077
No. He doesn't have anything
on the girls yet.

997
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,596
Besides, now is no time to be blurring
the line between good and evil.

998
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,310
This is useless.

999
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,277
We're never gonna find Paige
without a little help.

1000
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,474
Works every time.

1001
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,238
Okay, an enchantment spell.

1002
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,958
Wait, how is this
gonna help us find her?

1003
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:50,671
Well, maybe it's not to find Paige.
Maybe it's so we can lD The Source.

1004
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:54,116
See the last line? It's,
"So she can reveal the evil within."

1005
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,396
But that'll only help
if we can find him.

1006
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,039
Maybe we can.

1007
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,669
Or at least, maybe you can.

1008
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:02,989
What does he mean?

1009
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,517
Demons can sense
The Source's aura.

1010
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:13,276
It's how he reminds us of his power,
his reach.

1011
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,998
Maybe if I focused on it--

1012
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,118
Then he'll know you're doing it,
and he'll find you.

1013
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,599
Not if I was careful.

1014
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,200
It's your only chance
at saving your sister.

1015
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,319
Okay, so we need something
to enchant.

1016
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,353
Right.

1017
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,871
- How about these?
- Oh, Phoebe.

1018
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,554
- What? They're perfect.
- All right.

1019
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:44,711
Magic forces, far and wide
Enchant these so those can't hide

1020
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:49,237
Allow this witch to use their ends
So she can reveal the evil within

1021
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,908
Okay, better test them.

1022
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,593
- Well?
- Nothing. You look the same.

1023
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,634
How about me?

1024
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,149
What?

1025
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,438
What do I look like?

1026
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,919
You look like hell.

1027
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,512
Enchanting.

1028
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,870
Thanks for the magical assist,
Grams.

1029
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,315
How do you know
it wasn't somebody else?

1030
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,552
You know who you are now, Paige.

1031
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,393
This is where your destiny lies.

1032
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,154
It lies not with your sister witches.

1033
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,873
It's for no one but you.

1034
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,597
This is what you've been
searching for your whole life.

1035
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,877
This is why you have the power.

1036
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,592
You can't stop me.

1037
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,196
Use your power
for your own desires,

1038
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,272
to seek your own revenge.

1039
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,310
Use your power.
Call for his heart.

1040
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,755
Call for his life.

1041
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,473
Heart.

1042
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,149
Jake, what is it?

1043
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,758
No!

1044
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,309
I don't see Paige anywhere.

1045
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,232
Are you sure this is
the right place, Cole?

1046
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,913
The Source is here. I can sense it.

1047
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,037
Wait, there she is.

1048
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,474
- What is she doing?
- I don't know,

1049
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,278
but she's got a black aura
around her.

1050
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,317
- The Source?
- No, it can't be.

1051
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,835
If Phoebe saw my demonic self,
then she'd see his too.

1052
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,116
Yeah, well, whatever it is,
it's not good.

1053
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,759
Come on.

1054
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,197
Jake! Jake, what--?

1055
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:41,955
Paige? Paige, it's me, Phoebe.
And Piper.

1056
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,191
He's evil. He's hurting his child.

1057
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,839
Someone, hurting--

1058
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,399
No, you're being seduced
into doing this.

1059
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,516
No! No, Jake!

1060
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,113
All right, you know what? Hi.

1061
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,238
Leo, take her, go home.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1062
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,994
Let's get out of here.

1063
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,591
Are you sure you're all right?

1064
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,876
Maybe you better lay back down.

1065
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,558
I'm not covering for you
anymore, Carol.

1066
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,190
You keep your hands off our son.

1067
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,392
You two go ahead.
I'm gonna stay behind,

1068
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,949
make sure The Source
doesn't follow you.

1069
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,872
Don't die too quickly, traitor.

1070
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,317
I want your beloved witch
to see your last breath...

1071
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,712
...to feel the heartache of loss again.

1072
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:31,150
Oracle, find Paige one last time.

1073
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:37,875
Leo, where's--?

1074
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,392
I'm having a hard time convincing her
that she is not evil.

1075
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,869
- I see that.
- Lamp.

1076
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,350
Bright side? At least she's getting
the hang of her new power.

1077
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,715
That was Mom's crystal.

1078
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,633
- Okay, somebody--
- Off of me!

1079
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,758
Okay, relax. Relax.
All right, now what?

1080
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,150
We just better hope there's
some kind of Wiccan exorcism

1081
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,550
in the Book of Shadows,
because-- Yeah.

1082
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,153
Who are you?

1083
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,239
Piper!

1084
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,559
Piper!

1085
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,630
That's the-- That's the--
Look, look, look, look, look.

1086
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,518
I know who that is.

1087
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,472
Your powers are strong.

1088
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,756
But will they be enough
without the power of three?

1089
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,319
Shane, what's going on?

1090
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,470
It's okay, honey. I'm here now.

1091
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,508
Stay away from me.

1092
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,989
She still has free will.
You can't force her to choose.

1093
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,390
Oh, but she's already chosen.

1094
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,595
Haven't you?

1095
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,275
Come with me.

1096
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,838
You'll be safe forever, I promise.

1097
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,433
Don't listen to him, he's lying.

1098
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,068
They only want you for your power.

1099
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,312
You don't have to share it.
It's yours.

1100
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,874
You've already seen
what you can do with it.

1101
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,553
You did what nobody else could do.

1102
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,515
You nearly saved my son
from his father,

1103
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,348
from all the pain and suffering
he's put him through.

1104
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,437
Please help me.
Don't let him hurt me anymore.

1105
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,828
You're my only hope.

1106
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,913
No!

1107
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,749
Help me!

1108
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,752
Phoebe?

1109
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,480
Okay, come on, come on.

1110
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,077
I guess blood's a little thicker
than evil.

1111
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,152
I've broken the Charmed circle before.
I'll do it again.

1112
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:21,029
Besides, it wasn't a complete loss,

1113
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,555
thanks to Belthazor.

1114
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,679
- What did you do to him?
- Oh, my God.

1115
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,270
Inspector, would you get out
of here?!

1116
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,634
- Looks like evil wins again, huh?
- Not if I can help it.

1117
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,917
- How'd you do that?
- That's what whitelighters do.

1118
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,718
We heal good people.

1119
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,391
We have to go find Cole.

1120
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,395
Cole?

1121
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,238
Oh, no.

1122
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,748
No, no, no.

1123
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:30,037
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1124
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,075
- Heal him.
- You know that it's against the rules.

1125
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,470
Leo, screw the rules.
The Elders owe us.

1126
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,111
Even if I could, I could only heal
his human half,

1127
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:43,511
and that wouldn't be enough power
to save him.

1128
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,238
Aren't I half whitelighter?

1129
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,153
I mean, couldn't I use my half
to offset his half?

1130
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,232
It's worth a try.

1131
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,118
Take my hand.

1132
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,119
Hold your other hand
over his wound.

1133
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,638
That was good, right?

1134
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,791
That was very good.

1135
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,598
Let's just hope it wasn't all
for nothing.

1136
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,232
Yeah, drive safe.

1137
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,073
Thank you.

1138
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,198
Thanks, Anna.

1139
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:33,237
- Feels good to be here again.
- Feels good to be anywhere again.

1140
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,079
I will drink to that.

1141
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,840
- Don't ever scare me like that again.
- Promise.

1142
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,233
You okay?

1143
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,112
I'm not sure.

1144
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,639
Prue?

1145
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,474
Yeah.

1146
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,837
We barely got through the funeral, and
then everything started to go crazy,

1147
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,639
and we haven't had a chance
to mourn yet.

1148
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,552
And that's just not right.

1149
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,755
I think we'll have
the rest of our lives for that.

1150
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:13,156
I'm still not sure about continuing on
with this destiny thing.

1151
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:17,155
I need some time to think about it.
I hope you're okay with that.

1152
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,757
Absolutely.

1153
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,516
And I hope you're okay with it too.

1154
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,599
They may not be, but I am.

1155
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,116
So does this mean
I get free drinks now?

1156
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,508
I didn't mean it like that.
It's not that I really drink or...

1157
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,558
Okay, I'm just gonna go.

1158
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:41,518
No. Paige, you belong here.
Remember?

1159
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,353
Are you sure? I don't wanna intrude.

1160
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,913
Come on. Come sit right here.

1161
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,356
Okay, so maybe
Leo and I should go...

1162
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,231
...pretend like we've got something
better to do.

1163
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,789
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

1164
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,196
I won't stay long. I just wanted
to come by and thank you.

1165
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,952
- For what?
- For what? You mean,

1166
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,395
aside from saving my life?

1167
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,790
I feel like I should bake you
a cake or something.

1168
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:16,949
Do you cook?

1169
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,672
No. No, not really.

1170
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,039
So how's Shane?

1171
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,795
He's okay, I guess. Except for I'm not
too sure he wants to see me anymore.

1172
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,599
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, I can't say I blame him,

1173
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,876
you know. He doesn't know exactly
what happened to him,

1174
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,678
but he knows it's something bad,

1175
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,115
and he knows it's somehow
connected to me.

1176
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,272
Yeah, well, you're not truly one of us
until you've dated a demon,

1177
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,271
so welcome to the club.

1178
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,354
Can I ask you a question?

1179
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,437
Why did you come
to Prue's funeral?

1180
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,998
I mean, you never even
met her, right?

1181
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,873
No, I never did.

1182
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,392
I don't want this to be taken
the wrong way...

1183
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,590
...but I just feel like part of me
lost her too.

1184
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,589
And I just...

1185
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,436
I felt drawn to her, to all you guys.

1186
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:15,075
I guess it was just part of me
trying to find out who I was.

1187
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,557
Come on. There's something
we need to show you.

1188
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,389
Show me what?

1189
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,679
What good magic can do.

1190
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:46,035
Hear these words, hear my cry
Spirit from the other side

1191
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:50,358
Come to me, I summon thee
Cross now the great divide

1192
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,994
There's someone here
we thought you should meet.

1193
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,949
Paige.

1194
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,229
Mom?

1195
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,833
Welcome home.
