0
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,238
All right, it should be around here
somewhere.

1
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:32,877
And you can't be more precise
about what it is?

2
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,688
Okay. I told you,
it's some sort of evil-y thing.

3
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,761
Why did I let you talk me into this?
I should be at home procrastinating

4
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:41,568
my delinquent ethics paper,
not chasing some wild goose.

5
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,039
Wild demon, okay?
I was scrying for unnatural activity,

6
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:47,165
and this place came up
loud and clear.

7
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:49,081
Wait a minute.

8
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,849
Are you telling me you're actually
looking for trouble now?

9
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:54,764
Prue, what happened to
putting more balance in your life?

10
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,238
You know, less Wicca wonder,
more Prue.

11
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,247
Listen, I shot a magazine cover
yesterday, I had a date last night,

12
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:02,001
and this morning,
I'm searching for evil.

13
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:03,488
Can't get more balanced
than that.

14
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,078
Right, just your typical
everyday Cosmo girl.

15
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:07,961
Well, you and Piper don't need
me anymore,

16
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:10,404
so that leaves me plenty of time
to help those who do.

17
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:13,848
Is that what you think?
That we don't need you anymore?

18
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:15,880
It's just that ever since
Piper got married

19
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,243
and you hooked up with Cole,

20
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,843
I feel like I don't have to watch out
for you guys as much.

21
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:21,881
Prue, this is a good thing.

22
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,002
Yeah.

23
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,444
- I think that's it.
- Good.

24
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:31,925
All right, on the count of three:
One, two...

25
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:34,640
Oh, my God!

26
00:01:34,809 --> 00:01:38,802
- It's the coffeemaker I wanted!
- Phoebe, it's just a carton.

27
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:41,402
Right. Of course.

28
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:44,447
See? I need you. You just protected
me from making a fool out of myself.

29
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,840
Now there's a full-time job.

30
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,601
Thank you very much.

31
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,845
Hey, so how's Cole?
I haven't seen him in a while.

32
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,842
Oh, he's been dodging
demonic bounty hunters, you know,

33
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,604
but he still manages to shimmer into
the bedroom when he has a chance.

34
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:02,045
Pops in and then pops right back out,
if you know what I'm talking about.

35
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,722
I vaguely remember.

36
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:06,119
And even though I'm really happy
to see him,

37
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:09,645
it's starting to raise old issues for me.

38
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:14,485
Like does he really love me, or is he
just interested in my charms?

39
00:02:14,649 --> 00:02:18,642
Oh, Phoebe, come on. You know
for a magical fact that he loves you.

40
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:21,277
And think about how many times
he risked his life to save you.

41
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:22,928
I don't think that's just sex.

42
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:25,842
Yeah, but what if it was really,
really great sex?

43
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,522
Well...

44
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:31,318
Seek and ye shall find.

45
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:34,168
- Please, just one more...
- I told you!

46
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:36,087
What you want is no longer
in this box.

47
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,438
I need more.

48
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:39,924
Don't you understand?
I gotta have more!

49
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:42,484
You can never get enough greed,
can you?

50
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,161
Hey!

51
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:52,487
The box.

52
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:03,360
- The box belongs to Lukas!
- Yeah?

53
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:06,322
Well, tell Lukas it's been impounded.

54
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:08,440
Hey, it's okay. It's over.

55
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:11,361
I gotta have more.

56
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:13,924
Don't you understand?
I gotta have more!

57
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:17,688
- Box.
- No!

58
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,922
This guy just came out of nowhere.
I have no idea where.

59
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,045
His ID shows he's Robert Pike.

60
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,006
- Robert Pike?
- Yeah.

61
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,004
Did you see any eyewitnesses?

62
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:31,002
- Hey.
- Hey.

63
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:32,761
Did you find out anything?

64
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,324
Nothing unusual.

65
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:37,208
Unfortunately, we get these
kind of suicides all the time.

66
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:38,888
Darryl, this was not a suicide, okay?

67
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:41,199
He was driven into the street,
demonically driven.

68
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:43,564
I think that I can recognise
the signs by now.

69
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:45,521
Right.

70
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,839
This Robert Pike.
He was married, with two kids,

71
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:52,002
worked for Bregson Investments
as a stockbroker. Very successful.

72
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,961
The demon accused him
of being greedy.

73
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,643
- I wonder if there's a connection.
- It's hard to believe.

74
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:59,607
It seems like Mr. Pike
wasn't your typical stockbroker.

75
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:01,925
From all accounts,
he was more of a philanthropist.

76
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:05,485
He even hosted a fundraiser for the
American Cancer Society last night.

77
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:07,600
Something must've changed
in a hurry

78
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:10,203
because when we saw him,
all he cared about was the box.

79
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:13,162
- What box?
- This one.

80
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:18,806
- What's in it?
- I don't know.

81
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:21,529
But whatever it is, apparently
it's worth dying for.

82
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:24,887
In your opinion, was there anything

83
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:27,005
the bus driver could've done
to avoid him?

84
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:29,598
No, it happened too fast.
He didn't have time to react.

85
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:32,482
All right. I think that's it.

86
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:35,959
If I could have your home number,
in case I have any other questions.

87
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,921
The same as my sister's.
We live together.

88
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,881
Really?

89
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,924
Just out of curiosity, what would you
say if one of my other questions was:

90
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,647
Can I take you out to dinner?

91
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:51,446
You caught me off guard
with that one.

92
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:55,278
- That's my job.
- Well, you're very good at it.

93
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,043
But I...

94
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:01,725
I think that it would be best if those
numbers stayed in your report.

95
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:05,437
- I'm seeing someone.
- I'm not surprised.

96
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:07,248
Officer?

97
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:09,886
Excuse me.

98
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:17,688
Are you okay?

99
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,442
I don't know.
I keep thinking about

100
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:21,679
what we could've done differently
to try and save him.

101
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,524
- He ran into the street so fast and...
- We couldn't have saved him, Prue.

102
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:30,485
Not without knowing more about
the demon who did this to him.

103
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,280
Lukas.

104
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:36,923
To find him, we have to find
what's so special about this box.

105
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:41,602
Do you have any idea
how important that box is?

106
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,647
I thought you were working on
controlling your anger.

107
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,921
I am controlling my anger!

108
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:54,964
At least we got the businessman's
soul, Lukas.

109
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:59,959
Yes, but I need to deliver seven souls
for seven sins.

110
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:02,200
Can't you just locate the box?

111
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:07,318
Yes, but I have to figure out a way
to get around the witches first.

112
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,326
Thanks to you.

113
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:12,279
You know,
my own self-destruction

114
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,087
was supposed to bring me peace
from sin.

115
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:18,561
Instead, I am damned to spend
eternity inflicting others!

116
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:20,641
Gotta know the product to move it.

117
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:24,046
I know the product.

118
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:27,639
I know how sin warps human desire.

119
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,648
Which might be exactly the way
to get to the witches.

120
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:34,840
Yeah. Sure. Why not?

121
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:37,125
Witches have
human desires too, right?

122
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:44,683
You know, there's only one thing
that I can't quite figure out.

123
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,001
Why do I need you?

124
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:50,238
No!

125
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,920
I needed to vent.

126
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:06,437
Don't open that.

127
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:08,327
- Let me go get Piper first.
- Why?

128
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,638
Well, gee, Prue, I don't know.

129
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:14,041
Maybe so you don't go running in
the street and get hit by a bus too.

130
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,437
Piper, we need...

131
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:21,845
- Expecting company?
- Oh, no.

132
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,204
I was just making Leo
something to eat, you know.

133
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:25,722
Break up his day.

134
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:27,686
And something to take up
all of yours?

135
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:29,441
Well, sushi don't roll itself.

136
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,964
Besides, I like taking care of him
and cooking for him

137
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:33,164
and dressing up for him.

138
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:36,048
I was actually thinking of going out
and buying him a new wardrobe.

139
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:37,847
You know, de-flannel him a little.

140
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,124
What, you're afraid you're
gonna lose him?

141
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:44,479
- Wait, are you?
- Well, I'm not gonna give the Elders

142
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,322
any excuse to take him away again,
that's for sure.

143
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,997
No, Piper, they wouldn't do that.
You guys are married now.

144
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:52,444
So? There's nothing in those
wedding vows

145
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:54,520
that says they still can't
break us apart.

146
00:08:54,729 --> 00:08:57,482
Besides, I don't wanna be complacent
about my marriage.

147
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:00,482
Neither he nor they are gonna find
any fault in me.

148
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:03,726
Well, they might find fault in us.

149
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:05,800
Prue and I lost an innocent
this morning.

150
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,522
So we need you.

151
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:15,598
- What are you doing?
- Opening the box.

152
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:17,361
You're supposed to wait
for me and Piper.

153
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:19,161
Okay, so you're here.
I'm gonna open it.

154
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:22,603
What if you unleash
some huge abomination?

155
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:24,527
Whatever it is,
I'm sure we can handle it.

156
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:27,880
But at least I think we should call
my husband and ask his opinion first.

157
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:32,082
Okay, but we didn't need his opinion
before, when he was just Leo.

158
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,686
- You called?
- No.

159
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:38,642
But as long as you're here...
Box, intercepted from a demon.

160
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:41,642
- Open it? Yea or nay?
- You checked the Book of Shadows?

161
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:44,522
No, but that's a great idea.
Leo, you're a genius.

162
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:46,162
What would we do without him?

163
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:48,803
I don't know. I guess our lives
wouldn't be the smooth-running,

164
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:51,039
carefree existence
that they are today.

165
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,646
Phoebe, your ethics professor called
about your meeting today at 2.

166
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:57,846
- Well, obviously, I can't make it now.
- No, you should go.

167
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,398
You're too close to graduating
to mess up now.

168
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:02,639
The three of us can handle the box.

169
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:04,487
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

170
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,725
Go. Although you...

171
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:09,966
...you might wanna change into,
I don't know, clothes,

172
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:11,568
an actual shirt?

173
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:14,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

174
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:15,923
That's very...

175
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:17,158
Let's go.

176
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,926
"Bottled at the source,
by the source."

177
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:24,801
So, what, it's a box of sin?

178
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:26,482
Good thing you didn't open it.

179
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:28,640
It would've been Pandora
all over again.

180
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:31,528
Not quite. But this may be
how the myth got started.

181
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:34,442
Only it's a much more specific
type of attack.

182
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,766
According to this,
the box contains seven balls of sin

183
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,318
used to corrupt paragons of good.

184
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:42,599
If you're a paragon of good,
how do you get corrupted?

185
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:44,680
Because no one is immune to sin,

186
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:49,440
whether it be pride, envy, gluttony,
lust, anger, greed or sloth,

187
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,288
whichever one you're predisposed to
is the one that attacks you.

188
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:54,286
The businessman must've been
attacked by greed.

189
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:55,677
That's why he kept
wanting more.

190
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,403
Only his greed was magnified
a thousand times.

191
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:01,203
It explains why my scrying worked.
I thought the unnatural activity

192
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,167
was a demon courier,
but it must've been the sin working

193
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,206
against the businessman's
good nature.

194
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:08,047
Okay, so, what do we do now?

195
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:09,762
The infector appears to be the link.

196
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:11,567
Destroy Lukas,
and the sins lose power.

197
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,600
Do we know anything
about these infectors?

198
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,208
Only that they were humans

199
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:17,678
consumed by sin during life
and in death.

200
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:19,800
So, what we need to do now
is find a spell

201
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:22,005
to remove the sin
from the infected human

202
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:23,807
in case Lukas strikes again, right?

203
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:27,439
You can't remove sin magically
or otherwise. That's part of all of us.

204
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:30,361
Even you?

205
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:34,765
Yes, even me.
Just a tiny-teeny little bit.

206
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,365
Nothing that anyone would notice
but me.

207
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:46,165
Okay, you guys, wish me luck!

208
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:50,286
- Hey...
- It's okay.

209
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:52,405
I think you're gonna like...

210
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:54,480
...this one!

211
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:07,247
What was that?
What just happened?

212
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:10,606
Oh, no, don't tell me we got infected
with those sin thingies.

213
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,725
What do you mean?
What is she talking about?

214
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:15,244
Okay, nobody panic.
Does anybody feel different?

215
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:16,802
- No.
- Me neither.

216
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,482
All right, so maybe we're immune
because we're magical.

217
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,486
I don't know.
I better orb up and ask.

218
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:24,361
Do that. Piper and I will
recheck the Book.

219
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:27,601
You get your butt to that meeting and
charm the pants off your professor.

220
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:31,284
Go and get home soon as possible.
No, I'm sure. Go.

221
00:12:32,849 --> 00:12:35,841
The problem is, it's an ethics course.
It's about the dialectic.

222
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:38,159
So when someone misses
as many classes as you have,

223
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:39,648
it's hard to catch up.

224
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:42,601
Are you okay?

225
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:47,437
- I don't know.
- Plus, you owe me a major paper.

226
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:50,999
- And if I don't get it soon...
- What are you gonna do to me?

227
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:54,519
I'll have to give you an incomplete.
I'll have no other choice.

228
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:56,685
Do you have anything to say
for yourself?

229
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,445
I'm not wearing any underwear.

230
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:03,601
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, I find it too...

231
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:05,361
...constricting.

232
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:08,208
- Are you making some kind of joke?
- No, I'm serious.

233
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:10,246
Dead serious.

234
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:12,961
I've been a bad girl.

235
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:17,082
A very bad girl. And I'll do anything
to make it up to you.

236
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:20,842
I'll do anything to pass. Anything.

237
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:30,237
No, that'll be it.
Just the two Armani suits, size 42,

238
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,243
the Donna Karan dress, the three
pairs of Stuart Weitzman shoes,

239
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:37,765
the one Gucci jacket
and the Prada bag.

240
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:40,682
- What's the total?
- We don't have much time...

241
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:43,929
I'm on the phone
with Bloomingdale's.

242
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:49,448
Okay. Well, then I'm gonna have to
split that on two credit cards.

243
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:51,765
You can put $5000 on the card
that's on file and...

244
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:55,680
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life,

245
00:13:55,849 --> 00:13:58,647
or at least your credit rating,
which is your life.

246
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:00,442
Excuse me.

247
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:02,327
Leo needs suits.

248
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:03,928
Leo doesn't wear suits.

249
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:06,600
Yet.

250
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:10,924
Are you drinking in the middle
of the day?

251
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:13,766
I was a little bummed
about this sin thing.

252
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:15,601
I thought I deserved
a little indulgence.

253
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,043
Would you like a bit of bubbly?

254
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:20,559
I'd like a little bit of help. We are
supposed to be tracking down Lukas.

255
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:22,487
Sorry. Catch me up.

256
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:24,566
All right, so it turns out
that those sin balls

257
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:26,481
work a lot faster than we thought.

258
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:28,805
Once infected, the victim
only has a few hours

259
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:31,244
before it drives him
to total self-destruction.

260
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:33,639
Well, it's a good thing we weren't
infected, then, huh?

261
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:37,922
Right, but now that Lukas has the
box, the question is, who will be?

262
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:39,727
I tried scrying for unnatural activity,

263
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:41,925
but it just kept on pointing back
to the manor.

264
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:43,926
Go figure.

265
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:51,085
Guess what. My ethics professor
kicked me out of class.

266
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:53,439
- What? Why, what happened?
- I don't know.

267
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:56,043
One minute I was telling him why
my paper was late,

268
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:59,924
and the next thing I knew, I was...

269
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:02,398
...unzipping his pants with my teeth.

270
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,763
Oh, Phoebe, you do know that
"charming the pants off someone"

271
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,999
is just a figure of speech, don't you?

272
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,404
I don't know what
came over me, Prue.

273
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:15,840
I'm just glad that I realised
what was happening before I...

274
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:23,567
All right. Unfortunately,
what got into you was lust.

275
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:25,885
- As in, the sin of.
- Wait a minute.

276
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:27,721
Now you think we were infected?

277
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:29,647
Hello, gluttony, table for one.

278
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:33,842
- Leo!
- Oh, no, no.

279
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:37,319
Leo's not up there.
He's in the living room watching TV.

280
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:40,804
This coffee isn't as good
as it used to be.

281
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,158
I'll make a note of that.

282
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,923
But maybe someday
it'll get better.

283
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,320
- What are you doing?
- Just kicking back.

284
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,161
Something is wrong with this picture.

285
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,837
You need chips. I'll go get some.

286
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:59,763
Oh, turn on MTV. I wanna see
Carson Daly. He is so hot.

287
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:02,445
Okay. Excuse me.

288
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:04,167
Sins in a box?

289
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:06,803
Demon hunt, real life?
Can we please focus here?

290
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,648
Now what did they say
about Lukas' sneak attack?

291
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:14,081
I don't know. I didn't make it up there.
I orbed halfway up, and I got tired.

292
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:16,200
- What?
- After 60 years of constant vigilance,

293
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:18,883
I think I deserve a little downtime.

294
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:22,286
Pursuant to orders,
I halted on our side of the river.

295
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:24,639
- Here you go, honey.
- Oh, thanks, sweetie.

296
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,640
I'm gonna be thirsty soon.

297
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:28,999
I'm gonna be ill soon.

298
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:31,046
I'll get it.

299
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,324
- How gorgeous!
- Hi.

300
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,521
- Boy, this is a lot of flowers.
- I'll say.

301
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,520
I love a man in a uniform.

302
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:44,197
- Hey, who sent the flowers?
- I did. For myself.

303
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:46,283
This is just too much.

304
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,559
I bet you're too much.

305
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:52,483
All right, that's it. That's enough.
Nothing to see here.

306
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:57,479
Nothing to respond to. Get out.
You. What you smiling at, buddy?

307
00:16:57,689 --> 00:16:59,645
- Why did you do that?
- Unless you guys want

308
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:03,119
those flowers at your funeral,
you had better get a grip, okay?

309
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,642
You've been infected.

310
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,238
Gluttony, lust, and that in there...

311
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:10,164
...is sloth.

312
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:12,839
How did I get gluttony?
I don't overeat.

313
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:16,524
No, but you overdo. The sins are
drawn to our predispositions.

314
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:18,645
And lately, yours has been excess.

315
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:21,363
- What sin did you get hit with?
- Well, I didn't get hit.

316
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,763
I saw you get hit.

317
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:24,487
I must be strong enough
to fight it off.

318
00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:27,561
I'm not showing any symptoms,
am I? And thank goodness, right?

319
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:29,760
One of us has to keep
our wits about us.

320
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:31,960
Hey, turn that up, lazy.

321
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:35,241
And now we'll go live
to Bay City Motor Cars.

322
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:41,048
The SWAT teams just arrived
outside Bay City Motor Cars,

323
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:43,365
a further signal that police
are taking seriously

324
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,566
Pastor Roger Tremble's threat
to shoot and kill his hostage

325
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:48,208
if his demands are not met.

326
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:52,638
Do you have any idea what exactly
the pastor's demands are?

327
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:53,838
Actually, yeah.

328
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:56,569
It's a little bizarre, but he claims
he wants a Jag.

329
00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:01,126
Specifically, an XK8 convertible,
in British racing green.

330
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:04,844
- That's a new one.
- That newscaster's kind of cute.

331
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:08,797
What do you wanna bet the demon
infected the pastor with envy?

332
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:11,284
Prue, out of all the people
in San Francisco...

333
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:12,763
Still, he does fit the profile.

334
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:15,887
Paragon of good,
driven to an act of self-destruction.

335
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:18,444
Yeah, especially with
a SWAT team outside. All right.

336
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:22,085
We cannot let this demon steal
any more of our innocents' souls.

337
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:23,841
Piper, are you coming?

338
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:27,240
I was gonna stay here with Leo
and hold down the fort.

339
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:30,122
- More like hold down the couch.
- I'll come if you want me to.

340
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:33,639
No, it's fine. I'll just do
all of it myself if I have to.

341
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,527
Come on, Phoebe.

342
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:39,441
- Do you think she's mad?
- Probably.

343
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:50,638
- Those stained glass...
- Wait, turn that back.

344
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:53,923
We've almost sold our
entire stock of these deluxe...

345
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:55,204
Hand me the phone.

346
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:58,162
- stained glass flamingos.
Coming up after the break,

347
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:01,679
we'll have an ornate Asian curio
cabinet for your fine collectibles.

348
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:14,365
Make sure you keep them back.

349
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,565
Look, Darryl, just let me handle this.

350
00:19:16,729 --> 00:19:19,846
Look, Prue, it's a highly charged,
highly public situation.

351
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:23,319
I can't ask SWAT to let you handle it.
I get enough flak from them as it is.

352
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:26,208
All right, would you rather me
astral-project myself in there?

353
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:28,041
Come on, Prue,
you're not being reasonable.

354
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:29,764
I have something to say.

355
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:32,720
I see that cute officer
from this morning.

356
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:36,959
Hey, stay on point!
We still have an innocent to save.

357
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:39,438
You're right, we all do.
Cops included.

358
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:42,487
Look, just let the hostage negotiators
handle it, will you, please?

359
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:44,042
Fine. What's the plan?

360
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:46,643
The plan is to talk the pastor down,
wait him out.

361
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:48,083
Oh, okay.

362
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:50,757
- It works in most cases, trust me.
- If he's been infected,

363
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:53,045
it will not work in this case, trust me.

364
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:56,241
- The pastor is only gonna get worse.
- What would you do to resolve it?

365
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:59,041
There's only one thing to do.

366
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:01,439
Wait! Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

367
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:04,927
What the hell?

368
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:07,247
Her sister...

369
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:09,043
Phoebe?

370
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,001
They'd better hurry.
I can't wait much longer!

371
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:16,888
- Pastor Tremble?
- Who are you?

372
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,880
Okay, hold on. I'm here to help.

373
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:23,880
But I can't do that
unless you put the gun down.

374
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,649
- Get out of here.
- I just wanna talk.

375
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:28,077
I just want my Jag.

376
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:30,448
Do you want me to shoot you too?

377
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:33,047
- I swear I will.
- Okay. No, wait.

378
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:36,645
I know what's happened to you, okay?
You've been infected with sin.

379
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:38,487
- I warned you!
- No.

380
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:47,437
Prue?

381
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:49,281
You all right?

382
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:51,401
Talk to me, Prue.

383
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,401
All right. Got it.

384
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:10,565
Everything is under control.
Don't worry.

385
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,088
I got it all under control.

386
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:14,809
He needs medical attention.
The pastor's inside, I kicked his ass.

387
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,039
He needs attention too.
He's knocked out.

388
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:23,401
- If I could ask a few questions?
- My name's Halliwell, Prue Halliwell.

389
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:25,998
- What made you run in?
- It's my job to protect the innocents.

390
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:27,881
- You work for the police?
- No, actually...

391
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:30,239
She's a Good Samaritan,
a very Good Samaritan.

392
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:31,808
No further questions.

393
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:33,961
Why'd you do that?
I was just getting started.

394
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:36,563
You were about to hang yourself.
You shouldn't talk to the press.

395
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,521
- Why not?
- Because they'll destroy you.

396
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:42,728
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing can destroy me, Darryl.

397
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,488
Prue, are you bleeding?

398
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:51,088
I am. Oh, my.
Well, that bullet must've grazed me.

399
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:52,517
- You didn't even feel it?
- No.

400
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:55,408
- The adrenaline, it's no big deal.
- No big deal?

401
00:21:55,569 --> 00:21:57,525
You almost got yourself killed.

402
00:21:57,729 --> 00:22:01,438
I've never seen you run from danger,
but I've never seen you run toward it.

403
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:03,600
What have you got,
a death wish or something?

404
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:06,004
It does sound kind of self-destructive,
doesn't it?

405
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:09,122
Oh, that means I've been infected.

406
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,889
That must be why I can't control
my powers.

407
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:13,647
- What's going on?
- I don't have time.

408
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:16,767
Can you get Pastor Tremble to a safe
place where he won't hurt himself,

409
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:18,521
like a psychiatric hospital?

410
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:19,917
It shouldn't be a problem.

411
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,842
Okay, good, but nobody can know
that he's there, okay?

412
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,477
Because if so,
the demon will find him and kill him.

413
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:27,446
I don't know how long
I can keep it a secret.

414
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:30,840
Just long enough for me to find
the demon and vanquish him, okay?

415
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:32,806
Okay. Now where is my sister?

416
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:34,641
Phoebe?

417
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:51,359
It's a good thing I came prepared.

418
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:56,688
- Officer!
- Phoebe!

419
00:22:56,849 --> 00:23:00,728
- Wait, I can explain.
- Like hell you can. Get out of there!

420
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:05,364
- Hi.
- Get over here.

421
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:08,720
Here, put it on!
Are you out of your mind?

422
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:10,848
Yeah, I think so.

423
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,647
But if you're gonna go crazy...

424
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,317
Yeah, well my sin's not nearly
as much fun as yours.

425
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,645
Wait, your sin?
I thought you didn't get hit.

426
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:21,643
Well, that was the pride talking,
and it almost got me killed already.

427
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:24,238
Pride?
You don't seem all that different.

428
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:27,122
Really? Well, back at you.
We need to get home and try

429
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:29,843
- and track down this demon, okay?
- No, I don't think so.

430
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,569
I'm having too much fun,
so I'll just see you later.

431
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:36,045
If I don't get you home,
there won't be a later.

432
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:39,241
What the hell is the matter with you?
Not only in the middle of the day,

433
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:42,560
- but in the middle of a crisis.
- Look, she attacked me.

434
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:44,845
I swear. I didn't have a choice.

435
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:46,601
Well, not much of one.

436
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:50,165
That's a pathetic excuse.
You're an officer, for crying out loud.

437
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,047
What did you want me to do?
Shoot her?

438
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:54,080
- You're suspended.
- What?

439
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:57,122
Go back to the station,
turn in your hardware.

440
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:01,045
You can't suspend me.

441
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:04,406
It was her fault. Damn it!

442
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:07,720
Do you know that anger
is one of the seven deadly sins?

443
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:09,965
Your blood pressure's rising.

444
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:11,921
Adrenaline's pumping.

445
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,887
- You wanna hit somebody, don't you?
- Who the hell are you?

446
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:25,041
I'm somebody who can help you
channel that anger.

447
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:34,485
You know, it wouldn't have killed you
to drive by the fire station for a look.

448
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:39,404
You know what? If you and Piper
do not get your sins under control...

449
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:48,877
Good, you're here.

450
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:52,081
The pashminas have arrived,
and they're to die for. Come see.

451
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:55,124
Hey. Hi. Almost decapitated.

452
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:56,921
Hello.

453
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:03,041
Wow, Piper, you really put
the "glut" in gluttony.

454
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:07,447
- How did you get this stuff so fast?
- I just let my fingers do the walking

455
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:10,043
and the clicking and the flipping.

456
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:12,002
The flipping as in...

457
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:15,281
...the pages of the Book of Shadows?
You used magic?

458
00:25:15,489 --> 00:25:19,277
Well, yeah, I couldn't wait
six to eight weeks for delivery.

459
00:25:19,489 --> 00:25:21,047
That is so personal gain.

460
00:25:21,249 --> 00:25:25,162
- No, because we need all this stuff.
- Okay, Piper, this isn't you.

461
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:27,325
You're being consumed
by your consumption,

462
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:30,089
and it will only lead
to your total misuse of magic.

463
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:35,205
Soothing, isn't it?

464
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:40,048
Hey, Leo.

465
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:42,406
I'm watching TV.

466
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:45,402
I know something more exciting...

467
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:46,888
...than television:

468
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:49,606
Me.

469
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:54,127
What the hell are you doing?
Come on, give it back.

470
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:56,405
- Phoebe!
- What?

471
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:59,641
Prue won't let me leave the house.
I have to make do with what I have.

472
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:02,607
Get your slutty hands
off of my husband!

473
00:26:03,449 --> 00:26:05,201
- Make me.
- Gladly.

474
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:07,487
- Watch the remote.
- No!

475
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:12,206
You guys, the last I checked
we still had a demon to vanquish,

476
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:13,802
and an innocent to save.

477
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:16,000
You said Morris hid
the pastor someplace safe.

478
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:18,364
Yes, he did.
But envy's only the sixth sin,

479
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:21,202
which means there's still an
innocent out there infected with anger.

480
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:24,167
What would you
like us to do about it?

481
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:26,247
Leo, I would like for you

482
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:28,764
to orb up there and ask the Elders
what they know.

483
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:30,243
Okay?

484
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:32,043
I'm too tired.

485
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:36,563
Leo, get up there right now!
You're a whitelighter, that's your job.

486
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,489
Why? You never listen
to me anyway.

487
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:43,606
I think I'm gonna orb upstairs
and take a nap.

488
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:49,202
Fine. Fine, fine, orb.
Who needs you anyway?

489
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:51,405
We still have the power of three.

490
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:17,245
Did you find out where
they're hiding the pastor?

491
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:19,485
- Where did you come from?
- Answer my question.

492
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:22,886
- No one's talking. At least not to me.
- That's not good enough.

493
00:27:23,089 --> 00:27:25,159
Look, I don't know who
you think you are...!

494
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:30,565
Anger's the worst, isn't it?

495
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,448
Especially when the burning rage

496
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,486
saps you of all your strength
and reason,

497
00:27:34,689 --> 00:27:37,681
and the relentless scream
blots out all hope.

498
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:39,680
Use it against the Halliwells.

499
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:43,559
Make them tell you
where the pastor is.

500
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,405
Trust me.

501
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:51,003
Anger always feels better
when it has a target.

502
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:58,848
There is nothing in the Book.

503
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:01,000
Why did only lame witches
precede us?

504
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:03,558
Because nobody is as good
as you, Prue.

505
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:05,845
You know, at least I am trying, Piper,

506
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:09,604
instead of getting a foot massage
or instead of sleeping.

507
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:11,242
I'm not sleeping.

508
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:13,843
I'm just having the best premonitions
of my life.

509
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:18,088
- Of what?
- It's a button off Officer Cutie's shirt.

510
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:21,486
And let me tell you, if the movie is
anything like the previews...

511
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:26,488
All right, is that all
that you care about?

512
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:30,238
Fine. I'll save the innocents,
I'll vanquish the demon,

513
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:33,765
and if I feel like it, maybe
when I'm done, I'll save you guys.

514
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:38,047
- Oh, don't do us any favours.
- Yeah, Prue, worry about yourself.

515
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:41,243
Piper.

516
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,359
- You all right?
- What happened?

517
00:28:45,729 --> 00:28:48,243
- You were shocked.
- I feel strange.

518
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:52,237
Well, if you'd had both feet in the
water, you wouldn't feel anything.

519
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:56,242
Who's that?

520
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,360
It's Officer Cutie from this morning.

521
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:03,605
Hey! Hey, up here!

522
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,198
- I'm gonna come down, okay?
- Phoebe, watch out.

523
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,081
For the love of sin,
you see what's happening?

524
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,126
That was close.

525
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:18,719
Prue, we just have different priorities
than you do.

526
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:22,525
You need a little pick-me-up.
How about I buy you some shoes?

527
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:27,365
I knew you'd come back for me.

528
00:29:27,689 --> 00:29:29,839
This isn't a social call.

529
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:33,607
Are we role-playing?

530
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:37,205
- Did you bring your handcuffs?
- Where's the pastor?

531
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:40,361
- I don't know, I swear.
- You're lying!

532
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:45,999
You're something else,
you know that?

533
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:49,081
I got suspended because of you!

534
00:29:50,449 --> 00:29:53,646
You think you can ruin
somebody's life and not pay for it?

535
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:55,162
Well, you're gonna pay.

536
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:56,961
You're gonna pay right now.

537
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:59,205
Please, don't shoot.

538
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:01,522
My stuff!

539
00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:10,404
He unfroze!

540
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:12,446
Why are my powers not working?

541
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:14,480
- Where's the pastor?
- I don't know.

542
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:42,557
Phoebe...

543
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:15,407
You can't save what's already lost.

544
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:34,686
Leo!

545
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:49,528
Leo!

546
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:54,803
Leo?

547
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:57,005
Please, wake up.

548
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:58,278
Leo?

549
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:03,241
What?

550
00:32:03,449 --> 00:32:05,087
Piper.

551
00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:10,807
You glowed.

552
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:12,408
Doesn't matter.
Where are you hurt?

553
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:15,129
No, you gotta go downstairs
and heal Phoebe first,

554
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:18,008
and then go find Prue,
because the demon took her.

555
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:20,397
You glowed too.

556
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:24,161
I did? Did you heal me?

557
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:26,280
No, not yet.

558
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:33,006
It's the sins.
We must've gotten rid of them.

559
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:36,007
Wait a minute, you said
there was no magical way to do that.

560
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:38,769
There isn't.
Maybe there's a human way.

561
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:41,724
Maybe by being selfless.

562
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:45,245
By you caring more about your sisters
and me caring more about you...

563
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:46,603
...we overcame it.

564
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:49,963
Well, that means Phoebe must've
gotten rid of her sin too,

565
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:52,404
because she risked her life
to save me.

566
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:02,439
She's still breathing.

567
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:09,408
- Hey, honey.
- Hi.

568
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:11,764
Leo, what are you doing up?

569
00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:14,642
- Fixing you.
- Where's Prue?

570
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:16,328
We don't know,
but we need to find her.

571
00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:19,128
She won't admit it,
but she's in big trouble.

572
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,605
You think you can break free...

573
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:28,248
...but you can't.

574
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:31,401
See, that's what makes pride
the deadliest of all the sins.

575
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:34,766
It makes you think that
you're invincible, above it all.

576
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:38,245
- My powers are...
- Useless now. Corrupted.

577
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,599
You have only a small window
of opportunity

578
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,044
to save your life before it's too late.

579
00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:46,321
No demon has defeated me,
and you won't be the first.

580
00:33:46,969 --> 00:33:50,041
You see,
but I don't have to defeat you.

581
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:51,847
You're gonna defeat yourself.

582
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:54,719
In mere minutes,
you'll be so far gone,

583
00:33:54,889 --> 00:33:57,403
you will self-destruct
just like all the rest.

584
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,844
However, I am willing
to make you a deal.

585
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:02,961
- I don't make deals with demons.
- Do you listen to them?

586
00:34:04,449 --> 00:34:06,679
Look, we both know that you
safeguarded the pastor,

587
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:10,205
which means that
I can't deliver his soul.

588
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:13,167
This late in the game,
I am willing to pay for it.

589
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:16,042
Tell me where the pastor is,
and I'll remove your sin.

590
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:18,922
- Go to hell.
- This is my hell, every rotten day of it.

591
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:23,446
Listen, I am giving you a chance
to save your life, Prue.

592
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:25,486
To end your hell.

593
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:29,125
If you remove my sin,
you'll still be one soul short.

594
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:31,399
That's true.

595
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,525
But once expunged,

596
00:34:33,689 --> 00:34:35,247
I can use the sin again.

597
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:40,560
You see, it'll just pop right back
into my box.

598
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:44,478
And let you infect another innocent?
I don't think so. Screw you.

599
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:53,999
Witness the bottomless pit
of everlasting torment.

600
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:58,248
Pride goeth before a very long fall,
Prue. So, what's your decision?

601
00:34:58,449 --> 00:35:01,088
Remember, if I lose, you lose.

602
00:35:01,649 --> 00:35:04,004
All right.
All right, untie me.

603
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:05,682
Tell me where the pastor is first.

604
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:07,242
Oh, untie me first.

605
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:10,329
If I self-destruct,
you'll never get his soul.

606
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,280
All right, now where is he?

607
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,077
You lose, I win.

608
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:21,642
No!

609
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:23,601
- Prue!
- Leo! Leo!

610
00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:31,277
Why did she have to have pride?
Pride is the one sin you can't beat.

611
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:33,241
Beat this.

612
00:35:39,129 --> 00:35:40,608
I see orbs.

613
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:48,880
Let me go! I can handle this!

614
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:50,164
No!

615
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,201
- I was saving you.
- Saving me?

616
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:55,280
I had it under control.
I didn't need your help.

617
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,922
Right.

618
00:35:58,009 --> 00:36:01,285
Looks like the only way to get the
pride out of Prue is to vanquish him.

619
00:36:02,649 --> 00:36:05,322
- Who ordered the sweet sin balls?
- I did.

620
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,807
What did you...?

621
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:16,843
No! No!

622
00:36:20,169 --> 00:36:22,922
Okay, whoa. What just happened?

623
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,485
I think you just lost your pride.

624
00:36:25,689 --> 00:36:28,681
And these must be envy and anger...

625
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:31,119
...which must mean the pastor
and cop are okay now.

626
00:36:39,009 --> 00:36:40,886
Okay.

627
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:44,000
Wait a minute. Is this another?

628
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:45,483
I don't think so.

629
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:48,680
Maybe it's the businessman's soul.

630
00:36:50,049 --> 00:36:52,882
Well, then you should release it
someplace nice.

631
00:36:53,889 --> 00:36:55,447
I know the perfect place.

632
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:01,640
Wow, we sure showed that demon.

633
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:05,838
Okay, you guys sure
showed that demon.

634
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:06,998
Thank you.

635
00:37:07,169 --> 00:37:09,683
So I guess I needed you guys
a lot more than you needed me.

636
00:37:09,889 --> 00:37:11,641
No, we all needed each other.

637
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:13,800
You got me back to the house,
saved the innocents.

638
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:16,358
- Yeah, but...
- Stop it, I don't like this humble Prue.

639
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:18,719
- I want my real sister back.
- Me too.

640
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:21,159
Well, I mean I did save that cop
from killing himself.

641
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:22,808
- I was smart enough...
- She's back.

642
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:25,358
...to tell Darryl
to hide the pastor away, and...

643
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:12,045
- Here you go.
- Oh, no, I'm abstaining.

644
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:14,928
Piper, it's okay to indulge.
Just don't overindulge.

645
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:16,442
I guess we can thank Lukas

646
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:18,839
for teaching us
"Anything in moderation."

647
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:21,000
There was nothing that Lukas
could teach me.

648
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:23,522
Oh, really?

649
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:25,763
I'm doing it again, aren't I?

650
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,885
That whole pride thing.
I swear, I'm working on it.

651
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:30,005
It's a constant struggle.

652
00:38:30,209 --> 00:38:32,643
Here's one thing that I'm willing
to admit I don't understand:

653
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:33,958
You, Phoebe and Leo

654
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:36,245
were able to get rid of your sins
with a selfless act.

655
00:38:36,409 --> 00:38:40,641
I committed many selfless acts,
yet why did I have to wait for Lukas

656
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:42,640
to be vanquished to get
rid of my pride?

657
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:46,808
Well, Lukas said that pride
was the one sin you can't beat.

658
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:48,288
I think what he meant was

659
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:51,407
that there's no such thing
as a selfless act to pride.

660
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:54,961
I threw myself into the pit
for the pastor.

661
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:57,000
Yeah, but you did that to win.

662
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,928
So any good you did
during your prideful state

663
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:02,080
was for the greater glory of Prue.

664
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:04,166
All right, fine. Then here's to Leo.

665
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:06,763
For saving me from eternal torment.

666
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:10,042
And to me, for not trying to be
the perfect couple.

667
00:39:10,209 --> 00:39:12,404
If it isn't good enough for them,
then screw them.

668
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:13,962
I'll drink to that.

669
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:16,807
Excuse me.

670
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:18,677
Hi, I'm so excited.

671
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:20,885
And not in any sexual kind of way.

672
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:25,118
Recent events inspired me
to write a paper on sexual politics,

673
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:27,962
claiming that my indiscretion
with Professor Kass

674
00:39:28,129 --> 00:39:29,767
was an ethical experiment.

675
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:31,925
So I hand the paper in yesterday.

676
00:39:32,129 --> 00:39:35,041
And, pause for dramatic effect...

677
00:39:36,689 --> 00:39:39,203
- So did he buy it?
- I got a B.

678
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:42,127
Minus, but I got it fair and square,

679
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:45,241
which means I will be able
to graduate. And no man,

680
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:48,401
not even Cole,
is gonna stand in my way.

681
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:51,123
- Congratulations.
- I am very proud of you.

682
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:53,797
- Oh, and coming from you...
- Hey, be nice.

683
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:55,840
I don't even wanna think
about sin tonight.

684
00:39:56,049 --> 00:39:57,801
Me neither.

685
00:39:58,009 --> 00:40:00,364
So this is a pretty interesting band.
What's their name?

686
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:03,001
Orgy.
