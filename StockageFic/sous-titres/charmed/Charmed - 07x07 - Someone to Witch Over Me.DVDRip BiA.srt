1
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,554
We have to get you away
from the building.

2
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,014
Yeah, but my stuff!

3
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,774
Paige, there you are.

4
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,071
- Anyone got hurt?
- Not as far as I can tell.

5
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:32,366
- Have you seen Agent Brody yet?
- What are we doing here?

6
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,284
He said for us to meet him here.

7
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,162
He needed to talk to us
about something important.

8
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,539
Yeah, but it's a fire.

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,249
- So?
- So we don't do fires.

10
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,584
Firemen do fires.
We do fireballs.

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,003
He said it was something
connected to this

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,091
- New Power thing he's talking about.
- Well, we're not Brody's Angels.

13
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,971
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm stressed.
It's my first week back at work,

14
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,098
and I have a lot of catching up to do.

15
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,059
Follow me.
Keep an eye on the third floor.

16
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,811
Wait. Why?

17
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:05,065
Somebody's trapped. If I'm right,
he's gonna jump and not get hurt.

18
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,067
- How do you know?
- Just a hunch.

19
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,695
Just a hunch, huh, Agent Brody?

20
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,489
- Kyle.
- Whatever.

21
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:16,410
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but we don't really know you.

22
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,621
I know you were right about
the New Power thing, but...

23
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,415
On the ledge, third floor!

24
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,916
Jumper!

25
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,920
Come on, bring it down!

26
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,715
Hey, get the ladder over here!

27
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,220
Let me protect you.

28
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,230
Are you all right?

29
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,899
Come on.

30
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,567
Whoa.

31
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,694
Okay, how did you know that?

32
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:54,072
That's the fourth person
it's happened to in the last month.

33
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,408
If the pattern holds,
he's about to die.

34
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,744
- Pattern? What pattern?
- What?

35
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,496
All right, guys,
stay on the survivor.

36
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,415
- Keep recording!
- Copy that.

37
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,376
Oh, God, is he
talking to that helicopter?

38
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,047
He's really cool.

39
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,054
Yes, ma'am. I understand that.

40
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,685
I'm okay.

41
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,688
The EMT needs to
check you out first. Down there.

42
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,326
Sir! No...

43
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,713
Stop. Watch for the...

44
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,968
- Who are you?
- A thief.

45
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,641
Looks like you're on your own.

46
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,726
No, no, no, wait!

47
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,317
Damn it!

48
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,666
Ten-four, we'll update it.

49
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,720
Agent 250 at dispatch.
We need you to return...

50
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,389
Yeah. Well, take care of it.

51
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,894
I still don't understand
how he knew this was gonna happen.

52
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,104
I wanna know
why we couldn't stop it.

53
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,439
Stop what?

54
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,026
A man jumped out of a burning building
only to get hit by a truck?

55
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:39,238
- What's the connection there?
- I'm hoping Kyle knows.

56
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,864
Okay, you know,

57
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,909
can we call him Agent Brody
until we can trust him?

58
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,202
I trust him.

59
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,873
- Are you okay?
- No.

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,417
I just wish I knew
why this keeps happening.

61
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,296
- Something about a pattern?
- Every time something unusual happens,

62
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,506
I investigate.

63
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:01,718
The more unusual, the more it
tends to lead towards this New Power.

64
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,763
- This New Power have a name?
- Don't know. Wanna walk?

65
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:13,021
You think that whole thing's
what's killing these innocents?

66
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,983
I don't think they're
literally running them down.

67
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,695
I do think that they're doing
something to cause them to be killed.

68
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,989
- What kind of something?
- I don't know.

69
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,741
Whatever it is,
it's got to do with taking power.

70
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,119
- It's what they're all about.
- Powers?

71
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:30,747
Innocents don't have powers.
If they did, they wouldn't need us.

72
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,710
All I know is things this unusual
don't just happen over and over.

73
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,296
- Something's going on.
- Another hunch?

74
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,508
Don't knock 'em, Phoebe.
My hunches led me to you.

75
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,264
Look, I can guarantee you
this is not gonna be the last person

76
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,517
to miraculously escape a fire,
only to die moments later.

77
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,478
If you guys wanna
help me figure this one out...

78
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,149
...you know where to find me.

79
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,532
What do you think?

80
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,910
I think he's got some style.

81
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,923
How dare you summon me.

82
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,637
You said to call if
I ever wanted to challenge you.

83
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,849
You think you are
ready to challenge me?

84
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,685
The last time you tried it,
I spared your life.

85
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:37,105
This time I may not be so merciful.

86
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,733
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

87
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,154
You've been around humans too long.
What makes you think you're ready?

88
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,407
Like you said,
I've been around humans.

89
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,869
Shall we?

90
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,249
Talk to me.

91
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,972
You've come far... quickly.

92
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,896
Not far enough. I need more!

93
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,399
- More what?
- More guardians.

94
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,901
I steal the ones
who help save their humans

95
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,945
so that they can help me instead.

96
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,115
- All this just to defeat me?
- No.

97
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,743
So I can protect myself from
the threat you taught us was coming.

98
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,831
Nothing can protect you from that.

99
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:39,543
- Unless you go into hiding until...
- I won't hide!

100
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,379
If demons don't
stand up to them, who will?

101
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,424
I just need more.

102
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,678
Could you do me a favour?

103
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,723
Call Rex and have them do
a sound check before the show.

104
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,475
I don't wanna mess up
The Donna's release party.

105
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,228
- It's gonna be packed.
- Are you listening to me?

106
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,815
Yeah, yeah, Brody, fires, hunches.
I got my own problems.

107
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,527
- Are you sure Enola graduated already?
- Yeah, I'm positive. Why?

108
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:10,157
- She might be the one who can save Leo.
- What are you talking about?

109
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,202
She helped you see
your future with a vision quest.

110
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,330
Gave you something to look forward to.
Life after demons.

111
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,957
- That's what Leo needs.
- There's no guarantees

112
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,167
Leo would see that.

113
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,671
A vision quest can take you anywhere,
and sometimes it can be dangerous.

114
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,133
Couldn't be more dangerous
than what he's going through now,

115
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,385
if that New Power is still after him.

116
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,763
A vision quest won't change that.

117
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,724
No, but it may show him
a way to fight them.

118
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:40,896
Phoebe, he's alone, and he's scared,
and he's forgotten who he is.

119
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:44,983
I'm afraid if I can't help him,
my children are gonna lose their father.

120
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,738
- It's still risky.
- But it's a risk I'm willing to take.

121
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,575
What are you doing?

122
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:57,037
I'm making the vision quest potion.
She showed me how to do it.

123
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,957
- What about Brody?
- Paige can take care of Brody.

124
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:04,503
I think she likes taking care of Brody,
if you know what I'm talking about.

125
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,465
And besides, this... is family.

126
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,648
Nobody's home.

127
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,361
You're quite the liar.

128
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,615
Sorry. I didn't realise it was you.

129
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,410
Actually, I'm surprised
you even showed up.

130
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,621
Really? Why would that be?

131
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,041
It's pretty clear your sister
doesn't trust me very much.

132
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,085
- Should she?
- I think she should.

133
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:49,298
I've proven myself. I've saved you
from getting exposed more than once.

134
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,218
By the way,
where is Inspector Sheridan?

135
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,846
Come on, does it really matter?

136
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,182
It does if you hurt her.

137
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,392
I'm not here to hurt anybody, Paige.

138
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,895
I'm here to keep them
from getting hurt.

139
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,314
The fact that you know
that people may die

140
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,358
is exactly what makes you
so suspicious, Agent Brody.

141
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:09,943
Kyle.

142
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,865
What is that?

143
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:20,537
That is a bird's-eye view of the victim
just before he stepped off the kerb.

144
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:24,416
We shot this with the fastest
digital imaging equipment known to man.

145
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,543
Or at least Homeland Security.

146
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,422
If you look at it in normal light,
it appears as though he's alone.

147
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,257
Throw an EM filter on it...

148
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,636
...he's not.

149
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,304
What are those?

150
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:41,099
If I had to guess, I'd say the
light one's a protector of some kind.

151
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,019
Protector? Like some sort
of guardian angel thing?

152
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,104
That's one way of putting it.

153
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,984
- What, you don't believe in them?
- You do?

154
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,862
Given all the scrapes
that I've slipped out of,

155
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,406
it's the only reason
I think I'm still alive.

156
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,700
My guess is...

157
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,745
...that's the power
the dark figure wants.

158
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,665
People have especially
strong protectors.

159
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,876
It'd explain why they
miraculously survive something

160
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,379
and, the next moment, don't.

161
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,345
- What?
- Nothing.

162
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,888
So...

163
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:24,101
How do we find out if that
dark figure is what you think it is?

164
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,811
We wait for the next fire.

165
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,522
Interested?

166
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,286
There's nowhere else to turn.

167
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:47,708
- Nowhere else to go.
- Leave me alone!

168
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,502
Let go of all you know.

169
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,297
Don't resist. Don't resist us.

170
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,176
Why are you doing this to me?

171
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,136
What do you want?

172
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:07,561
- Perhaps we've pushed him too far.
- We have no choice.

173
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,022
He must join us willingly.

174
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,567
But first must see
there's no other option.

175
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:19,114
- His will is strong, even for an Elder.
- Which is why he's so valuable to us.

176
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,663
What is it?

177
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,249
There may be another way.

178
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:34,880
Another opportunity to show him that
one cannot ignore the truth forever.

179
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,595
Leo?

180
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,056
Leo?

181
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:47,935
You see, I know he can hear me.
He just doesn't wanna come.

182
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,103
Let me give this a try. Leo!

183
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,689
Leo, you get your butt
down here right now,

184
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,192
or we will summon your ass!

185
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,822
Nicely done.

186
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,283
It's not safe
for me to be here, you know.

187
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,827
- We'll take that risk.
- What about the boys?

188
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,579
At school. Nice try though.

189
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,123
- We found a way to help you.
- Help me what?

190
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,751
- Help you stop running.
- It's a vision quest.

191
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,587
A vision quest? No way.

192
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,674
Leo, don't you dare leave.
This is not just about you.

193
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,176
You are a father
and somebody's husband.

194
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,470
Which is why
it's risky for me to be here.

195
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,389
Except you're the one in danger.

196
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,599
I'm an Elder.
I can take care of myself.

197
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,227
Actually, you haven't
been yourself lately.

198
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,438
The vision quest helped me.

199
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,775
- Maybe it could help you too.
- It won't stop the creatures.

200
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,319
How do you know?
You tried everything else.

201
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,823
What do you have to lose?
Your mind, your family, your life.

202
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,660
You've already lost those, haven't you?
Go ahead, tell me I'm wrong.

203
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,166
I'll go get the potion.

204
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:10,017
Okay, when I said I'd help you,
this is not what I had in mind.

205
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,395
- Just go. I'll be okay.
- You crazy? How's this gonna be okay?

206
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,189
I believe in my guardians.

207
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,941
If I'm right, whoever
set this fire is out there.

208
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,485
Say your spell,
and we'll see what happens.

209
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:23,447
- Don't worry about me.
- It's a little late for that.

210
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,458
Which way?

211
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,010
Trust us.

212
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:56,980
You all right?

213
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,443
- It's all right. Homeland Security.
- You sure?

214
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,487
Paige? Paige!

215
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,657
Come on...

216
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,579
Show me what the evil sees
even if at lightning speed

217
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:26,260
- So it is true.
- Well, well, well.

218
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:30,389
What have we here... a witch?

219
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,058
You're not getting his guardian.

220
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:38,397
Now why would I want his,
when I can have yours?

221
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:50,284
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

222
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,578
I think I'm in big trouble.

223
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,126
No, I know, Elise,
but something came up.

224
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,588
Yes, again, but you don't
have to worry about my column.

225
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,339
I promise it'll...

226
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,383
I gotta go.

227
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,178
Wha...? Paige?

228
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,555
What's going on?

229
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,308
Pa... Oh, my God,
what happened?

230
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,644
- Par for the course, unfortunately.
- Par for what course?

231
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,898
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to protect your sister.

232
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:24,860
- I lost my guardian angel.
- You lost your who?

233
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:28,197
Protection spirits, guides.
They're with us all the time.

234
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,199
I know what guardian angels are.

235
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:33,285
Not just the Hallmark thing.
It's real. I saw mine.

236
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:37,164
- Surprised we'd not seen them before.
- The problem is, without them,

237
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:40,626
- people tend to be vulnerable.
- In my case, accident-prone.

238
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:44,213
I don't understand. How did
you lose your guardian angel?

239
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,881
We were trying to lose mine,

240
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,717
- but then this demon... Demon, right?
- Demon.

241
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,678
Demon comes along
and takes hers instead.

242
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,640
Can I talk to you for a second,
please, over here?

243
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,728
What is going on?

244
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:03,482
We figured out what is killing
all of those innocents.

245
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,903
The demon's stealing their protectors.
It's connected to this New Power thing.

246
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,949
- This is another of his hunches?
- No, it's one of mine.

247
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,410
But you have to admit, all of his
have panned out so far, right?

248
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,831
Yeah, so far they have.
So what's the next move?

249
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,667
I'm gonna ID the demon.
Seen the Book of Shadows?

250
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:24,920
- It wasn't upstairs.
- You're not gonna show him the Book?

251
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:27,923
Yeah, I am. I trust him.
I told you that.

252
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,968
Look, if it considers him a threat,
it'll just zap him.

253
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,137
Don't worry.

254
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:37,099
Paige, you're my sister.
I have to worry.

255
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,935
Well, if it makes you feel better,
come with us.

256
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:45,732
I wish I could, but I can't.
Leo needs some serious help.

257
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:49,027
- What's new?
- Promise me you're gonna be careful.

258
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,947
Promise. I think I can
take care of one little demon.

259
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,617
I meant Agent Brody.
The Book's in the kitchen.

260
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:00,873
Everything okay?

261
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,875
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

262
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,879
- No problem.
- Yeah...

263
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:10,465
- She lost her what?
- Brody's watching her. She's okay.

264
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,759
We can't leave her alone
if she lost...

265
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,554
Phoebe said she's fine.
Now, please focus.

266
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,098
- What am I supposed to do?
- Don't fight it.

267
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,517
Let it take you where
you're supposed to be.

268
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,811
- What if I want out?
- You won't be able to.

269
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:26,106
Not until you see
what you're supposed to see.

270
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,445
Just sip it.

271
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,663
- Now what?
- Make yourself comfortable.

272
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:50,672
Close your eyes
and just let it all go.

273
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,598
Wyatt!

274
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,228
We've gotta stop the bleeding.
He's going into shock.

275
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,775
I need a morphine kit!
Is there a medic out in the field?

276
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,285
What's going on?
What am I doing here?

277
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,079
Don't worry, Dad.

278
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,374
I'm gonna help you through this.

279
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,794
Chris?

280
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:30,838
Chris?

281
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:42,432
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

282
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,395
Guess I never knew how much
my guardian angel actually helped me,

283
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:49,815
- even with the little stuff.
- Don't worry, we'll find her.

284
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:51,567
I hope.

285
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:58,740
You know, maybe it'd help
if you looked at the Book with me.

286
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,714
- Feel better?
- What do you mean?

287
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,592
I assume the Book
won't let anything evil touch it.

288
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,386
Most magical tomes don't.

289
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,390
What do I have to do
to prove I'm not a threat to you?

290
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:29,771
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

291
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:33,567
I am. I can't seem to trust myself
right now, let alone anybody else.

292
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,445
Well, guardians do more
than keep you upright.

293
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:40,240
I mean, they're your inner voice,
your conscience, instincts.

294
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,993
And without them,
you tend to get a little lost.

295
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,454
You really do believe in them,
don't you?

296
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:48,332
Yeah. I'm a believer, all right.

297
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:52,711
Hunting the New Power for years
has made me realise

298
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,255
there's some awful things
in this world.

299
00:20:55,422 --> 00:21:00,135
I'd just like to think there's some
good things too, to balance it out.

300
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,095
Like you.

301
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,518
You found it!

302
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:11,230
"Celerity demons
are powerful beings

303
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:15,067
who can move at the speed of light
and feed off lesser demons."

304
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:18,487
Yeah, but guardian angels
are hardly lesser demons.

305
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:22,157
Well, whether they are or they aren't,
he's able to steal them.

306
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:23,534
The question is, why?

307
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:36,004
Well done.

308
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,257
Witches have powerful guardians...

309
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,467
...especially a Charmed One's.

310
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,679
How can you be sure
that she was a Charmed One?

311
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:47,349
It's the only explanation.
It's the most powerful one I possess.

312
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,769
Still, it will not be enough...

313
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,272
...when the Avatars come.

314
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:57,609
Perhaps not.
Unless I get the other two.

315
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:00,404
Legend holds the sisters
are magically connected.

316
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:03,532
It stands to reason
their guardians should be as well.

317
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:08,996
- How will you get them?
- I'll just listen to the one I've got.

318
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:12,583
She'll whisper to me when
the others need their guardians most.

319
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,668
When they're the most vulnerable.

320
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,090
You've taught me well, Aku.

321
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:34,188
I hope... well enough.

322
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:44,198
Why isn't he saying anything?
Do you think he's all right?

323
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,701
Yes, I think he's doing
exactly what he needs to be doing.

324
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,246
Sure you don't wanna
help me out here?

325
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,540
No, I'm fine right here.

326
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,792
Sweetie, you said it yourself.

327
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,712
This is something
that he needs to do.

328
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:02,966
I can have second thoughts, can't I?
What if something happens to him?

329
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,928
Hopefully, his angels
are taking care of him.

330
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:09,556
I don't think angels have angels,
Phoebe. It's redundant.

331
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,601
You just protect ours
so we can protect him.

332
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:15,521
I don't understand.

333
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,940
If I'm in the past,
what are you doing here?

334
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,274
I'm guiding you.

335
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,817
So you're real?

336
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,946
No. But I represent
something that is.

337
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,781
I died in your arms, Dad.

338
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:29,535
Killed by everything
that you thought was good.

339
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,161
I'm your root pain, okay?

340
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,623
I'm gonna be sticking with you
until you're ready to let me go.

341
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:37,167
How will I know when that is?

342
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:41,797
Come on, let's check out parts of
your life you really need to remember.

343
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:44,383
Do I have a choice?

344
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,511
Hey, it's your vision quest.
It's up to you.

345
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:50,848
Come on.

346
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,060
Where are we now?

347
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,317
I never stopped loving you.

348
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:16,415
That feeling's what it's all about, Dad.
You died fighting evil in the war.

349
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:19,251
You were reborn
as a Whitelighter to fight evil.

350
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:22,462
That led you to Mom, love,

351
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,506
to all that's good.

352
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,928
Is that what I think it is?

353
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:33,056
- To the day Wyatt was born.
- Yes, it is.

354
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:36,768
- Oh, it's a boy.
- I got a boy?

355
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:42,316
- Here you go, Mama.
- Hi.

356
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:46,528
Hi, little guy,
what are you doing?

357
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:48,447
Look what we did!

358
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:50,449
I see.

359
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,744
It's a miracle.

360
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:56,622
A little miracle.

361
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,501
To the day when I was born.

362
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,092
Oh, look, he's beautiful.

363
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:11,595
Baby Christopher.
That's your brother.

364
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:14,014
Looks like we
didn't lose him after all.

365
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,184
Do you understand now?

366
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:20,020
All the pain, all the sacrifices.

367
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:23,315
It's all been for good.
That's what you're all about, Dad.

368
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,567
That's what you've always been about.

369
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:28,111
That's what the future's about too.

370
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,617
- Look at your brother!
- You need to believe in that again.

371
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,537
Can we see her?

372
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:39,665
Go. Your family's waiting for you.

373
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,974
- Piper...
- Hey, how you feeling?

374
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:58,767
Good.

375
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:05,190
What?

376
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:06,942
What is it?

377
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,153
Leo.

378
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:12,656
Leo, wake up.

379
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,659
Leo! Wake up!

380
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:26,336
Who are you?
What do you want?

381
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,214
I want you to see the truth, Leo.

382
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:34,553
I want you to see the real future.

383
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,611
- We gotta do something.
- There's nothing we can do.

384
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:53,447
He's back in the quest.
Only he can get himself out.

385
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:56,783
He was out. Something made him
go back in. Something he saw.

386
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,369
I don't think anything
can get past crystals.

387
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,955
- The New Power?
- I didn't see floating heads.

388
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:06,251
- Doesn't mean they weren't there.
- Why are you doing this?

389
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,462
Why are you doing this to me?

390
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,882
I wanna get out of here.

391
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:15,177
You can't leave yet, Leo.
You're not ready.

392
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:18,347
You haven't seen
what you need to see.

393
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:21,683
- Why are you haunting me?
- Haunting?

394
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:26,313
No, the creature heads

395
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,609
were a necessary part
of guiding you to the truth.

396
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:34,738
To the truth that lies
beyond good and evil.

397
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:38,450
- To us.
- Us?

398
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,661
Avatars.

399
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:42,329
We are...

400
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:44,873
...a power.

401
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,377
One that offers a better way.

402
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,172
A solution to this.

403
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:55,843
You see, the future Chris
failed to mention

404
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:59,429
the death of all the people
that you love.

405
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,265
Sometimes peaceful...

406
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:03,976
...sometimes painful...

407
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,938
...but always inevitable.

408
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:11,275
And all well before their time.

409
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,110
Death is a part of life.

410
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:15,237
Natural death, yes.

411
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:20,993
But not death caused by the pointless,
endless battles between good and evil.

412
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,705
It's not pointless, it's necessary.
And when good wins...

413
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:28,041
Wins? Duality is self-perpetuating.

414
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,377
It feeds only on itself.

415
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:34,381
That is why the battle has been
raging since the dawn of time.

416
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,301
There is no winner.

417
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,136
- There can be.
- How?

418
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:42,055
With good there is always evil.

419
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:45,934
And so the battle never ends.
Not until there's nothing left.

420
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:51,231
That is the future
your fight is leading to.

421
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,026
Not good nor evil...

422
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:56,486
...only nothing.

423
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:00,157
No!

424
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:05,037
- Leo, who are you talking to?
- Piper, he can't hear you.

425
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,289
Well, he's hearing someone.

426
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,835
Leo. Leo!

427
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:17,132
What was that?

428
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,176
- Stay here.
- Why?

429
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:20,594
Just stay.

430
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,941
Guess your guardians
didn't tell you about that.

431
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,609
That's why I want yours.

432
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:38,529
So these kinds of things
don't happen again.

433
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:42,366
- Damn it!
- Paige, quick! In here!

434
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:51,041
You're getting to be a pain.

435
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:54,086
- You can't hide in there forever.
- Paige?

436
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:57,047
What the hell?

437
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:00,175
Leave him alone!

438
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,719
No. There's too much at stake.

439
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:06,014
Besides, I could use the leverage.

440
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:10,143
Oh, no!

441
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,314
You're not a witch.
What are you?

442
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,651
I'm a federal agent.

443
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,195
A what?

444
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:24,199
And you know about all this?
Magic, demons?

445
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,161
I'm getting a quick education.

446
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:30,956
It won't do you much good.
I only need you long enough

447
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:34,918
for the witches to attempt a rescue.
Since they're otherwise occupied

448
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:38,213
and down a guardian,
they won't come all at once.

449
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,758
Someone will get left behind.
And that's when I'll attack.

450
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,928
I'm just curious...

451
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:50,517
...what do you want with these
guardians, if you don't mind me asking?

452
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:53,604
I don't want them. I need them.

453
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:58,066
Worried about the New Power, are we?

454
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:00,152
You know about the Avatars?

455
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,489
Avatars?
So that's what they're called?

456
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:06,283
Yes, that's what they're called.

457
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:10,954
I won't be cast aside by them when
the time comes for them to take power,

458
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:13,457
which is why
I need more guardians,

459
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:16,126
which is the only reason
I'm keeping you alive.

460
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,554
So, what are you
gonna do if you find him?

461
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,932
What do you mean,
"What am I gonna do?"

462
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:32,309
I'm gonna save him.
We're gonna save him.

463
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:34,102
It's a trap. The demon said so.

464
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:37,439
- He took him for leverage.
- We're gonna let him get killed?

465
00:31:37,606 --> 00:31:40,317
He's not gonna kill him, okay?
He needs him alive.

466
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,945
Yeah, but for how long?
Piper, help me out.

467
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,030
I'm with Phoebe here.

468
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:47,866
Sarpedon's powerful.
He has all those guardians.

469
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:49,409
Yeah, including mine.

470
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:54,414
That's why you're not thinking straight.
We can't go after him. It's ridiculous.

471
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,792
Yeah? Well, I'm not gonna let him rot.

472
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:03,382
- I'll go get him myself.
- Wha? Pa...

473
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,185
Kyle?

474
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:17,187
Kyle?

475
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,986
Kyle?

476
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:27,030
Kyle?

477
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:41,503
Pai...

478
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,381
Now we know where they are.
All we have to do is mix up

479
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:47,342
a new vanquishing potion
and get Paige's spell.

480
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:49,761
But that'd mean
we'd have to go to the Book,

481
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:53,182
which is in the kitchen,
which entails us going downstairs,

482
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:57,019
away from the crystals, which means
the demon could slice and dice us.

483
00:32:57,186 --> 00:33:00,480
True, but for all we know
the demon could already have Paige.

484
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:04,109
Us getting killed doesn't change that.
I can't leave Leo.

485
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:06,570
I know this is
really hard for you, Piper.

486
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:09,406
But there's nothing
that we can do to help Leo.

487
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:13,911
He's gotta fight this fight on his own.
But we can help Paige.

488
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:16,205
All right, let's just make it fast.

489
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:19,333
Okay. Remember,
if the demon attacks, grab the amulet.

490
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,585
Oh, sure, yeah, no problem.

491
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:31,094
Phoebe!

492
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:44,066
Next.

493
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:46,985
Hey! Where's your amulet?

494
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:52,574
No!

495
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:59,373
Leo!

496
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,972
What do you mean, this is the end?

497
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,224
The end of what?

498
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:21,395
The end of the battle
between good and evil.

499
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:24,147
Its outcome.

500
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:26,733
Mutual destruction.

501
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:30,654
And the eternal void
that necessarily follows.

502
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:33,574
How is this possible?

503
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,201
I'm afraid it's unavoidable.

504
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:40,038
A... flawed design.

505
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,336
There is, however, another way.

506
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:48,589
A better way.

507
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:52,301
That is what we represent, Leo.

508
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,803
But we'll need your help to implement.

509
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:59,391
And the Charmed Ones,
of course, when they're ready.

510
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,018
What way is that?

511
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,187
Utopia.

512
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:07,274
A world where
good and evil no longer exist.

513
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:10,569
Where the battle is behind you,
behind everyone.

514
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:16,033
A world where you and Piper
no longer have to suffer

515
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,328
through the obstacles
that have kept you apart.

516
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:23,749
What's the catch?

517
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:28,045
Only the courage to change.

518
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:32,799
Unless it's already too late.

519
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:36,970
Piper.

520
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:41,308
She's not here, Leo.
I'm afraid there isn't much time.

521
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,602
Piper!

522
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:46,188
Piper!

523
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:54,071
No.

524
00:35:57,825 --> 00:35:59,618
Why did you do this?

525
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:03,330
We didn't do this, Leo. Evil did.

526
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:07,918
It might not be too late,
though, to reverse it.

527
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:10,963
If you'll join us.

528
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:13,841
You can save them?

529
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,134
We can save everyone, Leo.

530
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:18,971
With your help.

531
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:26,186
So be it.

532
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:41,827
Welcome to the fold.

533
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:44,913
What do I do next?

534
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:46,874
Heal them.

535
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,710
I can't heal them. They're dead.

536
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:51,712
You're an Avatar now, Leo.

537
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,548
You have all you need.

538
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:56,925
You have the powers.

539
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,001
Leo?

540
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,718
- Piper.
- You're back.

541
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:47,059
- I thought I was...
- Dead?

542
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,314
- Where did you get that?
- From the demon, I guess.

543
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:54,566
Wait, so that's it? It's over?

544
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,110
Is it?

545
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:01,240
I've never seen you
heal anyone like that, Leo.

546
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:05,828
- Did something happen to you?
- What do you mean?

547
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:09,414
In the vision quest,
you seemed like you were in pain.

548
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:13,544
Yeah, well, something
I had to go through, I guess...

549
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,587
...to see the truth.

550
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:10,809
Give it up for San Francisco's
very own, The Donnas!

551
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:13,562
Thanks for getting Rex
to do that sound check.

552
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:16,565
- They sounded great.
- Actually, I forgot to do that.

553
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:20,194
What? I was very busy
trying to save your husband.

554
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,696
Down, girl. Easy.
Don't worry about it.

555
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:26,450
I guess I get a little testy
when someone kills me, you know.

556
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:29,912
Oh, come on, we weren't killed.
We were just maimed.

557
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:31,830
Leo can't heal the dead.

558
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:34,500
Hey, ladies. Sorry I'm late.

559
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:38,170
You guys look great
for being recently deceased.

560
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:41,465
We weren't dead! Forget it.

561
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:42,966
Oh, hey!

562
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:44,259
Sorry!

563
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:46,929
God, I'm sorry, my bad.

564
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:51,725
I see you got your angel back.

565
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:54,603
Thank God. No pun intended.

566
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,439
- What about Agent Brody?
- Who?

567
00:39:57,606 --> 00:39:59,107
All right, Kyle.

568
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:02,986
Just 'cause we almost got him killed
doesn't mean we have to trust him.

569
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:05,447
Oh, come on, now.
Enough of this already.

570
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:08,242
Everything turned out fine,
like it always does.

571
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,244
Well, almost always does.

572
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,995
Except for the Avatars.

573
00:40:12,162 --> 00:40:15,874
Kyle said that that's what
the demon called the New Power.

574
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,543
Doesn't ring any bells.

575
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:22,548
Well, well, well, look at you.
Welcome back.

576
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,050
Thank you.
It's good to be back, believe me.

577
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:28,512
No voices, floating heads, guilt trips?

578
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,055
Nope, nothing.

579
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:33,600
You ever hear of the Avatars?

580
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:37,396
Avatars? Why?

581
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:40,566
They could be the big bad
everyone's worried about.

582
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:45,571
I will look into it. But first,
a toast to being back together.

583
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:49,616
- New beginnings.
- I will drink to that.
