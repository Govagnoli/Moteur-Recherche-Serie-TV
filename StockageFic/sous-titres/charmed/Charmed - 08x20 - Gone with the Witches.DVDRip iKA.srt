1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:06,715
I can't believe I got up early
on my husband's day off for this.

2
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,759
Stop complaining,
we're getting close.

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,427
Close to what, getting killed?

4
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,262
We scried for evil and it was here.

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,307
Yeah, because their names
are Christy and Billie.

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,768
I'm telling you, it can't be them.

7
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,478
They're supposed to be
the Ultimate Power.

8
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,356
Yeah, but I still think they're
being manipulated by something.

9
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,150
Or maybe
you're just avoiding the inevitable.

10
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,693
Piper, I told you.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,821
If we need to take down Billie
and Christy, I'm there, seriously.

12
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:33,617
But I still think there's something else
behind them.

13
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,662
And whatever it is,
it's behind that door.

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,626
What have we got to lose, right?

15
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,002
You know, just our lives.

16
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,380
Look, we're not even ready to deal
with Billie and Christy,

17
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:50,676
let alone what may or may not be
behind door number three.

18
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,679
Well, the sooner we find out,
the better.

19
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,816
All right, now that we've ascertained
it's a creepy, empty room,

20
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,401
I think we can go.

21
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,946
Just because we don't see anything,
doesn't mean it's not there.

22
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,907
This place is giving me
really creepy vibes.

23
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,534
Me too. I'm with Paige, let's go.

24
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,536
This room's not even supposed
to be here, right?

25
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,539
Well, whether it is or it's not,
let's go.

26
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,040
There's gotta be something in here.

27
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,376
- Okay, that's enough, let's go.
- Okay.

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,219
<i>The Charmed Ones.</i>

29
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,348
You're not supposed to be here.

30
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,058
Actually, I think
you got that backwards.

31
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,728
Wait.

32
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:43,937
Stop.

33
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,731
I mean it.

34
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,941
So, what, are these hall monitors
working for you now?

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,443
Does Billie know about this?

36
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,570
Billie's not your concern anymore.

37
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,364
And neither is this place,
so just go now.

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,034
Sorry, that's a no-can-do.

39
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,578
What are you gonna do, Paige?
Are you gonna vanquish me?

40
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,166
Oh, wait, I'm human
and that's murder.

41
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,751
That's illegal, isn't it?

42
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,962
That is unless it's self-defence.

43
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,757
I guess we'll just have to see
how this plays out then, won't we?

44
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,092
Let's get out of here.

45
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,887
We'll be seeing you again.

46
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,434
You're not supposed to be here.

47
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:27,231
Yes, but I was told they were here.
I thought...

48
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,983
I promised my sister
they wouldn't be hurt.

49
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,154
Not until we're ready.

50
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,937
Just out of curiosity,

51
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,439
was it easier dealing
with all of this stuff

52
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,900
when Leo was mortal,
or when Leo was magical?

53
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,236
It was easier
when he was still around.

54
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,612
Well, obviously.

55
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,821
I just mean, you know,

56
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,907
being pulled away
by demons all the time.

57
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,952
Oh, I don't know,
it's kind of a toss-up.

58
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,412
When he was magical,
he understood more.

59
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,998
But when he was human,
he was in more danger,

60
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,750
so I was more worried.

61
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,128
So what I'm hearing you say
is that it pretty much sucks either way.

62
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,256
Yes, basically.

63
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,924
Fantastic.

64
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,969
You just got married. You know,
give it some time, you'll get used to it.

65
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,388
But, see, that's the thing.
I don't want to get used to it.

66
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,265
I want to be able to go away
with my husband,

67
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,434
go out, do things without always
being called back on some emergency.

68
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,770
Yes, well, good luck with that.

69
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,940
Piper, Paige, come here.

70
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,441
Now what'd she find?

71
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:20,195
Probably another reason
to avoid Coop.

72
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,615
I think I ID'd the new power.

73
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,619
Yeah, are you sure you're just
not trying to keep busy to avoid...?

74
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,622
Piper, I told you,
if worst comes to worst, I will totally...

75
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,541
I'm not talking
about Billie and Christy.

76
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,126
I'm talking about Coop.

77
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,963
- What about Coop?
- Yeah, what about Coop?

78
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,302
I love Coop, okay?

79
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,637
I'm in love with Coop.

80
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,806
I love him and I just can't help it.

81
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,600
But this has nothing to do with that.

82
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,143
Hey, it's completely understandable.

83
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,145
You're miserable
that he can't love you back,

84
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,521
he's not allowed to,

85
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,357
and so you'd like to take
your frustrations out on some demons.

86
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,651
Can we please just focus here?

87
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:00,861
We are running out of time,

88
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,863
and we have no idea
what we're up against.

89
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,489
Since we can't go back
to Magic School

90
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,782
because it's not safe for us,

91
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,994
I compiled a little list here
of all the good magical creatures

92
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,996
that have helped us in the past.

93
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,457
Why are leprechauns
at the top of the list?

94
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,834
Well, because they have luck
and we need luck.

95
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,463
Yeah, but isn't that like throwing them
into the lion's den?

96
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,131
No, I mean,
it has to do with them too.

97
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,884
It's good versus evil, you know,
it affects all of us.

98
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,136
What happened to my life
that I wound up

99
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,639
having to talk to leprechauns
so much?

100
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,475
I'm sorry, honey,
but you know them best.

101
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,810
Okay, you and I
are gonna go upstairs

102
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,231
and see if we can ID
Christy's new hall-monitor friend.

103
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,034
Hey, there you are.

104
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,827
God, I've been looking all over
for you.

105
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,204
Well, I've just been here.

106
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:53,705
Doing what?

107
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,917
Just writing stuff down
about the sisters.

108
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,045
That's good, that's really good, Billie.

109
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,880
We can figure out
what their weaknesses are.

110
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,715
Yeah, well, I'm hoping
we can disempower them

111
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,175
so we don't have to hurt them.

112
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,385
Who are you kidding, Billie?

113
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,596
It's gonna take a hell of a lot more than
that to stop them, and you know it.

114
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,223
No, I don't know it.

115
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,976
I mean, besides, Piper has kids.

116
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,310
She has a baby, for God's sakes.

117
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,563
How can you even think
of wanting to hurt a mom?

118
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,439
What about our mom?

119
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,525
She didn't have any concern
about her.

120
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,570
Look, I didn't seek this out, Billie.

121
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,113
This was given to me.

122
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,739
It was given to us.

123
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,076
Yeah, we're supposed to take down
the most powerful witches of all time.

124
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,744
That's what this nightmare's
all about.

125
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,540
- So now I'm a nightmare.
- No, going against good people is.

126
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,001
They're not good people, Billie.

127
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,044
If they were,
we wouldn't be in this position.

128
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,921
They've lost their way.

129
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,965
And the longer it takes for you
to figure that out,

130
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,633
the more time they have
to attack us.

131
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,595
Like they tried to do today.

132
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,264
What are you talking about?

133
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,891
They were here.

134
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,100
I saw them.

135
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,311
Are you sure
they were looking for us?

136
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,439
- Billie.
- Look, if they come after us, fine.

137
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,983
I was wrong, we don't have a choice.
But until they do...

138
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,820
If we give them enough time
to attack us, we'll die.

139
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,283
You know what, Billie?

140
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,286
I'm tired of trying
to convince you of this.

141
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,288
If you don't wanna believe me,
then fine.

142
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:21,084
But I'm gonna introduce you
to someone that you'll have to believe.

143
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,841
Come on already.

144
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,510
- You.
- I'll raise you two.

145
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,558
Now, what, for God's sake,
could you possibly be wanting now?

146
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:40,979
Look, I know you just did me a favour,
okay, which I so appreciate,

147
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,856
but I just need this one thing.

148
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,816
The balance of good and evil
depends on it.

149
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,985
Well, it's always something
with you people.

150
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,862
It shouldn't take long,
it's super easy.

151
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,490
All I need you to do
is sneak into Magic School

152
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:54,993
and just identify a certain evil,
that's all.

153
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,204
A demon, no doubt.

154
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,122
Place is swarming with them.

155
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,959
Probably part of the brewing storm
we've been hearing about.

156
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,628
Exactly, that's it,
that's all you have to do.

157
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,630
We're leprechauns.

158
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,049
We toss a bit of luck about
here and there.

159
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,344
These big battles, well,
they're really more up your alley.

160
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,055
This fight affects us all.

161
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:19,643
Still, like he said,
we're not much for the fighting.

162
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,520
Might be better if we sit this one out.

163
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,147
Well, if the balance of power shifts,

164
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,483
you're gonna be doing an awful lot
of sitting around here,

165
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,987
because there's gonna be nobody
to protect you from all that evil.

166
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,698
Look, I came to you guys first,

167
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:36,076
because you're smart,
you're cunning, you're brave...

168
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,204
- Good-looking.
- You're damn good-looking.

169
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,914
I mean, that's for sure.

170
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:45,002
But hey, if you don't wanna help me
stop the Ultimate Power, that's okay.

171
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,714
I'll just go ask the gnomes.

172
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,215
What?

173
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,342
The gnomes are idiots.

174
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,053
You can't trust them any further
than you can throw them.

175
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,393
All right, we'll do it.

176
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,020
But we don't like it.

177
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,744
All right, Phoebe...

178
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,958
Jeez, what, are you mad at me
or something?

179
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,253
No, of course not,
why would I be mad at you?

180
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,882
All right, good, because I think
I found you the man of your dreams.

181
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,300
Oh, really, do you?

182
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,512
Yes, yes, I do.
I think he's perfect for you.

183
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,764
He's an aid worker in Bangladesh.

184
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:43,435
He's rugged, handsome, you know,
a real do-gooder type.

185
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,229
Of course, there's the long-distance
thing,

186
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,855
and you're gonna need to get shots.

187
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:50,108
Okay, yeah, I'm not gonna get
vaccinations to go meet a guy.

188
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,778
What's the matter,
you couldn't find anyone in the area?

189
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,113
Well, yeah, yeah, sure I can.

190
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,492
You know, I don't think you understand
how difficult it is.

191
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,953
It's not my fault that you reject
every guy that I bring.

192
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,162
Wait, every guy?

193
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,331
Coop, there's been one guy, one.

194
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,833
Yeah, but he was a really good guy.

195
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,084
Okay, you know what I think?

196
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:11,255
I think that you just have no idea
what I want.

197
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,592
Oh, I know exactly what it is
that you're looking for.

198
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,428
No, trust me, you have no idea.

199
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,180
All right,
then why don't you enlighten me?

200
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,150
You.

201
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,656
And I know it's impossible,

202
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,535
because of the rules
and everything, but...

203
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:59,219
Okay, so Dad is taking the boys
to the zoo...

204
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:03,223
Wow, excuse me,
hello, hi, sorry to interrupt.

205
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,935
But, you know, Ultimate Power,
mysterious things, gotta go, tick-tock.

206
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,354
Right, right, exactly.

207
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,940
You should probably go,
I'm thinking, you know?

208
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,193
Yeah, we'II...

209
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,446
- Talk to you later.
- Okay, yeah.

210
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,241
Oh, God, I know, I know,
it's forbidden love.

211
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:25,621
And I'm doomed and we're doomed,
and everything is doomed.

212
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,456
That about sums it up.

213
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:31,210
Well, at least you're not avoiding
anything anymore.

214
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,420
Did you happen
to ID Christy's hall monitor?

215
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,714
Yeah, but he's gotta get away
from Magic School

216
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,216
before we can do anything.

217
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,967
Okay, that's all right.

218
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:43,055
Because when we do, he'll talk,
I guarantee it.

219
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,191
What is this?

220
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,901
You'll see.

221
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,195
No, this is creepy,
I'm getting out of here.

222
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,947
Don't be afraid, Billie.

223
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,823
It's me.

224
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,623
Oh, my God.

225
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,627
You're all grown up now, aren't you?

226
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,254
How is this possible?

227
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,214
Anything's possible here, Billie.

228
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,799
That's why I come here.

229
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,425
For guidance, for him.

230
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,761
But he's not real, is he?

231
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,304
I've always been real, Billie.

232
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,391
Just like I've always been there
for you both.

233
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,434
I wasn't just an imaginary friend.

234
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,689
Who do you think wrote in my diary
and told you how to find me?

235
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,440
He prepared us for everything.

236
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,819
I was sent by the greater powers
to show you your destiny,

237
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,988
to help you understand
that your powers

238
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,865
were given to you for a reason:

239
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,785
To do good,
and to keep what's bad in check.

240
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,912
So this is where you get that from?

241
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,122
Yes, it is.

242
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:53,375
Much is at stake, Billie, and only you
and your sister can stop it.

243
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,960
This is the reason,
this is the moment

244
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,962
why you were gifted
with these powers.

245
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,841
To save the future from this.

246
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,970
<i>Of all the people to betray me.</i>

247
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,972
<i>I didn't go back
to betray you, Wyatt.</i>

248
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,765
<i>I went back to save you.</i>

249
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,475
Wyatt?

250
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,312
<i>Save me? From what?</i>

251
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,148
<i>It's all about power,
it's as simple as that.</i>

252
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,318
<i>That's why I keep
this museum intact,</i>

253
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,486
<i>to remind everyone the power
from which I was born</i>

254
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,155
<i>and that which I possess.</i>

255
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,249
Wyatt.

256
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,542
Piper's progeny.

257
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,253
That same sweet little boy
you once babysat.

258
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,507
That is what unchecked power
will become in the future.

259
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,344
A future that only you
and your sister can save.

260
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,847
It is your destiny.

261
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,855
I can't.

262
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,107
Billie, wait.

263
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:13,372
<i>We are not pleased, Dumain.</i>

264
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,503
<i>And we are running out of time.</i>

265
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,261
<i>This was your plan, Dumain.</i>

266
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,887
<i>You came to us.</i>

267
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:32,891
<i>We didn't sacrifice ourselves,
our lives, only to fail now.</i>

268
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,101
We haven't failed.

269
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,062
We just underestimated
Billie's connection to the witches.

270
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,565
It's a lot stronger
than we anticipated.

271
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:42,234
<i>You mean stronger
than you anticipated.</i>

272
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:46,822
For 15 years, I've worked tirelessly
to bring this plan to fruition.

273
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,448
We will succeed.

274
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,702
<i>Not unless we can kill
the Charmed Ones, we won't.</i>

275
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,954
<i>And Billie remains reticent.</i>

276
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,747
As do the Charmed Ones.

277
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,666
They, too, hesitate
to attack fellow humans,

278
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:58,876
as I knew they would.

279
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,627
<i>But they won't hesitate for long.</i>

280
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,422
Don't ignore the great progress
we've made.

281
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,717
We've successfully
inverted morality.

282
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,719
We've convinced
both Christy and Billie

283
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,429
that the Charmed Ones
are the evil ones.

284
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:13,932
<i>Which does us no good
unless Billie is able to kill them.</i>

285
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:17,352
<i>And if she can't,
the balance of power won't shift.</i>

286
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,938
<i>And we won't have the power
to return.</i>

287
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:23,942
<i>Which means
you won't become one of us.</i>

288
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,446
Have faith, my lords.

289
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:31,617
Once Billie is fully turned,
and believe me, she's close...

290
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,285
<i>Wait.</i>

291
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,662
<i>Someone is coming.</i>

292
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,759
Oh, me aching back.

293
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:53,055
Serves me right though,
for letting them witches strong-arm me

294
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:55,516
into being their lackey again.

295
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,644
Aye, for the love of Saint Andrew,
stop your griping, will you?

296
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,609
Something's not right here.

297
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:09,655
Oh, let's just get this over with,
shall we?

298
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,200
Well, what are you gonna do,
take a photo?

299
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,620
No, I'm identifying the threat
like she asked us to.

300
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,163
Do you have a better idea?

301
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,000
And you call yourself a leprechaun.

302
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,339
<i>Let luck reveal what can't be seen</i>

303
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,144
Leave it,
we'll find another way back.

304
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,188
Oh, curse those Charmed Ones.

305
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,983
Like lambs to slaughter, we are.

306
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:57,661
We may have just found a way
to help Billie cross the final threshold.

307
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,957
She may not believe
the Charmed Ones are evil from us.

308
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,876
But she'll believe it from them.

309
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,587
<i>Agreed. Summon Creo.</i>

310
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,547
Creo.

311
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,052
At your service, my lord.

312
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,394
Because you've never had friends,
you don't know what it's like for me.

313
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,479
I have Dumain and I trust him.

314
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,815
Can you honestly say that
about the sisters

315
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:28,817
after they've put their needs
above yours

316
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,694
every single chance they've got?

317
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,863
Look, I admit
they've become a little selfish,

318
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,782
but they haven't done anything
bad enough to deserve to die for it.

319
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,452
But, Billie, they will
and then it'll be too late.

320
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,954
- You don't know that.
- You saw their inner truths.

321
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,081
How they're being corrupted
by power.

322
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:46,919
- It's our destiny...
- Oh, I'm so sick of this destiny crap.

323
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,963
Demons.

324
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,765
No!

325
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,646
What are you doing here?

326
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,106
Wait.

327
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,316
Perhaps you should use him

328
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,443
to send a message
to the other demons.

329
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,071
Good idea.

330
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,992
Any more of your demons come here
and attack our friends,

331
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,744
they're dead, do you understand?

332
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:30,671
Are you okay?

333
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:34,174
Yeah, sure. Thanks to you.

334
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,468
Well, you guys can come out now,
it's safe.

335
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,180
Don't worry, we're your friends.

336
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,645
You never really know for sure
these days.

337
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,273
What were you doing here anyway?
Why did you risk coming here?

338
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,651
We were sent.

339
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,653
Really? By whom?

340
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,991
The Charmed Ones.

341
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,167
Paige hasn't heard
from the leprechauns,

342
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,877
which is not a good sign.

343
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:13,046
I just hope we didn't confirm
the mystery power's existence

344
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,506
at their expense.

345
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,216
Yeah, that would be a bad thing,

346
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,844
which also means that
we're running out of time looking for it.

347
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,137
Tell me about it.

348
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,598
I'm beginning to think
that the Ultimate Power's power

349
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,141
is to drive us crazy.

350
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:28,979
I think you're gonna have to face
some harsh realities soon, Phoebe.

351
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,773
We may just have to...

352
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,983
Don't say the K-word.

353
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,028
Do not say the K-word in regards
to Billie and Christy, please.

354
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,988
Okay, well,
just because you don't wanna say it,

355
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,698
doesn't mean we won't have to do it.

356
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,911
Oh, okay, and push comes to shove,
you're gonna be able to do it?

357
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,829
You're actually gonna be able
to kill them?

358
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,749
If it's us or them, absolutely.

359
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,376
Look, we're not talking
about innocents here, Phoebe.

360
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,545
And whether or not
there's a force behind them,

361
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:57,674
the Triad handpicked them to kill us.
I mean, it's time to get real.

362
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:00,302
That's even more reason
to avoid confrontation

363
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,138
and figure out who's behind them.

364
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:05,724
Which I think I may have just done.

365
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,935
- You found the demon?
- I think so.

366
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,853
Okay, I'll get Paige.

367
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,564
We'll use your truth potion
to pry a name out of them,

368
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:15,400
and you stay here and figure out
if the leprechauns are coming back.

369
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,903
Well, what if they don't?
What if something...

370
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,698
...happened to them?

371
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,409
I'm sure I was a goner.

372
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,745
I guess that's why
I'm a little shaken up.

373
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,373
Don't worry, you're safe now,
I promise.

374
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,625
I just don't understand
why the demons keep coming back.

375
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,836
I thought we killed all of them.

376
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,587
There. Good as new.

377
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,424
I thank you for that
and for saving us.

378
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,262
Just one thing I can't figure.

379
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,639
You folks are good,

380
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:48,892
so why did the Charmed Ones
send us here?

381
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,061
That's what we're still trying
to figure out.

382
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:53,063
What did they say
they wanted you to do?

383
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,066
It was to find a great evil.

384
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,776
They called it "the Ultimate Power. "

385
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,822
And they said it was evil?

386
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:03,115
What else did they tell you?

387
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:07,119
That the power was huge
and that they were bent on stopping it.

388
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,121
Really?

389
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:10,789
And how did they plan
on doing that?

390
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,459
Same as they deal with all evil,
I suppose. Vanquish it.

391
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:15,919
Is that what they said?

392
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:19,173
That they were gonna vanquish
the Ultimate Power? Are you sure?

393
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,799
Well, they didn't actually say that.

394
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,094
But that's what they do, isn't it?

395
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,346
I just don't know why
they would send you guys here

396
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:27,639
to do their dirty work.

397
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:29,975
Have they done this before?

398
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,602
All the time.

399
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,353
It's not just us.

400
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,647
They use
the whole magical community.

401
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:39,902
Yet they never took the time
to save Magic School from demons?

402
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,486
Couldn't break a nail, I guess.

403
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:43,655
Cannon fodder.

404
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,449
It's what we've become to them.

405
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,203
Now do you believe everything
I've been telling you?

406
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,257
We give up everything for them.

407
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,635
And this is the thanks we get?

408
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,804
What does Dumain think we are?
Lackeys?

409
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:10,724
We've had this conversation.

410
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,768
It's all part of the Triad's plan.

411
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:14,353
We'll get what we deserve
soon enough.

412
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,021
Yeah, that's what you keep saying.

413
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,731
But I'm still sleeping
behind a dumpster.

414
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,233
We do as we're told.

415
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,235
Even if we have
to make the ultimate sacrifice,

416
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,529
it's all part of the greater victory.

417
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:28,367
Yeah, but if we're not a part of it,
I'm not sacrificing anything.

418
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:30,369
You signed an oath in blood.

419
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:32,120
We both did.

420
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:33,413
And if you don't protect them,

421
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,249
you'll face a fate
much worse than death.

422
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,209
Funny you should say that.

423
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,045
Demons.

424
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:48,178
We have a few questions for you.

425
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:56,228
Gentlemen, who is the wizard
behind the curtain, so to speak?

426
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:57,896
- The what?
- The demon.

427
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,106
Who are you working for?

428
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:01,900
The demon is...

429
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,193
No.

430
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:06,196
- We can't.
- Too bad you don't have a choice.

431
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,673
Two and a half corn dogs?
What, are you crazy?

432
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,094
Dad, he's 3,
I don't care if he begged.

433
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,347
Look, I gotta go, but seriously,

434
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,516
no more junk food
or he will vomit on you.

435
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,729
- Where's the demon?
- In the wasteland probably.

436
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:41,648
Him and his pal vanquished each other
so they didn't have to talk.

437
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,066
They sacrificed themselves?

438
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,610
Yep. Scary, huh?

439
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,987
Any word
from our little green friends?

440
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,280
No, nothing.

441
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:50,449
I hope they're okay.

442
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:55,120
- What are you doing?
- I am going to call them.

443
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:05,339
Well, I might have known it was you.

444
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,925
Dropping us on our behinds.

445
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,010
You've no right
to call us back like that.

446
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,845
Well, I'm sorry, I was worried.

447
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,889
Are you okay?

448
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:17,684
Now you're worried,
after sending us into harm's way.

449
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,728
We wouldn't have done it
if it wasn't important.

450
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:22,481
Yeah, come on guys,
we're trying to save the future here.

451
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:23,982
So you say.

452
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:26,151
I'll be taking that back now,
thank you.

453
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:27,528
Hey, what are you doing?

454
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,030
We're no longer
at your beck and call.

455
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:33,951
That was a gift.

456
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:37,704
And don't bother calling.

457
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,376
Oh, wow, what's wrong with them?

458
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,336
I don't know but it's not good.

459
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:50,050
Okay, I know leprechauns are crabby
but this is different.

460
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,761
What do you mean, you think Billie
and Christy got to them somehow?

461
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:55,055
Or maybe somebody else did.

462
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:57,140
I just can't believe
they turned on us like that.

463
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:58,475
I mean, what did we do?

464
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,185
Maybe it's not anything we did.

465
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,396
Maybe it's something
Billie and Christy did,

466
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:03,772
or whoever's behind it.

467
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:05,065
What are you saying?

468
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:06,984
I'm saying I think they did
to the leprechauns

469
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,527
what the Triad did to them.

470
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,445
Turn them against us?

471
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:13,240
Twist everything around
and make us look like the bad guys.

472
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,617
That's crazy,
they would never believe that.

473
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:16,869
Sure they would.

474
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,912
Think about our track record
with them lately.

475
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,415
But what purpose would that serve?
I mean, why even bother?

476
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:22,791
I don't know, to isolate us,

477
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,794
make sure we have a little less backup
in our time of need.

478
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:27,212
You mean when they attack.

479
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,798
Maybe that's what
they've been waiting for.

480
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:31,884
Well, we have to warn
the magical community.

481
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,136
- Tell them not to fall for it.
- Where's that list?

482
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:36,138
- Upstairs, I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.

483
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:39,391
You talk to Coop, make sure they don't
try to turn anybody else against us.

484
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:42,561
And I am going to talk
to our little friends again.

485
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,147
I think that's kind of a waste of time.

486
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:48,901
I don't think so. I'm not letting them
off the hook that easily.

487
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,903
We're almost there, my lords.

488
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:54,573
<i>Almost?</i>

489
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:57,659
<i>The longer it takes,
the greater the chance</i>

490
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,912
<i>she'll regain sympathy
for the Charmed Ones.</i>

491
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:03,081
<i>Which we already know
Billie is prone to do.</i>

492
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,791
I don't think that's going to happen.

493
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,211
Especially now that she believes
the leprechauns were set up

494
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:08,420
by the Charmed Ones.

495
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:09,630
<i>Then what's the delay?</i>

496
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,465
<i>Either she's ready
to kill them or she's not.</i>

497
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:14,843
She's close, she just needs
a little more convincing.

498
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,304
Once she thinks the Charmed Ones
have turned their backs

499
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:18,931
on the entire magical community...

500
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:20,140
<i>Well, that's impossible.</i>

501
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:22,518
<i>The community's too vast
and too loyal to the sisters</i>

502
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,936
<i>for years of protecting them.</i>

503
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,771
We need to create a situation

504
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:27,523
where they won't be there
to protect them.

505
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,942
<i>- How?
- Simple.</i>

506
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:31,193
We distract the Charmed Ones

507
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,153
when the magical beings
need them most,

508
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,949
using the same distractions
that have worked on them in the past.

509
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:42,162
Billie herself has provided us
with all we need to know.

510
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:48,126
The witch doctor
who turned inner truth into obsession.

511
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:51,046
That should work quite nicely
on Paige.

512
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:55,592
Should be enough
for the lot of us to tough it out.

513
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:56,802
Aye.

514
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,804
If things get as bad
as I think they're going to,

515
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:00,931
no amount of luck will be too much.

516
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:03,976
Battening down the hatches we are.

517
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,315
Now, what do you think
you're doing here?

518
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:12,025
You're no longer welcome here.

519
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:16,154
That is exactly the kind of attitude
that I am here to talk to you about.

520
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,906
Our attitude?

521
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:20,325
It's your attitudes in question here.

522
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,953
Look, I don't know
who has gotten to you,

523
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,373
but contrary to popular belief,
we are still the good guys, okay?

524
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,292
And the fact that you guys
have gone demon-free

525
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,752
for all these years
pretty much proves that point.

526
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:33,505
Still, things change.

527
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:36,550
People change,
especially human people.

528
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:38,886
- Same difference.
- You know what I mean.

529
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:41,054
What I know is that this is not the time
to bail on us

530
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,806
just because
we've had our differences

531
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:46,101
or because someone
has been whispering in your ear.

532
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:50,355
We are going into a very big battle,
which you obviously know about,

533
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:53,358
because somebody
has been stockpiling luck.

534
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,241
You were saying?

535
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:03,535
What am I doing here?

536
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:06,205
I need to find enlightenment.

537
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,583
But you were telling us
about the battle.

538
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,585
Oh, battle.

539
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:13,712
Well, good luck with that.

540
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:23,222
I've always found lust

541
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,432
to be the greatest
of the seven deadly sins.

542
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,435
And apparently, so has Phoebe.

543
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:31,104
Coop.

544
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,564
Coop.

545
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:35,400
Oh, it's about time. I was wondering
when you were gonna get here.

546
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,862
Listen, I... Oh, no, not that.

547
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:41,114
- Not now.
- Not what?

548
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:44,451
You know,
whatever is in your mind right now.

549
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:46,411
We've got a big problem.

550
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:47,663
Yeah, I know, I know.

551
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,749
If there's one thing I know about love,
it's that we'll always find a way...

552
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,417
No, no, no, that's not the problem.

553
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:55,295
I mean, that is obviously,
you know, a problem.

554
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,130
But that's not the problem.

555
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:58,924
Okay, I don't understand.

556
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:02,928
Okay, look, there's this new power
at Magic School

557
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:05,806
and we're afraid that it's gonna turn
everybody against us.

558
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:07,933
Okay, and by everyone,
you mean?

559
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,604
Ogres, fairies, leprechauns,
cupids, maybe?

560
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:20,779
All right,
well, when will all this happen?

561
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:23,115
Phoebe?

562
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,326
You all right?

563
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:34,793
Their grandmother's wedding ring,

564
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,253
which she apparently put a hex on

565
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,797
to remind her of the horrors
of being a housewife.

566
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:42,634
Should be perfect for Piper,
considering her current situation.

567
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:56,481
Oh, crap.

568
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,694
This place is a mess.

569
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:08,494
Now it's time to bring in the demons.

570
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,914
It won't be long now before everyone's
against the Charmed Ones.

571
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,499
Especially Billie.

572
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:32,351
All right now.

573
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:34,686
Let's go, boys.

574
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:45,989
Now, we all know
that the winds of war are blowing.

575
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:47,658
Yes, yes.

576
00:31:47,825 --> 00:31:50,536
It's time we faced the facts.

577
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:55,374
The Charmed Ones can't be trusted
to help us anymore.

578
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:56,959
I don't believe that.

579
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,877
They've always been there for us.

580
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,879
Well, you didn't see Paige today

581
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:03,549
come here to beg us
to fight the coming evil.

582
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,467
Except she left right in the middle,

583
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,387
all in a hurry
to go find enlightenment

584
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:10,722
or get her nails done
or who knows what.

585
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:12,641
They don't care anymore.

586
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:15,394
Like last year,
when they took on new identities,

587
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:18,480
stepping away from the fight
without so much as a goodbye.

588
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:19,898
They did it to stop Zankou.

589
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:23,360
Just one of the many threats
they saved us from.

590
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:27,197
They stopped The Source,
the Avatars, the Triad.

591
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:29,992
Who are we to question them?

592
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,912
Witches prophesied centuries ago
to fight for the greater good.

593
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,042
That's just the point.

594
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:40,836
They don't anymore.

595
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:44,423
They don't care enough
to protect us from...

596
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:56,018
Run! Run this way!

597
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:17,080
Follow me, follow me!

598
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:25,422
If we don't get the Charmed Ones,
we're all dead.

599
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:45,609
Paige, you gotta help us.

600
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:47,069
We're under attack.

601
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,571
I'm sorry, this is me-time.

602
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:51,323
They killed Liam.

603
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,450
They're trying to kill us all.

604
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:55,994
I'm trying to find a deeper meaning.

605
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:57,996
Please go. Bay.

606
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:17,349
Help.

607
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:20,102
Phoebe. Please.

608
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:26,108
We're being attacked.

609
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:28,610
What? Not now.

610
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:30,154
- You all right?
- Yeah.

611
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,197
- You want me to stop?
- No.

612
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:05,189
May I help you?

613
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:06,398
What's that?

614
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:11,737
You and the whole magical community
is under attack?

615
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:16,033
Demons are slaughtering you
left and right?

616
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,493
Your only hope is us?

617
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:22,581
Well, I'm sorry, but unfortunately,
I can't help you.

618
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:26,001
I need to be here
for when Leo comes home.

619
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:39,097
That's just awful.

620
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:40,933
I just vacuumed there.

621
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:58,742
<i>Help! Help us!</i>

622
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:01,787
What's wrong? What happened?

623
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:04,790
Demons. They're attacking us all!

624
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:07,292
But where are the Charmed Ones?

625
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,461
Leaving us to die.

626
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:13,215
We'll take care of that.

627
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:25,269
Piper.

628
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:26,478
Paige.

629
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:29,022
Thank God, you're all right.
Why didn't you answer your cell?

630
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:30,440
I left it at the condo.

631
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:33,986
- Was a spell cast on you as well?
- Yes. I don't know what happened.

632
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:37,656
One second I was talking to Coop,
and the next, I was attacking him.

633
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:40,492
- Magically?
- No, sexually.

634
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:42,161
Who do you think did this to us?

635
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:43,370
Who else? Billie.

636
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:46,498
She's the only one who knows us well
enough to use our past against us.

637
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:48,625
- I'm gonna kill her.
- Where have you been?

638
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:52,129
Okay, the big question is,
what do we do now?

639
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:55,883
They seem to be one step ahead of us.
I mean, we tried to warn our friends.

640
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:58,010
Who probably think
we've abandoned them.

641
00:36:58,177 --> 00:37:00,679
Yeah, well, we need to find them
and change their minds.

642
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:02,639
The only way to do that
is to save them.

643
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:13,525
What's going on?

644
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:15,861
We were just coming to save you.

645
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:19,740
Well, we've already been saved,
and not by you.

646
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:25,204
For years, we thought
you were on our side, counted on you.

647
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:29,208
Then to leave us high and dry.

648
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:32,878
- Hey, we were under a spell.
- Yeah?

649
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:34,963
We wanted to save you
but something wouldn't let us.

650
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,590
You've betrayed us.

651
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:45,349
It's always one thing
or another with you, isn't it?

652
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:48,936
Our good friends
are being slaughtered,

653
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:52,439
while you're kissing your loved ones
or contemplating your navels.

654
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:56,401
Billie and Christy
were right about you.

655
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:59,238
Look, they're twisting everything.
It's not what you think.

656
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:01,532
They know exactly what to think.

657
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,283
They think it's over.

658
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:05,077
And so do we.

659
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,751
The "Book. "

660
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:22,636
What...?

661
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:24,930
How did we get here?

662
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,723
I don't know,
I aimed for Magic School.

663
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,102
They must have protected it
from us.

664
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:33,772
Wait, so there's demons up there
and we're stuck in the Underworld?

665
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:36,358
We're the bad guys now.

666
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:39,027
Well, how did that happen?

667
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:42,239
Well, more importantly,
what are we gonna do now?

668
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,584
Oh, this is bad. This is really bad.

669
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:58,630
<i>They've escaped.</i>

670
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:00,632
But not for long, they're on the run.

671
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,676
Banished with nowhere to turn.

672
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:05,929
<i>So how can they be destroyed?</i>

673
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:07,139
They won't give up.

674
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:10,017
They'll attack Billie and Christy
with everything they've got.

675
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:12,811
<i>And so will begin
the ultimate battle.</i>

676
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:18,609
One which will destroy all the witches,
including Billie and Christy.

677
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:21,278
<i>Then we can return...</i>

678
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,655
<i>...once and for all.</i>
