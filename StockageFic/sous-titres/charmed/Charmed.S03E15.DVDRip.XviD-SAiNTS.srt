0
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:07,001
Okay, that should be good.

1
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:09,603
I'm thinking more to the left.

2
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:12,963
Is this the biggest arch
you could get?

3
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:15,883
Without opening
a fast-food franchise, yeah.

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,838
Well, just remember,
if love is the quest,

5
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:21,239
then marriage is the conquest.

6
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,646
This place must feel like victory.

7
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:26,885
And I thought weddings
were supposed to be romantic.

8
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:28,078
Oh, my dear, sweet child.

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,723
Better listen to Grams.
You could always calculate her age

10
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:32,686
by the number of rings on her fingers.

11
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:38,801
All right, wedding arch is done.

12
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:42,126
The next thing to do
on the to-do list is...

13
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,439
Sleep. You've been yawning all day.

14
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:47,282
Try all week. It's this reoccurring
dream I keep having.

15
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:49,679
- It's keeping me awake.
- Really?

16
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:50,918
What's in the dream?

17
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:56,249
Well, there's this biker guy, and he's
kind of cute and kind of dangerous.

18
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:57,848
Sounds kind of yummy.

19
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:03,403
Piper, sweetie, well,
what do you think?

20
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,805
It's... It's beautiful.

21
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,166
Yeah, and the best part about it is,
it's finally happening.

22
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:15,484
Flowers and bows and Grams.
The only thing missing is...

23
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:17,848
Mom.

24
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,206
Grams, are you sure
that you can't do...?

25
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:24,884
No, nothing. I'm only here
because you need a high priestess.

26
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,279
They want me back
by the witching hour tomorrow.

27
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:28,922
I thought maybe this could help.

28
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:33,881
You okay?

29
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,406
Yeah, I just... I can't believe how close
I came to sabotaging my own wedding.

30
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:40,440
- What do you mean?
- Well, with the demons

31
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:43,601
and the false starts and them, l...
You know,

32
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,487
I told myself if one more thing
went wrong,

33
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:47,844
then it just maybe
wasn't meant to be.

34
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,609
Darling, there's no need
to think that way. I mean, you made it.

35
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:56,401
Yeah, and I will personally butt-kick
any demon who tries to ruin it for you.

36
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:58,685
Not if you're asleep.
Come on, I'm tucking you in.

37
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:00,766
Sweet dreams.

38
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:02,487
Bye.

39
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:08,363
I'll see you tomorrow
at 4:00, Mrs. Halliwell.

40
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,927
The women keep their names
in this family.

41
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:40,840
That's a lucky shot.

42
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:49,008
The more I play, the luckier I get.

43
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:54,160
All right.

44
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,326
So that would be...

45
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,366
...20 bucks that you owe me.

46
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:02,997
I never agreed to no bet.

47
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:06,048
Rules of the house say
loser pays 20 bucks.

48
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,201
Maybe you want me to take you
out front and teach you those rules.

49
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,446
All right.

50
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:16,401
Easy.

51
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:18,283
Thank you.

52
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:24,479
So I suppose that you
want something for helping me.

53
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:26,401
- You could say that.
- You'll have to win it

54
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:27,922
just like the rest of them.

55
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:29,568
Maybe I should just take it.

56
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:31,888
Maybe you should leave me alone.

57
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:33,767
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

58
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:35,084
Maybe you should show me.

59
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:40,281
- Hi.
- Sorry I'm late.

60
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:42,201
Yeah, well, so am I
because now I have to go.

61
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:43,927
Well, I want you to stay.

62
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:45,841
Yeah, I know.

63
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:47,886
You know that I can't, right? I have...

64
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,920
Responsibilities.
It's what you say every night,

65
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:52,967
- then you cut out.
- T.J., I would love to leave

66
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:56,678
my responsible half behind,
but I can't.

67
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:59,608
You can. What are you gonna miss
tomorrow? Work?

68
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,478
Blow it off. There's a freedom that
comes with making your own choices.

69
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:05,522
I know.

70
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:09,642
Yeah, and I want to know
what that's like, but...

71
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,798
The least you could do
is tell me your name.

72
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:29,604
Hey. You got my money?

73
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:30,958
Hey, you have a good memory.

74
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:37,128
Yeah, yeah. Maybe I'll just take it out
in trade, huh? Come here.

75
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:49,763
No, I don't wanna go again...

76
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,685
Leo?

77
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,848
Was that just giggling I heard?

78
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:14,319
Yes, I am guilty of giggling,
and I am guilty of being happier

79
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:17,367
than any previous moment in my life.

80
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:19,122
Piper, it's your wedding day.

81
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:22,841
- I know.
- Here comes the bridesmaid.

82
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:27,448
Prue. Come play.

83
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,606
- Hey.
- Another bad dream?

84
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:35,647
Yeah. I was still in that biker bar,

85
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:39,040
but this time I was attacked
by a big galoot.

86
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:42,480
A galoot? What is that?
You fought a demon in your sleep?

87
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:45,288
If I'm gonna have to vanquish
a demon in my wedding dress,

88
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,639
just tell me, because if so, then...

89
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:51,442
All right? He was not
a demon, right?

90
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:53,201
He was just a big, rude guy.

91
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,842
And it was just in her dreams, honey.

92
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:58,405
Yeah, and the only thing I need to
vanquish him is a potion called coffee.

93
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:04,643
That must be the flowers.
Okay, you just relax, no worrying.

94
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:08,967
And eat your breakfast, and then I will
have a hot bubble bath waiting for you.

95
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:11,442
Sure there's nothing
witchy going on?

96
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:13,122
I'm positive.

97
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:32,448
Is that her?

98
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:34,162
That the woman
you were with last night?

99
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,399
Yeah, so what?

100
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:39,088
So, what's her name?

101
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:41,363
I don't know.

102
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:44,208
You stick your tongue down her throat,
but you don't know her name.

103
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,320
- Is that against the law?
- I can appreciate

104
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:48,957
you trying to protect your girlfriend
from murder charges.

105
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,320
- She's no murderer.
- You sure about that, son?

106
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:53,968
You know something?

107
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:56,165
I know what happened.
I saw it with my own eyes.

108
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:59,679
- Did you get a look at the killer?
- I'm looking at her right now.

109
00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:08,204
Check out what I found in the attic.

110
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:09,637
I hope it's something old,

111
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:12,369
because we already have new,
borrowed and blue covered.

112
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:15,202
Is Melinda Warren's
blessing cup old enough?

113
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,439
That is very cool.

114
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,327
What could be better
than to give Piper

115
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:22,879
the actual cup that our favourite
ancestor drank from at her wedding?

116
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:24,767
All right, I can check that off.

117
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:27,682
Now all I need is help moving
the buffet table.

118
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:31,764
Maybe we should wait
until Cole gets here.

119
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,442
He should be here any minute.

120
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:34,758
You're kidding, right?

121
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,803
No. You knew he was coming
to the wedding.

122
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:40,761
Yeah, to the wedding, Phoebe.

123
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,523
But the moments leading up to it
belong to family.

124
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,443
And I'm sorry, but Cole is not family,
okay?

125
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,167
He is still a demon.

126
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:51,048
And I don't think Piper
needs a demon...

127
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:56,325
It is bad luck to see the bride's dress
before the wedding.

128
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:58,406
But you're not even wearing
your dress.

129
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:02,397
The same rule applies to
the bride's curlers. Go away.

130
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:06,244
Oh, good, you're here.

131
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:07,962
I'm just looking for a place
to change.

132
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:13,759
- What's with the robe?
- Oh, it's my formal whitelighter wear.

133
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:17,882
Yeah, I hope you don't mind,
but we sort of decided

134
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:22,167
that you should be a little bit more
traditional, so we rented you a tux.

135
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:24,248
Anybody home?

136
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:26,519
Daddy.

137
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:29,124
- Hi.
- Hiya, Pheebs.

138
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:32,439
- Leo.
- Victor.

139
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:33,968
- Hi, Dad.
- Come here.

140
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:38,202
Well, I know that you two have a lot
of joy and laughter to share,

141
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:40,240
so I'll just take you down...

142
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:42,718
What's the matter?

143
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:45,408
Just stay there.

144
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:50,165
Dizzy spell. I've been getting them
ever since those dreams began.

145
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:53,486
- What dreams?
- Oh, you know, these dreams...

146
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:57,285
You know, it's nothing.

147
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:00,600
Yeah, certainly nothing to worry about.

148
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:04,557
Okay, you two, follow me. You just sit
there and relax. I'll be right back.

149
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:17,359
Get dressed, and no fighting.

150
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:24,958
So you rented a tux, huh?

151
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:28,327
I thought for sure you'd be wearing
one of those long robes

152
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:31,481
all you whitelighters love so much.

153
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:34,926
No, I decided to go
a little more traditional.

154
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:40,047
Prue.

155
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:45,645
Okay, we've got everyone convinced
that we have things under control.

156
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:48,004
Now you have to convince me.

157
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:49,761
I can't do that.

158
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:51,681
Oh, no.

159
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:53,488
What are you feeling?

160
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:57,005
Tired. All the time.
I mean, when I fall asleep,

161
00:10:57,169 --> 00:11:00,844
my dreams are so real
that they don't allow me any rest.

162
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:04,126
It's like I'm awake 24 hours a day.

163
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:07,004
Is the Dream Sorcerer back?

164
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:10,083
I don't think so,
but I'm not ruling anything out.

165
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:11,688
Well, remember what Piper said.

166
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:14,966
If one more thing goes wrong,
she was gonna call off this wedding.

167
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:16,568
No, we can't let that happen.

168
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:20,603
Okay, why don't you let me handle
this almighty to-do list,

169
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:22,522
and you go upstairs
and get some rest.

170
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:25,487
Don't sleep. Just rest.

171
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:27,401
Okay.

172
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:32,241
Well, so you're relinquishing control
to your little sister.

173
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:34,560
You must really be tired.

174
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:41,923
Please help us through this day, Mom.

175
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:15,203
- Hey.
- Hey.

176
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:18,122
- You shouldn't have come back.
- What are you talking about?

177
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:20,678
I spent all morning with the cops.
They think you killed a guy

178
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:24,637
- and took his money.
- No, I didn't kill anyone.

179
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:27,124
Good, because that's
what I told them.

180
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:30,122
So then why are you still here?

181
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:31,844
Waiting for you.

182
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:35,883
But I didn't have your phone number.
You never even gave me your name.

183
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,725
That is the sexiest thing
a man's ever done for me.

184
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,205
You keep saying you wanna live a life
with no rules, no responsibility.

185
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:53,879
This is it, your chance. Come on.

186
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,566
Take it easy.

187
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:13,521
Don't do it for me, T.J.

188
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:17,998
You don't wanna be
an accessory to murder.

189
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:25,485
The name's Prue. Prue Halliwell.

190
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:27,923
Put up your hands.

191
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:29,717
- Come on.
- Get over here.

192
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:32,198
Look, I already told you guys
everything I know.

193
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,640
Let's go.

194
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:40,281
Prue? Prue, wake up.

195
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,484
Prue.

196
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:47,762
Oh, no.

197
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,607
Oh, no.

198
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:12,962
I was wanted for murder,
but this guy in my dream,

199
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:16,883
he risked himself to save me.

200
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,078
This sexy guy.

201
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:20,479
Prue, forget the guy.
What about the arrest?

202
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:24,198
Right. Okay, a cop handcuffed me,
and that's all that I remember,

203
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:26,405
except that I didn't really
wanna wake up.

204
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:29,129
It's like my dream
was overpowering me.

205
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:31,678
That's what my premonitions
feel like.

206
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,840
They pull me against my will.

207
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,204
Maybe somebody's trying
to pull me into a parallel world

208
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:38,200
or a dream dimension.

209
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:41,167
Well, hopefully that someone
will be in the Book of Shadows, okay?

210
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:42,808
Come on.

211
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:44,408
Wait, should we tell Piper?

212
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:46,958
No, I won't let this be the one
thing that goes wrong today.

213
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:49,768
I'll be okay as long as I
stay awake, right? For Piper?

214
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,567
For Piper.

215
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:54,357
Hold it right there. What's wrong?

216
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:59,128
Boy bands. There's just far too many
of them, don't you think?

217
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:02,687
- No. What's wrong with you two?
- Nothing's wrong.

218
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:05,164
It's in your faces.
We've demon hunted for three years.

219
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:07,445
Now you're going to the attic,
aren't you?

220
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,281
- Yes.
- Phoebe.

221
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:12,322
- I knew it.
- Prue, she's on to us. She knows.

222
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:16,363
Yes, Piper,
we were heading to the attic

223
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:19,163
to find something old, something new.

224
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:21,889
Something borrowed
and something blue.

225
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:24,438
- Blue, yes.
- Right. We were gonna surprise you,

226
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:26,247
but now you caught us.

227
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:30,526
Yeah. I mean, look, I told you,
you have nothing to worry about today.

228
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:33,840
All right? It's going to be
a demon-free day.

229
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:38,088
- Hey!
- Sorry, I'm late.

230
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:39,238
You were saying?

231
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:43,364
Had a near miss with a Zotar.
Almost spotted me.

232
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:47,925
Oh, don't worry, I lost him. I think.

233
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:50,365
See? No matter what,
a demon will attack today.

234
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,804
It's just the natural order
of our universe.

235
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:54,681
Piper, you have to stay positive.

236
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:57,886
You know what? I have Celine Dion:
Behind the Music on video cassette.

237
00:15:58,089 --> 00:15:59,807
- Like to watch that?
- Like to get slapped?

238
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,687
Hey, she's just trying to relax you.

239
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:03,845
Don't worry.
Leave the demons to me.

240
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:05,601
I'll handle anything that comes
through...

241
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:06,804
Oh, no, you don't.

242
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:09,847
You promised you were not gonna use
your demonic powers anymore.

243
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:12,722
Oh, sorry. Old habit.

244
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:13,918
Yeah, think good.

245
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:17,405
No, I am, I am. I brought a gift.

246
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:24,722
So you and Piper gonna move out,
get your own place?

247
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,842
Not right away.

248
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,283
Between you and me,
isn't that a little tough on the old pride?

249
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,041
Living off the girls like that?

250
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:36,003
Look, Victor,
I know you don't like the idea

251
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:37,887
of your daughter marrying
a whitelighter.

252
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:40,005
Oh, I never said that.

253
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:43,201
But now that you mention it,
yeah, I'd prefer Piper marry a mortal.

254
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:45,718
Well, Piper's not mortal.
She's a witch.

255
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:48,357
She was given her gifts
to serve a higher calling.

256
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:51,402
A calling that only people like you
can understand, right?

257
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:53,878
It's the same crap
my ex-wife's whitelighter

258
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,687
used to steal her away from me.

259
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:58,404
You know, I'm sorry
that happened to you.

260
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,845
I really am.

261
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:04,083
But with all due respect,
this isn't about you and Patty.

262
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:06,717
This is about me and Piper.

263
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:10,367
Now, I love her with all my heart,
and I promise to keep loving her

264
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,485
and taking care of her
for the rest of this life,

265
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:14,367
the afterlife
and whatever comes after that.

266
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:16,804
Now, you may not support it,
and you may not agree with it,

267
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:19,728
but it is not gonna stop me
from marrying your daughter today.

268
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:21,083
Nothing will.

269
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:24,878
You know...

270
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:30,962
...I could probably get used to having
a whitelighter for a son-in-law.

271
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:37,804
Everybody having fun down here?

272
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:39,922
Where do you stand on demons?

273
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:45,079
Hey, did you find anything
in the Book about your dreams?

274
00:17:45,249 --> 00:17:46,648
- Nothing.
- What are we gonna do?

275
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,846
The wedding's in half an hour. Get
ready, get set, get through it for Piper.

276
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:51,522
For Piper.

277
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,007
Oh, you're so beautiful.

278
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:10,480
- Mom?
- Don't be afraid.

279
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:16,481
Oh, my God.

280
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:21,883
But no, it can't be,
because ghosts glow.

281
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:23,482
And you're not glowing.

282
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,048
Well, I'm not a ghost.

283
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:31,768
Well, not today.
Today I am simply your mother.

284
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:34,682
But how?

285
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,885
After all the Elders
put you and Leo through,

286
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:38,727
they wanted to give you
something back,

287
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:41,767
so they sent me down
just for your wedding day.

288
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:46,402
You know, I think I wore my hair
like this for my wedding day.

289
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:51,444
You did. I kept your wedding album
after you died, and...

290
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:56,757
And I looked at the pictures
every night like a bedtime story.

291
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:00,160
I always thought you'd be the first
to get married.

292
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:02,520
You're the heart of this family, Piper.

293
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:09,767
I'm not dreaming, am I?

294
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,241
No, sweetie, you're not.

295
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,201
Mom.

296
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:32,280
It's true. She's real.
They sent her to us for today.

297
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:36,564
Oh, Prue.

298
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:38,882
It's been so hard on you.

299
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:41,357
Unfair.

300
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:45,960
Yeah.

301
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:50,520
No. It doesn't matter.
I just wanted to make you proud.

302
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:55,126
You protected this family better
than I could. I'm so proud of you.

303
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:57,287
Thank you.

304
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,883
And you, my baby.

305
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:04,442
You feel it all, don't you?

306
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,645
I was never there to comfort you.

307
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:10,084
I died before you even knew me.

308
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:13,159
Some nights I just wanted you
to hold me.

309
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,040
Your road's been the longest,
Phoebe.

310
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:21,724
But I was never worried about you.
You know why?

311
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,562
Because I had a premonition
the day you were born.

312
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:27,124
- You did?
- What did you see?

313
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:29,122
Oh, I saw this.

314
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:31,402
I saw this moment right now,

315
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:36,563
my three daughters standing
before me as beautiful young women,

316
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,329
and I knew that everything
would be okay.

317
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:41,048
What did you see next?

318
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:43,319
I held you.

319
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:58,847
Places. Places, everyone.

320
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:05,478
Don't answer that.

321
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:08,004
Can somebody answer that?

322
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:09,807
I'll get it.

323
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:15,161
Hey, you're late.
Where were you?

324
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:17,160
Trying to save your ass.

325
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:19,718
The police have your picture.
You're wanted for murder.

326
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:21,845
They said you fled custody
this morning.

327
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,118
That was your dream.

328
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:25,559
They don't have your name,
but it's only a matter of time.

329
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:27,767
Girls?

330
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:31,163
All right, let's just stay cool,
and we'll go downtown

331
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:32,523
and straighten this out later.

332
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:34,884
But we have to get through
the wedding first for Piper.

333
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:36,158
For Piper.

334
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:39,162
You're supposed to say, "For Piper."

335
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:41,200
Yeah, all right.
It better be a quick wedding.

336
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:45,963
Everything looks perfect,

337
00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:49,883
except, Victor, could you move
a little to your left?

338
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:51,442
Sure, why?

339
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:54,004
Well, to make room for...

340
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,760
- Patty.
- Hello, Victor. How are you?

341
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:01,204
Good. I mean, I was good.

342
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:05,324
All right, who brought my ex-wife
back from the dead?

343
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:06,683
Not now, Victor.

344
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:10,768
I know you two have issues,
but that's what the reception is for.

345
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:35,444
We did it. It's really happening.

346
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:53,320
- Prue!
- Who in the hell is that?

347
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:55,641
Oh, oh, oh, no.

348
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:56,964
Prue!

349
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:02,927
T.J.

350
00:23:03,969 --> 00:23:05,527
- You came.
- Had to beat the cops.

351
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:09,005
- I won't let them take you.
- Prue, what the hell is going on?

352
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,325
Prue, you get your astral ass
back here.

353
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:28,608
Oh, honey.

354
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:38,967
All right. That's it.

355
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:42,167
The wedding is off.

356
00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:46,080
- Phoebe.
- Sorry. Sorry.

357
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:50,648
Piper. Piper, wait, think about this.

358
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:55,844
Piper. Piper! You cannot just leave.

359
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:58,569
Yes, I can.
A demon I could have handled.

360
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,880
But my big sister ruining my wedding,
I cannot handle that.

361
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:03,442
Just listen to me for one second.

362
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,962
All we have to do is find a way...

363
00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:08,724
No. No. I don't wanna find a way
to get married on my wedding day.

364
00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:12,325
It's just... It's too hard.
There must be a reason.

365
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:15,168
- Piper...
- Leo, I'm sorry,

366
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:19,607
but this is just the final straw.
It's just not meant to be.

367
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:35,609
I've never seen Piper so defeated.

368
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:42,163
Prue. Come on, wake up.
Prue, come on.

369
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:44,479
Honey, you won't get her back
that way.

370
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,642
A part of Prue wanted to escape,
and it used her astral self to do it.

371
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:51,124
If the wedding's off, I have to go.

372
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:55,282
I'm only here to conduct the ceremony.
I'm sorry.

373
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:02,957
Maybe Piper's right.

374
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:05,245
Maybe the wedding
just wasn't meant to be.

375
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:07,280
- Victor.
- All I'm saying is maybe the gods

376
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:10,208
are trying to spare them
the pain that we went through.

377
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,282
No.

378
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:14,923
All I need is what's inside me
to know that Piper and I

379
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:16,363
are meant to be together.

380
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,447
What happened here today...

381
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:24,483
Piper and Leo's love
has touched us all.

382
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:27,168
We have to fix this.

383
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:30,648
I gotta go fend off the posse.

384
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:32,158
What posse?

385
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:35,443
Prue's wanted for murder.

386
00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:38,366
I'll stay in touch by cell phone.

387
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:40,088
Murder?

388
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,803
- You knew about this?
- I found out when Morris told Prue.

389
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:46,006
But it's obviously a mistake. I mean,
Prue wouldn't murder anybody.

390
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:48,723
Are you sure?
I mean, Prue's astral form

391
00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:50,880
seems to have taken on
a life of its own.

392
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,722
- How do you know she didn't do it?
- Because I know her.

393
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:56,489
- Oh, yeah.
- At least I think I do.

394
00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:00,562
All right. All right,
you guys find Piper,

395
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:03,118
bring her back here somehow.
Phoebe, Book of Shadows,

396
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:05,245
see if there's a spell to bring
astral Prue back.

397
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:08,926
Cole, you and me are gonna do
a little investigating of our own.

398
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:12,768
All right, come on, you guys.
We've got a wedding to save.

399
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:25,088
Interesting place to dream about.

400
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,961
Especially for Prue.

401
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:34,328
Based on what Morris said,

402
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:37,362
someone must have knifed
the victim after astral Prue left.

403
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:39,400
By the looks of this crowd,
it could be anybody.

404
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:43,164
No, not anybody. Very few humans
have the heart of a true killer.

405
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,078
One who kills without prejudice.

406
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:47,563
How do you know?

407
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,082
I can always sense it.

408
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:51,120
Before I suppressed
my demonic side for Phoebe,

409
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:54,804
I could sense how human killers
felt inside.

410
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:01,438
He's here.

411
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:04,840
The murderer? Are you sure?

412
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:08,678
That he's our murderer, no,
but he's got fresh blood on his hands.

413
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:11,440
Go, get Morris.

414
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:17,999
Just let me do the talking.

415
00:27:18,209 --> 00:27:20,439
You always said the wrong thing
when they were young.

416
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:21,837
Well, wrong according to you.

417
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:23,442
You weren't open
to what I had to say,

418
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,646
because you wanted to raise them
as witches...

419
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:30,884
...instead of little girls.

420
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:40,248
We were worried.

421
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:42,724
I'm sorry, I let everyone down.

422
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:46,085
Honey, you have nothing
to apologise for.

423
00:27:47,129 --> 00:27:51,042
It is a tribute to you and Leo that you
made it as far as you did, I think.

424
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:52,762
But we didn't make it all the way.

425
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:56,007
- Not yet, maybe, but...
- Not ever.

426
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:58,245
I mean, I think it's obvious.
Don't you?

427
00:27:58,449 --> 00:28:01,407
- Leo and I are just clearly not...
- Destined to be?

428
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:02,888
I don't believe that.

429
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,643
And I don't think that you
really believe that either.

430
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:10,007
Don't I? All I have to do
is look at you and Dad

431
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:13,718
to see where I might end up
if I marry Leo.

432
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:16,087
I mean, look at the track record.

433
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:20,606
As Halliwells, we are blessed as
witches, and we are cursed as women.

434
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:25,246
Sometimes I think we're all just
destined to end up alone.

435
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:30,477
Well, you don't really...
I mean, just because...

436
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:34,881
Victor.

437
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,727
You think your mother
and I were cursed.

438
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,768
- Don't you?
- Honestly,

439
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:43,523
I look back on those days
as the best of my life.

440
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:47,202
I loved your mother. She was the
best thing that ever happened to me

441
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:49,843
until the three of you came along.

442
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:52,438
But your marriage still didn't last.

443
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:54,082
Yeah, and it hurt.

444
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:55,678
A lot.

445
00:28:56,689 --> 00:29:00,159
But it was our love that gave birth
to you and your sisters.

446
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:03,925
Maybe that was my destiny.

447
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:11,801
I'm sorry, I just need to be alone.

448
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:23,121
Not bad for a guy
who always says the wrong thing.

449
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:25,162
Thanks.

450
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:28,764
I just wish I knew that it helped.

451
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:43,486
Gotcha.

452
00:29:45,889 --> 00:29:48,323
I just gotta know,
how'd you get away from the cops?

453
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:50,684
You know, I don't really wanna talk
about that.

454
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:53,727
I mean, I'm here now.
That's all that really matters, right?

455
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:57,319
Yeah, but for how long?

456
00:29:57,609 --> 00:29:58,678
Do you care?

457
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:03,678
Well, I did crash
your sister's wedding.

458
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:06,283
- Yes, you did.
- And...

459
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:09,598
...I am harbouring you from the cops.

460
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,003
And I appreciate that.

461
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,403
I mean,

462
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:15,369
definitely past first-date behaviour
here.

463
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:17,685
So then why are you still talking?

464
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:21,518
Prue, I don't need much,

465
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:23,640
but I need to know one thing.

466
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:26,807
Are you gonna take off on me
again tonight?

467
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:30,407
You know,
I hadn't really thought about it.

468
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:32,681
For the first time in my life,
I'm free,

469
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:35,409
so I'm sort of just living
moment to moment.

470
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:38,688
- Is that okay?
- I'm cool with that.

471
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:41,359
"Cool with that"?

472
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:51,564
- Oh, not now.
- What's wrong? Prue.

473
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:53,122
Prue, where you going?

474
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:57,441
No. I am free. I am not going back.
I wanna...

475
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:03,078
No, I will not let you take me.

476
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,087
Nice spell, huh?

477
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,679
- How dare you.
- How dare you.

478
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:13,682
You destroyed Piper's wedding
along with Piper.

479
00:31:13,889 --> 00:31:17,359
I don't know what's going on with you,
but you've got to pull yourself together.

480
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:21,441
I am out of here.

481
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:25,765
You know what?
You cannot stop me, all right?

482
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:28,568
I am never going back.
I'm not going...

483
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:34,045
All right, you know what?
I am sick of this.

484
00:31:34,249 --> 00:31:36,763
She is all about duty and obligation.

485
00:31:36,969 --> 00:31:38,960
Well, not me.
All right, I want to be free.

486
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:41,518
I wanna find love.
I wanna have a life.

487
00:31:41,729 --> 00:31:44,368
Well, Prue, you have responsibilities
whether you like it or not.

488
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,685
Don't talk to me about
being responsible, all right?

489
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:49,886
You were not very responsible when
you went and fell in love with a demon.

490
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:53,206
Oh, please, we... You have got to let
this whole Cole thing go, okay?

491
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,166
You can't stay mad at me forever.

492
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:57,837
I'm not mad at you, Phoebe.
I never was.

493
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:00,921
All right? She was.
I was rooting for you.

494
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:04,888
Okay, now you're scaring me.

495
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,559
You risked everything for love,
just like Piper and Leo.

496
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:10,919
I dream of having
that kind of freedom,

497
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:13,967
but instead I get stuck watching
my sisters live my dream.

498
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:15,967
Wait a minute.

499
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:22,119
You astralled out in a dream
when your subconscious takes over.

500
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:24,519
- So what?
- So I just studied this.

501
00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:27,157
It's Psych 101, Freud.

502
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:30,202
You're the id, Prue's inner desires.

503
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:35,086
Which means that she is the ego,
the control factor.

504
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,881
Yeah, well, she is one big
remote control,

505
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:38,801
and she's always got me on pause.

506
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:40,322
I think I understand.

507
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:43,601
The sacrifices that you've made
for us over the years,

508
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:46,647
they made you suppress
your inner desires.

509
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:51,643
Yeah, well, don't tell me, tell her.

510
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:54,926
No, I'm telling you
because you are a Prue.

511
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:58,001
I mean, you're both two sides
of my sister.

512
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:02,838
Prue, you have to stop devoting
your entire self to the Charmed Ones.

513
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:05,358
It'll tear you apart. Literally.

514
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:08,728
Is Piper very mad at me?

515
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:11,767
She'll get over it.

516
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:14,082
And you know why?

517
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,684
Because we're okay now,
Piper and me.

518
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:19,966
We've both got passion and purpose
in our lives.

519
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:22,245
And you gave us that.

520
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,918
- I did?
- You took care of us.

521
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:28,686
And now it's time to take care of you.

522
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:41,688
Welcome back.

523
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:44,362
Thanks.

524
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,208
For everything.

525
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:51,326
Oh, no.

526
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:00,925
I cannot believe
I wrecked Piper's wedding.

527
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:02,608
Only part of you did.

528
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:04,805
Is it too late to fix it?

529
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,965
Oh, now what?

530
00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:10,526
Freeze! Stay where you are.
Don't move.

531
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:17,359
Prue Halliwell,
you're under arrest for murder.

532
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:29,565
All right, sit down.
The inspector will be with you shortly.

533
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:41,839
This is all our fault.

534
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:50,126
Look, Prue's been booked for murder.
We're running out of time.

535
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:51,802
Leo says you found the killer.

536
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,567
Found a killer.

537
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:57,526
Oh, great, you mean you don't know?

538
00:34:57,689 --> 00:34:59,600
What are you gonna do, ask him?

539
00:35:07,009 --> 00:35:08,488
That's a good idea.

540
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:11,288
Why don't you meet me
out front in five.

541
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:29,687
Is that the spot
where they found the body?

542
00:35:30,249 --> 00:35:31,523
Who are you?

543
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:33,645
I'm here to find out
what you know about the murder

544
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:36,004
that took place here last night.

545
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:38,488
Why don't you show me your badge.

546
00:35:38,689 --> 00:35:42,762
Oh, no, no, I'm not a cop.
I'm a fortune-teller.

547
00:35:42,929 --> 00:35:45,397
And I predict you're gonna give me
a confession.

548
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:51,725
You think you're a funny man, huh?
Why don't you excuse me, huh?

549
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:03,606
I guess that's the knife you used
on the victim

550
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:05,043
when you found him unconscious?

551
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:06,602
You want a closer look at it, huh?

552
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:16,520
One more chance.
Confess to the murder

553
00:36:16,689 --> 00:36:18,964
- and talk to the police.
- Or what, huh?

554
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:24,408
Or deal with me.

555
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:34,760
I think he's ready to talk.

556
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:45,562
I don't get it. Prue should be back
by now. The police have the killer.

557
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:47,924
They might have held her over
for escaping custody.

558
00:36:48,129 --> 00:36:49,801
Can we get some light
while we're waiting?

559
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:52,608
No, Dad, the police
cut the power line.

560
00:36:53,529 --> 00:36:57,238
I'm sorry, Patty.
They sent me to take you back.

561
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,521
No, it's not midnight yet.
We still have five more minutes.

562
00:37:00,689 --> 00:37:03,123
I should have said something more
to convince Piper.

563
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:04,921
You said everything.
You were wonderful.

564
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:12,126
- Sorry we're late.
- What, not who you were expecting?

565
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:17,364
So, okay, what are we waiting for?

566
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:19,524
Don't look so shocked.

567
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:24,487
Girls, it's showtime.

568
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,801
A little help here.

569
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:37,045
I noticed you don't have a best man.
If you like, I could...

570
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:39,487
I'd be honoured.

571
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:43,285
Oh, no, there's no power for music.

572
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:49,044
All right, is that the best
that we can do on the lights?

573
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:01,564
That's more like it.

574
00:38:03,169 --> 00:38:06,605
We are gathered here today
to unite two souls as one.

575
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:10,564
Do you, Leo Wyatt and Piper Halliwell,
join us here

576
00:38:10,729 --> 00:38:14,802
of your own free will to acknowledge
the eternal bond shared by you both?

577
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:17,523
- I do.
- I do.

578
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:20,880
You may face each other, join hands.

579
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,119
Leo, you may recite your vows.

580
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:25,605
Piper,

581
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:28,048
through all the tears and struggles,

582
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:30,245
I always knew in my heart
that we'd make it here.

583
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:33,919
I promise to love and respect you

584
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:36,649
from this point forward
as your husband.

585
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:43,601
As my wife, my lover,
my friend and my soul mate,

586
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:46,840
all I am is yours.

587
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:49,128
Piper.

588
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:54,164
Leo, you are the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

589
00:38:54,729 --> 00:38:57,402
I was afraid that you were too good
to be true,

590
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:59,127
that maybe
I didn't deserve someone

591
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:03,646
so pure and beautiful
and loving as you are.

592
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:07,285
But here we are, surrounded
by the people that I love the most.

593
00:39:07,689 --> 00:39:11,602
And I feel so proud and so blessed
to be your wife.

594
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,443
Leo, I was born to love you,

595
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:16,565
and I always will.

596
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:24,848
Here, before witnesses, Leo and Piper
have sworn their vows to each other.

597
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:29,446
With this cord,
I bind them to those vows.

598
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:37,519
Heart to thee, body to thee,
always and forever, so mote it be.

599
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:40,726
- So mote it be.
- So mote it be.

600
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:44,123
Kiss her, fast.
