1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,513
There you go.
There you go, my kitties.

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,159
There's plenty for everyone.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,910
Don't worry, I haven't forgotten
about you either.

4
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,429
I know.

5
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,515
Meow.

6
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,429
Now.

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,471
- So Piper was engaged before Leo?
- Yep, she was.

8
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,393
Well, lucky for you, little man,
that did not work out.

9
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,870
Actually lucky for all of us.
She was engaged to a warlock.

10
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,634
- Dan was a warlock?
- Oh, no, before Dan. Way before Dan.

11
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,394
Two bankers, a rock climber
and a ghost before Dan.

12
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,556
And actually, the ghost
was the best of the bunch.

13
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,872
See, now, that's what
I'd call critical sisterly information.

14
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,873
How am I supposed to be petty
and judgmental without all the info?

15
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,270
Sweetie, what do you expect?
You didn't know her back then.

16
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,511
It doesn't mean you're any less
a part of us, though.

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,636
- You know that, right?
- Yeah, I know.

18
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,153
It would've been cool, though.

19
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,869
Hang out with you, see what
you guys were like. Maybe meet Prue.

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,679
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
you didn't miss much with me.

21
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,434
I'm pretty much the exact
same person I was back then.

22
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,034
- Yeah, right.
- No, I'm serious.

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,476
I mean, I have a job now.
And that's good.

24
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,872
But, you know, I'm still
living at home, I'm still single.

25
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,474
The only real difference
is that I'm five years older.

26
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,596
I need to use
more expensive night cream.

27
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,156
That is not what happened
and you know it.

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,630
That's exactly what happened. And it's
not the first time it happened either.

29
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,473
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You know what, just forget it, Piper.

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,875
Don't walk away from me. Leo.

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,435
Leo. I am talking to you.

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,194
I'm tired of you mocking me,
especially in front of our friends.

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,476
Oh, I resent that. I don't mock you.

34
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,075
You always mock me.
I work my butt off around here.

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,078
I quit my job, I quit my career
so you wouldn't have to.

36
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,838
And I get no respect for it. None.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,070
I never asked you to give up
your career.

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,913
- The hell you didn't.
- You're right, I didn't. Did I?

39
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,196
Right, turn to them for support
like you always do.

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,430
Oh, what? So now you have
a problem with them too?

41
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,953
No, I have a problem with you.

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,918
Leo, don't you dare
walk away from me again.

43
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,354
I mean it.

44
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,998
Hi. Come on.

45
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,278
- What? Where are we going?
- You'll see, let's go.

46
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,518
- Would you stop dragging your feet?
- I don't wanna talk to him.

47
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,353
Lady, just get in there.

48
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,072
- What's going on?
- We are gonna stay here

49
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,714
until we figure this thing out.
That is what is going on.

50
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,395
Figure out what? This is between us,
it has nothing to do with you two.

51
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,397
You know what,
I don't know what the problem is,

52
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,677
but it's affecting Piper's power.
And if her power is out of control,

53
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,831
then it's our problem too.

54
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,639
Plus, we love you guys
and we wanna help. That's all.

55
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,756
- We'll figure it out.
- Really?

56
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,673
Before the next demon attacks?

57
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,393
- What is this?
- Dr. Berenson.

58
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,632
He's a marriage counsellor
that I use to help me with my column.

59
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,031
I called in a favour and he's
expecting you, 1:00 today.

60
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,156
- What?
- He cancelled his other appointments,

61
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,709
so you'll have the whole day
to talk this out.

62
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,029
Come on, this is ridiculous.

63
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,350
You expect us to go to some mortal
and spill our guts?

64
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,630
What you need
is a mortal doctor, Leo.

65
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,870
Your problems are marital,
not supernatural.

66
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,918
So you know, speak in euphemisms
if you have to.

67
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,633
I don't know.

68
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,435
What do you think?

69
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,950
I think it might be a good idea.

70
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,954
Although I don't know

71
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,873
realistically how much
we're gonna accomplish in one day.

72
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,155
So use magic.

73
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,155
Cast a spell. Don't worry
about the consequences.

74
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,271
You've already got them. In spades.

75
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,317
Who's gonna watch Wyatt?
Aren't you both busy?

76
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,153
I've already taken care of that.
It's Darryl's day off.

77
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,471
- You didn't tell him why, did you?
- No, I did not tell him why.

78
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,073
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

79
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,873
You've been through so much,

80
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,191
it's a wonder you've made it
this far without professional help.

81
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,555
It's a wonder we all have.

82
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,394
You owe this to yourselves.

83
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,915
And your baby.

84
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,270
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

85
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,272
Gotcha.

86
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,318
- Bad time?
- No.

87
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,712
No, not at all.
My advice sucks today anyway.

88
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,074
I thought you had a lunch date.

89
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,358
I was. I was just kind of distracted.
I kept thinking about Piper and Leo.

90
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,669
I know, me too.

91
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,718
It's just so unsettling.
They've always seemed so solid.

92
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,839
- Till recently. It's kind of scary.
- Yeah. They'll work it out.

93
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,676
Yeah, if you say so. It's strange.

94
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,195
Not having seen them
fight like that before.

95
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,039
Are you kidding? How many
times has Piper blown up Leo?

96
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,634
She's blown him up literally?

97
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,633
Yeah, but you know Piper,
she didn't mean anything by it.

98
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,190
Look, Paige, don't worry.
They love each other so much.

99
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,635
And they've been through
a lot worse than this.

100
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,115
If you say so.
You know them better than I do.

101
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,232
Hey.

102
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,913
Piper, what are you
still doing at home?

103
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,270
This isn't Piper. I'm an innocent.

104
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,752
<i>Someone is after me. A warlock.</i>

105
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,194
- What is it?
- Who is this?

106
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,759
<i>I don't have time to explain.</i>

107
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,912
You need to come home
with your sisters.

108
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,274
And Leo. I need healing.

109
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,237
L... I don't know
what you're talking about.

110
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,915
Where's the disinfectant? Didn't it
used to be kept in Prue's bathroom?

111
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,032
- No, it's in the kitchen.
- What is going on?

112
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,633
<i>Hurry, please.</i>

113
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,711
Before he kills me.

114
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,108
- Dr. Berenson.
- Yes. Hi, is it Leo?

115
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,272
- Yeah, and Piper.
- Nice to meet you.

116
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,549
- Nice to meet you both.
- Hi.

117
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,915
Why don't you come in
and make yourself comfortable.

118
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,838
Sorry.

119
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,239
Well...

120
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,519
- Phoebe has told me a lot about you.
- Oh, really? Like what?

121
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,678
Oh, I don't mean
about what brings you here.

122
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,432
Just that she thinks the world
of you.

123
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,638
So, what does bring you here?

124
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,879
Well, I guess we've been
sort of fighting a lot lately.

125
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,553
Is that unusual in your marriage?

126
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,438
- No.
- Yes.

127
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,799
We just had a baby.

128
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,476
Right. The baby.

129
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,597
Is that what you guys
have been fighting about?

130
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,358
- Never.
- No.

131
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,149
Maybe it would be better
if we started at the beginning, huh?

132
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,117
Why don't you tell me
about your childhood.

133
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,828
- For God's sake.
- Piper, what are you doing?

134
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,797
You can't freeze the shrink,
we're on the clock.

135
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,992
Yeah, well, forget about the clock
because you know what?

136
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,879
We're gonna need a calendar.
Because this is gonna take months.

137
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,590
Okay, well, if you remember, you're the
one that wanted to do this, I did not.

138
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,633
Yeah, well, Leo, we need to
for all the reasons that Phoebe said.

139
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,994
And you know it.

140
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,317
Look, we've lost our way,
and we need to find it back. Fast.

141
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,598
- So you really think a spell will help?
- It has to.

142
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,792
Not so fast.

143
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,956
I want to enjoy this.

144
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,554
Hey.

145
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,112
Orb her out of here.

146
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,794
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

147
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,275
You've really got that orbing thing
down, don't you?

148
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,989
- Who are you?
- Someone from your past.

149
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,634
I'm just worried about
the memory part of the spell, that's all.

150
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,117
Look, we have to make our memories
real, and everything around them real,

151
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,431
or we're never gonna get through this.
Now scoot over, we weren't this close.

152
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,910
<i>Let the truth be told
Let our lives unFold</i>

153
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,119
<i>So we can relive our memories
And stop being enemies</i>

154
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,677
- Ready?
- Yeah.

155
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,271
- Do you smell something?
- No.

156
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,000
Look, we were thinking
we'd just skip the childhood part

157
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,230
and just cut to the chase
and go straight to us.

158
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,913
If that's all right with you.

159
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,114
Oh, sure. Sure.

160
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,153
Why don't you
tell me how you first met.

161
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,313
- Need any help?
- What do you want? Who are you?

162
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,071
He must have blinked us
outside here.

163
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,229
He must have.

164
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,391
Well, I think I see...

165
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,358
Yeah, there's definitely
something here, Miss Halliwell.

166
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,839
Definitely.

167
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,638
Piper?

168
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,109
"Miss Halliwell"?

169
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,388
You are not gonna believe this.

170
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,910
My, Santa, you've changed.

171
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,554
- He's looking for Kit.
- The cat. Right.

172
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,269
Four legs, fur. I remember.

173
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,596
- Is that you?
- Yeah. From about five years ago.

174
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,479
Sorry. You know,
have you tried the shelter?

175
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,194
- Yeah, nothing.
- Well, she had her collar on, right?

176
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,594
With your number on it?

177
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,439
- A very distinctive collar, actually.
- Anyway.

178
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,633
Thanks for looking. I'm sure you must
be hungry after all that work.

179
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,074
All what work?

180
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,117
Oh, that's just Piper.
She's gotta be everyone's mom.

181
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,158
Think of her as your mom.
I know I do.

182
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,272
Isn't she a scream?

183
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,871
Well, thanks.

184
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,989
Let me go put these fliers up first,
and I'll be right back, okay?

185
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,193
- Oh, careful. You all right? Careful.
- Yeah, I'll just...

186
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,072
- Antique.
- Thanks.

187
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,390
- Grandma's.
- Yeah.

188
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,878
Quite possibly the finest glutes
in the city.

189
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,156
- In the state.
- In all the land.

190
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,276
I saw him first.

191
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,954
You hit on Leo.

192
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,918
Never mind that. We have to
figure out a way to get out of here.

193
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,672
We can't risk changing our history.

194
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,598
Otherwise, we'll have no future
to go back to.

195
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,718
Yeah, but what if that's
what the warlock wants us to do?

196
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,393
<i>We gotta get to the Book.</i>

197
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,712
I'm telling you, he's not your type.
He's nice.

198
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,953
- Oh, really? And I don't like "nice"?
- No, Phoebe, you don't.

199
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,033
You like dangerous.
You like bad boys. You always have.

200
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,189
- Some things never change.
- Would you be quiet?

201
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,235
Then Phoebe and I went upstairs
to fight over him a little bit more.

202
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,470
And I went out to put up the fliers.

203
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,757
You know, it's uncanny
how well both of you

204
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,559
seem to remember
exactly what happened.

205
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,438
Especially after five years.

206
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,594
Well, you know, it just seems
like yesterday to us.

207
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,593
Except that yesterday,
Piper almost blew up the house.

208
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,709
Figuratively speaking.

209
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,950
I mean, Piper's got a bit of a temper.

210
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,756
- I do not.
- Oh, no?

211
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,153
- What happened?
- I don't know.

212
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,833
<i>Let's get the Book
and get out of here.</i>

213
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,872
Wait.

214
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,152
That was easy.

215
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,633
Too easy.

216
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,075
Where's our sister?

217
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,880
Kill me,
and you'll never see her again.

218
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,835
So maybe we should
just torture you instead.

219
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,510
Why don't you just shatter her hand
and see what happens.

220
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,711
I was under a spell. Evil.

221
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,556
Evil? You were blond.

222
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,670
Piper, we need to talk.

223
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,873
- What's going on?
- Well, you just helped her to escape.

224
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,871
That's what's going on.

225
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,478
Smash him.

226
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,231
Bastard.

227
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,953
<i>I'm... I'm sorry.</i>

228
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,034
When you say she shattered you,

229
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,272
- I assume that's...?
- Metaphorically speaking.

230
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,760
Perhaps we should try to explore
all this a little more fully.

231
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,908
Okay, you didn't tell me
you blew up Leo too.

232
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,596
Don't worry, he'll be fine just as long
as we don't mess anything up.

233
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,034
What? You said you wanted to know

234
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,390
what we were like
before we met you, right?

235
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,437
Voilà.

236
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,514
<i>Okay, does evil stump-lady come
back for the Book any time soon?</i>

237
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,433
No, which means we
have to figure this out by ourselves.

238
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,631
I don't remember
anything about a warlock

239
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,756
with the power to jump
through time, do you?

240
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,956
No, but I still think
he's from the past.

241
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,236
- Why?
- Because Katrina, our innocent,

242
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,510
says she knew us from the past.
The warlock's after her

243
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,033
so, hey, it only figures, right?

244
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,719
Yeah, that makes sense.

245
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,394
But I don't know
how he's jumping us through time.

246
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,198
- Or why.
- Maybe he's not.

247
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,035
- Maybe there's some other reason.
- Maybe. But if he is behind this,

248
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,158
we have to figure out a way
to force him to bring us back.

249
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,635
I think I know a way how.
Remember the muses?

250
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,313
Remember the potion
that Piper made

251
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,277
to blind the warlock
and keep him from blinking?

252
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,953
Yeah, do you remember
how to make it?

253
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,032
- If the right herbs are in the kitchen.
- What are we supposed to do now?

254
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,037
I don't know, kill innocents?

255
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,198
No, I mean about Prue.
How are we supposed to find her...

256
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,430
Orb us. Orb us out of here.

257
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,914
What happened?

258
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,231
It's like we got bounced
off something.

259
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,634
I think we're stuck.

260
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,110
Of course I don't wanna lose Leo,
that's why I'm here.

261
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,108
It's just...

262
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,238
I don't know. Sometimes it seems
like our entire relationship

263
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,874
- has been one big fight.
- Really?

264
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,871
And I don't mean arguing fighting,
I mean...

265
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,553
All the obstacles
we had to overcome.

266
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,949
- Especially early on.
- And honestly,

267
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,079
sometimes I've wondered whether
we're really meant to be together at all.

268
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,151
Even on our wedding day.

269
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,879
What the hell is going on?

270
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,469
Prue, you get
your astral ass back here.

271
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,870
Oh, no. Piper's wedding.

272
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,069
Come on, baby.

273
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,152
- We're going for a ride.
- Prue?

274
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,672
Prue.

275
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,951
All right. That's it.

276
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,680
The wedding is off.

277
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,508
Piper. Piper! You cannot just leave.

278
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,513
Yes, I can.
A demon I could have handled.

279
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,518
But my big sister ruining my wedding,
I cannot handle that.

280
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,432
Okay, just listen to me
for one second.

281
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,999
All we have to do is find a way...

282
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,875
No. No. I don't wanna find a way
to get married on my wedding day.

283
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,430
It's just... It's too hard.
There must be a reason.

284
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,196
- Piper...
- Leo, I'm sorry,

285
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,234
but this is just the final straw.
It's just not meant to be.

286
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,038
What just happened?

287
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,677
Come here, honey.

288
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,630
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah. Great.

289
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,399
Maybe Piper's right.

290
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,551
Maybe the wedding
just wasn't meant to be.

291
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,631
- Victor.
- All I'm saying is maybe the gods

292
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,916
are trying to spare them
the pain that we went through.

293
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,958
No.

294
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,159
All I need is what's inside me to know
Piper and I are meant to be together.

295
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,392
What happened here today...

296
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,795
Piper and Leo's love...

297
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,598
...has touched us all.

298
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,399
We have to fix this.

299
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,716
I gotta go fend off the posse.

300
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,115
I can't believe Prue
ruined Piper's wedding.

301
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,037
Oh, my God. Kit.

302
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,794
- It is Kit.
- I didn't know you had a cat.

303
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,632
Yeah, she ran away
a couple of years ago.

304
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,279
Okay, that was weird.

305
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,113
We gotta work
on that blinding potion.

306
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,393
Didn't he just change history?

307
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,910
What's the matter, honey?
What is it?

308
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,278
I don't know, I just got a sharp pain
in my heart.

309
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,795
Oops.

310
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,598
- Paige.
- What?

311
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,518
Potions go poof, that's what they do.

312
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,432
- Just hurry up.
- I'm done.

313
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,319
I just hope I didn't use any herbs
I'm gonna need in the future.

314
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,118
I've already been
to one alternate reality.

315
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,316
I don't care to go home to another.

316
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,834
What's the matter?

317
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,594
I don't know.
This whole thing is just sort of...

318
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,313
...odd. It doesn't make any sense.

319
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,035
Like half the things
we go through do?

320
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,909
I know, but didn't the warlock
seem surprised to see us in there?

321
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,518
Yeah, now that you mention it.
Why?

322
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,908
Because I'm beginning to think

323
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,957
that maybe he didn't have
anything to do with this.

324
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,789
Maybe he's stuck in the same
weird time-Ioop just like we are.

325
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,110
Yeah, well, he's still dangerous.

326
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,999
It'll be easier for him to kill us
in the past without Piper around.

327
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,679
Yeah, and I'm also beginning
to think

328
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,229
that Piper's the reason
we're stuck here.

329
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,119
I mean, think about it. What's the
common denominator in all of this?

330
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,955
Piper and Leo, right? Every past event
has centred around the two of them.

331
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,074
- You think this is a spell?
- Yeah, one gone awry, obviously.

332
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,869
I think Piper took my advice
to heart with the marriage counsellor.

333
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,349
They're taking a walk down
memory lane. Literally.

334
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,272
But it seems too real
just to be a memory.

335
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,873
I mean, what are we doing here?

336
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,270
They obviously have
a lot of issues to work through.

337
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,193
Yeah, well, I hope
they work through them soon.

338
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,074
- Thank you.
- You feel any better?

339
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,356
Yeah, a little bit.
That was really weird.

340
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,272
Piper, you know,

341
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,274
sometimes bringing back
old memories, old feelings,

342
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,273
can have a psychosomatic effect.

343
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,749
Especially when you're dealing
with inner demons.

344
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,029
Let's talk about
before your wedding.

345
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,478
About when you knew for the
first time that you really loved Leo.

346
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,951
I found it.

347
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,590
Leo, I love you.
Can you hear me?

348
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,070
I love you, Leo. Please hear me.

349
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,110
- Piper!
- Oh, thank God.

350
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,475
I tried so hard,
and I couldn't make it work before.

351
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,394
- Why didn't you tell me?
- That love was the trigger?

352
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,198
You had to find that out
on your own.

353
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,478
Why couldn't you tell me?

354
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,678
I don't know. I was afraid. I was afraid
if I admitted how I really felt

355
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,432
that I would hurt more if I lost you.

356
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,108
I'm so sorry.
I should have said it before.

357
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,998
It's better late than never.

358
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,508
Come on.

359
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,392
You know, Leo, the fact that you
seem to be able to relive

360
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,076
your wife's experience
to such a degree is very telling.

361
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,318
- It is?
- I think you might have

362
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,192
some co-dependency issues.

363
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,034
Here you go, my sweetie.

364
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,997
- Here you go. You okay?
- Yeah.

365
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,720
This is better than home movies.

366
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,911
They've just been through so much.

367
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,593
Yeah. We all have.

368
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,555
It's good to remember, even for me.

369
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,075
Makes me realize
how much I really have changed.

370
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,353
Kit?

371
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,350
- Okay, throw the potion.
- Don't bother.

372
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,632
Wait a minute.

373
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,268
Is it just me,
or is he not after us?

374
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,755
No, I think he's after your cat.

375
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,995
Kit? Really?

376
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,993
- Why?
- I don't know.

377
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,435
Unless there's something
you're not telling us.

378
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,795
It's funny,
she's so familiar to me, though.

379
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,633
Reminds me of this old stray
that used to hang outside my loft.

380
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,631
Wait a minute.
You just said something.

381
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,995
I did? Was it smart?

382
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,119
<i>Oh, I am so glad the Book
is still in this memory.</i>

383
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,111
Why, what did I say?
What are you looking for?

384
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,192
I am looking for familiars.

385
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,554
That's what I'm looking for.

386
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,197
"Enchanted creatures
who follow and guide new witches

387
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:21,036
to protect them
while they learn the craft."

388
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,555
Hey, is there something
you haven't been telling me?

389
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,199
Huh, Kit? Hey, don't you kiss up
to me. Answer the question.

390
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,995
- You sure you didn't know about this?
- What, that Kit was our familiar?

391
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,197
No, we just thought she was this cat
that we found on the porch.

392
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,557
Better hope the warlock doesn't get
her in the past. Otherwise, our future...

393
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,428
Is screwed.

394
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,113
I'm screwed.

395
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,552
This is a no-win situation.

396
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,315
I work, she says I'm never around.

397
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,995
I quit my job,
she says I'm around too much.

398
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,188
I gave up everything for her.

399
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,279
Co-dependent, thank you.

400
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,555
Okay, so what? Maybe I am.

401
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,188
But you wanna talk co-dependent,
ask her about her damn sisters.

402
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,356
They're freaking inseparable.
"The power of three."

403
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,390
I think we should go back
to talking about

404
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,790
some of your more
positive memories.

405
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,397
Things that you've overcome
as a couple.

406
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,471
Free associate.
Let the memories flow.

407
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,717
Whatever comes to mind.

408
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,755
Truth is, caffeine makes me
a little clumsy, you know.

409
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,036
- Leo, wait.
- Yeah.

410
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,268
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

411
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,479
Do you need another shirt?

412
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,200
No, I got one in the truck. Thanks.

413
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,360
Leo, wait. That wasn't my question.

414
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,870
- It wasn't?
- No.

415
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,713
I was just wondering,
do you ever think of me?

416
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,718
- Yeah.
- In what way?

417
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,515
- As a friend sort of way or...?
- You have beautiful eyes.

418
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,318
That's a good way.

419
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,195
I'm sorry.
That was totally inappropriate,

420
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,715
- wasn't it?
- No, not at all.

421
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,349
Oh, what the hell.

422
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,670
Leo, how do you feel about women
who make the first move?

423
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,630
I don't know.
I'm still waiting for it to happen.

424
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,792
Goodness.

425
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,990
How do you feel about guys
who make the second move?

426
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,518
Love them.

427
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,595
Nice kiss.

428
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,151
I bet you guys think
this is real funny, don't you?

429
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,912
Haven't you taken enough from me?

430
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,629
You have to send trolls
to kick me while I'm down?

431
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,913
I am a good person.
I'm a good witch.

432
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,275
And damn it,
I would have made a great wife.

433
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,953
And how dare you
take that from me.

434
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,395
I deserve...
No, you know what?

435
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,714
I demand
that you send him back to me.

436
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,592
You hear me? Right now!

437
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,278
I'm going to stand in this very spot
until you send Leo back to me.

438
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,632
Enough already.

439
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,274
The warlock.

440
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,990
You said you always
wanted to meet Prue, right?

441
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,509
It's another little spell gone awry.

442
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,832
Stop that.

443
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,919
No, no, no.

444
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,231
Very bad, Prue.
Very, very bad, Prue.

445
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,558
Hi, Cujo. Who are you growling at?

446
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,790
I'd better go check
with the Elders to see if they know

447
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,389
- how to vanquish a Banshee.
- Don't tell me you're afraid of Prue?

448
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,795
- Yeah.
- Well, wait a minute. Hold it.

449
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,632
What if we find the Banshee
in the meantime?

450
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,195
Well, you blew up the last
demon you fought, didn't you?

451
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,277
Yeah, but I was trying to freeze him.

452
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,479
Just remember what we talked
about, just try and relax.

453
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,199
I wish everybody would quit
telling me to relax.

454
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,470
Piper, Phoebe.

455
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,996
- Easy. Easy.
- Behind you. Behind you!

456
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,153
Finally, one I remember.

457
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,192
Nice!

458
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,793
Leo?

459
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,713
- I thought you were a pacifist.
- I didn't kill him, did I?

460
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,392
I gotta tell you,
I find this side of you very sexy.

461
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,672
- Really?
- Yeah.

462
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,398
What's that sound?

463
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,759
Paige.

464
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,916
Potion, potion, potion.

465
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,755
The past, Paige, remember?
They're going to rescue you.

466
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,074
Okay, if that warlock
doesn't kill the cat soon, I will.

467
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,832
I'll get her.

468
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,592
Phoebe.

469
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,031
Hi. I didn't know you guys
were in here.

470
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,838
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

471
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,910
No. Not yet.

472
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,838
Okay, that's good.
That's really good.

473
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,752
Phoebe, would you
just get out of here?

474
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,434
- And cover your eyes.
- Sure. Okay, getting out.

475
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,672
- Hey, did you change your hair?
- Me? No.

476
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,319
Watch out for the...

477
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,953
I'm okay. I'm okay.

478
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,956
That was a bit close.

479
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,676
Oh, my God.

480
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,909
I've never seen this side
of Piper before.

481
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,198
Don't ask. Next memory.

482
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,959
Every time I see you,
I love you even more.

483
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,595
You're so beautiful.

484
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,997
You're so special.

485
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,511
I can't imagine my life without you.

486
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,955
- Piper.
- Leo?

487
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,832
- Who are you talking to?
- Me?

488
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,996
Nobody. Just myself, you know.

489
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,916
Yourself? You were telling yourself
how much you love you?

490
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,791
No, of course not. I mean, it's...

491
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,155
It's not like that at all.

492
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,757
Let's go downstairs, and I'll explain.

493
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,150
Leo, what's the matter?
Why are you acting so weird?

494
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,676
- Can we go downstairs, please?
- No. Why?

495
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,434
Okay, fine.

496
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,959
Here's good.

497
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,430
I've been thinking a lot, actually,
about our situation.

498
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,996
- Leo...
- Just... Now, let me finish.

499
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,436
I think I've come up with a solution.

500
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,998
A way for us to be together
no matter what they say.

501
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,468
Okay.

502
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,834
Will you marry me?

503
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,634
- Paige.
- Wait, I wanna hear the answer.

504
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,438
We already know the answer,
for God's sakes.

505
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,874
Kit's in trouble. Orb.

506
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,429
- What if I can't?
- Just try.

507
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,752
Looks like curiosity
just killed your cat.

508
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,837
Oh, no.

509
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,035
Oh, no.

510
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,391
It's easy for a couple, over the years,

511
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,712
to lose sight of what brought them
together in the first place.

512
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,112
In your case,
a very remarkable case, I might add,

513
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,636
it's probably even more important
than it would be for most...

514
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,679
- What? What's the matter?
- Freeze him, hurry.

515
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,835
What? Talk to me.

516
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,517
Something's gone terribly wrong.
People are crying out in pain.

517
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,632
Witches. They're all under attack.

518
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,836
- What? Why?
- I don't know why.

519
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,353
We gotta get home, fast.

520
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,876
<i>- Piper.
- No. Wait.</i>

521
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,710
<i>- Piper, can you hear me?
- Phoebe?</i>

522
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,517
Piper, can you hear me?
It's Phoebe.

523
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,314
Are you crazy, what are you doing?

524
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,829
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm trying to contact Piper.

525
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,514
But she'll hear you, she'll
come running in and ruin her future.

526
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,995
Her future's already ruined.
Unless she could somehow give us

527
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,196
a second chance
and let us replay her last memory.

528
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,110
Wait, are you talking about
present-day Piper?

529
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,719
Yeah. Yeah, why not?

530
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,952
I mean, she dragged us into this spell,
consciously or subconsciously.

531
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,872
We might as well
take advantage of it, right?

532
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,112
Besides, if she really is reliving this,
she ought to be able to hear me.

533
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,954
Piper, it's your sister Phoebe.

534
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,032
Now, I know you're having
big problems because of this.

535
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,191
You're kidding,
your sisters are involved with this?

536
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,918
Can we do nothing without them?

537
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,638
I'm trying to concentrate.

538
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,470
Something about our last memory?

539
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,671
Our last memory?

540
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,319
The one where I proposed?

541
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,793
Every time I see you,
I love you even more.

542
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,997
- It worked.
- Okay, now orb.

543
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,916
- Hey.
- Remember us?

544
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,112
What's the matter,
cat got your tongue?

545
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,273
All right, cat, start talking.

546
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,631
The cries are gone.

547
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,834
- Everything's back to normal.
- Oh, no, it's not.

548
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,036
It's not until I reverse this spell.

549
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,636
Even I don't wanna be
this close to my sisters.

550
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,228
Are you sure I can't get you anything.
Coffee, tea, a saucer of milk?

551
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,311
- Good one.
- No, I'm fine.

552
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,199
Although I wouldn't mind some kibble
if you've got some.

553
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,913
- That's not funny.
- It's a little funny.

554
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,156
No, see, you didn't live with her
for three years.

555
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,357
And by the way, what was with
the scratching of my bedpost?

556
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,433
- What was that?
- I had to keep my nails sharp.

557
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,670
Yeah, see, that's just very creepy.

558
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,149
Well, at least we know how important
she was as your familiar.

559
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,276
And how painful things
could have been without her.

560
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,476
I'm just glad to finally know
who you are.

561
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,915
I mean, it makes it easier
to understand why you ran away.

562
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,878
- You know, as a cat.
- You didn't need me anymore.

563
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,951
I mean, once the Charmed Ones
were reconstituted,

564
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,588
- it was time for me to move on.
- Don't you mean moving up?

565
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,228
You know, complete
the evolutionary cycle and all?

566
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,470
Yeah, only special familiars
like Katrina

567
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,471
are rewarded for their service
by becoming human.

568
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,030
To guide other familiars.
That's why the warlock was after me.

569
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,875
Take out familiars, and you leave
their witches defenceless, vulnerable.

570
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,596
Well, it's a good thing you've got
nine lives, that's all I have to say.

571
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,513
Although you're probably down
to your last seven or eight, so...

572
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,517
I'll watch my back.

573
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,756
Well, I gotta get going.

574
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,390
I've got a hungry litter
waiting for me.

575
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,872
You call me
when he comes into his powers?

576
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,797
Blessed be.

577
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,756
So how are we doing?

578
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,195
- We?
- Oh, simmer down, honey.

579
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,354
We, meaning Leo and I, are doing
just fine. Thank you very much.

580
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,797
We did learn that we
have some issues to work on.

581
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,195
Like, somebody needs
to get a life first.

582
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,675
And one of us
needs to be a wife first.

583
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,992
Oh, easy on the rhyming.
No more spells.

584
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,189
Gladly.

585
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,474
But the point is, we need
to spend more time as a couple.

586
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,036
- So that we don't forget.
- Right.
