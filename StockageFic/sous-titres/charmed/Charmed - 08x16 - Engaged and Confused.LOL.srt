1
00:00:01,477 --> 00:00:04,892
The night my sister was taken,
it was raining outside.

2
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,801
That was the last time
I ever saw her.

3
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:09,491
Previously on Charmed...

4
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:10,997
It's only been a couple days.

5
00:00:10,998 --> 00:00:12,684
I know, but what if I never
get through to her ?

6
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:15,075
The only thing you can really do is
just be there for her.

7
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:18,617
Christy, it's ok. You're safe now.
You're gonna be ok.

8
00:00:19,576 --> 00:00:21,976
There's one more battle
on the horizon for you three,

9
00:00:21,977 --> 00:00:24,073
one unlike you've ever faced before.

10
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:27,988
One you won't see coming, and one,
you may not survive.

11
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:29,526
What does that have to do with Leo ?

12
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:35,198
I've faced demons and fireballs,
magical suitors, orbing.

13
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:37,471
I mean, I think
I passed the test, right ?

14
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:38,696
What test ?

15
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:41,913
Paige...

16
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:44,383
will you marry me ?

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,836
Yes.

18
00:00:45,974 --> 00:00:48,780
Your powers are a blessing, Christy.
They're a gift.

19
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:50,362
They're a great thing to have.

20
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,152
They scare me.

21
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,332
She's the key, and whatever that means,
it can't be good.

22
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:57,992
Well, maybe it is. I mean, maybe she's here
to help us fight whatever comes next,

23
00:00:57,993 --> 00:00:59,519
you know. Maybe they both are.

24
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:03,849
She's in position.

25
00:01:05,854 --> 00:01:07,841
We're almost there.

26
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:12,281
Well, we haven't made much progress here,
either. The whole

27
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:15,286
Christy ultimate power thing
has got me kind of stumped.

28
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:17,052
Piper, relax.

29
00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:20,966
You sound so stressed.
Don't worry ! We'll figure it out.

30
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:22,705
You're like hyperventilating.

31
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:26,062
I'm not hyperventilating.
I'm kneading dough, do-do.

32
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:27,532
You're kneading bread ?

33
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:30,669
Uh, yeah ! You are talking
to a former chef,

34
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,398
you know ?
Don't act so surprised.

35
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,772
Look, sweetie, are you sure you're
ok with this ?

36
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:37,816
- Throwing Paige an engagement party without ?
- Are you kidding ?

37
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:40,668
It's exactly what Leo would want us to do.

38
00:01:40,788 --> 00:01:43,119
Besides, Paige deserves
what Leo and I had.

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,835
And you will have that again as soon as
we figure out what we're up against.

40
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:49,992
Well, until then, someone in this family
is going to have

41
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:53,102
a normal, happy wedding engagement,
party and all.

42
00:01:53,137 --> 00:01:56,014
Speaking of witch, how's the Christy
project going ?

43
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,233
Actually, it's going really well.

44
00:01:58,234 --> 00:02:01,956
This morning, we mastered
the art of walking in high heels,

45
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:04,922
and now we're just picking out an outfit...
Try that one.

46
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:08,041
And we're gonna go
for a little test run at a cafe,

47
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:09,892
- you know, see how it goes.
- Great.

48
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:12,803
Because demons attacking at the party,
I can handle,

49
00:02:12,804 --> 00:02:15,431
but Christy eating with her hands,
I cannot handle.

50
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:19,351
Don't worry. She will be totally,
totally ready by tomorrow night.

51
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:20,243
Thank you.

52
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:23,797
What... what happened ?

53
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:33,098
I suppose letting him escape half alive
was meant to send a message.

54
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:34,095
Yes.

55
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:36,925
That it's suicide to go up
against the Triad.

56
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:39,491
We can't afford to lose
any more demons, Xar.

57
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:44,332
- Well, there might be another way.
- How about retreating deeper into the underworld ?

58
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,229
If the Triad gets the ultimate power,

59
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,366
nowhere will be safe.

60
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:52,024
But we can't even get them out
of magic school now, let alone destroy them.

61
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:54,238
We're not strong enough to stop them.

62
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,647
No.

63
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,765
But the Charmed Ones might be.

64
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:01,791
Perhaps we can get them to destroy
the Triad for us.

65
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,348
Charmed 816,
"Engaged and Confused"

66
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:15,710
Subtitled by Team Charmed
from forom.com and teamcharmed.net

67
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:25,623
Greatouille, Launka, Ronanasplit, Lucile76,
Demonclem, Chryssie, Titelilie, Kiff, Guix

68
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:10,193
What are you doing here ? I thought
you were going ring shopping with Henry.

69
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:11,073
Oh,

70
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:13,294
yeah. I was supposed to, but, you know,

71
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,160
I figured what with the key to the ultimate power
over at Phoebe's, I should

72
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:19,538
take this time just to, you know, kind of
check things out and...

73
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:22,200
Ok, but this is your wedding ring
we're talking about.

74
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:22,998
I know.

75
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:25,701
I'm not getting married tomorrow.
I've got some time.

76
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:29,400
But still, when a girl isn't the least bit
giddy about ring shopping,

77
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:32,055
that usually means something's very wrong.

78
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:36,565
You know, maybe I'm just not of
those kind of "whoo-hoo" wedding girls

79
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:38,437
that goes crazy about the whole thing.
Did you ever think of that ?

80
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:40,959
I think you have a classic case
of cold feet.

81
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,681
I don't have cold feet because...

82
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:47,892
because I'm crazy for Henry.
I am. Crazy for him. Love him.

83
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:51,122
Ok, yeah, sure, I believe you.
And I love Leo, too,

84
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:55,252
but that doesn't mean I didn't get knots
in my stomach the moment I said yes.

85
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:57,906
- You did, really ?
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:04:58,155 --> 00:05:00,046
It's perfectly normal.

87
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:03,980
Well, is it normal to fight about
every little thing ?

88
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:05,226
Actually, yes.

89
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:10,446
Look, you just need to relax and spend a little time together
and talk it out and, you know, listen.

90
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:12,015
That's always a good thing.

91
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:16,105
I could probably do some more listening
than I've been doing.

92
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:17,736
You should kind of give it a try.

93
00:05:17,737 --> 00:05:21,570
Ok, I will. I will call him right after
I'm done checking on some things.

94
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,243
No. You need to get your butt out of here.
Go.

95
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:27,267
The demons will show up eventually.
They always do.

96
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,462
Good luck.

97
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:38,376
I'd rather die than spend eternity hiding out in some dingy cave
while the Triad luxuriates up at magic school.

98
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:42,100
Their resurfacing after so long away
opens old wounds.

99
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:44,578
They were wrong to have
excommunicated you, Xar.

100
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:47,792
- And it will be their downfall.
- I have no doubt.

101
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:49,680
- Still...
- I know their weakness,

102
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:51,879
what they so desperately want.

103
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,624
To kill the Charmed Ones

104
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,886
and shift the balance of power
from good to evil,

105
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:01,072
and the fact they just took over
magic school tells me they're close.

106
00:06:01,073 --> 00:06:03,521
All the more reason to stay away, I think.

107
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:04,635
But

108
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,196
if the Charmed Ones knew
the Triad was back,

109
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:11,091
they'd want them vanquished as much as I do.

110
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:14,036
I just have to find a way to get them
the message.

111
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:17,478
Or rather, you'll have to find a way.

112
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:22,666
Still, with all due respect, maybe we should
wait, see how things play out.

113
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:25,052
No ! We need
to take the Triad out now

114
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:27,566
before they get the ultimate power.

115
00:06:43,222 --> 00:06:45,024
Ok ! Utensils !

116
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:47,417
Right.

117
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:50,849
- Sorry.
- No, it's ok. You're doing... you're doing fine.

118
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,276
You know, honey, you have a little

119
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:53,223
something...

120
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:54,396
everywhere.

121
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:58,445
Just... fine. You know, um, why don't we
just stick to liquids ?

122
00:06:58,446 --> 00:06:59,787
I'm a freak.

123
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:01,560
I'm never gonna get this.

124
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:06,805
Oh, no. I mean, you were raised by demons for 15 years.
You can't expect to get all this in one week.

125
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:11,049
- Just eat your salad.
- Yeah, just relax.

126
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,102
Relax. Concentrate.

127
00:07:17,748 --> 00:07:20,352
Oh ! My goodness !

128
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,944
Goodness.

129
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,921
Ok. Ok. That's not...
put it out. Put it out.

130
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:28,497
Well...

131
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:33,318
- uh, maybe this was a little premature.
- Yeah. We need to leave now.

132
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,751
- Ok, I'm going to give you money...
- Thank you.

133
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:39,484
I'm going to go run some errands,
and I'll meet you at the house, ok ?

134
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:41,363
You're gonna get this. I promise.

135
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:49,636
Ooh !

136
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,478
- Sorry.
- It's ok. Don't worry about it.

137
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,343
It's my fault.

138
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,135
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

139
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:03,566
- Hey ! Wait ! Missy !
- What ?

140
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,947
- Hello ?
- What ?

141
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,633
That guy was totally hot. He was checking you out.
What are you doing ?

142
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:10,874
- He was ? I didn't even see him.
- I know.

143
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,054
- That's why I came over here.
- Ok, let's just focus on Christy.

144
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,642
Otherwise, we're going to have to deal
with the wrath of Piper.

145
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,181
Nobody touch these !
I don't want smudges !

146
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:25,068
And then we clink.

147
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:29,037
You need to wash those.
I don't know if I ordered enough.

148
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,491
Why clink ?

149
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:34,555
You know, I don't really know. It's just
kind of a thing. Ok, and now we sip.

150
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,676
That was... that was really nice.
I should've told you what sip meant.

151
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:43,007
It's ok.
No ! Don't use... napkin. Napkin.

152
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:48,120
Ohh. At least there aren't any smudges.

153
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:50,193
That's all right.
I got it. I got it. I got it.

154
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:52,434
Ohh.

155
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:56,122
Yes, these, my friend are salad tongs.

156
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:59,566
You kind of dig in there and pull the salad out.
Don't use your fingers.

157
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:01,278
I got it.

158
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,562
Those are the tables.

159
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,864
What's this do ?

160
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:16,737
- Ok, uh, Rick, you can just put those on the...
- Piper Halliwell ?

161
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:19,461
Yes ?

162
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:21,140
Is there a problem ?

163
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:23,177
We just wanted to make sure
you're all right.

164
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:25,739
Can we, uh, come in ?

165
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:28,880
Uh, why wouldn't I be all right ?

166
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:32,455
Have you noticed any suspicious
activity lately around your home ?

167
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:35,329
What is this about exactly ?

168
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,135
We got word there might be
an attempt on your life.

169
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:39,496
What ?!

170
00:09:40,556 --> 00:09:41,649
By who ?

171
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,916
You, uh...

172
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:45,571
you've come across them before.

173
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:47,617
"Them" ?

174
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:51,257
Who are you guys ?

175
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:58,145
Can someone please tell me if it is normal to argue
with somebody about whether

176
00:09:58,146 --> 00:10:01,288
you should eat before or after
you buy wedding bands ?

177
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:02,680
Hey, who are they ?

178
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:06,566
Look. This is a friendly visit.
We're just here to warn you that there are...

179
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:10,496
beings who you thought you dealt with,
but haven't.

180
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,226
Beings ?

181
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:14,506
Wait a second.

182
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,764
- They're demons !
- The Triad's back ! Beware !

183
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:29,185
- Gotta get you out of here !
- Wait.

184
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:34,651
Sweet !

185
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:39,452
Did he just say Triad ?!

186
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:53,038
I don't know I didn't recognize him.
I just got a hit they were demons.

187
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,688
Gotta love that telepathy.

188
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:57,234
It's too bad your power
just won't tell us what they want.

189
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:59,140
Well, they don't want Christy, thank god.

190
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,410
I think they were coming to tell us
about the Triad.

191
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,097
Who are supposedly dead. We thought cole
vanquished them years ago.

192
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,397
Are they dangerous ?

193
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:07,324
Very.

194
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:11,548
I'm not really understanding, though.
Why would demons come to warn us about other demons ?

195
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:14,602
- Yeah, I probably should just go check the book...
- No !

196
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:19,357
I can do the research. You need to talk
to your fiance. We have enough firepower down here.

197
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:21,600
- Don't say the "f" word.
- Firepower ?

198
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:23,083
Go.

199
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:26,089
- Maybe we should call the whole thing off.
- Don't even think about it.

200
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,376
Listen, the party is on, dude.

201
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:29,520
Dude...

202
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,117
- the house is a mess.
- And what else is new ? Ok ?

203
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:36,489
You two need to go hang out at Phoebe's
until we know something.

204
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,870
Come on. I'll take you.

205
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:40,241
And then you need to go straight to Henry

206
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:43,073
because I ain't throwin' you
an engagement party if you ain't engaged.

207
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:44,187
Don't threaten me.

208
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:48,576
- How could you fail ?!
- We didn't...

209
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:53,069
exactly ! We... we warned them about the Triad !
We just didn't get a chance to elaborate.

210
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,744
- Ciril was incinerated by a Charmed One !
- No.

211
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:59,059
By another witch. The same one who knew
that we were demons.

212
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,592
And they seemed very protective of her.

213
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:03,528
Explain.

214
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:06,221
They risked themselves so
she wouldn't get hurt,

215
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:08,887
even though she didn't look like
she needed much protection.

216
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,760
Interesting.

217
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:15,346
A strange, powerful witch appears
in the Charmed Ones' lives

218
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:19,363
just as the Triad is close
to achieving its goal.

219
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:22,472
I wonder if she's the one.

220
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,671
I don't follow.

221
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,874
When I was one of them,
they spoke of going after the coming power.

222
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:32,672
- The ultimate power.
- And you think that might be her ?

223
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:34,622
If she is,

224
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:37,741
we need to get her away
from the Charmed Ones fast.

225
00:12:37,742 --> 00:12:41,890
- But then they'd come after us.
- Not if they think the Triad took her.

226
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:44,339
Then they'd go after them.

227
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:58,777
Hey. Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

228
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,176
- Oh, no ! The store's closed.
- Yeah, yeah.

229
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:06,509
Hey, don't worry, though. I got to watch
another couple pick out their band. It was...

230
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:07,886
it was really beautiful.

231
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:11,227
So sorry. Right after we hung up,
these demons attacked us, and...

232
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:14,570
- Demons ? Are you ok ?
- Yeah, we're fine.

233
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:17,689
They were, in their own special way,
coming to warn us about this

234
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,011
group called the Triad, who we thought were dead,
but apparently aren't, which is kind of freaking us out a little bit.

235
00:13:22,012 --> 00:13:25,676
- I'll explain more about that whole thing later.
- Paige, look, if you have too much goin' on,

236
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:27,285
if you can't deal with this wedding
right now...

237
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,353
No. Of course I can deal
with the wedding and

238
00:13:30,354 --> 00:13:36,266
picking out bands and, you know,
dealing with toothpaste caps and snoring.

239
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:38,855
Uh... snoring ?

240
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:43,115
- It's nothing.
- Didn't sound like nothing.

241
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:46,699
- Well, every couple has their little quirks and their issues.
- Issues ?

242
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,933
Are you talking about not nailing down the wedding date
or are you talking about not having a guest list ?

243
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:55,222
Ok, by guest list, you're saying you're not really
interested in just having a

244
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:57,806
barefoot-on-the-beach wedding in Fiji ?

245
00:13:57,841 --> 00:14:01,852
No. Because I would like to lift a wedding veil,
not a mosquito net when I'm gonna kiss you.

246
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:05,149
- Does every couple go through this ?
- Hold on now.

247
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,157
I want to go back to the small issue
here of toothpaste.

248
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,797
What ? You don't put
the cap back on !

249
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:13,365
Ok. Well, you squeeze from the middle.

250
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:16,661
By the way, I am not wearing a veil.

251
00:14:16,662 --> 00:14:20,598
- How can you get married without wearing a veil ?
- Well, if you want one so much, why don't you wear it ?

252
00:14:21,254 --> 00:14:23,190
I... I...

253
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:30,302
It's funny. I remember doing this to you
when we were little.

254
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,320
- Oh, really ?
- Yeah.

255
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:36,226
Manicure, pedicure, the works.
We had fun playing dress up.

256
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:40,794
Well, I think I was a little young to remember,
but I have to say, I know you lived in a cave and it was terrible,

257
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:42,935
but it did wonders for your complexion.

258
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:46,276
There you go.

259
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:50,041
- Oh, sweetie, you look so beautiful.
- She's a total babe.

260
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:52,446
You are a total knockout.

261
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:57,842
Oh, whoops. This isn't right.

262
00:14:58,306 --> 00:14:59,817
Hey...

263
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,588
hey, I saw you at the cafe earlier,
didn't I ?

264
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:06,444
Yes, you did, which makes me wonder
even more what you're doing in my house.

265
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:10,794
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that.
I'm new here. Must have gotten off on the wrong floor.

266
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:13,371
An understandable mistake.

267
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,529
Why does your key work ?

268
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,833
Hmm. I don't know.

269
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:20,827
That's a weird one.

270
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:22,763
Have to talk to the broker about that.

271
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,479
Anyway, ladies, I apologize.
Have a wonderful evening.

272
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,881
Listen, if you ever need anything,
I live right below you, so don't hesitate.

273
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:33,121
Even if it is just for a...

274
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:35,303
cup of sugar or something.

275
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:43,052
Ok, blowing that hot guy off once,
maybe, but

276
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:45,710
he just landed in your apartment,
and you let him leave ?

277
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,237
You have to admit,
that's kind of suspicious.

278
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:49,620
I...

279
00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:52,597
I mean, you must have got some sort
of vibe off him. Did you ?

280
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,896
- No. I thought he was cute.
- Yeah.

281
00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:58,966
Please. What do you know ?
You were raised by demons, for god's sake.

282
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:01,806
All right, whatever. Come on.
Let's go try this dress on.

283
00:16:03,037 --> 00:16:06,439
Excuse me. I think
I can dress myself by now.

284
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,374
- Ohh !
- Ohh !

285
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,928
Well, that's progress.
Little snippy, but progress.

286
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:15,342
Christy.

287
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:22,064
The Triad.

288
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:28,687
How did this happen ?
Why couldn't I stop him ?

289
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:32,382
Because you just couldn't. I couldn't, either.
He was in there waiting for her.

290
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:34,197
And you're sure it was the Triad ?

291
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:36,937
Well, it's not the kind of robe
you find at Nordstrom's, you know.

292
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:41,282
So I don't understand. The guys that kidnapped
her 15 years ago were just front men ?

293
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:44,517
Well, it kind of makes sense,
especially if she's the key to the power.

294
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:47,590
Which if the Triad gets, we're screwed.

295
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,776
Well, who cares ? All I care about is getting
her back before they...

296
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,960
They won't hurt her. They need her.

297
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:56,527
We just need to get her back before
they get whatever it is they're after.

298
00:16:56,528 --> 00:16:59,434
I still don't understand why
those demons warned us about them.

299
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,697
Well, they don't want the Triad taking over
any more than we do.

300
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:04,774
They probably thought
we would take them out.

301
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:09,535
You know, this might be the fight
that the Angel of Destiny was talking about.

302
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,801
And if we win...

303
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:13,886
we could get Leo back.

304
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:18,478
Ok. Well, I'm gonna start by checking into that guy
that broke into my apartment.

305
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:22,167
- You really think he's part of this ?
- Yes !

306
00:17:25,283 --> 00:17:29,109
We're gonna get your sister back, Billie,
one way or another.

307
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,281
And Leo, too.

308
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:41,179
- She's the ultimate power ?
- Doubtful. She was too easy to take.

309
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,050
More likely an unsuspecting conduit.
Still,

310
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:48,085
as long as we have her,
the Triad doesn't.

311
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:51,296
Do you really think the Charmed Ones
will go after them instead of us ?

312
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:55,096
- That's the plan.
- But what if they don't ?

313
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:57,149
Then we're dead.

314
00:17:57,428 --> 00:18:00,668
But that's still better than having to
answer to the Triad.

315
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:06,207
Ah ! Finally waking, are we ?

316
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,814
Care to tell us what you know about
the ultimate power ?

317
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,389
Spunky.

318
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,870
But you'll talk...

319
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:18,586
eventually.

320
00:18:23,651 --> 00:18:24,750
I knew it.

321
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:36,246
Well, took you long enough.

322
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,976
Well, love is never having
to say you're sorry.

323
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:52,299
Ah ! That's nice.

324
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:54,249
Very nice.

325
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:57,270
Ok,

326
00:18:57,271 --> 00:18:58,897
now...

327
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:00,877
you lie awake at night.

328
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:04,279
You're afraid that you
may never find love again.

329
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:08,473
The best years of your life lost,
battling for the greater good,

330
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:11,786
but at the cost of starting
your own family.

331
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:15,671
Well, that ought to do it.

332
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:22,961
You don't need to fight me, Phoebe.

333
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,862
- I'm on your side.
- Like hell, you are.

334
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,406
Just sit down, ok ?

335
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:30,640
Listen, now you were just thinkin'
how you lay awake at night, right ?

336
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:33,665
How you're afraid that you may never
find love again ?

337
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,542
Um, it's not fair, really.
I already know I'm right.

338
00:19:37,228 --> 00:19:40,528
- Who are you ?
- I'm Cupid. I'm one of them anyway.

339
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:42,315
You can call me Coop.

340
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:47,160
That's just great, Coop, but you know what ?

341
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:49,891
I don't have the time for this because
I need to go find my sisters.

342
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:52,606
You always say that, and that is exactly
why I'm here.

343
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:55,044
You always think that you never
have time for love.

344
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:56,879
That's why the Elders sent me.

345
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,376
They feel guilty, you know ? About how everything
got all messed up after they enlisted you.

346
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:04,838
So they sent me down to help you
get things back on track.

347
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:08,614
Oh, ok, well, you know what ?
I don't need help finding true love.

348
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:10,958
- Well, apparently, you do.
- Excuse me ?!

349
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,718
You didn't even notice me at the cafe.

350
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:14,781
Oh ! Well, you know what ?

351
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:18,823
I didn't notice you at the cafe
because you're... pff.

352
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:21,950
- You are just not cute.
- No, I'm cute.

353
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:24,456
You're resistant. Now, come on.

354
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,500
How you gonna have that future child that you were
promised unless you find love first ? Right ?

355
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,892
That's still possible?

356
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:35,063
Not only is it possible, it's destined.

357
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,656
We are gonna have to hurry.

358
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:41,816
- But my star charts...
- All wonky. I'm sorry. Your math stinks.

359
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:44,639
Anyway, I'll show you about that
later. First,

360
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:46,958
- we're gonna heal your heart.
- No.

361
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:52,178
First, I need to go kill some demons
because if I don't, none of this is gonna matter, ok ?

362
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:54,490
- Wait. You're resisting.
- You know what ?

363
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,440
You can take that bow and arrow
and shove it up your, uh...

364
00:20:57,588 --> 00:21:01,286
and don't even try to freeze me
because I will vanquish you.

365
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:05,083
Ooh !

366
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:08,086
Well, this is gonna be
tougher than I thought.

367
00:21:08,087 --> 00:21:11,332
Hey, Henry, can you
please do me a huge favor ?

368
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,780
I need you to call everybody on the list
for our party and cancel.

369
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:17,214
Ca... Paige, we can't cancel on them.
It's tomorrow night.

370
00:21:17,215 --> 00:21:21,356
Look, there might not be a tomorrow night for us, ok ?
I have to deal with the Triad.

371
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:23,592
The Triad.

372
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,109
Right, the Triad.

373
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:29,372
You know, I just thought...

374
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,204
I thought we were working on it.

375
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:34,393
Well, I thought we were working on it, too.
But, sadly, they've come back.

376
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,464
Can you please
just make the call ?

377
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:39,879
Ok. All right. Yes, ma'am.

378
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:45,555
Hey, there. How's it goin' ?

379
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:50,779
- Not good. There's no known way to vanquish them.
- Well, that's, um... really great news.

380
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,498
Do you think it's odd that they went after Christy
and didn't even try to fight us ?

381
00:21:55,499 --> 00:22:00,636
No. The Triad thinks she's the key to what they want,
and once they get it, we may be obsolete.

382
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:04,581
"Power of the witches rise, course unseen across the skies.
Come to us who call you now..."

383
00:22:04,582 --> 00:22:06,340
How long has she been doing that ?

384
00:22:06,502 --> 00:22:11,299
Since we've been up here, and she's working
on an enhancing potion to make the spell stronger.

385
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,501
Hmm.

386
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:14,803
Um...

387
00:22:15,463 --> 00:22:19,363
Billie, the thing is, if that spell hasn't worked
by now, it's not gonna work.

388
00:22:19,364 --> 00:22:21,666
Well, I don't know what else to do.
I have to do something.

389
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,073
We're gonna get her back.

390
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,759
Ok ?

391
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,017
I'm gonna go scry.

392
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:36,501
"Power of the witches rise, course unseen
across the skies".

393
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:39,507
"Come to us who call you near,
come to us and settle here".

394
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:42,971
You have no idea
who you're dealing with !

395
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:49,598
I may not know exactly who you are, but I know you have something
the Triad's been wanting for a very long time.

396
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,170
And it brings me untold joy to think that I'll
ruin their plan just as it's about to reach fruition.

397
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:57,043
Let me out of here !

398
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:59,052
We're not going to get anything out of her.

399
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:00,049
No matter.

400
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,937
We just need to hold onto her until the battle
between the Charmed Ones and the Triad is over.

401
00:23:04,938 --> 00:23:08,431
Then we'll see who's left standing.

402
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:29,706
Now it's your turn.

403
00:23:35,062 --> 00:23:37,067
Christy ?

404
00:23:38,728 --> 00:23:41,420
- What happened ?
- It worked !

405
00:23:42,737 --> 00:23:45,200
I was in a cage.

406
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:48,637
I got out, but then they came
after me again...

407
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:51,793
- and then I was here.
- What did they want ? Did they say ?

408
00:23:51,794 --> 00:23:55,825
- I don't know. I was scared.
- It's ok. You're safe now.

409
00:23:55,826 --> 00:23:58,862
Well, the Triad is gonna figure out
where she is sooner or later.

410
00:23:58,863 --> 00:24:01,033
We need to stop them
while we have a chance.

411
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:03,053
Ok, I'm gonna go get Phoebe.

412
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:11,504
- Are you ok ?
- Yeah. I just need to lie down.

413
00:24:11,505 --> 00:24:15,880
- Yeah, come on. Let's go.
- No, it's ok. You stay here and help her.

414
00:24:15,881 --> 00:24:17,782
I'll be fine.

415
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:55,153
Somebody's impersonating you.

416
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,630
What do you mean, impersonating us ?

417
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:02,872
- How do you know ?
- Will you keep your voice down ?

418
00:25:02,873 --> 00:25:04,556
I don't want them to find us together.

419
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:07,308
I always said this plan
was taking too long.

420
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:10,086
- We should just attack the Charmed Ones while we're here.
- No.

421
00:25:10,087 --> 00:25:13,891
- We don't have the power yet.
- And we're not strong enough without it.

422
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:16,572
We don't know that. Besides,

423
00:25:16,573 --> 00:25:21,475
- someone's already exposed us.
- Yes. The real question is, who ?

424
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:25,529
- Who else ? It has to be Xar.
- Xar ? Who is Xar ?

425
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,830
- A demon who was once one of us.
- But one whom we banished.

426
00:25:29,831 --> 00:25:32,799
And one who's been looking to avenge
that for decades.

427
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,659
He's the only one who knows
our ways and our desires.

428
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,387
- So, what ? He's been sabotaging us ?
- Undoubtedly, so he won't have to answer to us.

429
00:25:40,388 --> 00:25:43,059
Xar would do anything
to keep that from happening.

430
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,330
Well, he may have already succeeded.

431
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:48,411
The Charmed Ones are after you now.

432
00:25:49,987 --> 00:25:55,621
- Which means I may never get Billie back.
- Yes, you will, just as we promised.

433
00:25:55,622 --> 00:26:00,016
You're still the key, and you're still
in perfect position.

434
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:03,718
You're her sister, Christy.
Soon, you will show her the way.

435
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:07,995
If we can stop Xar
from doing any more damage.

436
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:28,572
- Hey ! How'd it go ? Was the hot guy a Triad ?
- He's worse. He's a cupid.

437
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:30,503
- A what ?!
- A cupid.

438
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:34,546
The Elders sent him down here to help me
find real love? How insulting is that ?!

439
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:36,609
Well, maybe they figure they owe you.

440
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:40,845
Well, I wish they'd help with the Triads first
because I have no idea how to vanquish them.

441
00:26:40,915 --> 00:26:44,351
- Well, what did Cole do ?
- Well, I don't know.

442
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:49,008
He was a really powerful demon.
Probably just as powerful as they were.

443
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:52,740
You know what ? Cole was my longest
relationship. Is that pathetic, or what ?

444
00:26:52,775 --> 00:26:57,169
Actually, you might be onto something.
Maybe we need a demon to vanquish them.

445
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,407
Are you kidding ? Where are we gonna
find one of those ?

446
00:26:59,408 --> 00:27:02,578
Well, I don't think we'd need to
if we just get the Triads to kill each other.

447
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:06,719
- Uh... how do you propose we do that ?
- I don't know. I'm makin' this up as I go.

448
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,593
What if we don't get them all ?

449
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:12,883
I don't think we need to. If we just kill one,
then we weaken the collective.

450
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:14,855
- Kind of like us.
- Exactly.

451
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,349
- It's still dicey.
- Dicey's all we got.

452
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,308
Well, we better do something fast,
or we're not gonna be able to save Christy.

453
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:24,077
Or Leo, for that matter. I mean,
if the Triad really is the big threat.

454
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:28,615
- And we're in for a huge battle.
- Which means, I need to get the kids out of here.

455
00:27:28,616 --> 00:27:32,758
- Oh, and I need to go see Henry.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Can it wait ?

456
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:34,496
No, it can't.

457
00:27:34,597 --> 00:27:39,559
Look, if something happens to me, I don't want
the last thing Henry remembers about us is arguing.

458
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,736
- Well, we don't have a lot of time.
- I need to do this. Sorry.

459
00:27:43,737 --> 00:27:45,602
Hurry.

460
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:55,293
- How did you find me ?
- The witch led us to you, Xar.

461
00:27:56,744 --> 00:27:59,212
You should have killed her while
you had the chance.

462
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,973
You know me better than that,
Asmodeus.

463
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:04,604
I wanted to find out why you needed her.

464
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,152
You look tired, old friend.

465
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:11,026
The stress of so many years
on the run, no doubt.

466
00:28:11,027 --> 00:28:14,439
- Those days are behind us.
- Perhaps.

467
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,331
But the days ahead
are few, thanks to me.

468
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:21,499
- You'll never save yourselves from the Charmed Ones.
- That remains to be seen.

469
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,829
Does it ?

470
00:28:23,224 --> 00:28:26,945
If you had the power to take them on,
you would have done so by now.

471
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:30,056
You need more...
but now it's too late.

472
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:33,427
Your hubris has always been
your undoing, Xar,

473
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:38,767
- even in the end.
- See you in the wasteland.

474
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,288
He's right.

475
00:28:42,903 --> 00:28:45,478
The Charmed Ones will be coming for us,

476
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:48,198
and without the power, we'll never be able
to defeat them.

477
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:49,873
We don't know that !

478
00:28:50,158 --> 00:28:53,489
Besides, we only have to take one out
to weaken their power of Three.

479
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,401
But that's our weakness, too.

480
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:59,344
That's why we embarked on the plan
all those years ago to use Christy.

481
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:03,923
Without the power, we are
too closely matched to ensure success.

482
00:29:03,924 --> 00:29:06,039
We don't have a choice
now, do we ?

483
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,661
It's kill or be killed now.

484
00:29:18,195 --> 00:29:19,893
Ahh... Henry.

485
00:29:19,894 --> 00:29:20,687
Hey.

486
00:29:20,688 --> 00:29:21,871
- Hey.
- What are you doin' here ?

487
00:29:21,872 --> 00:29:24,228
- Uh, I need to talk to you.
- Ok.

488
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,114
- Will you come with me ?
- Sure.

489
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:28,520
Wait. Is there
something wrong ?

490
00:29:28,521 --> 00:29:32,111
I'm ok. Uh, no, not really.

491
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:36,890
Um, I just really wanted to see you,
just in case...

492
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:40,213
Wait, wait, wait, Paige.
What's wrong ?

493
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:45,482
We're going up against the Triad.

494
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,624
What does that mean ?

495
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:51,157
Well, it means, if we win this battle,
it'll be a very, very good thing,

496
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:54,906
and we can get Leo back,
and everything'll be

497
00:29:54,907 --> 00:29:57,706
super happy and perfect,
and I won't even

498
00:29:57,741 --> 00:30:00,516
care if you leave the cap
off the toothpaste.

499
00:30:00,517 --> 00:30:03,188
What if you don't win ?

500
00:30:03,727 --> 00:30:05,439
All right, I'm going with you.

501
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,846
We'll do it together.
I can't sit here and do nothing.

502
00:30:08,902 --> 00:30:12,550
You can't. It has to be
just the 3 of us.

503
00:30:13,392 --> 00:30:18,781
All right. When you get back,
I'm gonna marry you as soon as I can.

504
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:22,711
- At the engagement party.
- You were supposed to cancel that.

505
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:25,215
I guess I didn't.

506
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,798
Hey !

507
00:30:47,465 --> 00:30:50,001
- You scared me.
- I'm sorry.

508
00:30:50,002 --> 00:30:52,381
So, when are we
gonna get started ?

509
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,030
Don't you have someone else's love life
to meddle in ?

510
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:56,731
Mmm... nope. I'm all yours.

511
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:59,842
I mean, yeah, sure, normally, we've got
40, 50 jobs, but

512
00:30:59,843 --> 00:31:02,575
the Elders thought that you deserve
to have me all to yourself.

513
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:04,840
Oh, lucky me !

514
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:09,824
Uh, you know what ? I'm just really busy
right now, and I have big issues to deal with, so...

515
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:11,581
Yeah, I know. I know.

516
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,915
And, uh, you're gonna get through this.

517
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:16,875
And then we're gonna get to work.

518
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:21,700
Has anyone ever told you
that you are a big pain in the butt ?

519
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:24,100
Mmm... no. I'm a Cupid.

520
00:31:24,832 --> 00:31:28,223
Hey... good luck.

521
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:40,577
Anything ?

522
00:31:40,578 --> 00:31:44,439
Well, we think they're at magic school.
We found a very high concentration of energy there.

523
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,526
- So that means we have to fight them there ?
- Does it really matter where we fight them ?

524
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:52,347
- Ok, let's go over the plan again.
- Divide and conquer, right? That's the plan.

525
00:31:52,348 --> 00:31:55,308
- So that I can draw out their power...
- and I will freeze one of them.

526
00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:57,852
They are upper level demons,
so they won't freeze for long.

527
00:31:57,853 --> 00:32:02,166
They only have to stay frozen long enough
for me to orb the last one into position.

528
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:06,923
You know, do you guys think I should go with you ?
I mean, my projection power could really help.

529
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:09,682
No, you have to stay here
and protect your sister.

530
00:32:09,683 --> 00:32:12,964
And you also have to call the Elders
if we don't come back.

531
00:32:14,276 --> 00:32:15,803
Ready ?

532
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:18,479
Nope, but let's do it anyway.

533
00:32:30,485 --> 00:32:33,162
Whatever happens,
we're gonna stick together.

534
00:32:33,324 --> 00:32:37,384
Yeah, right. Of course.
That's what sisters are for, right ?

535
00:33:03,571 --> 00:33:05,224
Ok,

536
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:08,063
how are we supposed
to divide and conquer that ?

537
00:33:08,064 --> 00:33:10,659
Maybe we should try to blast 'em
while they're distracted.

538
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,719
I don't think it'll even faze them.

539
00:33:13,511 --> 00:33:15,724
I'll distract 'em.

540
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:18,440
Too late.

541
00:33:22,256 --> 00:33:25,088
- Phoebe ?
- Yeah ? Go !

542
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:30,764
- I've got her !
- No ! We're stronger together !

543
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:31,756
Hey !

544
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:37,271
Yoo-hoo !

545
00:33:39,154 --> 00:33:40,620
Paige, now.

546
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:42,589
Triad guy.

547
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:51,392
No !

548
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:54,726
No !

549
00:33:57,859 --> 00:33:59,469
Looking for me ?

550
00:34:08,368 --> 00:34:10,768
- You ok ?
- Yeah.

551
00:34:11,655 --> 00:34:15,018
- I can't believe we did it.
- Well, 2 out of 3.

552
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:18,410
Well, that's all we needed, right ?
That means we won.

553
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:21,384
Well, if we won, where's Leo ?
I mean, he should be here.

554
00:34:21,947 --> 00:34:25,832
- I don't understand what went wrong.
- Maybe nothing.

555
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:29,874
Maybe there's a bigger threat out there.

556
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:40,970
I don't understand. What could possibly be
a bigger threat than the Triad ?

557
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:42,901
Is everything ok ?

558
00:34:42,902 --> 00:34:47,437
Well, yeah. We got the Triad...
but we do think that there's a bigger threat out there.

559
00:34:47,438 --> 00:34:51,479
- Did they say that ?
- No. They didn't have to. Leo would be here.

560
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,174
I'm so sorry, Piper.

561
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,052
You know, you're gonna get Leo back.

562
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:04,608
Well, in the meantime, we have
an engagement to celebrate.

563
00:35:04,609 --> 00:35:06,462
Oh. Well...

564
00:35:07,052 --> 00:35:11,418
I've been thinking about that, actually.
And I will do it on one condition.

565
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:14,188
If we can just

566
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:17,107
turn it into a wedding instead.

567
00:35:26,715 --> 00:35:30,223
- What are we supposed to do now ?
- We stay the course.

568
00:35:30,224 --> 00:35:33,764
- But how without the others ?
- It was never about us.

569
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,875
It was always about you.

570
00:35:39,009 --> 00:35:43,107
We've taught you all we know,
shown you the way.

571
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:47,402
Now you must go forward alone to fulfill
your destiny...

572
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:50,764
to unite with the ultimate power.

573
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:57,795
Billie.

574
00:35:57,796 --> 00:36:01,369
This isn't the course either one of us
wanted to take,

575
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,735
but we don't have a choice now.

576
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:06,983
The end result is all that matters.

577
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:11,479
You must save your sister.

578
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:28,444
Well, absolutely. Although, it is kind of short notice.
I might need some magical assistance.

579
00:36:28,445 --> 00:36:31,602
Let's do it.

580
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:37,654
- Christy, what's wrong ?
- Oh, nothing. I'm fine.

581
00:37:05,302 --> 00:37:07,492
Are you nervous ?

582
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:09,577
Surprisingly, no.

583
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,372
You're not ready.

584
00:37:13,373 --> 00:37:18,035
I... am just kind of stunned
this is happening.

585
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:20,012
Well, believe it.

586
00:37:20,478 --> 00:37:23,811
Sure you don't
want to wear my dress ?

587
00:37:23,812 --> 00:37:25,879
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

588
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,376
All right. Let's go conjure you
a very special dress.

589
00:37:36,895 --> 00:37:44,351
How's it goin' ?
You want cake, don't you ?

590
00:37:44,352 --> 00:37:48,474
I want cake, too. Go ahead.
You can have that. Let me get my own.

591
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:52,729
Is it good ? All right.
Here. Take another one real quick.

592
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,515
Quick, before anyone sees.

593
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:59,697
Yeah. All right. Let's go
before anyone sees.

594
00:37:59,698 --> 00:38:01,409
Hi everybody.

595
00:38:04,301 --> 00:38:08,340
Now stand right over here.
There you are.

596
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,788
So, how you feel ?

597
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:13,688
Like I'm ready to take on the world.

598
00:38:24,347 --> 00:38:28,357
- I wish Leo was here.
- He is.

599
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:32,538
Oh ! Sorry. How's it goin' ?

600
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:36,948
- Did someone invite you here ?
- What, are you kidding me ? I love weddings.

601
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:25,030
- You look beautiful.
- And you look very handsome.

602
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:31,881
<i>Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today
to join Henry and Paige in holy matrimony</i>

603
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:35,317
<i>in the presence of family and friends...</i>

604
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:40,593
<i>The union of 2 lives as one
is a sacred bond,</i>

605
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:43,588
<i>both solemn and joyful,</i>

606
00:39:43,623 --> 00:39:48,141
<i>embracing all that you are
and all that you will be.</i>

607
00:39:48,142 --> 00:39:53,035
<i>On this day of your marriage,
know that everything that we love deeply</i>

608
00:39:53,036 --> 00:39:56,261
<i>becomes part of us.</i>

609
00:39:56,262 --> 00:40:02,747
<i>The trick is learning to receive this love
with as much understanding as you give it,</i>

610
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:06,616
and knowing this, you can begin
a life together

611
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:10,477
with an open mind and heart.

612
00:40:10,497 --> 00:40:13,654
And I vow to honor,

613
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,268
to love,

614
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:17,889
and to cherish you

615
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:22,309
- each and every day.
- Through all the seasons of life,

616
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,550
the good times, the bad times,

617
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:29,223
I vow to cherish you
each and every day.

618
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:55,198
- I do.
- I do.

619
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:58,385
You may now kiss the bride.
