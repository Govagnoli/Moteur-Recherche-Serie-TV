1
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,134
Are you sure you don't wanna go
to the manor?

2
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,886
I mean, it's gonna be
kind of cramped here.

3
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:12,179
No, it's bigger than a cave.

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,556
I mean, it works for me
if it works for you.

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,308
I don't even come here
that much anymore.

6
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,602
In fact, I don't think
I ever wanna come back.

7
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,854
Well, can't you just get
a bigger dorm?

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,815
No, not the dorm, I mean school.

9
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,317
So much has happened.

10
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:28,320
Billie, you can't quit now,
you have to graduate.

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,821
Mom and Dad would want you to.

12
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,491
Well, Mom and Dad
aren't here anymore, are they?

13
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,662
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little tired right now.

14
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,330
I know.

15
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:43,001
This has been really hard
for both of us.

16
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,879
I just still can't believe they're gone.
I mean, I feel like if I...

17
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,340
It's not your fault, okay?
A demon murdered them.

18
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,343
Yeah, but if I wouldn't have left them,
maybe they would still be here.

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,178
Or if Piper hadn't called you away.

20
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,973
- This is not her fault.
- Oh, it isn't?

21
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:02,521
You know what,
you just stay here, okay? You rest.

22
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,773
We're gonna get through this,
I promise.

23
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,525
I promise, together.

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,528
I would have never been able
to get through this week without you.

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,658
Well, I'd still be living in a cave
without you.

26
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,538
- I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

27
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,207
I'm gonna help my little sister
get some peace of mind.

28
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,502
I mean, the police might think that
Mom and Dad are an unsolved case,

29
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,712
but we know better.

30
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,881
The Noxon demon can't
be vanquished. You know that.

31
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,341
I'll hit him with a potion
and send him to the astral plane,

32
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,885
like Piper did to the other demons.

33
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,219
But she can't find him.

34
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,721
Then I'll help her, Billie.

35
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:42,060
You let me worry about the demons,
and you just get some rest.

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:53,322
The Noxon won't be easy to find.
He's on the run, he's cagey.

37
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,908
But we will scour the underworld.

38
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,410
Whatever it takes to find him.

39
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,872
I don't like it.
Vanquishing a fellow demon?

40
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,458
We're not going to vanquish him.

41
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,293
Not until we can use him

42
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,754
to separate the other sister
from the Charmed Ones.

43
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,757
Yeah, but why do we have to do
what the Triad wants anymore?

44
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:15,928
- They're dead.
- Nevertheless, we do what we're told.

45
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,432
Says who?

46
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,854
What's going on?

47
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,817
- Is there a problem?
- No. Not anymore.

48
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,197
We're here to help.

49
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,686
Hey there. What took you so long?

50
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,480
I was dropping the boys off at Dad's.

51
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,524
Why? What are you doing here?

52
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,776
Oh, you know,
just in the neighbourhood,

53
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,196
thought I'd drop by,
see how you're doing.

54
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,740
- How go the battles?
- The battles?

55
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:04,077
Yeah, you know, Ultimate Power,
ultimate threat, ultimate stuff.

56
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,370
Need any help?

57
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,955
You just got back
from your honeymoon,

58
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,540
and you want to talk about demons?

59
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,959
Well, it is what we do, isn't it?

60
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,087
You're giving me
a very suspicious look.

61
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,173
You know,
you're a very suspicious person.

62
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,592
- And you're avoiding the question.
- I am not.

63
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,844
All right, fine, maybe I am.

64
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:25,390
But it doesn't mean I don't want to help
out of the goodness of my own heart.

65
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,602
I think you need to talk to Henry.

66
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,563
About what? About demons?

67
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,608
No, about whatever it is
you came here to talk to me about,

68
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,069
which you should be
talking to him about.

69
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,822
I can't tell him about it because
it's just gonna hurt his feelings.

70
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,492
That's not a good enough reason.

71
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,912
The problem is that
it's not Henry's fault at all, okay.

72
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,372
He's amazing. I love him.

73
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,582
I can see why you're avoiding him.

74
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,501
See, the thing is it took me so long

75
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,920
to forge an identity
separate of you and Phoebe,

76
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:58,924
I'm just... I guess I'm kind of afraid
of losing myself in the marriage.

77
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,468
So you're burying yourself
in demons?

78
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,095
It could work for me.

79
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,931
I don't approve of the way
you're handling this.

80
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,808
Anyway, I think I have a lead.

81
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,770
If the Noxon demons killed
Christy and Billie's parents,

82
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,981
somebody else had to
send them to do it.

83
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,984
Because they were originally after
the Magic School kids, right?

84
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,946
Right. So why change their m. o.
Unless somebody told them to?

85
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,574
Whoever it is that's after the key
to the Ultimate Power.

86
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,367
Do you think they were really
after Christy?

87
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,453
Absolutely, which means
the Noxons know who's behind it all.

88
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,331
And maybe who we'll have to fight
to get Leo back.

89
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,084
So, what's the plan?

90
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,753
We're going to find
that genetic freak of a demon,

91
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,340
and tell him we'll do to him what
we did to his friend unless he talks.

92
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,634
What can I do, besides ponder
the state of my marriage?

93
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,429
You need to go to the underworld
and see if you can find him.

94
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,349
- Done.
- Be careful.

95
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,364
What have we here?

96
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,326
Who are you?

97
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,954
- Stay back.
- Or what?

98
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:14,875
She's not just clutching your leg,
she's clutching your powers.

99
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,962
It'll come in handy
when I feed off of you.

100
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,470
What's a low-level demon like you
doing in this neck of the underworld?

101
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,222
I'm not low-level.

102
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,392
I'm working with the Triad.

103
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,479
- The Triad?
- Yeah, yeah.

104
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:38,065
I'm helping them harness the
Ultimate Power, so if you're smart...

105
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:42,402
- The Triad's dead.
- Right. Exactly.

106
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,820
Which means I'm the only one left

107
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,114
who knows where to find
the Ultimate Power.

108
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,825
Release me and all the power
in the world is yours, I promise.

109
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,953
Well, why don't you get it
for yourself?

110
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,748
The power has yet to emerge.
Till it does, I must hide.

111
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,709
Demons are after me,
and powerful witches.

112
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,753
The Charmed Ones.

113
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,797
I'm telling the truth, I swear.

114
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:06,635
Well, seeing as how you're
so neatly tied up at the moment,

115
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:11,223
I think I'll just leave you here,
see who comes looking.

116
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:15,727
No. Come back. They'll find me!

117
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,229
<i>I'm telling you, I found him.</i>

118
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,942
I found you a match and
he could be the man of your dreams.

119
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,779
Phoebe, hello?
Am I making myself clear?

120
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,407
Hello, I'm working.
Do you see me working?

121
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,076
Yeah, yeah, so am I.

122
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,745
- How about Michael?
- Coop.

123
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,707
Also happens to be the style editor
at your paper, no less.

124
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,667
Which probably makes him gay,
okay?

125
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,962
- I know who he is, and no, thank you.
- He's not gay.

126
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,256
Trust me, I wouldn't be
setting you up with him.

127
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,592
So why don't you go out
with him, huh?

128
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,804
Well, maybe because I don't like
to date people at the workplace.

129
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,681
Did you ever think of that?

130
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,850
Yeah. Yeah, of course
I thought about that.

131
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,311
I think about everything
when it comes to matchmaking.

132
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:04,193
Besides, you met Jason at work,
and Leslie, and Dex.

133
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,778
Yeah, and those
didn't go too well for me, did they?

134
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,531
Yeah, but not because
you worked with them.

135
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,992
It's because of, you know,
other reasons.

136
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,245
Anyway, I'm not asking you
to marry the guy, just go out with him.

137
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,123
Let me see how close I am
to figuring you out.

138
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,250
What have you got to lose?
Take a risk.

139
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,503
It's just the whole process,
you know?

140
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,797
Like dating and then
opening up to someone

141
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,383
and then having to tell them
that I'm a witch, them fainting.

142
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,010
It's just not fun.

143
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,305
You are so confusing to me.
I don't get it.

144
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,516
First you tell me you don't
wanna date magical beings,

145
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,851
and then you don't wanna
date mortals. Who's left?

146
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,145
Yeah, yeah, it's not funny.

147
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,315
You have any idea how hard it is
to find a match for you, Phoebe?

148
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:46,360
You are a smart, successful,
gorgeous woman

149
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,488
with a great sense of humour
and an amazing strength.

150
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:53,075
And look at you,
you're lounging around in a tracksuit

151
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,578
with a pencil in your hair,
and glasses and...

152
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,581
You're so beautiful.

153
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,837
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

154
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:09,591
I'm just, you know, trying to see
what Michael sees in you.

155
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,677
Or would see in you,
if you'd go out with the guy.

156
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,680
Okay, but what about my column?
And everything Piper's going through?

157
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,350
I mean, doesn't love
pale in comparison to all of that?

158
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,770
No, you don't get it. I don't know
how many times I need to tell you.

159
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,898
Love doesn't pale
in comparison to anything.

160
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,443
It makes the world turn
and the flowers grow...

161
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,948
Okay, smart aleck, do me a favour.

162
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,951
Just be open next time
love comes knocking, okay?

163
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,127
Hope it's not my sister.

164
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,630
Oh, hey, sweetie, how are you?

165
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,799
Hi, I've been better.

166
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,760
You look exhausted. Come in.

167
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,182
- I'm going to be prepping Michael.
- Okay.

168
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,184
So how was it?

169
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,603
Oh, just about
as good as a funeral can be.

170
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,230
I just... Can I hang out here?
I don't wanna be alone right now.

171
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:09,026
Of course you can, yeah. You can
stay here as long as you want.

172
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:22,414
Hey. Okay, so I found the Noxon,
but we better hurry, in case he moves.

173
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,708
Well, you might want
to call Henry first.

174
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,460
He's called three times
since you left.

175
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,504
Yeah, he called my cell,
you know, left a message.

176
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,214
But I'll get him when I come back.

177
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:33,842
So now you're avoiding
his phone calls? Paige.

178
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,470
No, I'm not avoiding him,
but I told you,

179
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,223
I don't really know
what to say to him yet.

180
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,933
Besides,
it's not his problem, it's mine.

181
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,978
Well, it is his problem
if you're not taking his calls.

182
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,064
Do you want to let this demon
get away or what?

183
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:51,193
Okay, fine. Just let my years
of marriage experience go to waste.

184
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,862
- Fine, let's go. Here.
- Go where?

185
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,075
Oh, hey, Christy.
How are you doing?

186
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,327
- I'm not doing very well.
- Where's Billie?

187
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,287
She's back at her dorm room,
she's resting.

188
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:05,499
That's weird, Phoebe just called
and said she was at her apartment.

189
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,001
I see.

190
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,879
So where are you on finding
the demon you let kill my parents?

191
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,298
Whoa, hang on.
We didn't let anybody kill...

192
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,592
Actually, we found him,
but if we don't wanna lose him,

193
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,178
- we need to go right now.
- All right, well, then I'm going.

194
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,640
But I get to be the one who sends
his sorry ass to the astral plane.

195
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:22,850
Actually, no.

196
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,977
We don't wanna vanquish him,
we need to question him.

197
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,354
It's more important
to find out who put him up to this.

198
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,649
Who cares? Who wants
to talk to him? I want him dead.

199
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,443
I understand that,
but we can't ignore the fact

200
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,822
that this could be connected
to something else, like saving Leo.

201
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,867
So that's what this is about,
saving your husband.

202
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,535
Well, yeah, but...

203
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,662
If we don't vanquish him,
he could escape.

204
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:48,250
Well, I realise that, but we need to
get some information out of him first.

205
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,127
Let's go.

206
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:58,635
What are you doing?

207
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,470
I'm not gonna let you take this
away from me.

208
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,556
You shouldn't be here.
The demons are after you.

209
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,142
- I don't care.
- Look, stop it.

210
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:08,812
We're not gonna let him get away.
You need to just back off.

211
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,149
- Gosh.
- Okay, listen, you have one chance

212
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:15,736
and one chance only to tell me
who sent you and why.

213
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,364
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- The hell you don't!

214
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,787
- Say the spell.
- No!

215
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,499
- Say it!
- Stop it.

216
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:34,838
<i>Demon of fire, demon of pain
I banish you to the astral...</i>

217
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,766
Looks like you were telling the truth.

218
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,436
Damn it.

219
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:54,066
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

220
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,734
It's not me I'm worried about.

221
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,917
I knew he would get away!

222
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,585
Christy, just let me heal you, okay?

223
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,629
Right! After she just tried to kill me?

224
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,298
I didn't try to kill you,
it was an accident.

225
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,925
That was no accident.

226
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:24,096
Okay, listen, you're right. It wasn't.
But I didn't mean to hurt you, okay?

227
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,890
- I just couldn't let you vanquish him.
- Well, now he got away.

228
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,226
Look, Christy,
you didn't leave me a choice, okay?

229
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,270
This is my husband,
and that demon...

230
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,896
Killed my parents!

231
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,274
Why am I even explaining this
to you?

232
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,609
- It's not like you care.
- Of course we care.

233
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,279
We care about you
and we care about Billie.

234
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,780
Billie's been like a sister to us.

235
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,782
Well, Billie's not your sister.

236
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:47,744
- Christy, please...
- Look, just stay away from me.

237
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,581
And stay away from Billie.

238
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,961
Well, that went swimmingly.

239
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,630
There was nothing else I could do.
Right?

240
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,174
No, you did what you had to do.

241
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,135
Still, I don't expect her
to understand.

242
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,012
She doesn't know Leo
and she barely knows us

243
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,680
and all she wants is revenge.

244
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,098
- Can you blame her?
- No.

245
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,310
But it doesn't mean anything.
We still have to find the Noxon again.

246
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:14,646
- We'll just figure out who took him.
- Okay, I'll check the "Book. "

247
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:22,279
- It's Phoebe. I'll fill her in.
- You know where to find me.

248
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,032
- Hello.
- Any luck with Leo?

249
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,035
No, but we did manage successfully
to get Christy to hate us.

250
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,955
- What? How?
- Well, we were going after the...

251
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,500
Hold on a second, okay?

252
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,336
- Hello?
- Hi, Paige. Where have you been?

253
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:43,008
Hey, hi, honey.
Just kind of a bad demon fight.

254
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,802
<i>- Can you hold on a second?
- Wh...?</i>

255
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,181
- Pheebs, that's Henry.
- Okay, so quick, what happened?

256
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:52,267
Christy wanted to vanquish the Noxon,
but we needed to talk to him...

257
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,853
<i>- Wait, you found the Noxon?
- Kind of, sort of.</i>

258
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,564
He got away,
but that was only after...

259
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,025
Okay, this is gonna take a minute.
Hold on a sec.

260
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,320
Hey, can I call you back?

261
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:06,490
No, that's why I'm calling you, because
you haven't called me back yet.

262
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,536
Yes, okay, I'm sorry about that.

263
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,120
Paige, are you mad at me?

264
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,206
Did I do something
that I don't know I did?

265
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:18,210
No, I'm not mad at you, not at all.
It's just...

266
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:19,837
What, what, what?

267
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,216
Hold on a second.

268
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:26,510
Phoebe, forget about Christy.

269
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,388
What I really need your help with
is Henry.

270
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,182
- Phoebe?
- Still me, Paige.

271
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,355
<i>- What is going on? Talk to me.
- Nothing, it's nothing.</i>

272
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,567
It's really nothing.
It's just... You're completely perfect.

273
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,236
You are. Can I call you later?

274
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,738
That would really be the best thing.
Okay, I'll do that. Bye.

275
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,950
- Phoebe?
- Yeah.

276
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,996
I need professional help.
Can I borrow your Cupid?

277
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,039
<i>A little help here, please.</i>

278
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,794
Creo! Where are you?

279
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,132
- Sorry, I was looking for the Noxon.
- Well, you're a little late.

280
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,925
The Charmed Ones
already found him.

281
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,219
What happened?

282
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,971
Piper attacked me.

283
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,515
I followed her to the Noxon,
she wouldn't let me vanquish him.

284
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,268
But you're not supposed
to vanquish him.

285
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:20,647
We need him to turn your sister
against the Charmed Ones.

286
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,192
Yeah, I know. I know.

287
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:29,448
But I was upset, okay?
He killed my parents.

288
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,658
But now you need to focus
on your sister.

289
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,411
And that wound just might help.

290
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,456
It could help to convince her
that the Charmed Ones are truly bad.

291
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,958
I don't know,
she's pretty attached to them.

292
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,462
All the more reason to try and save her
from them as soon as possible,

293
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,464
as the Triad said you must.

294
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:51,011
They're using her, Christy.
You know that.

295
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,515
And you also know that the two of you
are the only ones who can stop them.

296
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,183
Do you really think so?

297
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:59,603
It is your destiny.
One that you will not fulfil

298
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,773
unless you get your sister away
from them by any means necessary.

299
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,317
Well, you better get to the Noxon
before they do,

300
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,487
or you'll have to come up
with another plan.

301
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:13,992
I'll worry about finding the Noxon.
You worry about saving Billie.

302
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:28,757
I must confess, you're far
more valuable than I imagined.

303
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,759
Let me go.

304
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:33,303
I wasn't lying about
the Ultimate Power. I proved...

305
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,181
Then I should be able to fetch
a high price for you.

306
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:37,766
They'll come back for me.

307
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,310
- It's just a matter of time.
- I doubt that.

308
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,813
My lair is a labyrinth
of secluded caves.

309
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:46,108
I should be safe long enough
to figure out what to do with you.

310
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,861
But we aren't dealing
with ordinary witches.

311
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:52,197
- The Charmed Ones...
- Make you all the more valuable.

312
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,366
I could trade you
for immunity from them.

313
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:59,204
Or perhaps I could sell you to demons
in exchange for powers.

314
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,206
The possibilities are limitless.

315
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:26,106
Come on, seriously, what's the harm
in asking Phoebe out one more time?

316
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,318
Look, I don't think she's into me.
I don't want to push it.

317
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,779
See that? You're being sensitive.
Phoebe loves sensitive.

318
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:36,241
Yeah, then how come she has
an excuse every time I ask her out?

319
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,077
- She's just playing hard to get.
- Really hard to get.

320
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,581
Come on, isn't she worth it, huh?

321
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:45,876
- Caring, funny, talented.
- Hot.

322
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:52,299
You can't say "hot. "
Women want romance, poetry.

323
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,968
See, I'm not much of a poet.

324
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,639
You don't have to be.
All right? Just think about Phoebe

325
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,266
and let the poetry come to you
from what you see.

326
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,560
She's ethereal, you know.

327
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:09,691
Rose-petal lips, slender neck,
fiery, passionate eyes.

328
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:12,402
And when she laughs, I mean,

329
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,738
doesn't that just make you feel
like you can fly?

330
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,740
Maybe you should ask her out.

331
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:20,619
Me? No. No.
Come on, it's against the rules.

332
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,163
Then maybe you ought to go work
for another dating service.

333
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,291
You're missing the whole point.

334
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,127
You wanna go out with a woman
like Phoebe, you can't just ask her out.

335
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,129
You have to woo her.

336
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,298
I don't usually woo.

337
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,843
Well, you're gonna have to
if you wanna go out with her.

338
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,845
It's easy, I'll walk you through it.

339
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:42,057
Meet me at Phoebe's house
with a dozen red roses, long-stemmed.

340
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,517
Trust me.

341
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,313
What are you doing here?
Come on, go, chop-chop.

342
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,023
What are you waiting for?

343
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,029
Coop, I need to talk to you.

344
00:19:56,196 --> 00:20:00,200
- Kind of in the middle of something.
- Okay, but it's kind of an emergency.

345
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,953
What? What do you mean,
did something happen to Phoebe?

346
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,997
No, no, no.
Nothing happened to Phoebe.

347
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:07,249
It's an emergency of me.

348
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,587
Well, the Elders didn't really
send me down here

349
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,214
to work with the whole family.

350
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,718
Look, please?
I really need your expertise, Coop.

351
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:21,054
How much help could you need
after only two weeks of marriage?

352
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,848
Henry keep leaving
the toilet seat up?

353
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,726
No, it's not Henry.

354
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,686
It's me, okay? It's me.

355
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:30,230
I'm so used to having
my own identity,

356
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,815
you know,
and being super independent,

357
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:36,570
and now it's not just a "me," it's a "we,"
and I'm kind of freaking out on that,

358
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,864
and I'm taking it out on him
and I can't do that.

359
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,825
It will work itself out.
You've talked to him about this, right?

360
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:44,620
I've tried to talk to him about it,
but it just comes out wrong.

361
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,371
Paige...

362
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:51,752
...I'm really busy here,
so give it some time.

363
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,047
I don't have time, okay?
I really, really don't.

364
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,049
Isn't there something you can do?

365
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,052
Oh, yeah, there is one thing.

366
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,721
What? Please, I'm open to anything.

367
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,350
All right, you got it.

368
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:18,403
<i>- Henry?
- Paige?</i>

369
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,155
Where are you?

370
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,116
<i>- That's a very good question.
- I know.</i>

371
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:26,036
<i>Oh, no. Okay, go to a mirror.</i>

372
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,539
<i>- Mir... Why?
- Please, just do this.</i>

373
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,417
Why do I have to look...?

374
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,254
- What the...?
- Oh, God.

375
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:38,590
- I'm in your head.
- I can see that.

376
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:40,717
Paige, what's going on?

377
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:42,928
Coop!

378
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:12,791
Michael? Hey.
What are you doing here?

379
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,586
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm wooing you.

380
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:19,298
- You're what?
- Well, you deserve it, don't you?

381
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,675
And you're not just anyone,
you're special.

382
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:24,011
You're not just anybody,
you're special.

383
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,054
- You're one in a million.
- One in a million.

384
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,307
I'm not leaving here
until I get you to go out with me.

385
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:31,101
And I'm not giving up
until I get you to go out with me.

386
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:36,523
Wow, Michael, I had no idea
you were such a romantic.

387
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,483
- No, I'm not.
- I'm hot.

388
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,527
I'm sorry, you're what?

389
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:42,613
No, I'm not.

390
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,158
No, I mean, I'm not.

391
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,161
I'm not really a romantic.

392
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:53,832
Romantic. Really. It's just that...

393
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,335
- You bring it out in me.
"... you" bring it out in me.

394
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,838
- Every time I see you, every...
- Every time you walk past.

395
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:03,759
Every time you walk past.
You're all I ever think about.

396
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:06,470
And it's been that way
from the moment I laid eyes on you.

397
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:08,180
The way you walk,
the way you smile.

398
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:10,849
The way you walk,
the way you smile.

399
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:12,392
How you help so many
with your words.

400
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,394
The way you help so many
with your words.

401
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:18,357
I knew I had to do everything I could
to get you to go out with me.

402
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:21,193
- And that's why I'm here now,
- That's why I'm here now,

403
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,864
- hoping that you can't turn me down.
- Hoping you can't turn me down.

404
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,908
I don't know what to say.

405
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:29,743
Just say yes.

406
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:32,246
Say yes.

407
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,043
Well?

408
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:41,213
- You know what, I have to go.
- Wait, but...

409
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,715
Listen, thank you so much for coming,
it means so much to me

410
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,926
and will you leave the flowers
by the door?

411
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,761
- Yeah.
- Okay.

412
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,058
- What now?
- Just keep trying.

413
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:57,229
She's worth it. Believe me.

414
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,648
Come on.

415
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,902
What's going on?

416
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,613
I don't know.

417
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,327
- Christy, hey, what's wrong?
- Billie, I need to talk to you.

418
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:16,123
- What happened to you?
- Piper attacked me.

419
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,833
What?

420
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,294
Okay, you know what, come in
and we're gonna talk about this.

421
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,131
No, I'm not coming in.
Billie's coming out.

422
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:34,975
I still don't know why
you didn't let Paige just heal you.

423
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,436
Oh, right, after what Piper did to me,
I don't think so.

424
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:40,355
But still... Okay, just please just stop

425
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,065
and just tell me
exactly what happened.

426
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,483
It's real simple, Billie.

427
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,321
I tried to kill the demon that killed Mom
and Dad, and she wouldn't let me.

428
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,990
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Does this make sense?

429
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,452
Listen to me, Piper is so obsessed
with saving her husband,

430
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:55,120
she doesn't care
who gets in her way.

431
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,997
But I don't believe
she'd ever hurt you.

432
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,833
- Yeah, well, believe it.
- I have to be missing something.

433
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,294
Fine, then let's go to the house,
you can ask them yourself.

434
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:04,129
No, I'll go. You're way too upset.

435
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:06,131
Billie, you can't trust them.

436
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:08,675
- That's not true.
- Oh, really?

437
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,345
Face it, they don't care
about what we want.

438
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:13,222
They care about what they want.

439
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:15,933
Let me just go back to the house
and talk to them myself.

440
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,311
Just meet me at the dorm, okay?
Please.

441
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,483
I still don't understand why
you couldn't just talk to me.

442
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,110
- Why did you have to use magic?
- Well, I didn't mean to.

443
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,988
I don't have time to talk about this
right now, I have to go help Piper.

444
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:32,574
You should have thought about that
before you jumped in my head.

445
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:35,452
I didn't jump in your head.
Coop put me in there!

446
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:38,080
Right, right,
because you were losing yourself?

447
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:40,541
What does that even mean?

448
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,710
I thought things were going great
between us.

449
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:47,297
Hey, Paige,
I love being married to you, okay?

450
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:50,092
<i>And I love being married to you too.
That's the problem.</i>

451
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:52,010
How could that be a problem?

452
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,471
<i>Because I've never loved someone
so much before.</i>

453
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:59,518
<i>And I love you so much
that I'm afraid of losing me.</i>

454
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,776
But maybe you're gonna find
something new, like I did.

455
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:11,780
<i>- You did?
- Yeah.</i>

456
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,907
Isn't that the point of marriage?

457
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:16,660
<i>Henry, go to the mirror.</i>

458
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,872
Paige, I want you to stay
the woman that you are.

459
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:22,374
I fell in love with
the woman that you are.

460
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:25,878
But at the same time, I think
we can make each other stronger.

461
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,797
That was Coop's point too.

462
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,925
Sorry I snapped at you.

463
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,511
I'm sorry too,
my little baby, baby, baby...

464
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:38,432
- Baby, baby...
- You okay, Henry?

465
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:39,975
Dennis, I...

466
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:42,394
<i>- Trouble with the missus.
- Trouble with the missus.</i>

467
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:46,190
I guess that means I don't have to
listen to you gush about her for once.

468
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:48,775
<i>- You gush about me?
- Yeah, I do.</i>

469
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,069
No, you don't. You won't.

470
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,697
You checked in on time,
so now you can go.

471
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:56,867
And we'll see you
the same time tomorrow. Great.

472
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:58,994
Yeah, right.

473
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:02,789
- Yeah, see you.
- Okay. Get home safe.

474
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:09,254
We have to do something
about this, fast.

475
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:12,007
<i>I couldn't agree more.</i>

476
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:19,848
- Whoa.
- "Whoa" yourself. How'd you do that?

477
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:22,017
<i>Ask if they've had any luck
finding the Noxon.</i>

478
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:25,395
Hold it a second. I think it'll be easier
if I just talk to them myself, honey.

479
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,356
Honey? Are you okay?

480
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:32,277
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.
- No, you're not and neither am I.</i>

481
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,321
Why are you talking to yourself?

482
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:37,199
No, I'm not. Paige is in my head.

483
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,035
<i>Tell her I went to Coop for advice.</i>

484
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:42,287
Please, I can handle this, Paige.

485
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,581
<i>- Sorry.
- Coop did it.</i>

486
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:48,627
Coop did it.
Of course he did. Great.

487
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:50,212
Well, you need to get him to undo it,

488
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:52,548
because we need the power of three
to find the Noxon.

489
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:55,384
<i>I might be able to do it from here.</i>

490
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:59,054
Paige thinks that she... Headache.

491
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:02,683
Paige thinks that she might be able
to do it from where she is.

492
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:13,318
- Billie.
- We need to talk.

493
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:16,321
I know, I'm sorry about your sister,
but how are you?

494
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:19,408
How am I? I'm not so good.
How could you attack my sister?

495
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:21,451
She didn't leave me
much of a choice.

496
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:22,911
She was gonna
vanquish the demon.

497
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:24,621
You just thought
you'd vanquish her too?

498
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:27,082
- No, I didn't.
- Look, we know how you feel,

499
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,251
but revenge is not
the only thing right now.

500
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,336
That's what Christy said.

501
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:34,173
Look, I wanna find Leo too.
I really, really do.

502
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,049
But not at the expense of her.

503
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,010
Okay, well, then she needs
to understand

504
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:40,262
that it can't all be about
what she wants.

505
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,556
Right, because it seems to be
all about what you want.

506
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,474
- That's not fair.
- Isn't it?

507
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:47,019
Okay, look, don't you wanna figure out
who killed your parents?

508
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:48,979
Yes, I do, but that's not
what you care about.

509
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:50,814
All you guys care about
is finding Leo.

510
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:53,984
- You don't care about me.
- Billie, what are you doing?

511
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:55,360
I'm gonna vanquish the Noxon.

512
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:58,071
- No, you're not.
- Are you gonna blow me up too?

513
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,990
<i>Hold out your hand
and call for the vial.</i>

514
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,909
Nobody's blowing anyone up here.

515
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:04,119
<i>- That didn't stop her last time.
- Now.</i>

516
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:05,871
Vial.

517
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:09,833
That was cool.

518
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,509
Billie, you come back here.

519
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:22,930
Now what do we do?

520
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:26,016
We gotta find that demon
before they do.

521
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,565
Is everything okay?

522
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:36,026
You were right. We are on our own.

523
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,330
- Any luck?
- No, nothing.

524
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:50,582
There's tons of potions to take us
to the underworld,

525
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:54,461
but nothing on the Noxon.
Are you scared about being here?

526
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:56,463
This place is usually crawling
with demons.

527
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,798
I think between the two of us,

528
00:29:57,965 --> 00:29:59,508
we have enough power
to defend ourselves.

529
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:02,719
Besides, we can't count
on anyone else.

530
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:05,055
So we don't have any other choice,
do we?

531
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:08,559
Yeah, I guess,
but it's still kind of creepy.

532
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,229
<i>Do you know where he is?</i>

533
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:15,107
<i>No, but I'm afraid the Charmed Ones
are close to figuring it out.</i>

534
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:18,402
<i>- Well, what if they find him first?
- You'll know where to find him too.</i>

535
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:21,280
<i>If you use your powers
to follow them,</i>

536
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,490
<i>it may be your only chance
to save her from them.</i>

537
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,831
It's no use, there's nothing here.
What are we gonna do?

538
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:35,586
- I wonder...
- What?

539
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:39,840
Maybe I can listen in on them,
see if they found him yet.

540
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,509
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

541
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,094
I mean, if it's okay with you.

542
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:46,263
Yeah, why not?

543
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:53,312
<i>Ancient powers, we summon thee
We, the power of three</i>

544
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:58,358
<i>And seek your help in finding
The demon who is in hiding</i>

545
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,570
- Nothing.
- I'm sorry, guys, I think it's my fault.

546
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:04,239
<i>Maybe I should try saying it again.</i>

547
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,908
Paige thinks that maybe
she should try...

548
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:09,286
Forget it. We need to
get her out of there. Call him.

549
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:12,080
Do I have to?

550
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,419
Okay. Cupid!

551
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:21,507
Look, I know you're out there,
watching everything I do.

552
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:23,175
Coop!

553
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:25,010
<i>Oh, lift me from the grass</i>

554
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,930
<i>I fail, I die,</i>

555
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:31,266
<i>But thy loving kisses
Rain on my lips.</i>

556
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:34,520
- What are you doing?
- I'm just reciting what Michael wrote.

557
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:35,979
He left this for you at the door.

558
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:37,189
- Really?
- Yeah.

559
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:39,149
Yeah, never mind that, we need...

560
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,443
<i>My heart beats loud and fast</i>

561
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:46,198
<i>Oh, press it to thine own again,
Where it shall break at last</i>

562
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,367
Michael didn't write this.

563
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,370
Yeah, you're right.

564
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:53,497
I wrote that a couple
of hundred years ago or so.

565
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:55,541
Some of my best work.

566
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:02,381
Yeah, okay, listen,
we need your help.

567
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,050
You gotta get Paige out of Henry.

568
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,136
Yeah, but are you sure
they worked through their issues?

569
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,513
Yes, they have.

570
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:11,890
All right.

571
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:18,355
Oh, dear.

572
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:22,025
- Hey.
- Hey, you okay?

573
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:23,652
- I'm okay.
- Good.

574
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:26,238
But you should probably go.

575
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:28,699
All right. Good luck.

576
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:33,579
Well, you should probably go too.

577
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:36,540
- What about love?
- Go!

578
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:43,755
- I mean, really.
- Oh, you got truffles.

579
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:45,257
Yes, I did.

580
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:47,092
- Okay.
- Okay.

581
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:52,014
<i>Ancient powers, we summon thee
We, the power of three</i>

582
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:56,226
<i>And seek your help in finding
The demon who is in hiding</i>

583
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:57,644
They found him.

584
00:32:57,811 --> 00:33:00,647
Hurry, throw the potion
while I'm still channelling them.

585
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:07,571
Oh, no, you don't!

586
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:16,121
What happened? What's going on?

587
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:19,124
You have exactly
five seconds to live

588
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,460
unless you tell us
who you're working for.

589
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:23,295
I don't know
what you're talking about.

590
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:25,047
- Four.
- Three.

591
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:26,965
- Two.
- All right, all right.

592
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:28,675
- I'll talk.
- Not so fast.

593
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,554
- Leave him alone, he's ours.
- Ours?

594
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:35,224
- Billie, we're all on the same side.
- Are we?

595
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,809
- We're not letting you vanquish him.
- Works for me.

596
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:40,062
And we're not gonna let you
take him alive, either.

597
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:43,148
This is absurd. What are you doing?

598
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:44,858
Why are you twisting
what we're all about?

599
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:46,276
She's not twisting anything.

600
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,612
She's the one that tore me away
from protecting my parents

601
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,697
so she wouldn't bother
the two of you.

602
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:53,075
Billie, I swear,
if I knew what would happen...

603
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:55,828
You would have used me
the same way to get what you wanted.

604
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:58,622
And I'm sick of being used.

605
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:04,920
<i>- No.
- We don't need the potion.</i>

606
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:06,171
What do you mean?

607
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:08,757
<i>You can use your power
to amplify mine.</i>

608
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:10,342
What's going on?

609
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:39,246
Okay, did they just vanquish
the demon that can't be vanquished?

610
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:40,789
What does that mean?

611
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:44,042
I think that means we just found
the Ultimate Power.

612
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:59,892
- Hey.
- Hey.

613
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:03,520
- Tough day at the office?
- Oh, well, you know,

614
00:35:04,021 --> 00:35:08,525
you let a young witch into your family,
teach her everything that you know,

615
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:11,028
only to be betrayed by her.

616
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:12,613
Yeah, it was a rough day.

617
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:15,365
I guess love is pretty low
on the list, then, huh?

618
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:17,910
Actually, no.

619
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:20,037
I mean, it can only
make me stronger, right?

620
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:21,872
Yeah.

621
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:26,001
There's something I want to tell you,

622
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:29,213
but I'm not sure if
I will be able to articulate it well.

623
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,637
Maybe I can help.

624
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:39,139
No, actually, it's something
that I have to say.

625
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:41,016
And that you have to hear.

626
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:44,978
I've been having these feelings,

627
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:50,317
these really intense feelings
that I haven't had for a really long time.

628
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:52,945
And it's scary,

629
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:57,699
mostly because the person
that I'm having these feelings for

630
00:35:57,866 --> 00:35:59,284
is so unexpected.

631
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:04,081
I don't know if it can work.

632
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:09,169
But you gotta
follow your heart, right?

633
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:16,301
You tell me.

634
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:20,556
God, it has got to suck to be Cupid.

635
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:23,767
You know, never finding a love
of your own,

636
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:26,144
it's gotta be so hard for you.

637
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:27,980
I'm sorry, what?

638
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:29,815
You know, because of all
the rules and stuff,

639
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:32,568
it's just I would think
it's gotta be really hard.

640
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:37,072
So you were talking about
you and?

641
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:38,991
Michael.

642
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:41,410
Yeah. Yeah, who else
would I be talking about?

643
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:47,583
No. You know, you just made it sound
like it was someone unexpected.

644
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:51,545
Well, yeah, you know,
I don't wanna be with anyone magical,

645
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:55,007
just because of everything
that I've gone through in my life.

646
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:56,842
Yeah, what changed your mind?

647
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:03,265
I think maybe watching what
Paige and Henry are going through

648
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:05,225
and how they're making it work,

649
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,104
and honestly, you.

650
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,732
I mean, you knew.

651
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:15,235
You had to hear the things that
he was saying to me on the balcony.

652
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:17,946
They were just so sweet.

653
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:20,407
Actually...

654
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,538
Yeah, I always knew
he had it in him.

655
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:30,083
I guess that's why
you picked him for me, huh?

656
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:34,671
Yup. It sure is.

657
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:39,426
So I guess my work here is done.
Guess I better get going.

658
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:53,023
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

659
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:56,693
No. It was my pleasure.

660
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:03,242
- Good luck, huh?
- Bye.

661
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:43,949
Hey. It's gonna be okay, you know.

662
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:47,744
Oh, yeah? I'm not so sure.

663
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:51,915
It was right there in front of us
the entire time and we didn't see it.

664
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:56,086
How were we supposed to see it?
It's Billie. She's one of us.

665
00:38:56,253 --> 00:39:00,465
Still, with Christy and their powers,
the Triad.

666
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:03,886
We just missed it.
And now I hope it's not too late.

667
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:10,350
Not too late for what, exactly?

668
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:12,811
To stop them.

669
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:15,898
No. No, Piper.
We can't vanquish them.

670
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:17,608
They're not demons, they're people.

671
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:22,571
People the Triad targeted
to take us out.

672
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:24,990
- You don't know that for sure.
- Don't I? Think about it.

673
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:26,533
It makes complete sense.

674
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,870
I can't give up on Billie.
I'm not gonna give up on Billie, not yet.

675
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:32,498
She's been through so much,
they both have.

676
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,374
Maybe they'll come around.

677
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:40,506
I have to go. Henry's waiting for me.

678
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:44,968
Look, we're gonna figure this out,
okay? It's what we do.

679
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:47,888
We'd better.

680
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:05,697
It's just you and me now, sis...

681
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:09,535
...and it always will be.
