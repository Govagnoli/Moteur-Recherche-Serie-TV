0
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,229
Look at me. I am a fashion blunder.
A Mademoiselle "don't."

1
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,509
- Oh, my God. You lost your powers?
- Can't lose what you never had.

2
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,998
I hate when she plays astral games.

3
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,310
- Marco.
- Polo.

4
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,917
- What were you doing down there?
- Practicing.

5
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,311
Trying to use telekinesis
in astral mode.

6
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,676
Witch exercises. Since when?

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,119
Since I studied up on Belthazor.

8
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,635
The Triad couldn't have sent us
a worse demon.

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,751
Or one with worse skin.

10
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,076
I would hate to find myself
alone with this guy.

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,879
Yeah, well, you wouldn't last long.
None of us would.

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,679
That's why I'm trying to teach
my astral self how to fight.

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,396
- I have a date with Cole.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

14
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,238
It's a lunch date.

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,994
- So?
- So it's not a good sign.

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,116
Lunch is a cheap imitation of dinner.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,317
That's why it has
its own special menu.

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,914
And, you know, we kissed last week.
We should be on to dinner

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,548
- and candlelight by now.
- Well, may...

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,715
I can't believe you haven't
taken care of that tooth.

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,950
Yeah, well, I have a dentist
appointment in an hour.

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,190
Good. I hate to see you
so miserable.

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,192
Me too.

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,517
Stop right there, please.

25
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,317
Okay, come ahead.

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,671
That way. There we go.

27
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,039
Go ahead.

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,153
- Hello?
- Hey, did you cast any

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,635
- "give me a sign" spells lately?
- No, why?

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,109
I don't know, it just seems
like somebody's dropping signs

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,111
right in front of me. Literally.

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,397
Okay, Prue, you need to ignore the
signs and get yourself in to a dentist.

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,192
Yeah, I know.

34
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,112
Hold it.

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,474
Hello, Prue?

36
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,551
I'll call you back.

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,514
Excuse me.

38
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,399
- You're with Social Services, right?
- No, why?

39
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,232
The guy won't come out
of his loft up there.

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,755
And we're supposed to start
demolition today.

41
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,474
- Someone still lives here?
- Well, if you can call it that.

42
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,831
Poor guy says he hasn't
stepped outside in four years.

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,077
Hello?

44
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,274
Close the door, go away.

45
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,998
I just wanna talk.

46
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,470
Please go away.

47
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,470
No. Don't...
Don't come any closer.

48
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,559
- Are you hurt?
- My head.

49
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,792
It's exploding.

50
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,432
- The pain, you're letting it in.
- What pain?

51
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,878
Everyone's pain.
From the city, the streets.

52
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,909
I feel it. I feel all of it.

53
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,231
I won't hurt you.

54
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,719
You are hurting me.

55
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,475
Your pity, it's like razors inside.

56
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,877
- Please, I can...
- Oh, your tooth. I feel your tooth.

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,596
All your pain. I can't stand it.

58
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,031
Why didn't you just go
when I asked?

59
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,389
I just can't believe you
introduced me as "a friend."

60
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,155
Okay, social malfunction. I hadn't
seen the woman in years. I'm sorry.

61
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,588
I lost my wings for you.

62
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,520
You know, I've hurled my body
into the path of oncoming demons.

63
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,075
You wanted heaven,
I took you there, literally.

64
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,878
I am more than a friend.

65
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,270
I know, but if I had introduced
you as my fiancé,

66
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,668
she would've asked how we met,

67
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,637
when we're getting married,
where my ring is,

68
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,552
questions that I can't answer,
now can I?

69
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,997
I suppose that's how
I became a doctor too.

70
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,912
Leo, that's what you were.

71
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,672
Look, what am I supposed
to tell people,

72
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,398
that I'm engaged to a whitelighter?

73
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,071
Sometimes being magical kind of
takes the magic right out of things.

74
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,909
- Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
- Oh, come on. Don't you sometimes?

75
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,871
Every now and then, I just wanna feel
what it's like to live in the real world.

76
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,673
Hey.

77
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,519
What are you two doing together?

78
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,436
- Cole pulled up behind me.
- Good timing.

79
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,951
Hey, look, it's my lunch date.

80
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,199
Sorry I'm late. I got held up on a case.
You look amazing.

81
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,396
It's all part of my master plan.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,468
Phoebe, I wanted to talk to you
about the signs...

83
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,519
The assignment that we were
talking about on the phone.

84
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,400
- Where did it lead?
- To this incredibly tragic guy

85
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,835
who's scared to leave his own home,
which might be okay

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,958
- if it weren't about to be torn down.
- Was there a social worker there?

87
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,634
No, but I was told that a deputy
was going there to evict him,

88
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,279
and he has no place to go.

89
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,595
Let me make a call,

90
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,552
- see what I can do.
- Kitchen.

91
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,839
Thank you.

92
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,072
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

93
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,958
We agreed no more Triad reports,
not until my plan succeeds.

94
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,839
I can't be associated with
any more failed attempts.

95
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,912
- Phoebe.
- Hey.

96
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,959
I just need some aspirin.
Prue has a toothache.

97
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,358
Water.

98
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,953
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

99
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,032
Just got disconnected.

100
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,833
Prue followed my signs.

101
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,313
The plan will work. If it doesn't,
then you can rat me out to the Triad.

102
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,554
Based on everything you said,

103
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,756
it sounds like your shut-in's
a future empath.

104
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,957
An empath?
And me without my dictionary.

105
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,079
They're mortals who can actually feel
what other people feel.

106
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,038
It's a rare gift. When they die,

107
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,555
they often return to Earth
as empaths,

108
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,594
where they blend into society
as counsellors, elders, teachers.

109
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,076
They use their sensitivity
to guide mortals,

110
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,191
ease their pain, even heal them.

111
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,872
No, I don't think this guy
would look at it as a gift.

112
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,917
He's one big, raw nerve ending.

113
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,514
You should've seen how
he reacted to my toothache.

114
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,272
Well, it could be
he's rejecting his gift,

115
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,670
fighting the emotions he feels
instead of embracing them.

116
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,155
Well, he sure sounds
like an innocent to me.

117
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,920
It'd be a shame to lose a future
empath and all the good he'll do.

118
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,719
I care less about his afterlife
than his current one.

119
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,509
I know what it's like to receive a power
that you just do not understand.

120
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,513
What I don't understand is who
sent the signs that you followed?

121
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,711
It's hard to say, it could be them,
it could be...

122
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,353
Cole.

123
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,352
I got a guy at Housing Authority
who'll relocate your shut-in

124
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,835
if he leaves voluntarily.

125
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,431
- Here's my card. Have him page me.
- Thanks. All right.

126
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,439
Prue, do you want us
to go with you?

127
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,074
No, this guy can barely deal
with one person, let alone three,

128
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,753
but thank you.

129
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,551
Okay then, ready for lunch?

130
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,320
Lunch would be great.
Would you mind if we join you?

131
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,318
I mean, it would be great. Two couples
on the town in the real world.

132
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,878
What could be greater?

133
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,438
It's up to you.

134
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,793
Why not?

135
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,074
No.

136
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,796
- No! I have to get out.
- It's okay, Father Thomas. Relax.

137
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,315
No, they're tearing it down.
I have to get there.

138
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,873
- Hold on now.
- No, please.

139
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,548
Let me go.
I have to get to that building.

140
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,756
I must protect the innocent.
Please!

141
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,717
To the apartment.
Protect the innocent.

142
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,030
- Let's go.
- Come on, Father.

143
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,032
A little help here!

144
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,672
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I know he's scared,

145
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,798
but I personally handed him
a final eviction notice two weeks ago.

146
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,952
Officer, please.

147
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,509
Cole Turner, assistant district
attorney, he knows the case

148
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,513
and he wants to help, but only
if I can keep this guy out of jail.

149
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,038
You got three minutes.

150
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,588
Thank you.

151
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,713
Hello.

152
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,674
Hey.

153
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,070
It's me again, Prue.

154
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,958
I took a pain reliever for my tooth.

155
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,111
The deputy downstairs told me
that your name's Vince.

156
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,432
- What's your last name?
- Misery.

157
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,828
Well, in that case,
would you like some company?

158
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,988
That's not funny.

159
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,715
Yeah. Neither is your situation.

160
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,473
Vince...

161
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,597
...you know that deputy is here
to arrest you for civil disobedience.

162
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,157
I'll die if they put me in jail.

163
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,232
I believe you.

164
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,153
That's why I came back
to find you a new home.

165
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,790
- But you have to leave with me now.
- I can't. Can't go outside.

166
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,953
Vince, I know what it's like.

167
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,879
I know what it's like to have
a gift that you can't control,

168
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,752
that you never asked for.

169
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,229
And living with that is hard,
really hard...

170
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,675
Don't tell me what's hard.

171
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,910
You avoid your pain. I feel it.

172
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,717
Right, then let's talk
about the blessings,

173
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,552
the rewards that come
with having that gift.

174
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,676
I mean, you can't even begin to...

175
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,991
Words, just empty words.

176
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,470
You don't feel them
in your heart. I know.

177
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,473
You feel fear

178
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,991
and panic,

179
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,355
because something's
coming for you.

180
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,476
Something you're afraid
you can't stop.

181
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,791
Are these the blessings you want
me to feel thankful for?

182
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,677
- I'm sorry.
- Yes, you are.

183
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,871
You are sorry.

184
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,632
And confused and afraid.

185
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,358
And it's drowning me alive.

186
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,632
Deputy. Time's up. Open the door.

187
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,400
Can't you see? This is not a gift.

188
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,429
This is a curse. I am cursed to feel
everything all the time from everyone.

189
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,876
I can't go outside that door,
not now, not ever.

190
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,314
I'm coming in.

191
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,549
Hey.

192
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,710
- How'd you do that?
- I was sent here to help you,

193
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,393
and that's what I'm gonna do.

194
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,636
Free the empath
Release his gift

195
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,751
Let his pain be cast adrift

196
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,834
What the hell's the matter
with you people?

197
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,596
Sorry, deputy,
that door stuck on me too.

198
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,953
He's ready now.

199
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,998
But how?

200
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,271
We'll talk later.

201
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,119
This is the DA.

202
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,796
Page him. He'll find a place
for you to go.

203
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,433
Thank you.

204
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,714
You don't know
what you just did for me.

205
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,433
Let's get you out of this dump.

206
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,839
What's the matter with you?

207
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,719
Just wondering
what you're feeling right now.

208
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,638
Yeah? Why is that?

209
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,591
Because...

210
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,715
...I can't feel a thing.

211
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,839
So...

212
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,670
- How about those Niners?
- The what?

213
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,991
The Niners, the 49ers,
the football team.

214
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,555
You don't follow football?

215
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,837
He isn't human.

216
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,637
You okay?

217
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,913
Check.

218
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,078
We're gonna be right back.

219
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,229
Phoebe, I know you're upset
Leo crashed your lunch date, but...

220
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,118
No, it's not that.

221
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,511
Cole is pulling away from me again.
I can see it.

222
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,036
- Premonition?
- Intuition.

223
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,355
Look, Cole, before the girls get back,
I need to tell you something.

224
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,835
What, spinach in my teeth?

225
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,555
Oh, no, no. It...
It has to do with Phoebe.

226
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,674
Well, I just feel very protective
of her. We all do.

227
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,759
You know, she's a sweetie.

228
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,750
She's been through a lot.
A lot of loss.

229
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,317
- I sense that.
- Yeah, well, she's into you. I can tell.

230
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,830
Whatever your intentions are, I just...

231
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,037
I want you to be straight with her,
okay? I don't wanna see her get hurt.

232
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,473
Heaven forbid.

233
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,988
Hey, what did we miss?

234
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,310
Leo was just giving me
investment advice.

235
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,708
- He was?
- Yeah.

236
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,239
Really?

237
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,751
Why don't we split this?

238
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,390
Oh, honey, did you forget
your wallet again?

239
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,837
I guess so.

240
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,758
I got it.

241
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,153
I have to take this.

242
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,272
Forgive me.

243
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,433
- Belthazor.
- Got your page.

244
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,430
I owe you for sending me the witch.
It went down just like you said.

245
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,238
Thanks.

246
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,669
You made physical contact
during the spell?

247
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,837
I could feel the empathic cancer
pass out of me and right into her.

248
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,592
How did you know that would happen?

249
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,916
That's how you got it, isn't it?

250
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,029
- How long does she have?
- She's a mortal.

251
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,078
She won't be able to fight it
like a demon can.

252
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,791
I give her a day until the weight
of human emotion crushes her.

253
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,430
- You'll enjoy watching it.
- I'll be out of town.

254
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,354
I don't need to see the other two
suffer the loss of their sister.

255
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,391
Compassion?

256
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,074
From you, Belthazor?

257
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,198
I think maybe you've been
undercover a little too long.

258
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,396
- Not your concern.
- True.

259
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,639
My only concern is the empath
who cursed me, Father Thomas.

260
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,153
And I know just where
to track him down.

261
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,634
No. I can't risk the witches finding
you and reversing their magic.

262
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,469
You forget who I was before
I was an empath, Belthazor.

263
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,358
I'm immune to their powers.

264
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,790
Maybe, but you're not immune
to mine.

265
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,679
Understood.

266
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,958
Look, I'm really sorry that I missed
my appointment this morning, okay,

267
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,758
but I couldn't get out of work.

268
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,150
Is there any way that
Dr. Timmons can fit me in?

269
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,918
We're pretty booked up.

270
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,793
All right, but my tooth kills.
I really need to...

271
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,989
- Peter!
- Are you okay, Miss Halliwell?

272
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,076
- Yeah.
- I thought you'd like it.

273
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,912
That was my tooth.

274
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,358
I'm having a really, really bad day
because it hurts a lot.

275
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,273
- Let me see if I can do anything.
- Thanks.

276
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,876
I mean, I really appreciate it.

277
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,315
I think that it's abscessed.

278
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,071
I'm so sorry. I don't...

279
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,236
My tooth has been hurting
for a long...

280
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,755
What is she laughing at?

281
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,957
Who of you guys is laughing?

282
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,556
Here's Mrs. Freeman's chart.

283
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,154
That's just the nitrous oxide
at work, Mrs. Freeman.

284
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,797
You're fine.

285
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,351
Nitrous oxide. Laughing gas?

286
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,673
The best I can do
is fit you in at 4:15.

287
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,990
No. No, no, no. That's okay.
I have to go.

288
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,955
What did I do?

289
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,756
You know what?

290
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,556
Is there something wrong?

291
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,313
No.

292
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,712
It's just you haven't said anything

293
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,791
since we left the restaurant.

294
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,468
A lot on my mind, I guess.

295
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,233
Work?

296
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,598
Yeah, sort of.

297
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,236
I don't know how to say this.

298
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,870
Don't ever start a sentence
like that with a girl.

299
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,431
You don't wanna see me
anymore, do you?

300
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,632
Right.

301
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,077
I never accept a lunch date.

302
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,589
It's got nothing to do with you.
I mean,

303
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,751
how I feel about you.

304
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,315
- I don't understand.
- It's complicated.

305
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,636
I think that I deserve to know.

306
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,633
I promise, you'll understand soon.

307
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,478
Maybe more than you'd want to.

308
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,475
Are you okay?

309
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,670
I haven't felt anything like that
since Andy was alive.

310
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,154
Anything like what?

311
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,558
Spinning into infinity.

312
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,157
You know, that headlong spiral

313
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,550
that steals your breath
and stops your heart.

314
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,834
Prue, what the hell
are you talking about?

315
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,958
- Falling in love.
- Falling in love?

316
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,079
Prue, I just got dumped, okay? I'm
trying to experience a break-up here.

317
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,397
- Who's falling in love?
- Cole.

318
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,076
Okay, you're so off-track...

319
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,233
Wait. I felt that too.

320
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,030
Your heart just jumped, and I felt it.

321
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,398
You're falling in love too.

322
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,112
We got a problem.

323
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,953
Prue cast a spell
to remove Vince's pain.

324
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,599
- Who's Vince?
- The shut-in.

325
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,112
But I think, and call it a hunch,

326
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,999
that it backfired
and made Prue an empath.

327
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,758
What kind of hunch?

328
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,751
Okay, I don't really know
how it happened.

329
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,589
All right, l... All I was trying to do
was help an innocent...

330
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,997
Hey, what is that I'm feeling?

331
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,798
You. You're feeling fear. Spill it.

332
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,271
l... I'm afraid that you're in danger.
You weren't meant to receive this gift.

333
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,910
- You can't handle it.
- Okay, you're looking at it all wrong.

334
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,991
Okay, I was guided to Vince,
remember?

335
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,037
Maybe I was meant to have this gift.

336
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,435
But, Prue, you're not an empath.
You're just a witch.

337
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,837
Right, a witch whose power comes
from her emotions, all right.

338
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,113
Look, I was looking for a power boost
to fight Belthazor. Maybe this is it.

339
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,591
Will you guys please stop
being so negative?

340
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,558
- We didn't say anything.
- Yeah, but I can feel all of your...

341
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,870
- What was that?
- I think I did it.

342
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,474
It's just all of your doubts
are screaming in my head.

343
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,993
I've gotta get control of this.

344
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,276
Book of Shadows, maybe
there's something about empaths.

345
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,510
- Where are you going?
- To help you.

346
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,116
- Yeah, but you're dying to see Cole.
- Stop that. I did not say that.

347
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,635
Phoebe, go to him, all right?
Tell him what's in your heart.

348
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,153
I think you'll find him receptive.

349
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,034
Prue, I can't.
I need to stay here with you.

350
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,953
- Do you really think he'll be receptive?
- Yes.

351
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,556
Now go get your man. He wants you.

352
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,272
- We'll help you out.
- No, no, no. I'll hit the book alone.

353
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,113
Your guys' couple issues are
really starting to hurt my head.

354
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,475
Wait, we have couple issues?

355
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,750
Resentment, denial. Be nice.

356
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,509
Leo, what is it exactly
that you resent?

357
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,355
Well, I tried to step out into
the real world today like you wanted.

358
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,348
Yes, and I appreciated your subtle
yet effective lunch invitation.

359
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,959
I was humiliated.

360
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,999
- When?
- When?

361
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,515
When the bill came.
You know, Piper, in my time,

362
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,477
men opened doors for women
when they walked in

363
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,996
and they stood up when they left and
they always, always paid for meals.

364
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,156
I just assumed
that you were okay with it.

365
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,114
- I'm not.
- Then you should've said something.

366
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,958
Look, Piper, you want me in
the real world, but I'm not of this world.

367
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,759
I know, and I'm...
I see your point.

368
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,150
I'm sorry I didn't understand.

369
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,788
I know this must be
very difficult for you.

370
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,797
- It is.
- Leo, you have to understand,

371
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,599
I am very proud to be with you.

372
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,389
And so proud that I need to share you
with the rest of the world, my world.

373
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,875
And you know, the other stuff
we'll just...

374
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,031
We'll figure out.

375
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,274
Not now. I have a headache.

376
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,551
- Phoebe, what are you doing here?
- I...

377
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,469
I came to tell you something.

378
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,951
Actually...

379
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,239
I was always much better
at "show" than "tell."

380
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,149
You have no idea what
you're getting yourself into.

381
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,791
Neither do you.

382
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,599
Morning.

383
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,238
Morning.

384
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,195
How you feeling about last night?

385
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,394
Last night was...

386
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,634
...magical.

387
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,432
You?

388
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,116
What do you think?

389
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,951
Don't.

390
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,356
Right here, right now, this place...

391
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,597
...it's perfect.

392
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,316
I wish the whole world
were just right in this room.

393
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,438
We wouldn't have to worry
about what happened next.

394
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,875
Are you going someplace?

395
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,198
Maybe.

396
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,232
I'm not sure yet.

397
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,118
You know...

398
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,189
...if you're hiding anything
from me,

399
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,032
you don't have to hide anything
from me.

400
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,839
What makes you think
I'm hiding something?

401
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,357
For the same reason I know
how you really feel about me.

402
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,392
If you're in some kind of trouble...

403
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,312
- I can handle it.
- I can help you.

404
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,072
No, you can't.

405
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,157
I have to go.

406
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,511
Am I gonna see you again?

407
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,796
One way or another.

408
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,192
I promise.

409
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,998
Where did Father Thomas go?

410
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,639
Crest Hills.

411
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,950
It's a psychiatric hospital.

412
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,398
If I were capable of feelings,
I might enjoy the irony of that.

413
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,913
What happened to the good Father,
pray tell?

414
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,516
Nervous breakdown.
Three years ago.

415
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,592
Something about losing his gift
to help others.

416
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,953
Well, he might wanna worry about
who's going to help him.

417
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,348
As should you.

418
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,038
I'm not the one who said it, you did.

419
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,629
- Oh, I want a divorce.
- Hey, you walk in and out of here

420
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,156
- like you're the one...
- Don't turn your back on me.

421
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,754
If I tell you again...

422
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,751
Every day, it's the same thing.

423
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,029
I don't love you anymore.

424
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,196
Prue, what's the matter?

425
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,555
What are you doing
in the basement?

426
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,315
I'm... I'm just trying to escape.

427
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,475
The emotions, they're...
They're everywhere.

428
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,551
- I can't get away.
- What do you mean?

429
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,598
It's not just you and Piper.

430
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,116
I'm picking up things
from other people's houses.

431
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,392
They're these people,
and they're in my head

432
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,155
and they're in my heart.
And it just hurts.

433
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,235
No!

434
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,149
Stay away, Piper. No contact.

435
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,991
Okay.

436
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,638
God, it is just so hard
to concentrate, to even talk.

437
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,268
I just want it to go away.

438
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,910
My head, it feels like
it's gonna split.

439
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,149
- What was that?
- Her empathic ability.

440
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,595
The more she feels,
the more powerful she becomes.

441
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,593
All right, if this is a gift,
we are returning it.

442
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,796
It was not meant for you.

443
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,834
Come on, we're gonna find
this Vince guy. Come on.

444
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,991
I know, I know,
you're gonna be okay.

445
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,113
Phoebe, where were you
when we called?

446
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,953
- Cole's.
- You could have changed.

447
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,758
All night?

448
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,872
Did you?

449
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,718
Was he?

450
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,833
Okay, can we talk about this later?

451
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,958
- Yeah, where's Prue?
- Waiting in the car.

452
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,068
Oh, this does not look good.

453
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,557
Cole said that Vince never called.

454
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,711
I'm starting to smell a demon.

455
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,314
If you're right, it would explain
why the gift didn't kill him.

456
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,357
I think we should stop
calling this a gift.

457
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,954
Okay, so how did the demon
formerly known as Vince

458
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,190
become empathic anyway?

459
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,669
Well, I'm guessing he got the power
from a true empath.

460
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,353
It would act like a curse
on the demon,

461
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,592
making him feel the pain
that he inflicts.

462
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,959
Phoebe.

463
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,190
Phoebe. Okay, come on.

464
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,917
Okay, we're definitely right
about the demon theory.

465
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,953
That was a premonition?
But you didn't touch anything.

466
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,918
This room must be dripping
with psychic remnants.

467
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,437
- Well, what did you see?
- Murders, and lots of them.

468
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,637
Like a big demon killing spree.

469
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,552
- Just random?
- No, more like a mission.

470
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,439
Could be he's looking for revenge
on the empath who cursed him.

471
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,989
Well, if we're gonna help Prue,
then we gotta get there first.

472
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,116
What was the last murder you saw?

473
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,876
A man at a mental hospital, Crest Hills,
but I don't know if it happened already.

474
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,389
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

475
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,156
And who are you here to visit today?

476
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,269
We came to visit our father.

477
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,677
What's his name?

478
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,718
Dad.

479
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,872
This is a psychiatric facility.
We can't very well let every...

480
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,598
Okay.

481
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,229
This place is a minefield for you.
You should wait here.

482
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,949
No, if Vince comes, I need
to be there to reverse the spell.

483
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,273
That looks like the guy
from my premonition.

484
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,791
Hi. Excuse me.

485
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,396
I know this is probably
gonna sound crazy...

486
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,233
...but are you an empath?

487
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,395
You people don't have
to humour me, you know.

488
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,788
I know you don't believe me.

489
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,351
No, we're not doctors or patients.
We're...

490
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,911
We're witches, and we're looking
for the empath who cursed a demon.

491
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,909
I was working as a priest,

492
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,270
helping people
when it came after me.

493
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,870
- You mean Vince.
- Is that what it calls itself?

494
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,959
Vinceres is a demonic assassin.

495
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,999
Timeless, unstoppable.

496
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,354
But you stopped him. How?

497
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,317
When the demon took my throat
to kill me,

498
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,119
I laid my hands on him
as if to heal him.

499
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,436
- And you gave him your power.
- Yes.

500
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,076
I didn't know if I could, but I did.
I cursed Vinceres and myself.

501
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,157
How did you curse yourself?

502
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,152
I'm staring at eternity on Earth
with no gift and no reason to be.

503
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,991
Well, I can't help you
with the eternity part,

504
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,832
but I can give you a reason
to be now.

505
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,792
Yeah, I know, I know.
I read the paper.

506
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,555
We have to get to that building
and safely relocate the demon.

507
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,150
It's funny you should mention that,
because when Prue met Vinceres,

508
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,078
she thought that he was
a shut-in, and...

509
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,912
- You didn't cast a spell?
- She did, but...

510
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,954
I gave up everything to prevent
that beast from killing again.

511
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,957
If it's free, you can't stop it.

512
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,351
- Nobody can!
- Stop yelling.

513
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,116
Please. I can't take it.

514
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,436
In the walls. Can't you hear it?

515
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,552
Here he is, Vinceres.

516
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,193
Pretty much lives up to his gloss.
Unstoppable hit man.

517
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,999
Just keeps going
till he gets his target.

518
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,517
Great, the Energizer demon.
So, what do we do?

519
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,875
Nothing. There's nothing you can do.

520
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,071
It will find us, and when it does,
we're all dead.

521
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,748
Well, you're just a ray of sunshine,
now aren't you?

522
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,679
- Hey. Anything?
- No. She won't say a word.

523
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,752
We've gotta snap Prue out of this or
she won't be able to reverse the spell

524
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,070
- when the demon attacks.
- You can't reverse the spell.

525
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,151
Vinceres is immune
to witches' magic.

526
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,157
Hold on. Prue's spell worked.

527
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,595
Because the demon allowed
it to work, to its own advantage.

528
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,558
You'll find your spells useless now.

529
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,314
Maybe we actually don't need
to reverse the spell.

530
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,159
- What are you thinking?
- Well, Prue's getting hit by emotions,

531
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,639
all emotions.

532
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,995
And her powers are tied
to these emotions.

533
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,760
So maybe if she could figure
out a way to channel them,

534
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,309
then she'd be pretty unstoppable
herself, don't you think?

535
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,072
- Is that possible?
- From what I've seen,

536
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,708
your sister is too far gone.
She won't live to see the night.

537
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,273
- All right, that's it.
- Piper...

538
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,192
No, I'm sorry, but this man
has experienced

539
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,595
the entire rainbow
of human emotions,

540
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,672
and the best he has to give us
here is self-pity? I don't think so.

541
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,509
Look, you used this power to stop this
demon. Now my sister has your power.

542
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,671
Deal with it and then help us.

543
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,117
Go away!

544
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,033
I know how you feel. Your instinct
is to pull away. Don't.

545
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,913
- Try to find an inner calm.
- I can't.

546
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,991
The pain, the noise.

547
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,913
You're carrying a cross you were
never meant to bear. I'm sorry.

548
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,835
Your sorrow, I can't...
I can't take it. Please.

549
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,390
You've been fighting what you feel.
That's natural, and it's wrong.

550
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,558
To find your strength as an empath,
you must embrace the emotion.

551
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,670
Focus on me. The feelings
are ripping you apart

552
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,956
because you're fighting them
like the demon did.

553
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,833
The demon can't handle
human emotions, you can.

554
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,031
- Anybody home?
- Piper, now!

555
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,276
Okay, I guess this is
the unstoppable part.

556
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,795
- Where's Father Thomas?
- Plan B, plan B.

557
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,109
Okay, do we have a plan C?

558
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,909
Leo, hurry.

559
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,478
Prue, take my hand.

560
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,793
My power to ease human suffering
lay in my hands.

561
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,234
That's how I cursed the demon.

562
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,910
You must channel
the empathic gift into your power.

563
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,433
I can't.

564
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,476
- I can't control my powers.
- Prue, you can do it.

565
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,915
You have a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity

566
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,718
to feel the world's emotions.

567
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,118
All it means to be human,
the good and the bad. Don't be afraid.

568
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,397
Just tell me where the empath is,
and I won't kill you.

569
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,632
You want him?

570
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,599
Come and get him.

571
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,313
How'd you do that?

572
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,512
If you want the empath,
you're gonna have to go through me.

573
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,478
Stay back. This is my fight.

574
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,435
You can't hurt me, witch.
I can handle your powers.

575
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,077
- I can handle your powers.
- What about pain?

576
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,912
Human pain.

577
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,959
The voices, they're gone.

578
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,954
So you're not an empath anymore.

579
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,670
I'm sorry. I was hoping
that we could return your gift.

580
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,313
But you did.

581
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,153
It appears I have the ability to
understand what people are feeling

582
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,072
even without a magic assist.

583
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,036
- You kicked ass.
- I did, didn't I?

584
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,189
- Hey.
- Hey.

585
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,828
You know, I cannot wait
for this Novocain to wear off.

586
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,911
Can you unfreeze my tongue?

587
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,792
You're lucky that dentist
even saw you.

588
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,992
Okay, there's one thing I don't get.

589
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,873
How did you vanquish Vinceres?

590
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,877
It was something that
Father Thomas said to me.

591
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,833
Vinceres was trying to fight off
the feelings of an empath,

592
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,150
because demons cannot
handle human emotion.

593
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,920
And so you astral-projected
into his body.

594
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,351
Yes, carrying the emotional baggage
of half of the city.

595
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,710
I forced him to feel,
and he couldn't take it.

596
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,988
- Hey.
- Hey.

597
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,594
Just left Father Thomas.
I got connections at the archdiocese.

598
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,432
They're gonna let him return
to his church.

599
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,318
Thank you. You're an angel.

600
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,398
Well, not technically.

601
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,158
So I guess the only other question

602
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,709
is who sent the signs
that led Prue to the demon?

603
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,389
Well, probably the Triad.

604
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,358
Or Belthazor. Which means we have
to be careful next time we get a sign.

605
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,269
Yeah, but, Prue, you got quite a power
boost there. You gonna miss it?

606
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,793
Yeah.

607
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,474
But I did get to stop
an unstoppable demon.

608
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,069
Got a little taste of what
my future powers are gonna be like.

609
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,872
I'm on the right path.

610
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,196
Speaking of paths, what's up
with you and your Cole dependency?

611
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,716
- Where do you guys stand?
- Oh, I have no idea.

612
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,594
I think I'm gonna
go find out right now.

613
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,878
Yeah.

614
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,197
- Hi.
- Hi.

615
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,550
I half expected not to find you here.

616
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,473
Yeah?

617
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,717
Well, an associate of mine
didn't do as he was told,

618
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,757
so I've still got work to do here.

619
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,998
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

620
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,073
Both.
