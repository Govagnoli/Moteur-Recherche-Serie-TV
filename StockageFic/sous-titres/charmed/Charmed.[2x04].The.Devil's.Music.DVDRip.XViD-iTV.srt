1
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:23,488
This place couldn't be more dead
if I was embalmed.

2
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,799
Yeah, I think that we're gonna
have to take that offer.

3
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:29,445
- What's this guy's name again?
- Chris Barker.

4
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,361
And he's not a loan shark
or anything, is he?

5
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,247
No. He's a collector, an investor.

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,718
And it's a no-interest loan that
we can pay back any time.

7
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:37,959
And trust me,
he's not gonna miss the money.

8
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:42,765
- Must be nice. When do we tell Piper?
- Not until the club is in the black.

9
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:47,927
So you guys do like the name
of the club right? P3?

10
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:50,478
Little nod to the power of three,
to us, partners?

11
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:54,437
Yeah, it's very clever.
Piper, it's a little...

12
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:58,399
...quiet in here, don't you think?

13
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:00,878
Lt'll pick up
once word of mouth kicks in.

14
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,279
And when will that be, exactly?

15
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,326
Well, you can't predict
these things exactly.

16
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,922
It's not like starting a restaurant.

17
00:01:07,089 --> 00:01:08,920
Besides, the bank's
not gonna call the loan.

18
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:10,727
It's not like we're gonna
lose the house.

19
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:12,800
Who said anything
about losing the house?

20
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:14,448
We're not gonna lose
the house, are we?

21
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,964
No, because we're gonna take
that offer and trust Piper

22
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:19,637
- to pack this place with people.
- What people?

23
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,559
Where is everybody?

24
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:17,488
So you, like,
produce the records, or what?

25
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:21,204
No, no, nothing that creative.
I'm their new manager.

26
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:24,925
I take care of things.
Whatever needs to be done, I do.

27
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:27,600
Man, I can't believe this.
This is, like,

28
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:30,124
the most unbelievable thing
that has ever happened to me.

29
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,642
Well, the night's young.

30
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:36,047
- I can't believe you picked me.
- Well, you seemed like a good soul.

31
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,005
Plus, you said the magic words. You
said you'd do anything, remember?

32
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:42,202
Yes, yes, I do.

33
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:45,122
All right. So wait inside,
the band should be down any minute.

34
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,961
Thank you, thank you so much.

35
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:48,558
Don't thank me yet.

36
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:07,723
Hello?
Is somebody there? Hello?

37
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:11,642
Hurry up, damn it!

38
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,808
Okay, that's it. No more.

39
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:46,080
I can't keep doing this.
It's gotta stop.

40
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:48,206
We have a pact.

41
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:54,160
You get what you want,
and I get what I want.

42
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,924
I want.

43
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:24,039
Good morning, San Francisco.
This is Ralph Garman,

44
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:26,604
and that was Dishwalla's hit,
"Counting Blue Cars."

45
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:28,361
Dishwalla and their manager,
Jeff Carlton,

46
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,042
are my in-studio guests this morning,

47
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:32,922
talking about club dates here and
around the country. So stay tuned,

48
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:34,841
and we'll let you know
where you can see them.

49
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:38,440
- Excuse me.
- They want him to go in 30 seconds.

50
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:40,201
Jerk. You know where
the bathroom is?

51
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:42,599
Yeah, it's right over...

52
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,564
- Hey, what is this?
- An intervention.

53
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,727
This is bad.

54
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:15,839
You should keep
that door locked, you know?

55
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,520
Anyone could just walk in.

56
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:20,847
Jenny, what are you doing here?

57
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:24,121
Am I breaking the law right now?
Being underage and all?

58
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:27,247
No, we're not open.
Actually, I don't know.

59
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:29,081
What's your point, Jenny?

60
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:30,807
Well, if you were open for business,

61
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:33,119
and I was in here,
would you have me arrested?

62
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,519
Because I think friendship counts
for something,

63
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,560
and even though
we're not really friends yet...

64
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:39,168
But at least we're neighbours,

65
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:41,445
and neighbours do favours
for each other, right?

66
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,646
- What kind of favours?
- I need a ticket to the show.

67
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:47,607
- What show?
- It's all over the radio.

68
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:51,205
I have to see them. If I don't, I'll die.

69
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:54,799
- Not a clue what you're talking about.
- She's talking about passion.

70
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:57,438
Piper Halliwell?

71
00:06:57,609 --> 00:07:00,965
- Yeah, can I help you with something?
- Jeff Carlton.

72
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:04,049
I have to tell you,
when I heard about "P-Cubed,"

73
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:06,200
it was as if the fates
had smiled upon me.

74
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:09,242
- P3.
- Whatever.

75
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:11,406
I manage Dishwalla.

76
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:14,644
Dishwalla? The Dishwalla?

77
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:16,680
I've been looking for the right
kind of place,

78
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:19,921
something small, new, intimate.

79
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,642
The boys wanna reacquaint
themselves

80
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,242
with the personal side of performing.

81
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,842
They wanna connect again.

82
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:28,321
I think your little hole in the wall
here is just what the doctor ordered.

83
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,209
Dishwalla wants to play
my "little hole in the wall"?

84
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,637
I want them to. Don't you?

85
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:36,603
- Yeah.
- Then let's cross some T's

86
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:38,407
and dot some I's.

87
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,638
Mr Carlton, sir,

88
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:45,040
do you think it'll be possible
for me to meet the band?

89
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,688
I'd do almost anything.

90
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,685
Careful what you wish for,
sweetheart.

91
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,286
- Prue, don't feel awkward.
- Well, it's a big deal.

92
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,519
I know, starting a business
with that bank loan

93
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:04,884
breathing down your neck
can make things kind of scary.

94
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:08,280
- Yeah, on top of your loan.
- Hey, listen, I have no doubt

95
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:09,564
I'll be seeing my money again

96
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:11,606
after your sister gets her club
off the ground.

97
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:15,239
- And the terms are still the same?
- Absolutely. No interest.

98
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:19,038
- No, we'll pay you interest.
- Okay, fine.

99
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,608
A quarter percent, whatever.

100
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:23,239
Now, speaking of getting off
the ground,

101
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:28,085
that plane trip to Paris
is still open for discussion, isn't it?

102
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:29,923
Mr Barker...

103
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,966
I mean, come on,
hasn't that rain check

104
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:33,847
burned a hole in your pocket
by now?

105
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:36,000
Look, I really appreciate your offer...

106
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,208
It's not an offer, Prue.
It's a dinner request.

107
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:41,848
In Paris.

108
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:45,238
You know what
they call French bread in France?

109
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:47,604
- Bread.
- Exactly.

110
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:51,240
Dinner in Paris is where it all begins.

111
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:55,800
You know, why don't we just start
with your loan,

112
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,278
followed with us paying
you back as soon as possible.

113
00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:02,044
- You're a hard bargainer.
- So are you.

114
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:04,809
Oh, I haven't even begun to fight.

115
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:08,088
Paris?

116
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,200
- Stop it.
- Never.

117
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:13,768
I'll see you at the club
with the money.

118
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,362
Okay, bye-bye.

119
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,720
Well, it's all set.

120
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:21,527
Mr Barker's gonna meet us
at the club,

121
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:23,361
hand over the check,
and that'll be that.

122
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:26,126
We're doing the right thing,
aren't we?

123
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:31,205
Well, we're helping out our sister.
That's always the right thing, right?

124
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:33,641
Guess what I did!
Guess what I did!

125
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,083
- All by myself!
- What?

126
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:36,284
- You ready?
- What?

127
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:40,203
Get this: Dishwalla, my club,
playing there tonight.

128
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:42,042
- What?
- I networked,

129
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,126
sent out feelers,
sent off press releases,

130
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:47,486
and wouldn't you know it, Dishwalla
decided to put P3 on their schedule.

131
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:51,119
How's about that? P3 has officially
been validated as the place to be.

132
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:52,483
We are on the map.

133
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:55,840
And I couldn't have done it
without you, you patient,

134
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,719
most generous sisters
in the whole wide world.

135
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:01,403
I'll get it.

136
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:10,086
Leo. This day just keeps
getting better. Hi.

137
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:12,644
- Hi. Piper, we have to talk.
- Yeah, okay.

138
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:15,449
Are you free tonight?
Better be, because you're my date.

139
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,526
We have backstage passes,
all-access, baby,

140
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:19,202
to see Dishwalla at P3.

141
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:23,123
- I made it happen.
- No, actually, I made it happen.

142
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,200
- What?
- Look, I wanted to tell you sooner,

143
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:26,848
but I didn't have the time.

144
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:29,239
I had to move fast.
There's a demon involved.

145
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:33,318
- A demon?
- Yeah, he'll be in your club tonight.

146
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:37,198
But, no, their manager, Jeff Carlton,
came to me and booked them himself.

147
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:39,599
- I know, I cast a spell on him.
- You what?

148
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:42,237
I sort of cribbed it from one
of the other witches I look after.

149
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,321
I suggested to Carlton
that he get Dishwalla into your club.

150
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:46,842
Why didn't you just come to us?

151
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:48,806
Because he knows
I would have been pissed off.

152
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:50,641
- What are you doing?
- My job.

153
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,606
Your job? What are we,
like, Leo's witches now?

154
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:54,999
We're supposed to kill a demon
during a sold-out concert?

155
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,284
- Are you nuts?
- Piper.

156
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:59,486
No. Leo, anywhere else,
but not there, not my place.

157
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:05,400
Look, the band's manager
made a bargain with Masselin.

158
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:07,127
- That's the demon?
- Yeah. In exchange

159
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:10,599
for human sacrifice,
Masselin will make Carlton rich

160
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,999
and powerful by attracting
successful bands to him.

161
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:15,478
Are you telling me Dishwalla
is hooked up with a demon?

162
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,401
They don't know anything
about the demon.

163
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:20,208
So these innocents,
what happens to them?

164
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:23,088
They're devoured by Masselin,
consumed for their souls.

165
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:27,327
The more souls Masselin collects,
the more successful Carlton becomes.

166
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:28,763
Now, you can't destroy the demon

167
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:30,885
without first freeing
those trapped within him.

168
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:35,679
All this freeing and destroying, is this
in between sets or during the encore?

169
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:41,644
Look, I know you're upset.

170
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:45,961
No, no, I skated past upset
just after you came in the door.

171
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,768
- Right now I'm at furious.
- We have to talk.

172
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:52,239
- You bet your whitelighter ass we do.
- All right, but later. I have to go.

173
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:01,162
See, now, this is exactly why
you should never date a coworker.

174
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:03,601
It was a joke.

175
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:07,287
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
- How could he do this?

176
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:09,599
Well, it sounds like
he didn't have a choice.

177
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:12,442
And quite frankly,
I don't think we do either.

178
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:17,925
Well, I have to get to the office
and call this investor.

179
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:19,727
Barker. I gotta talk to Barker.

180
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:30,481
- Stick it up there with the bass.
- Okay.

181
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:31,963
This is Tina Hitchens.

182
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:34,689
She's been missing since last night,
when she came to this club.

183
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:38,040
Yo, the address is
on the front seat, P3.

184
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:39,807
- You got it.
- You're playing P3?

185
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:41,084
Piper Halliwell's place?

186
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:44,522
- Yeah, so I don't have a lot of time.
- Well, you've got time for this.

187
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:48,599
- I answered your question.
- I didn't ask one.

188
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:53,039
- You asked me if I saw Tina whoever.
- I don't believe I did. Did you?

189
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:54,801
- What?
- See her.

190
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:58,037
I didn't see anybody, inspector.

191
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:00,042
Look again.

192
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:02,359
Listen, you have any idea
how many girls like that

193
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:03,723
show up to something like this?

194
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:06,767
Hundreds of them, thousands,
and they all look the same.

195
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:11,042
Short skirts, tight tops,
like sexy little peas in a pod.

196
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,165
So, what difference does
it make if one disappears?

197
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:15,047
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

198
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:16,927
Why aren't you out hassling
her boyfriend?

199
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,881
Did that already.
Now I'm hassling you.

200
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,847
I haven't seen her.
What's with the Gestapo routine!

201
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,318
It tends to follow
the acting-like-a-suspect routine.

202
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:26,162
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

203
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:31,558
- Melody Jenkins?
- No.

204
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:35,002
- Brittany Tyler?
- None of them. Never saw them.

205
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,123
They all disappeared from clubs
all around the country,

206
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:41,207
clubs that your band played in.
That doesn't concern you?

207
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:44,845
Not in the slightest.
If we're done here, see you around.

208
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,162
Count on it.

209
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,928
- There's Leo's problem.
- It's our problem.

210
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:57,681
You wanna know what
the real problem is?

211
00:13:57,849 --> 00:13:58,838
Oh, do tell.

212
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:00,328
- Never mind.
- Thank you.

213
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:03,401
- So how do we vanquish this creep?
- Oh, let's find out, shall we?

214
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,446
And what was with that attitude?

215
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:07,248
What attitude?

216
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:09,246
Leo, it was like he was angry
that I was angry.

217
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:11,684
I have a right to be angry.
I don't wanna talk about it.

218
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:13,083
Then don't.

219
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:16,125
- What?
- Look, Masselin's victims.

220
00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:20,847
Yeah. "Trapped within the demon,
the unfortunates are kept alive,

221
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:24,161
their souls tortured for the pleasure
he gets from their suffering."

222
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:29,046
- We gotta get them out of there.
- With what? Demonic ipecac?

223
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:32,042
Actually, yeah,
that seems to be the idea.

224
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:34,086
"The demon seeks willing,
trusting souls

225
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,962
delivered by the one
who sealed the pact."

226
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:39,799
- The manager.
- So we have to get close to Carlton.

227
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:42,005
Well, I'm already close,
and as far as we know,

228
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:44,683
I'm a willing, trusting soul,
a sucker.

229
00:14:44,849 --> 00:14:46,965
Someone who falls
for a quick line from a pretty face.

230
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:50,041
- Will you please stop that?
- You're right. Fine.

231
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:51,722
Leo is the least of my worries.

232
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,959
Right. We'll worry
about that tomorrow.

233
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:56,518
- I don't think I can wait that long.
- You're gonna have to,

234
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:59,965
because tonight we have
some major demon ass-kicking to do.

235
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:14,483
The cops are asking questions.
And you know what?

236
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,038
They're not gonna catch you. No, sir.
They're gonna catch me.

237
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,006
All right, okay, I'm out.

238
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,922
I'm done with it. No more souls.

239
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,445
The pact, the agreement
is now officially null and void.

240
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:36,001
You will honour your agreement,
Mr Carlton.

241
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,208
- You will bring me more souls.
- Okay.

242
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:42,243
More souls.

243
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:52,758
So, what you're telling me
is that you no longer need

244
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:56,367
a white knight to rescue you
and your sisters from debt.

245
00:15:56,969 --> 00:15:58,800
- No.
- But we have a deal.

246
00:15:58,969 --> 00:16:02,564
Well, what we had was
an agreement to make a deal,

247
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:06,286
- and I no longer agree.
- I see.

248
00:16:07,729 --> 00:16:09,924
This wouldn't have anything to do
with a certain

249
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:13,240
band choosing to play P3 tonight,
would it?

250
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:14,723
- Word travels fast.
- Yeah, well,

251
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:16,322
Piper pulled us out of the fire.

252
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:20,004
Yes, and in doing so, revealed to me
quite a diamond in the rough.

253
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:22,167
- Meaning what?
- Well, meaning

254
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,680
I understand you're showing me the
door, but I think I rather like this party.

255
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:28,841
I think your sister's little venture
is on its way to great success,

256
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,403
which is why

257
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:33,288
I've already gone to your bank and
made an offer to pick up your loan.

258
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:36,486
- You didn't.
- Did.

259
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:40,561
Okay, Mr Barker,

260
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:43,400
- we have a relationship.
- Yes, and you've brought

261
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,129
so many valuable items
into my field of view,

262
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:49,725
I just have this feeling that your sister's
club is gonna be the best one yet.

263
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:52,119
Could you put me
on the guest list for tonight?

264
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:55,326
Me plus one.
I'd like to see what I'm buying.

265
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:58,723
Okay, I am asking nicely,

266
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:01,119
for your own sake,
not to go through with this.

267
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:03,365
Is that a threat, Miss Halliwell?

268
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:08,604
Be careful, you could be jeopardizing
a very profitable relationship.

269
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:11,448
Two passes.

270
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,964
I'd like a booth too,
close to the stage.

271
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,762
How is this gonna work?

272
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:26,682
We are just gonna slip Masselin
a little extra-strength antacid.

273
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:29,642
And if the Book of Shadows is right,
he should disappear

274
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:32,084
like some demonic gas bubble,
freeing his victims,

275
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:33,318
leaving them safe and sound.

276
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:35,684
Phoebe, we can't even give
our cat a vitamin.

277
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:37,840
How are we gonna
get this down a demon's throat?

278
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,760
- In this.
- What is that?

279
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:43,324
- It's a balloon.
- Okay, where is it?

280
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:44,878
Where is what?

281
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:47,483
The spoonful of sugar
big enough to hide that thing.

282
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,368
- You're looking at her.
- Excuse me?

283
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:53,043
Well, the only way to get
to Masselin is through Carlton, right?

284
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:55,719
So all I have to do
is get close to Carlton,

285
00:17:55,969 --> 00:18:01,248
pretend I'm some choice titbit,
then we get Masselin to swallow this...

286
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:05,044
Right before he swallows you,
Phoebe. No, it's too dangerous.

287
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,519
Well, unless you have a better idea,
it's our only choice.

288
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:10,805
You and Prue will back me up.
I'll be fine.

289
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,082
I hate him.

290
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:20,644
Of course you hate him.
He's a demon.

291
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,606
Wait, we are talking
about the demon, right?

292
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,522
He didn't even have
the decency to ask me first.

293
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,526
He at least could've
discussed it with me.

294
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,408
- Leo.
- I mean, can you believe him?

295
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,037
He acted as if we've never even
had a relationship before,

296
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:34,688
like it was just business.

297
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,678
Got to put the lid on, honey.

298
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:46,321
And I saw the future too.
You know, Leo and I get married.

299
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:49,919
A marriage in the future implies some
sort of relationship in the present.

300
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:52,080
The question is,
where's the relationship?

301
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:55,600
Somewhere between confusing
and complicated.

302
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:57,680
Just talk to him, honey. It'll be okay.

303
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:00,687
I'd rather just freeze him
and kick him in the...

304
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:03,448
That better not be him.

305
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:08,809
- In the shins?
- Not exactly.

306
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:15,125
- Piper.
- Dan. Hi.

307
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:18,042
- Could I talk to you for a second?
- Sure, what's up?

308
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:22,444
Jenny, did you tell her she
could go see Dishwalla tonight?

309
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:25,607
- No, no, she can't go.
- She said you said it was all right.

310
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,319
Well, I didn't exactly
tell her it wasn't,

311
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:30,241
but things were happening
kind of fast.

312
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:32,684
Well, she's in her room right now
picking out clothes.

313
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:35,158
Oh, God. Okay, I'll go talk to her.

314
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,685
- Hi.
- Hello.

315
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:42,364
Listen, I was hoping
that we could talk.

316
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:45,919
- Sure. Leo, this is...
- Dan Gordon.

317
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:48,048
Wait, you know him?

318
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:50,769
Are you kidding? He used to play
second base for the Mariners.

319
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:53,489
He had an all-star season
till he blew his knee sliding into home.

320
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:55,685
- I still think you were safe.
- So do I.

321
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:57,248
- I'm Leo.
- Nice meeting you.

322
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:00,321
No, it's not. You follow baseball?

323
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,365
- Yeah.
- You have time for baseball, but you

324
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:06,089
don't have time to tell me about
you-know-what before you-know-who

325
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:08,604
shows up you-know-where?

326
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:11,767
Listen, if you two need
to talk or something, I can...

327
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:15,365
No, no, no, we don't need to talk.
Leo stops by occasionally to fix things.

328
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:18,965
Phoebe can show him around.
Let's go talk to Jenny.

329
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:21,718
- It was nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you too.

330
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:28,604
- She's just a little upset.
- Yeah, I don't blame her.

331
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:39,965
Right. And this is where you say,
"Darryl?" and I say, "Prue?"

332
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:42,404
And then you say something like,
"What are you doing here?"

333
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:44,321
What are you talking about?

334
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:47,049
Andy didn't have time to teach me
all the steps in this dance,

335
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:48,688
but I'm a quick study.

336
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,040
- I have to go.
- To P3?

337
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:56,405
As usual, I barely know
what's going on. And I don't like it.

338
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:58,725
Look, I will explain everything
to you later.

339
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:01,762
But you never do.
I know it's all about keeping me safe,

340
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,159
and I respect that.

341
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:06,280
What do you know
about Jeff Carlton?

342
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:09,043
- I can't.
- This is about my job.

343
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:12,727
Andy is gone, but I'm not Andy.

344
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:15,278
And I'm not saying that you have
to tell me about everything.

345
00:21:15,449 --> 00:21:17,405
But whenever you and your sisters
get involved,

346
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,241
the whole playing field
gets a little crazy.

347
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:21,798
- Yeah, and a lot more dangerous.
- I'm a cop!

348
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:26,042
- Stop protecting me, Prue.
- Look, you have absolutely no idea...

349
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:28,882
I'm an imaginative guy.
I have plenty of ideas.

350
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,887
I even had you three working
for the CIA for a while.

351
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:33,277
But none of that matters.

352
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:36,759
What matters is that you and I
work out some kind of relationship.

353
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:41,002
We're gonna need to communicate,
or I'm gonna become very unsociable.

354
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:45,398
Okay.

355
00:21:47,449 --> 00:21:52,443
- The missing girls and Jeff Carlton.
- We're working on it.

356
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:57,242
- I figured.
- Look...

357
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:01,089
...Darryl, just trust us, okay?

358
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:03,961
We've got this one for right now.

359
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:08,247
- Sure.
- I have to go.

360
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,367
Be careful.

361
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:22,328
Jenny, the state
could shut me down.

362
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:24,684
How are they gonna find out?
Are you gonna tell them?

363
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:27,283
Because I'm not gonna tell them.
You like the red or the denim?

364
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:30,043
- Jenny.
- Yeah, let's hear from Uncle Dan,

365
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,888
who never in his life
faked an ID or snuck into a bar,

366
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:34,488
who never did anything wrong, ever.

367
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,688
- We're talking about you.
- No, we're talking about Piper.

368
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:40,443
- She said I could go see the show.
- I never said that.

369
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:44,128
Jenny, I'm sorry,
but I can't let you in the club.

370
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,326
Your mom and dad,
they put me in charge.

371
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:50,442
Right, everybody's in charge,
but not me, not ever. Why is that?

372
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,842
I'm sorry, she's just feeling,
you know, a little...

373
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:05,088
Betrayed. It's okay.
I know the feeling.

374
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:13,248
You didn't leave any passes
for that investment guy, did you?

375
00:23:13,449 --> 00:23:14,768
No way.

376
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:17,727
The bouncer has his orders.
Chris Barker is not allowed.

377
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:20,847
The last thing we need is for Piper
to find out she's gonna lose her club.

378
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:22,647
If the bank accepts his offer...

379
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:24,527
One hellish complication at a time.

380
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:27,157
- Okay, do you have the poison pill?
- Armed and dangerous.

381
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:29,604
Good, because
here comes demon boy.

382
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:31,680
Positions.

383
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:38,718
- Mr Carlton.
- Nice crowd. Is the band here?

384
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:40,288
Yep, they came in the back way.

385
00:23:40,449 --> 00:23:42,201
They're right over there.
Everything's ready.

386
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:44,564
Better be. I don't want any problems.

387
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:49,207
- That's too bad.
- Talking to yourself again, I see.

388
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:50,683
What are you doing here?

389
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:52,646
Watching over things.
It's what I do, remember?

390
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:54,845
I remember when it didn't used
to be a job.

391
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:57,284
Look, this isn't easy
for me either, Piper, you know?

392
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:59,679
Leo, I really can't talk
about this right now. Excuse me.

393
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:07,442
- Okay, Pheebs, go get him.
- Keep an eye on me.

394
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:09,361
You're kind of hard
to miss in that outfit.

395
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:15,480
When you're done with the lights,
let's do the sound check, okay?

396
00:24:15,649 --> 00:24:17,048
Excuse me.

397
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:21,084
- Aren't you Jeff Carlton?
- Yes.

398
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:25,765
Yeah, I recognized you from that MTV
top-ten-videos thing last month.

399
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:27,521
Somebody actually saw that?

400
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:30,409
- Well, I'm flattered.
- Hey, it was riveting.

401
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:32,440
I taped that almost two months ago.

402
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:34,526
I didn't even know
there was such a thing

403
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:38,841
as a music manager, let alone what
they did, until you came on the scene.

404
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:40,362
I mean, who knew?

405
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:45,400
I'm now taking a class in music
management at the Learning Annex.

406
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,203
- You're my inspiration.
- Really?

407
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:52,488
Cross my heart.
Hey, do you have any pointers?

408
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:57,519
I would do just about anything
to get the inside scoop.

409
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:00,408
Anything, huh?

410
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:05,083
- Wanna meet the band?
- Yeah!

411
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:06,923
This way.

412
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:10,607
Where is he taking her?

413
00:25:12,729 --> 00:25:14,082
In the back.

414
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:18,082
All right, let's go.

415
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,723
- Hey, what's the rush?
- No time to waste.

416
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:02,842
- Are you all right?
- Did you get him?

417
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:05,045
- No. I think we need a bigger balloon.
- What?

418
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:08,042
Okay, we're gonna have
to regroup. Let's go.

419
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:27,484
He's huge and ugly, and I really think
we need a bigger balloon.

420
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:30,038
- Maybe we just came in too soon.
- Maybe he saw the potion.

421
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:31,688
Well, in any case,
the spook spooked.

422
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:34,921
And took the trapped souls with him,
the ones that we have to save.

423
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:36,841
We don't know for sure
if the demon is gone.

424
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:39,000
But if he is still here,
then he's gonna feed again,

425
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:41,524
and Carlton feeds him.
Do you still have the poison pill?

426
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:43,361
Yes, but I don't think
it's gonna be enough.

427
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:47,522
Phoebe, stop. All right, we need
to cover the exits, look for Carlton.

428
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:49,004
If we see him grab anybody,

429
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:51,239
Piper, freeze the room,
and we'll get into positions.

430
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,320
I wish we could just stuff his head
in a toilet

431
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:56,799
- and make him cough up the demon.
- Oh, honey, you still upset with Leo?

432
00:26:57,209 --> 00:27:00,963
- I'm talking about Carlton.
- I can't keep up.

433
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:06,401
You brought witches to destroy me.

434
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:09,288
What? What are you talking about?
No, I didn't. I swear!

435
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:11,326
To whom do you swear?

436
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,847
To you, just you.
I didn't know about the witches.

437
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:19,807
Your most recent selection,
she holds the key

438
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:22,608
to my destruction. Take it from her.

439
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,682
But why? They know about you.
They know about me!

440
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:29,802
Take it from her,
and bring the witches to me.

441
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:31,925
All right, but how am
I gonna get them back here?

442
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:33,881
I mean, they're gonna be
a little suspicious.

443
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:37,246
Tempt them with an innocent soul.

444
00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:44,238
Excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry.

445
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:46,648
Pardon me.

446
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:51,848
Excuse me.

447
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:54,688
Sorry.

448
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:58,798
Look, I'm sorry,
but if you don't have a ticket,

449
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,358
and your name isn't on the guest list,
I can't let you in.

450
00:28:02,689 --> 00:28:06,602
Try looking under G for Grant.

451
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:11,523
Oh, here you are, Mr Grant.

452
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:14,362
Thank you so much.

453
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:23,161
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together for Dishwalla!

454
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:00,648
- I wish you'd quit doing that.
- What's happening?

455
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:03,403
We're on it, Leo. We're just waiting
for Carlton to do his thing.

456
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:05,400
- What, you think I like this?
- Leo.

457
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:07,161
You think I like not being with you?

458
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,843
Can we cut the crap? I know
what you have to do. I always have.

459
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,239
The question is, what do you want?
What do you wanna do?

460
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:14,684
With me, with us?
Do you ever think about that?

461
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:17,124
- All the time.
- You ever wanna discuss it with me?

462
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,757
Yes, it's just the timing
always seems...

463
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:26,488
Seems to suck. Okay, hold that
thought. Don't let go, just hold it.

464
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:33,441
Morris is here.

465
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:37,561
Oh, boy.

466
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:40,488
What are you looking at?
He's over there.

467
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:42,526
Yeah, okay, come, come.

468
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:51,846
See that honey by the stage
in the silver thing?

469
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:54,087
- Yeah.
- She's got something in her purse.

470
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:56,405
- Something illegal?
- Extremely. Get it out of here.

471
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:58,327
You got it. Let's go.

472
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:05,001
Hey, what are you doing?

473
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:07,524
- Weapons check.
- There is nothing in there.

474
00:30:11,449 --> 00:30:15,920
- What the hell is that?
- That is a $75 dry cleaning bill.

475
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:26,758
Hey, there, Jenny?
Hello. I remember you.

476
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:28,760
You're a friend of Piper Halliwell's,
right?

477
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:32,086
And Phoebe and Prue.
We're like sisters.

478
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:34,001
Listen, would you like
to meet the band?

479
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:38,164
Are you serious?
Man, I'd do anything to meet them!

480
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:39,924
Follow me.

481
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:55,637
Hello, Prue.

482
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:59,007
- Mr Barker.
- Where's Phoebe?

483
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:02,201
- Let me guess. Piper Halliwell, right?
- Yeah. Who are you? Who's he?

484
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:03,563
The name's Chris Barker.

485
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:05,879
I'm gonna be taking over everything
from here on out.

486
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:07,926
- Wait, what?
- Piper, we gotta talk.

487
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:09,284
Not now.

488
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:11,679
I'd be willing to discuss
you staying on, however,

489
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:13,965
in a diminished capacity, of course.

490
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:15,608
- Jenny's here with Carlton.
- What?

491
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:17,600
- Jenny's here?
- And I've lost the potion.

492
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:19,839
- Piper, it's important.
- Yeah, wait in line, pal.

493
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:21,488
Hey, why don't you step to the back.

494
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:23,799
Okay, everybody hold it.

495
00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:30,688
Look.

496
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,607
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

497
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,879
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

498
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:44,761
Freeze them again,
they're through the door!

499
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:46,683
Hey!

500
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:50,888
Hello?

501
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:05,406
- Hold it. Stop.
- Jenny's in there.

502
00:32:05,569 --> 00:32:07,799
Yeah, but we can't kill Masselin
without the potion.

503
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:09,721
But we can't just stand here.
She's gonna die.

504
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:22,883
- Help us.
- He'll kill me.

505
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:25,165
He'll burn the flesh
off my bones for eternity.

506
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:28,403
Listen up, skid mark,
you tell us how to save Jenny

507
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:29,888
and get Elvis out of the building,

508
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,483
or spending eternity in hell
will be the least of your worries.

509
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:34,879
- There's nothing you can do.
- We can break the pact

510
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:37,358
and free you from Masselin.

511
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:40,840
Believe me, if I could help you,
I would.

512
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:44,764
If you go in there, he's gonna swallow
you whole. And you'll still be alive.

513
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:46,608
That's not a bad idea.

514
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:48,607
- What?
- Where's the demon?

515
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:54,040
Through that door.

516
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:56,439
I got a plan. We get eaten.

517
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:58,282
I'm sorry, we get what?

518
00:32:58,449 --> 00:33:01,407
And once we're inside, Prue, you
use your power to blow him up.

519
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:02,968
From the inside?

520
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:05,883
Who's to say that we don't lose
our powers once we get in there?

521
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:07,801
Maybe that's exactly what he wants.

522
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:11,718
Well, we don't really have a choice,
Phoebe. The poison pill is gone.

523
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:14,443
Is it?

524
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:19,563
Phoebe, what are you...?

525
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:29,924
It's time to join your friend, witches.

526
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:31,918
Your friend.

527
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:44,045
What is going on back here?

528
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:55,688
Jenny.

529
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:01,243
Come on, we gotta get her home.

530
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:05,083
Little dizzy.

531
00:34:05,329 --> 00:34:07,320
Prue, what's going on here?

532
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:11,482
- Someone wanna clue me in?
- You're arresting a kidnapper.

533
00:34:12,209 --> 00:34:14,848
And rescuing his victims.
Good job.

534
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:19,204
Trust me, that's all you wanna know.

535
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:22,719
I guess that's all I need to know.

536
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:30,122
Mr Barker,

537
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:31,962
here's what you need to know.

538
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:35,765
This place is ours, the ups, the downs,
the good, and especially the bad.

539
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:39,280
It's all ours.
Now, if you ever bother us again,

540
00:34:39,529 --> 00:34:42,805
you won't have to ask
if I'm threatening you. Are we clear?

541
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:45,119
- Yeah.
- Good.

542
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:02,288
Paying bills?

543
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:05,123
Every last one,
for this month at least.

544
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:06,642
Thanks to Leo.

545
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:09,006
Well, technically, if it wasn't for him,

546
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:10,921
you would have never landed
Dishwalla.

547
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:15,600
I suppose. And technically,
if we hadn't vanquished a demon,

548
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:19,365
your client Chris Barker wouldn't have
abandoned his hostile takeover.

549
00:36:19,529 --> 00:36:22,089
The bank called
and told me Mr Barker

550
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:25,565
didn't have the stomach
for gruesome stage theatrics.

551
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:28,289
- He's withdrawing his offer.
- I'm sorry.

552
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:31,600
He was just supposed to help.
We didn't expect a double-cross.

553
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:33,603
It's okay.

554
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:36,602
I mean, I understand why you
didn't wanna hurt my feelings,

555
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:38,487
but you could've told me the truth.

556
00:36:38,649 --> 00:36:41,083
- I said I was sorry.
- We're sorry.

557
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:44,842
It's just dawning on me
that personal relationships

558
00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:47,523
and business
just don't mix well at all.

559
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:49,962
I got it.

560
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:55,364
Why were you trying
to blame it all on me?

561
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:01,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

562
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:06,165
Thanks for everything.

563
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:10,765
Just doing my job.
Do you wanna come in, sit down?

564
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,362
I'd love to.

565
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:14,808
But you can't.

566
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:19,483
We got Jenny home safe.
Dan doesn't know she was at the club.

567
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:21,839
But are you sure
she won't remember anything?

568
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:24,643
I took care of it
with a little hocus-pocus.

569
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:27,607
So you erase memories now?

570
00:37:28,009 --> 00:37:29,283
No, I make pain go away...

571
00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:34,044
...when I can.
Sometimes I can't,

572
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:36,202
no matter how hard I try.

573
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:39,327
- And Masselin's other victims?
- They'll be fine.

574
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:42,680
- No memory of Masselin or Carlton.
- Good.

575
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:46,280
Piper, did you mean what you said?

576
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:50,604
- When?
- A couple of months ago,

577
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,602
when I almost died and you
saved my life, I left, and you said

578
00:37:54,009 --> 00:37:55,761
that you love me.

579
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,328
I thought you were gone.

580
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,406
Well, sometimes I linger.

581
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:04,200
Did you mean it?

582
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,882
Yeah, I meant it.

583
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:10,842
- You linger?
- What about now?

584
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:15,402
I still mean it.

585
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:18,483
- But...?
- But we can't keep doing this.

586
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,603
I can't keep doing this.
I feel like all I do

587
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:24,846
is wait around for you to show up.
And then when you do, it's just not

588
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:26,328
quite right.

589
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:30,243
Well, I'm just... I'm doing what
I thought you wanted me to do, Piper.

590
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:33,283
You're the one who didn't want me
to clip my wings.

591
00:38:34,009 --> 00:38:38,161
And you shouldn't, not for me, but
that doesn't make it any easier for us.

592
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:43,884
What are we gonna do?

593
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:47,282
I don't know, Leo.

594
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:52,883
Go. It's okay. I understand.

595
00:39:00,689 --> 00:39:02,281
I'll see you.
