1
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,929
- Leo, I need your help.
- Why? What's the matter?

2
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,973
- The Elders have assigned me a charge.
- That's great!

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,433
No, actually, it's not.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,437
- You have to help me get out of this.
- You can't. You're a Whitelighter.

5
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:24,274
I'm also a chick in her 20's
who'd like to have a life.

6
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,944
- I don't have time for this!
- You're nervous.

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,155
No, I'm just busy.

8
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,824
All right, fine.
Maybe I'm a little nervous.

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,034
You know what?

10
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,663
That used to happen to me all the time
before I met my first charge.

11
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,499
It's good. It means you
don't want to let 'em down.

12
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,335
- Or maybe I'm not ready.
- Trust me, you're ready.

13
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,296
Yeah? Then why don't
you tell that to my stomach.

14
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,675
- 'Cause it really hurts right now.
- Look... Here, try this.

15
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,596
- Toast?
- Yeah, it helps calm the butterflies.

16
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:59,726
You've been a Whitelighter for 60 years,
and toast is what you got for me?

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,230
Well, it's not like you
haven't had charges before, okay?

18
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,732
Right, okay... Fine.

19
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:10,237
But I always had Piper and Phoebe
to back me up, all right?

20
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,364
Now I'd be solo.

21
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,700
- What if I fail?
- You won't fail.

22
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:18,245
That's easy for you to say.
You have a job, you got your wife.

23
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,831
You got your kids.
You got... breakfast.

24
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,625
If I make a mistake,
someone dies.

25
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,210
You done?

26
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:27,796
Yeah, how did you know?

27
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,382
Toast and venting.
Works every time.

28
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,431
- Guess I could try.
- I know you can do it.

29
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,143
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

30
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,780
- Thanks a lot.
- Here you go.

31
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,746
- Mitchell Hanes?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:05,042
Hi, I'm your new Whitelighter,
Paige Matthews.

33
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,377
Nice to meet you...

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,671
Not interested.

35
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,383
- You can't just walk away from me.
- No? Watch me.

36
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,136
Aren't you at least gonna hear me out?

37
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,596
Let me guess...

38
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,349
That I'm a witch with great powers.

39
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:23,519
You can help bring them
out for me. Master them.

40
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,855
- Well, yeah.
- I don't want your help.

41
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,815
Wait. Wait.

42
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,275
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

43
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,070
Look, I know you've had
some problems in the past,

44
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:36,949
but maybe you haven't had
the right person help you... Namely me.

45
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,619
My last Whitelighter said the
same thing. They ever send anybody

46
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:44,623
- who hasn't read the Elder playbook?
- I'm not just anybody, okay?

47
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,752
I am a Charmed One. I ran Magic School
for a year, and I'm a Whitelighter.

48
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,714
Triple threat. Where are you going to
find somebody with that experience.

49
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,801
Good, you can use it
to help your next charge.

50
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,226
Okay, wait. Listen!

51
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,519
New rule.

52
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,605
I'll not tolerate demon activity
in my house or my club.

53
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,815
Got it?

54
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,862
Barstool!

55
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,079
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

56
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,248
What the hell do you
think they wanted?

57
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,710
- I have no clue.
- At least you're okay.

58
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,129
Yeah, but he's not.

59
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,246
He has a concussion
and needs a few stitches.

60
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,540
- Otherwise, he's fine.
- Oh, thank God.

61
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,585
Did he say whether, you know,
he had seen anything?

62
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,003
He was hit from behind.

63
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,256
Last thing he remembers
was loading beer from his truck.

64
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:42,718
That was good. I mean, you know,
that he remembers something.

65
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:45,804
That probably means
he doesn't have any brain damage.

66
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,308
Stick around. The detective's
gonna need to take a statement.

67
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,145
"Probably doesn't have
any brain damage"?

68
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:57,316
- Smooth, Piper. Real smooth.
- Well, that's the last time I call 911.

69
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,610
Well, sadly,
now that Leo can't heal us,

70
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,613
I think we're gonna be calling
that number a lot more.

71
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,742
I can't believe this. They attack me
at work now? Is no place sacred?

72
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,786
- I thought we covered pretty well.
- Yeah, this time.

73
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,414
What about next time
and the time after that?

74
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:16,335
- We'll deal with it when it happens.
- No, I'm gonna deal with them now.

75
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,421
Before you do, can you help?
The reason why I came...

76
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,798
That guy Mitchell blew me off.

77
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,051
My charge!

78
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,553
Oh? That's all you
have for me is "oh"?

79
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,765
I can't really help with that
whole Whitelighter thing.

80
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,683
You should probably talk to Leo.

81
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,647
Excuse me. You're
Phoebe Halliwell's sisters, right?

82
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,273
- Right.
- Yeah.

83
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,816
I'm Inspector Sheridan.

84
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,861
I met Phoebe a couple of
weeks ago on a different case.

85
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,113
Well, it's nice to meet you.

86
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,742
- Where is Lieutenant?
- Lieutenant Morris? He's out of town.

87
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,995
Taking personal time.
I'll cover for him while he's gone.

88
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,873
So, could you describe the suspects?

89
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,711
- Tall. Short. White. Black?
- Didn't really get a good look at him.

90
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,465
Yeah, we were in the back and
by the time we came out they were...

91
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,509
Gone! Yeah, gone.

92
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,554
What I don't understand is
why would they rob the place

93
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,306
in the middle of the day.
Before you even opened?

94
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,602
We have been asking ourselves
the same question.

95
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,482
Well, we'll stay in touch.

96
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,865
Well, the good news is
I don't think she remembers meeting us.

97
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,825
Thank God for memory dust.

98
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,327
Yeah, but it's not
100 per cent guaranteed.

99
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,831
If we give her the slightest cause,
her memory could come back.

100
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:39,334
Which is another reason we
need to find the demon who did this.

101
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,299
Come closer, Lantos.

102
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,678
You can tell me why you failed from here
just as easily as from over there.

103
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,598
I'm confident the witch
will be alone again soon.

104
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,684
I don't have time for soon!

105
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,562
I need a lock of hair now!

106
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:03,817
The only way to weaken Zankou is to
take out his most trusted lieutenants...

107
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,613
Daleek, Benzor, Linson.

108
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,114
All above ground.

109
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:14,077
All of whom I can only get to with
the help of the beautiful Charmed Ones.

110
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,332
Tell me, Lantos...

111
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,959
Do you think I'm beautiful too?

112
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,669
Of course.

113
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,423
Do you want another scar?

114
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,801
I can make you look like me
in no time, you know.

115
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,222
To your chambers!

116
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,184
We can't wait any longer.

117
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:40,771
I reported to The Source.
I won't do the same with his successor.

118
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,357
I'll need at least
a half a dozen more demons.

119
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,235
You can't overcome
the sisters with force...

120
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,153
Especially not Piper.

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,656
Since she'll be
expecting another attack,

122
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,867
I need you to go after
a different sister instead.

123
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,118
Phoebe.

124
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,705
Why not Paige?
She's less intuitive, more predictable.

125
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,833
But she's also a Whitelighter now.

126
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,752
Which puts her in
constant contact with the Elders.

127
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,171
Besides, Phoebe's a celebrity.

128
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,590
Idolised. Envied.

129
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,093
The way I deserve to be.

130
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,762
And someday will be.

131
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,145
Lawyers!

132
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,983
There should be a special place in hell
for each and every one of them!

133
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,777
Okay, before you freak out,
let me tell you about...

134
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,029
- I mean, talk about an attack!
- Exactly.

135
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,156
The paper's been sued
by a few people,

136
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,201
and the legal department's
clamping down on reporters.

137
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,746
- You're not a reporter. Anyway, other...
- But I'm a columnist.

138
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,125
They're saying I could actually
be sued if I gave bad advice.

139
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:47,379
So they want every one of my columns
to be reviewed by a professional shrink!

140
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:51,175
Okay, well technically
you're not a real shrink. So as I...

141
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,760
Excuse me!
Bachelor's degree, four years.

142
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,430
My readers don't care
about my credentials.

143
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,474
- All they care about is my insight.
- Yes, that is true.

144
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,936
Now why don't you direct that
famous insight towards the fact

145
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:07,524
- that I was attacked at P3 today.
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?

146
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,569
I'm alive. The demons won't be
when I'm done with them.

147
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,154
Providing I can find them.

148
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,324
- They're not in the Book?
- Too many fit the description.

149
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,452
God, that is so weird.
Demons never attack at P3.

150
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,455
Even weirder,
I don't think they wanted to kill me.

151
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:25,167
One of them could have nailed me
with a fireball, but then didn't.

152
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,920
Here.

153
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,672
- What's this?
- New policy.

154
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,050
We carry them
for protection at all times.

155
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:36,053
- If we don't know what kind of demon...
- Doesn't matter.

156
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,305
If it doesn't kill 'em,
it'll stun 'em.

157
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,766
Wow, and I thought
I was on a rampage.

158
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:45,270
I'm sending the Underworld a message.
"Back off and let me live my life."

159
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:49,399
And I'm going to help you with that.
First, I have to deal with my column.

160
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,529
- Want me to have a life too, don't you?
- If you must.

161
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,409
- Anything else, sir?
- I need a copy to go to every teacher,

162
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,288
and tell Mr Feeney a definite "yes"
on the after school TK classes.

163
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,415
I'll take care of it right away.

164
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,793
So you're bummed with your charge?

165
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,879
- Yeah, I'd say majorly.
- Don't let it get you down.

166
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,423
Reluctant charges
come with the territory.

167
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,468
I'm wishing the Elders
could've given me more to go on.

168
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,638
He told me he's had
several Whitelighters

169
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:23,183
and has the power of hyperspeed.
I could've found that on Google.

170
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,477
Hold that thought. Yes?

171
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:29,481
I'm not feeling well. Could you
fill in for me at corporealising class?

172
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,776
- No problem. Go home and rest.
- Thanks.

173
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,447
- What?
- Nothing.

174
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,617
- You're just impressive, that's all.
- What do you mean?

175
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,036
I was headmistress of this school
for a year

176
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,165
and you make it look easy,
and I know it's anything but.

177
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,541
Thanks.

178
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,209
So you need an assistant?

179
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,795
- Paige...
- What? I don't think I'm cut out

180
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,965
for Whitelighter stuff.
I still don't trust the Elders.

181
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,426
'Cause they didn't tell you everything?

182
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:00,429
They don't. They want you
to get to know your charges.

183
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,348
Why send me out to some guy
who hates Whitelighters,

184
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,685
- and doesn't wanna talk to me?
- Gotta find a way to make him.

185
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,522
It's your job. You're his guide.
If you don't get him to use his powers,

186
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,983
a lot of future innocents
are gonna be lost.

187
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,443
No pressure there.

188
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,446
The Elders wouldn't give you
this assignment if they

189
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:21,116
didn't think you can handle it.
Use your instincts. Be creative.

190
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:26,830
Look, once I had these charges
who were a little less than willing

191
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:30,667
to use their powers. So I had to
assimilate myself into their lives.

192
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,795
Get them to trust me
before I could help them.

193
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,841
Pretended to be a handyman.
Worked like a charm.

194
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,219
Let me guess...
You married one of them?

195
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:44,223
Let's say that the Charmed Ones
make Mitchell look like a piece of cake.

196
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,731
I don't care what they say
in the legal department.

197
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:55,776
That guy is not touching
one word of what I've written!

198
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,820
All right, you know what,
I'll be up there in a second.

199
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,689
It's my favourite scissors.
I knew I left them somewhere.

200
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,198
What pretty hair she has.

201
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,327
This is going to be fun.

202
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,413
I was lucky to get out of there alive.

203
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,166
- Her powers of intuition are...
- Won't do any good

204
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,835
once she's trapped inside my cage.

205
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,297
- If her sisters can anticipate like...
- They can't.

206
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,883
Phoebe's power's unique.

207
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,137
I wonder how men look at her.
With lustful hearts, no doubt.

208
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:08,307
Maybe we should hold off
on the transfer till we're sure...

209
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:12,269
How long have we been watching them?
We know them better than anyone,

210
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,062
including Zankou.

211
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,689
But their bond is strong.

212
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,150
To fool them even for a day we...

213
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,695
Like I said, we've learned enough.

214
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,993
I cannot believe
they cut a piece from my hair.

215
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,246
- I just spent $250 on a cut and colour.
- What?!

216
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,457
You spent $250 on a haircut?

217
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,793
You could've bought a week's
worth of groceries with that.

218
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,923
I don't think the price of my haircut
should be your main concern right now.

219
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,967
Okay, you're right.
Actually, this is good news.

220
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,094
- For whom, exactly?
- All of us.

221
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,639
How many demons
specialise in cutting hair?

222
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,600
Should make 'em easier to find.
What'd he look like,

223
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:55,437
- long coat and greasy hair?
- Wielding some scissors, which I have.

224
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,481
Good. We can use them to scry with.

225
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:01,902
I'll drop 'em off as soon as I deal with
someone else who wants a piece of me.

226
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,238
- I gotta go.
- Wait... Phoebe, wait.

227
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,867
Miss Halliwell, hello.
I'm Dr Randall.

228
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,745
Yes, I know exactly who you are.

229
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,122
You're the guy here to ruin my column.

230
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,333
I sense some displaced anger.

231
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,628
No, it's very well placed.
You can put your red pencil away.

232
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,047
You're not touching
a thing I've written.

233
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:24,591
I'm afraid you don't
have a say in the matter.

234
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:29,429
Really? Because the column is called
Ask Phoebe, so I'm pretty sure I do.

235
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,914
Let me remind you...
You're not the doctor, I am.

236
00:15:56,081 --> 00:16:00,085
After all, I don't see
any diplomas on your walls.

237
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,263
Nice...

238
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,348
What's going on? Where am I?

239
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,810
You're with us now, Phoebe.
Get in the cage.

240
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,937
Hello, witch...

241
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:22,858
I hope you enjoy the view.
It'll be the last one you ever have.

242
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,988
So, whether you like it or not,

243
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:31,158
you and I are going to be
working together for a long time.

244
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:35,537
- Do we understand each other?
- Do you think I'm hot?

245
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,414
Excuse me?

246
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:43,462
This is gonna be fun.

247
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,555
- Any luck finding our demons?
- Nope.

248
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,058
Well, good.
I'm glad it just wasn't me.

249
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,893
- By the way, thanks.
- For what?

250
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,562
For coming home to help
in the middle of the day.

251
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,481
- You were attacked.
- Yeah...

252
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:04,900
I'm working on that
not happening so much.

253
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:08,153
You can't scare away all the demons
all the time, you know.

254
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,199
No, but I can make them think twice
about attacking again, can't I?

255
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,535
I'd like to think one day
you'd come home

256
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,329
in the middle of the day for,
I don't know, lunch?

257
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:23,377
You know we could find something
else to do for like an hour or so.

258
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,796
Take it easy. Keep checking.

259
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:33,095
I'm thinking whoever wanted the hair
was working for an upper-level demon.

260
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,722
The question is... Who?

261
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,060
- Soul-swapper?
- Could be.

262
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:44,231
Or voodoo priestess.
Or witch doctor. Or demonic cloner.

263
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,733
A cloner. That wouldn't be
such a bad thing.

264
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,153
At least then I'd have
another sister to fight demons with.

265
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,030
Did someone say fight demons?

266
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,242
'Cause I am so there.

267
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,579
- What're you doing back so soon?
- What do you mean?

268
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,414
What happened with the shrink?

269
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh, I took care of him.

270
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,628
Oh, my God...

271
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,673
Oh, for God sakes.
Your hair looks fine.

272
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,843
We should go and check
the Book of Shadows again.

273
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,971
- I already checked it.
- Maybe we should check again.

274
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:20,267
I'm just saying we have to
fight demons, right?

275
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,453
Any idea what these
demon creeps are looking for?

276
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,957
Not yet. The more I think about it, the
more I'm leaning towards soul-swapping.

277
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,961
Soul-swapping?
No... I don't buy it.

278
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:51,673
If it was voodoo, they could've stolen
a comb or a brush to get hair.

279
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,636
See, soul-swapping is more powerful.
It requires fresh ingredients,

280
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,222
which explains why
they need fresh cut hair.

281
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,724
Demons have tried to
impersonate us before

282
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,852
and it's never worked.
We just know each other too well.

283
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,187
She's got a point.

284
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:08,899
Besides, at least we still have
the scissors to scry for them with.

285
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:13,487
- Scissors?
- Are they in your purse? I'll get them.

286
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,699
- Phoebe?
- What?

287
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:21,411
- Did you have a premonition?
- Yes, I did.

288
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,956
A very big one.

289
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:27,626
This is the guy. This is the guy
we're looking for, right here.

290
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,046
Daleek?

291
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:35,384
- He doesn't look like the demons.
- Are you sure?

292
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,805
- Maybe he was working with 'em.
- Yeah, that's probably it.

293
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:44,893
"Works above ground."
It could be a Zankou plant.

294
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,813
But it doesn't say anything
about him cutting hair.

295
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,525
But I saw him posing
as a civilian in my premonition.

296
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,402
What more proof do we need?

297
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,947
- Okay...
- Great, I'll meet you downstairs.

298
00:19:57,114 --> 00:20:00,075
I'm gonna go slip into
something a little bit more sexy.

299
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,662
Sexy? We're killing a demon,
not going to the club.

300
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:07,332
Did I say sexy?
I meant comfortable.

301
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,334
Wait!

302
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,461
God, now what?

303
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:15,465
Maybe we shouldn't go after this guy
till we have the Power of Three.

304
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,594
You can call Paige,
but she's a Whitelighter.

305
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,138
You gotta get used to
working without her.

306
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,098
- What he said.
- You have potions.

307
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,768
If it's an upper-level demon,
it's nothing you haven't handled.

308
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,396
Couldn't have said it
any better myself.

309
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,565
I'm gonna go change.

310
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,117
You have somewhere to go?

311
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,997
I can't believe I was worried
we wouldn't pull this off.

312
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,166
I'll get out of here eventually.

313
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,544
With a face like that,
you're better off in the cage.

314
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,924
Don't feel all that charmed now, do you?

315
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,968
My sisters will get me
out of this cage and this body!

316
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,513
You forget. For them
to come to your rescue,

317
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,973
they have to realise
lmara's in your body.

318
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,601
Don't think they can tell
when there's a demon?

319
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:11,021
There was a demon.
Not long ago. Zankou.

320
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:14,441
Everything he learned, we learned.
Imara broke into his lair,

321
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,444
stole his information,
knows everything about you.

322
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:20,155
I don't care.
My sisters'll figure it out.

323
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,658
It'll be too late
for both you and Zankou.

324
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:27,037
We've killed his allies. Weakened him
to where he can't rule. As for you...

325
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:30,290
You're keeping lmara's body alive
so her soul can return.

326
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,627
Too bad there won't be a body
for your soul to return to.

327
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,180
No.

328
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,520
Help me!

329
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:54,606
Please! Someone!

330
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,108
Help!

331
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,335
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

332
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:20,883
- Surprise.
- What the hell?

333
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,635
What're you doing?
You out of your mind?

334
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,972
I'm trying to show you
that your powers can save lives.

335
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:29,808
You didn't have to save mine,
but you could've.

336
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:32,060
- So you tricked me.
- Technically.

337
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:35,898
Here's the thing. I'm trying to
remind you of what your powers can do,

338
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,901
and why you can't just
walk away from a gift like that.

339
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,111
- The hell I can't.
- Mitchell, please!

340
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,989
You don't know me.
You don't know me at all.

341
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,869
Can someone tell me
why I'm trying to help this person?

342
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:52,414
You crashed your car?

343
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:55,000
It was a rental.
What? I got the insurance.

344
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,960
That's not the point, Paige.

345
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,421
You told me to
trust my instincts. I did.

346
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,715
Yeah, to earn his trust,
not destroy it.

347
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:05,093
Maybe there's a reason
nobody's able to get through to him.

348
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,221
Maybe he just can't be gotten to.

349
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:10,557
I don't think there's any such thing
as a lost cause, Paige.

350
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,227
- Maybe it's time to get somebody else.
- Paige...

351
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:16,688
I mean it! Call the Elders.
Have 'em get another Whitelighter.

352
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:20,150
- I'm done. I can't do it.
- So you're just gonna give up.

353
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:26,740
I cannot force Mitchell
to be a witch. I can't.

354
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,243
- Maybe that's your problem.
- What?

355
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,870
He's not just a witch, Paige.
He's a person too.

356
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:35,582
He was a person first.
Your powers are tied to your emotions.

357
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,294
Stop concentrating on him as a witch.
Start focusing on him as a man.

358
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,596
We're vanquishing a city councilman?

359
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:52,307
- Are you crazy?
- I saw him posing as a civilian.

360
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,017
You were fine with it before.

361
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:58,021
I thought we were gonna find him in
an alley or a warehouse. Not downtown.

362
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,566
You insisted I come home
so we'd deal with it.

363
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:03,735
Stop clickety-clacking
in those things for one second.

364
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,780
I wanna kill demons as much as you.
Probably even more.

365
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:10,534
We can't afford to be reckless.
Especially with Sheridan lurking.

366
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,287
- Sheridan?
- Yeah. This morning at the bar?

367
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,707
Oh, right. Sorry.
I got demon-councilman on the brain.

368
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:19,501
We really don't want her
on our case again.

369
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,044
What are you doing?

370
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:24,214
- Are you checking yourself out?
- Yeah, it's not a crime.

371
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,050
No, but now is not the time.
Don't be so vain.

372
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:29,553
I just wanna look presentable.

373
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,055
We are meeting a councilman,
for God sakes.

374
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:34,391
Then maybe you should put on a jacket.

375
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:37,311
A councilman you think might be evil.

376
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:40,689
I know is evil. You will too,
once you freeze the scene.

377
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:43,400
Yeah, if he's upper-level
he's not freezin'.

378
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:44,902
Can I help you?

379
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:47,487
No.

380
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:56,413
Excuse me, Councilman Wexler?

381
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:59,541
I'm sorry, do we have an appointment?

382
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,461
No, Daleek.
Actually, we don't.

383
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:11,220
Wow, that was awesome!
What was in there?

384
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:12,846
Who cares? Let's go.

385
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:15,849
Hey, what's the rush?
Everyone's frozen anyway.

386
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,227
I don't want to be here
when they unfreeze

387
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:20,395
and figure out their boss is missing.

388
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,648
No one will ever know we were here.

389
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:32,199
I think we should just concentrate
on the demon who actually attacked us.

390
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,034
- We'll get him.
- When?

391
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:37,162
Well, when I try and get
a few more premonitions.

392
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,915
I mean, who knows
how many demons Zankou has.

393
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:42,501
Our first demon still has
a piece of your hair.

394
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:45,254
Who knows when he's
gonna use it, or come for more.

395
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,590
Who cares? With a face like this,
I can be bald and look great.

396
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:51,510
- What the hell's gotten into you?
- What do you mean?

397
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:54,721
What do I mean? You're walking
around like a crazy person.

398
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:58,642
That is, when you're not checking
yourself out in every shiny surface!

399
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:01,979
Well, I think I'm just a little
scattered and overwhelmed

400
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,857
with the column
and all these demons...

401
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:07,234
And trying to help you
find a normal life.

402
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:10,946
I appreciate that, but it doesn't
require us going a mile a minute.

403
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:14,074
Well, you wanted to make
a statement to the demon world.

404
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:17,327
What better statement than
to kill a lot of demons, right?

405
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,454
Right. Where are you going?

406
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:21,790
I'm going upstairs to change my outfit.

407
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:24,418
I've been in this for the last hour.

408
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,510
- Inspector, hello.
- Piper.

409
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:36,221
What brings you all the way out here?

410
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,557
Well, actually, this does.

411
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:40,809
The city councilman's missing.

412
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:43,979
According to that photograph
the two of you were the last

413
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:46,899
- to see him before he disappeared.
- You think we had

414
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,318
- something to do with that?
- I don't know.

415
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:51,778
- Did you?
- No!

416
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:55,949
We went to talk to him about some
branches hanging over our back yard.

417
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:59,495
Interesting. Considering he's
not really your councilman.

418
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:03,582
Right. Which we figured out
when we talked to him.

419
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:07,044
- Satisfied?
- No, I'm not.

420
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:11,465
First, a robbery that doesn't look like
a robbery. Then a councilman vanishes.

421
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:14,927
- Both times one of you was there.
- Coincidence.

422
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:17,554
I don't believe in coincidences.

423
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,390
We'll keep in touch.

424
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,859
Come on, Phoebe.
There's gotta be a way out of here.

425
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:34,863
Hey, give it a rest, will you?
You're tiring out her body.

426
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,951
Imara's gonna need her strength
when she returns to kill your sisters.

427
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:42,746
Yeah? What makes you think
I'd let any demon...

428
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:49,086
What's the matter with you? Get up!

429
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:52,673
What happened?

430
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,550
What am I doing here?

431
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:58,846
They've figured it out.
They reversed the spell.

432
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:02,432
Don't just stand there, fools.
Let me out of here!

433
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,935
- What're you talking about?
- Don't you see?

434
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:07,813
The witches switched
our souls back. It's me.

435
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,399
- Imara.
- Hurry! We don't have much time.

436
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:13,569
- Open up and let me out.
- Wait!

437
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:17,823
- How do we know it's really you?
- You dare challenge me?

438
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,243
Open the cage or I'll kill you both!

439
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,452
Same temper.

440
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:26,748
We've been planning for months and
they figure it out in a couple of hours?

441
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,375
I don't think so.

442
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:32,379
They wouldn't have suspected anything
if you hadn't left the scissors.

443
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:34,882
That's right.
You screwed up!

444
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,467
Let me out before
they get here and kill us all.

445
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:41,263
Stay here. I'm gonna go
above ground. See for myself.

446
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,808
Idiot! Phoebe will kill you
the moment she sees you.

447
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:48,145
Unless you're Phoebe,
and this is just a trick.

448
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:50,105
Don't let her out until I return.

449
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:56,069
The witches will vanquish him!
Then they'll come and vanquish you,

450
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,238
unless you let me out of here now.

451
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:09,041
Hi.

452
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,919
Get out.

453
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:14,004
Nope, not going away this time.

454
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:17,925
And neither are you.

455
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,511
I know why you
stopped using magic, okay.

456
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:23,514
- I did some research.
- You don't know anything.

457
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,225
- I know what happened.
- Leave me alone.

458
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:30,312
You're not gonna run from me
like from the others.

459
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:33,106
Something happened
to your fiancée, right?

460
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:34,483
Jennifer?

461
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:40,197
I can do this all night.

462
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,282
Why are you doing this to me?

463
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:46,912
Look, I don't give a rat's ass
about you being a witch or not.

464
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,330
I'm trying to help you.

465
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:52,543
You're not just running from your gift.
You're running away from yourself.

466
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:57,631
- You really loved her, didn't you?
- Yes, I did.

467
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,926
How'd she die?

468
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:05,556
I was supposed to meet her...

469
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,808
I was late.
I can't remember why.

470
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:11,311
By the time I got there,
they had already killed her.

471
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:12,855
Demons.

472
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:16,358
They didn't want her. She didn't
even know what they were,

473
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:18,360
or who I was.

474
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:22,406
They were there for me,
but I was... late.

475
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:25,450
If only I used my speed,
I might've been there on time...

476
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:28,412
You can't know that.
You're never gonna know.

477
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:30,706
When my parents died,
I blamed myself.

478
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:33,667
I even used magic to try to
go back in time and fix it.

479
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:34,877
But I couldn't.

480
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:38,130
Thing is, we're never gonna
be able to fix everything,

481
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:40,799
or save everybody,
because at the end of the day,

482
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:43,218
you and I, we're just...

483
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:47,514
...people that have
the ability to help other people.

484
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:56,315
Aren't you cold?

485
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:59,109
No, but then again,
I actually have clothes on.

486
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:02,779
I know it's kind of skimpy.
It was so cute, I couldn't help myself.

487
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,823
Okay, can we
get back to the demons?

488
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,451
Right. You betcha.

489
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:09,661
Let's see...

490
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:13,999
Benzor!

491
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,959
- Benzor?
- Upper-level demon.

492
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:19,588
I saw him posing as a judge,
and he's probably working for Zankou.

493
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:22,966
- You got all that from one premonition?
- Pretty good, huh?

494
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:28,180
You gonna get that?

495
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:31,350
- Your phone.
- Oh, right.

496
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,691
Hello?

497
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:41,735
Dr Randall?

498
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:45,197
Oh, yes... Dr Randall.

499
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:49,827
You know what? Do what you want
because I don't really care.

500
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,415
I'll be right back.

501
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,798
- What are you doing here?
- Imara?

502
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:06,260
Who else would it be?
Why aren't you watching the witch?

503
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:09,012
She said they sent you
back to your body.

504
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,639
- I came to check.
- What?

505
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:13,517
- Phoebe? Who are you talking to?
- Piper, help!

506
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:15,853
- What are you doing?
- Covering.

507
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,772
- Blow him up!
- No!

508
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:25,279
That was close, huh?

509
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:27,906
That was the demon
that attacked me in the club.

510
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:29,867
And me in the elevator.

511
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:31,702
Hey, what's up?

512
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:34,872
- Paige, good. You're just in time.
- For what?

513
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:37,916
To help us vanquish
the demon that's trying to kill us.

514
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:41,587
- How do you know who it is?
- The demon we just vanquished

515
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:44,548
said her name. It's...

516
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:50,679
...lmara.

517
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,639
We have to vanquish her right away.

518
00:32:57,728 --> 00:33:01,523
- I can't let you out, she'll kill me.
- She is me!

519
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:04,318
- But Lantos said...
- Lantos is dead.

520
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,528
Otherwise, he'd have returned by now.

521
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:07,821
I don't know.

522
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:10,949
If you do nothing, you'll be
vanquished by the witches.

523
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:15,370
But if you free me, you'll take
Lantos' place and rule by my side.

524
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:26,673
You made a wise decision.

525
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:32,429
Phoebe! No!

526
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,601
Well, it took you long enough.

527
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,647
- Actually, I think we're right on time.
- No! Don't!

528
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:52,908
What was that?

529
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,493
That was Phoebe's soul.

530
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:57,621
We just killed your sister.

531
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:07,798
I told you it was a soul swap, didn't I?

532
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:10,717
I don't think now is
the time for "I told you so."

533
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:14,555
I think it's the perfect time.
There was obviously something wrong.

534
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:18,016
- Why didn't I do something?
- I don't think beating yourself up

535
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:20,644
- is gonna do any good.
- How could we have known?

536
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:23,188
She took over
Phoebe's body to kill demons.

537
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:26,108
- It's what Phoebe does.
- No, not lately it isn't.

538
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:28,777
Not with everything
going on at work with her.

539
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:31,905
I should have done something.
I can't believe I didn't...

540
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:34,741
We should just concentrate
on getting her back.

541
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,661
Back? Paige, her soul floated away.

542
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:40,622
- She's gone!
- Not necessarily.

543
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:42,499
We've dealt with spirits before.

544
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:45,794
They can keep from moving on
if their will is strong enough.

545
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:47,296
Phoebe's definitely is.

546
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:50,340
Okay, fine. Great.
But lmara is still in her body,

547
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,968
and I don't see her
in a hurry to give it up.

548
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:55,929
Yeah, especially since we
blew up her demonic body...

549
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,473
Not that I'm saying
it's anybody's fault.

550
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,811
Do another soul-swap. Put Phoebe's
back in her body and send lmara's to...

551
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,856
- What, oblivion?
- You have to do the same ritual.

552
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:09,026
That requires a piece of Phoebe's hair.
I don't see lmara

553
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:11,278
letting us get close enough to try.

554
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:15,657
No, but I think I might know
somebody who can.

555
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,168
Thomas Hendricks?

556
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:29,254
- Where'd you come from?
- Judge Thomas Hendricks?

557
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:31,089
Who are you?

558
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,759
Someone who doesn't
wanna work for your boss...

559
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:35,302
...Zankou.

560
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:41,016
That was my favourite minion.

561
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,811
All right, who's next?

562
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:47,147
Thanks.

563
00:35:57,449 --> 00:36:00,577
- She's pretty pissed.
- Thanks.

564
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,248
Wait...

565
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,584
Now.

566
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:11,463
Lock of hair, completes our goal
to help us reclaim our sister's soul

567
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,757
Banish this demon, spare no pain

568
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:16,385
Bring Phoebe back
from the ghostly plane

569
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,493
- Are you okay?
- No, I am not okay!

570
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,996
How could you not know
that was inside me?

571
00:36:44,163 --> 00:36:47,207
- Don't start with me.
- Who's this guy?

572
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:50,878
This is my first charge, Mitchell.

573
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:54,590
- He saved you.
- Oh, thank you.

574
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:57,176
Don't thank me,
thank my Whitelighter.

575
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:00,679
- She saved me.
- He's cute.

576
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:03,015
She's back.

577
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:26,663
- Do I even wanna read this?
- I don't see why not,

578
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,374
considering it's word for word
what you wrote.

579
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:32,377
Dr Randall is no longer with the paper.

580
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:36,548
- Really? Did you fire him?
- He didn't leave me much choice.

581
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:40,052
He... He claimed you came on to him.

582
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:43,347
- I did?
- Exactly.

583
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:45,182
And that was just his first lie.

584
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:49,019
He said you told him he could do
whatever he wanted with the column.

585
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:51,188
That you didn't care
one way or other.

586
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:53,732
He must have me confused
with someone else.

587
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:56,902
Which is what I said when
I kicked his butt out the door.

588
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:59,488
That's fine by me.
Are you hiring someone else?

589
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:02,866
I told legal we never had a problem
with your column before,

590
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:05,494
and until we do, back off.

591
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:08,205
I appreciate that
vote of confidence, Elise.

592
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:09,790
But I've been thinking...

593
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:13,794
Maybe my column could use
a little bit more professional insight.

594
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:15,045
How so?

595
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:19,258
I'll let you know.
Gotta run it by my sisters first.

596
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:36,316
Hey, how'd you
fix this place up so fast?

597
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,236
Potions? Spells?

598
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:41,530
Even better... Husband.

599
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:46,201
Getting Leo to go back to work.
Nothing says normal quite like that.

600
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:48,954
And we haven't had
a demon attack all day.

601
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,957
Hopefully, the demon world
took note of our rampage.

602
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:55,002
I don't think killing lmara
constitutes a rampage.

603
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:58,463
No, but killing lmara,
Daleek and Benzor does.

604
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,174
We didn't kill the last two.

605
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,052
- The demon world doesn't know that.
- No, they just think I did it.

606
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:06,430
- Which is fine by me, actually.
- Me too.

607
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:07,639
Okay.

608
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:10,976
So, you guys wanna know what
the real Phoebe is gonna do next?

609
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:12,186
What?

610
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:14,688
I've decided I'm gonna
go back to college.

611
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:16,982
College? Again?

612
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:19,735
Yeah, I think I wanna get
my graduate degree.

613
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:22,112
This way the paper
will get off my back.

614
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:25,199
I can get my professional credentials
and, who knows,

615
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,201
maybe even be a better columnist.

616
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,870
What happened to the woman
who said her readers

617
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:33,582
- don't care about credentials?
- Well, as a future psychologist

618
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:37,628
- I can honestly say that I was...
- Swimming in a big bag of denial?

619
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:40,923
- Yes, exactly.
- What about the shrink at work?

620
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:45,219
- I don't think he'll be a problem.
- Well, girls, unfortunately,

621
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:48,138
I think Inspector Sheridan
is going to be a problem.

622
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:51,767
- Wait, she's on our case again?
- And how!

623
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:04,988
Did you hear about Judge Hendricks?

624
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:06,573
No. What?

625
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,618
He disappeared too.
It must be an epidemic.

626
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:11,829
It must be.

627
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:14,331
If you need a hand with
the councilman's case,

628
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:15,541
just let me know.

629
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:18,544
No, it's all right. I got it.
