1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,340
Today, we're gonna be talking about
The Five-Minute Orgasm,

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,968
a new book written by Nina Halter.

3
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,178
Hi, Nina, welcome.

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,640
Thank you. It's an honour
to be on your show, Phoebe.

5
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,518
You're gonna get me in trouble.
It's not my show, I'm a guest host.

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,520
Oh, I'm sorry, but
I've been watching all week

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,856
and I love, love, love your topics.

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,526
- So provocative.
- Thank you very much.

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,569
And speaking of provocative,

10
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,072
we should probably talk about this
book here of yours.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,490
It's wonderful, isn't it?

12
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,326
To be honest with you, I haven't
been able to read the whole thing

13
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,828
because I haven't had time,
but I love the title:

14
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,623
The Five-Minute Orgasm, amazing.

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,626
Okay, so I guess the first question
would be:

16
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,711
Why only five minutes?

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,964
I mean, don't you think that's
rushing it a bit?

18
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,968
You misunderstood. It's not about
having one in five minutes,

19
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,096
it's about having an orgasm
for five minutes.

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,434
Oh, well, is this my copy?

21
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,397
Okay, so let's just
cut to the chase here

22
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:08,944
and I'm gonna ask you, how does one
experience this phenomenon?

23
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:13,532
Well, it's really quite simple, really.
First...

24
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,500
Chris!

25
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,379
- Piper, let's go.
- No, Wyatt's upstairs.

26
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,631
Just go get my sisters.

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,510
This is just fascinating stuff.

28
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:37,264
I have to ask you,
does it work for guys too?

29
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,517
Well, there is a technique,

30
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,519
- but it's quite dangerous.
- Dangerous?

31
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,563
Really?

32
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,197
Oh, no, you don't.

33
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,385
I don't understand it.
This trick worked in '68.

34
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,471
You forgot the saws, dear.

35
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,181
I forgot the whats?

36
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,433
It's okay. I got you covered.

37
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,409
How'd they do that?

38
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,580
So wait, a vortex did all of this?

39
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,209
Vortex, whirlpool, I don't know,
whatever.

40
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,878
Well, if it's a whirlpool,
there would probably be some water.

41
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,006
The fineries of what almost killed Piper
aren't important. The point is,

42
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,300
she was almost killed
and no one was here to help.

43
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,720
You're right, I'm sorry.
I was kind of tied up. Or cut in half.

44
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,974
And I was interviewing
the most fascinating woman.

45
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,226
Oh, the orgasm lady!
That show was great.

46
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,938
At least what I saw of it
until the TV was sucked into oblivion.

47
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,148
I hope you brought home that book.

48
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,985
Piper, doesn't it bother you
you had to vanquish that demon alone?

49
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,987
Yeah, well, sure.

50
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,488
But, you know, we all have lives,

51
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,491
which is why I need this place
cleaned up before my guests arrive.

52
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,868
Who's coming?

53
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,662
Mary has designed a fashion line
and she wants to show us all.

54
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,163
I love clothes.

55
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,832
Wait, we've got a demon to hunt.

56
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,209
If I could just find him in here.

57
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,336
Okay, but regardless of
what you find in there,

58
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:41,425
I'm gonna be with my friends, because
I will have a normal life if it kills me.

59
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,345
Piper, why don't you have Leo heal
that when he comes to pick up Wyatt?

60
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,182
Because I don't need magic
to heal a cut.

61
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,309
I'd use magic for everything
if I could.

62
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,228
Well, if I had done this fighting
a demon that would be one thing.

63
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:56,023
But I did it in the kitchen,
the chef did it in the kitchen,

64
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,276
so that person will wear this bandage
for the shame of it all.

65
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,196
Well, this book is not gonna help us.

66
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,615
But I've seen vortexes like that before.

67
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,075
You know, this job would be
so much easier

68
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,828
if there weren't so many roses.

69
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,079
What's with all the roses?

70
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,708
I think Jason thinks that he's losing me
and as an empath,

71
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:18,587
I don't know who's feeling what
anymore and I just have my guard up.

72
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,881
You should know that the
vortexes suck their victims

73
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,549
into pocket realms
or alternate realities.

74
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,052
You know, sometimes guys can be
funny like that, you know.

75
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,930
The more you pull away,
the more they come back at you.

76
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,517
Yeah, but I'm not pulling away.
I really like him.

77
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,894
Dangerous alternate realities,
people.

78
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,897
Based on fantasies.
Desires. Dreams.

79
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,818
So stop worrying about it
and let him wine and dine you.

80
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,862
I mean, a little wooing
never killed anyone.

81
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,739
But a demon can,
so can we please,

82
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,491
please, let's focus.

83
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,493
Piper, you were almost sent
to another world.

84
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,245
That takes serious magic.

85
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,580
Magic. Brilliant idea.

86
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,584
Let the object of objection
become but a dream

87
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:01,380
As I cause the scene to be unseen

88
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,928
Well, call me butter
because I'm on a roll.

89
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,264
Wow, that's much better.
Thanks, Paige.

90
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,182
Yep, well, gotta get back
to the temp job.

91
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,143
Don't know how much longer those
old folks are gonna be alive.

92
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,521
And I'll walk you out because

93
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,398
- I have to meet Jason for lunch.
- Yo!

94
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,650
No. No, no. We have a demon to hunt.
Get back here!

95
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,403
See you later, Chris.
We'll talk about it later.

96
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,698
You are our new favourite whitelighter
and all, but you need to lighten up.

97
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,241
No, you three need to get serious.

98
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:32,077
If you keep putting your personal
lives before your Wiccan duties,

99
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,413
- you're gonna pay for it.
- Maybe so, but not today.

100
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,540
I scared away the demon,
he's not coming back,

101
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:41,086
I have friends coming and I also have
chocolate chip cookies in the oven.

102
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,801
It's your fault I have to do this now.

103
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,609
- You!
- Wait, before you...

104
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,825
Would you just relax?
I didn't come here to vanquish you.

105
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,870
How did you find me here?
No one's ever been to my lair.

106
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,207
I didn't have to find you, Gith.
I know you.

107
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,167
From the future.

108
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,419
I came here to give you what you want.

109
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,380
The Charmed Ones.

110
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,055
So I'm sitting there in the middle
of this board meeting

111
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,725
and I completely lose all concentration
because all I can think about is you.

112
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,645
It's like they were speaking
a foreign language.

113
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,188
Well, you were in Hong Kong.

114
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,149
The point is, I flew straight back.

115
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,401
So you could regain
your concentration?

116
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,403
To concentrate on you.

117
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:52,032
Well, I will try to keep your mind
from wandering.

118
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:53,825
What's it gonna be tonight,

119
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,453
box seats at La BohÃ©me
or backstage at Metallica?

120
00:08:56,662 --> 00:09:00,582
Phoebe? Oh, my God.
I'm sorry. Could you...?

121
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,584
Yeah, absolutely.

122
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,670
You know, I've been watching you
on TV all week.

123
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,380
You were huge.

124
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,591
Oh, well, the TV does add ten pounds.

125
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,552
Oh, no, no...!

126
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,721
Oh, there it is, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean it like that at all.

127
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,684
- No, I know what you meant.
- Okay.

128
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,562
Thank you. Bye.

129
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,400
She's right, you know.
You could be huge.

130
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,735
I'm taping my last show today.

131
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,196
It doesn't have to end.

132
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,615
I own TV stations all around the world.

133
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,243
Are you offering me the world,
Jason Dean?

134
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,912
Yes. All except Kazakhstan,
I don't have stations there.

135
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,377
Look, I appreciate you hopping your jet
to see me.

136
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:49,923
And the roses,
all ten dozen of them,

137
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,508
and the shows and the dinners

138
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,469
and the private concert by the
San Francisco Symphony.

139
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,972
- But?
- No.

140
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,516
No buts. I like you.

141
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,060
I like you a lot,
and you don't have to try so hard.

142
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,104
- I know.
- You do?

143
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,816
You're a very easy girl to please
and I love that about you.

144
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,943
But have you ever stopped
to consider that

145
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,571
maybe I enjoy
doing these things for you?

146
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,200
No, actually,
that never occurred to me.

147
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,332
I don't like to talk about it,

148
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,462
but you're dating a minor media mogul
here, so can I make a suggestion?

149
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,005
Sure.

150
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:33,509
Let go. Lose control a little bit.

151
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,428
Trust me and just enjoy the ride.

152
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,138
You mean, let you drive?

153
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,141
I don't know, I'm not a very good...

154
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,522
Passenger.

155
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,704
Oh, look, Daddy's here.

156
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,165
- We need to talk.
- No, you need to orb.

157
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,000
There are diapers in the bag. Here.

158
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,504
Wyatt is very excited to spend
the afternoon with you.

159
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,174
Was that a sneeze?
Are you feeling all right, buddy?

160
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,302
Daddy will heal you up right away
and then take care of Mommy's hand.

161
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,096
No, no, no. No magic, really.

162
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,683
He has a common cold and
babies need to develop immunities.

163
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,601
Not when his father's
a miracle worker.

164
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,396
No, really. If I'm gonna lead
any kind of a normal life,

165
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,232
there will be no healing for any of us.

166
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,359
So you just want him to suffer.

167
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,902
Don't be so dramatic.

168
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:37,072
If he had a serious illness,
I would be the first one to call you.

169
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,366
But he doesn't, so in the meantime,

170
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,827
just watch him and fret,
like a normal person.

171
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,955
Now go.

172
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:49,126
Well, that's...
I can't take Wyatt today.

173
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,295
You can't take Wyatt?
What do you mean?

174
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,921
You asked to take Wyatt.

175
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,673
You know, father-son bonding.

176
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,384
Yeah, that was until I found out
about this.

177
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,802
Do you know where Chris got it?

178
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,053
A swap meet?

179
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:01,555
He killed for it.

180
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,765
The Valkyrie who owned this pendant
was murdered.

181
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:04,975
Leo, this is not cool.

182
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,311
I have people coming here
in ten minutes.

183
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,979
Chris isn't who he says he is.

184
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,523
I know he banished me to Valhalla
and this proves it.

185
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,733
You know what, Leo?

186
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,194
Nothing will ever change with you.
You always find a way

187
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,738
to make your job more important
than your family.

188
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,865
Taking care of my family is my job,
Piper.

189
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,409
And right now I need to find out
what Chris is up to.

190
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:30,417
You must think I'm pretty low
on the evolutionary ladder.

191
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,669
- That's not true.
- A minor horned demon,

192
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,421
a lesser slime devil.

193
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,548
Just another common fiend
with no power.

194
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,009
I have the greatest respect
for your power.

195
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,594
Then don't insult me.

196
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,679
Whitelighters don't kill their charges.

197
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,848
Well, I'm not your typical whitelighter.

198
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,268
I came from the future because
I need the power of the Charmed Ones.

199
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,853
- To do what?
- Not your concern.

200
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:53,232
All you need to know is
they're drifting apart.

201
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,776
How do you mean, "drifting apart"?

202
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,986
They're putting their desires
before their duties.

203
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,780
And that makes them useless to me.

204
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:03,075
You said, "desires"?

205
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,827
You caught that, huh?

206
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,496
That's what you feed off of, right?

207
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,332
Though I never quite understood
how one could eat a desire.

208
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,338
Do you know how much energy is
contained in an unfulfilled desire?

209
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,091
People spend their whole lives
wanting something.

210
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,593
Usually never getting it.

211
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,137
I feed off that energy.

212
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:27,140
Just think how much power
the Charmed Ones must pack.

213
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,309
You... you know their desires.

214
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,936
It's all right here.

215
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,437
With this, no messy vortexes,

216
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:36,441
you can bring them into your world
from the comfort of your own cave.

217
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:43,115
They'll die, you know.
Victims of their own desires.

218
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,700
Is that what you want?

219
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,452
I'm counting on it.
Why else would I offer to help?

220
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,872
So good luck.

221
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,834
And for the sake of both our lives,
don't screw this up.

222
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:01,967
"A normal life with normal friends
and no magic."

223
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,345
Ask and ye shall receive.

224
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,234
Is that a sneeze?

225
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:28,493
Okay, I'm gonna put you down here
for two seconds.

226
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,455
Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on.

227
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:34,917
Okay, you're good. You're okay.

228
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,630
- Hi.
- Hi.

229
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,924
- It's been too long.
- I know.

230
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,343
Oh, I hope you don't mind,
a few friends tagged along.

231
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,471
Oh, no, not at all, Elizabeth said
you might be bringing a few friends.

232
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,556
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

233
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,142
- Five.
- Hello. Oh, I can't wait.

234
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,770
- Or eight.
- Oh, see, I told you,

235
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:58,857
- you should have called her.
- Oh, no, no, really, it's fine.

236
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,610
You have no idea how long
I've been waiting to do this.

237
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,904
Okay. Living room, girls.

238
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,324
They're all dying to see
my new line of lingerie.

239
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,202
- Oh, you design lingerie?
- You're gonna love it.

240
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,455
Oh, sure, just as long as
I don't have to try any of it on.

241
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,040
Well, you'd look silly if you did.

242
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:17,751
You don't have what it takes
to fill the pouch.

243
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:18,961
The pouch?

244
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,796
Meet my models.

245
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,215
Sorry. Hi.

246
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:26,969
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the pouch.

247
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,804
So where can we change?

248
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,558
- My bedroom's free.
- Right this way.

249
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,519
Come on, honey.

250
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,483
And abracadabra.

251
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,449
Where's the...
The rabbit?

252
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,077
The rabbit died last year, dear.

253
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,875
What?

254
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,836
Charlie.

255
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,797
Okay, somebody call 911.

256
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,674
It's his heart.
Charlie, can you hear me?

257
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,718
Hold on, Mr. Rolls,
we're calling an ambulance.

258
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,137
We haven't got time for an ambulance,
he needs help now.

259
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:14,099
All right, I can get him there faster,
but everybody's gotta clear the room.

260
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,643
- I can't leave his side.
- Please, he's gonna die.

261
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:19,563
Just use your magic
and orb him to the hospital.

262
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,939
How do you know?

263
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,150
I think it's a good idea,
you should orb him.

264
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,277
- You know too?
- That you're a witch?

265
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,446
- Everybody knows.
- Yeah.

266
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,780
- Yes.
- Please.

267
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,782
We're running out of time.

268
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,826
All right, all right, just keep it a secret.

269
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,161
Of course.

270
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,666
Hey.

271
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,710
I can't believe I'm taping
my last show today.

272
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,212
This week just flew by.

273
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,255
Usually happens
when you're having a good time.

274
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,175
Yeah, I have to admit, it has been fun.

275
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,469
Thank you, Bret.

276
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,513
You know, it doesn't have to end.

277
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,181
Oh, don't start with that again.

278
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,768
Miss Halliwell, you're on
in 30 seconds.

279
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,061
Okay.

280
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,606
You said you'd enjoy the ride.

281
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,608
- Right.
- So enjoy it.

282
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,069
When you step out on that stage
today, don't hold back.

283
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,196
I want you to lose yourself
in the moment, okay?

284
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,324
- You might be surprised.
- But I don't like surprises.

285
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,206
Okay, you know the drill.

286
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,542
And we're going in five...
four...

287
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,002
three... two...

288
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:35,722
Hi.

289
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:41,353
Welcome to the show.

290
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,068
Welcome to my show.

291
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:02,374
- That was amazing.
- You were amazing.

292
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:06,170
To be in front of a live audience
like that and feel all the passion.

293
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,589
- So you liked it?
- How did you pull it off so fast?

294
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,424
I bought off a lot of people.

295
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:13,468
- Did you buy them too?
- No, those belong to you.

296
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,179
They've been here all week
to see you.

297
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,014
- Blake, can you stay close?
- No problem.

298
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,432
- Who's Blake?
- Your bodyguard.

299
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,225
What? I thought he was a grip.

300
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,769
Hi. There you go.

301
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,772
Thanks.
Oh, they're beautiful, thank you.

302
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,650
Hi. There you go.

303
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,030
You saved my marriage.

304
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,074
My Janie was gonna leave me
until I read your column.

305
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,494
Thank you so much.

306
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,788
- You're welcome.
- It's like walking with Gandhi.

307
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,499
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

308
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,542
- Let's go.
- What is this?

309
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,629
Thank you, Blake.

310
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,429
Jason, I appreciate everything
you're trying to do for me

311
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,181
but a lot of this doesn't make sense.

312
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,892
Like, I swear those people
weren't here a few hours ago.

313
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,394
And the elaborate stage,
how did you get them to...?

314
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,271
Hey, you promised.

315
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,900
I know, just sit back and enjoy the ride.

316
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,070
Home, Blake.

317
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,863
I got a big surprise for you.

318
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,782
Wait, bigger than all of this?

319
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:21,703
Phoebe! Phoebe!
I love you, Phoebe!

320
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,607
We need to talk.

321
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,401
Sorry, not now.

322
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:55,112
Oh, yeah, now.

323
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,822
Look familiar?

324
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:59,658
- I don't have time for this.
- You had time to kill a Valkyrie.

325
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,327
Whitelighters don't kill,
or did you not read the manual?

326
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:03,829
But it's all right for an Elder?

327
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,622
You have Valkyrie blood
on your hands.

328
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,166
Fighting to protect the sisters.

329
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,460
You went out, hunted a Valkyrie
to steal her magic.

330
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:14,131
Oh, so that makes you
the noble one, right?

331
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,841
Face it, Chris, I got you this time.

332
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,885
Enough to get
your whitelighter status stripped

333
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,137
and your soul sent back
down to Earth for recycling.

334
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:23,515
- You do what you have to do.
- I already did.

335
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:26,518
I arranged a hearing
with the Elders tonight.

336
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:29,354
I expect this will be your last day
as a whitelighter.

337
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:33,108
That's... quite possible.

338
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:35,611
Excuse me.

339
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,323
Why are you making
a vanquishing potion?

340
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,908
To help the sisters.

341
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:44,912
- Why aren't they making it?
- Because they're busy.

342
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,753
- I can't sense them.
- Don't worry. I'm on it.

343
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,296
You know, if I can't sense them,

344
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,882
- it means they're not in this world.
- I said, I'm on it.

345
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,552
Where are you going?

346
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,638
To bring them back, now lay off.

347
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:06,308
Till I find out what's going on,
I'm not gonna let you out of my sight.

348
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:09,978
You don't trust me, fine.
I get it. But get this.

349
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,981
If I don't show up where
I'm supposed to be, alone,

350
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,859
they'll die. Your call.

351
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,550
Hey. They said I could come back.

352
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,802
Is Charlie gonna be okay?

353
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,428
Thanks to you.

354
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:47,307
No, thanks to the doctors.
I was just his cosmic taxi.

355
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,142
Oh, Paige, you saved his life.

356
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,436
Well, it felt nice to help out.

357
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:56,441
I'm just curious,
how did you know that I had a...

358
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,443
...a power?

359
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,195
A power?

360
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,822
You mean your magic?

361
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:04,700
Okay, let's keep it down
because it's just our secret.

362
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:08,245
Oh, Paige, don't be shy.
Your magic's a godsend.

363
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,874
Well, if you hadn't been a witch,
I would be a...

364
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,292
I'd be a widow right now.

365
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,627
Okay, just don't say "witch."
Someone might hear you.

366
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:18,797
So, what if they do?
This ain't Salem, honey.

367
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:21,216
There's no shame
in being a witch today.

368
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,594
You should use your magic with pride.

369
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:53,081
That's great design detail there.

370
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:56,585
Thanks, I try to use the natural
contours of a man's body

371
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,463
along with clean, simple lines
to convey an image

372
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:01,673
of sensuous sophistication.

373
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,426
I just think it's hot.

374
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,933
It doesn't provide a lot of support,
though, now does it?

375
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,101
That's the point.

376
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:15,729
So you guys do this a lot?

377
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:19,024
You mean stare at half-naked men
under a socially accepted pretence?

378
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,610
- Yeah.
- Every chance we get.

379
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:24,363
Our lives used to be very
Sex and the City,

380
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,825
then we got married, had kids,
and it's Celibacy in the Suburbs.

381
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,993
I've just missed so much, haven't I?

382
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:32,538
I guess you could say that.

383
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:38,669
Oh, speaking of families,
I think all this noise woke up Wyatt.

384
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:41,380
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

385
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:46,009
Hey, hey, bud, you're okay.

386
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,720
What's the matter? Come here.

387
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,806
You're all right.

388
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,351
Actually, you're burning up a little.

389
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:55,936
Come here, come here.

390
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:58,397
Okay.

391
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:01,191
Look, look, look. Let me see.

392
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,363
A hundred and two?

393
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,699
That's not good.

394
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,492
Leo!

395
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:13,203
Leo, come on, Wyatt needs you.

396
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:23,463
No offence, Blake.

397
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:26,300
- We're alone.
- I wasn't joking

398
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,510
when I said I wanted
to give you the world, Phoebe.

399
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:30,554
That live audience wasn't just
to impress you,

400
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:34,433
that was a test run for a nationally
syndicated talk show starring you.

401
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:38,228
What? Are you kidding me?

402
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:42,191
I have commitments from my O&O's,
that's 12 major TV markets.

403
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,526
And don't worry,
once they see the test run,

404
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:47,613
everybody in the country's
gonna want to Ask Phoebe, live.

405
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,741
- So, what do you think?
- I think this is moving very fast.

406
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,868
Yeah, isn't it great?

407
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:56,163
We're coming to the penthouse.

408
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,333
Penthouse?
I thought you were taking me home.

409
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,294
That is your home.
Well, it's your new home.

410
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:11,512
Phoebe!

411
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,681
- Oh, my God!
- Phoebe!

412
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:23,398
Okay, Jason, enough is enough here.

413
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,817
I know this is all coming from
a really good place

414
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:28,320
but you can't just take over my life.

415
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,572
I'm not even sure I want to star
in my own...

416
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:32,449
We need to get inside.

417
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,409
Clear a path.

418
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:36,245
Where did all these people
come from?

419
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,456
Back up.

420
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,381
Phoebe, I've read every one
of your columns.

421
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:50,384
- They're on all my walls.
- Great, thank you.

422
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:53,428
- This is too much.
- Isn't it great?

423
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:56,849
I don't think any of this is real,
I think something's wrong.

424
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:59,643
- What?
- I said I think something is wrong.

425
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,563
My wife left me because of you!

426
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,189
No, wait. Phoebe.

427
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:06,567
Yeah, I never posed for that.

428
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,610
See, this isn't my world.

429
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:10,612
Do you know how much pain
you caused me?

430
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:12,155
This isn't even my fantasy.

431
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:14,158
Wait till you see the penthouse
I bought you,

432
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:17,161
- it's got the best bay views of the city.
- No, we can't go in there.

433
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,329
I know this isn't gonna make
any sense to you,

434
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:21,081
but I don't think any of this is real,

435
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,208
I think we're in some kind
of alternate reality.

436
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:26,378
What are you talking crazy for,
Phoebe? This is real, it's me.

437
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,172
I'm real.

438
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,467
Gun!

439
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,098
It's time for you to feel pain!

440
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:48,859
We gotta get you inside.

441
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:02,956
I don't understand.

442
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:05,417
Something wrong?

443
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:08,128
The boyfriend took the bullet.
It was meant for the witch.

444
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,838
You tried to kill one of them already?

445
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:11,882
I create worlds.
I don't control them.

446
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,510
They work in their own way,
in their own time.

447
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:19,056
But this is the first time a victim's ever
escaped a direct attempt on their life.

448
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,308
Yeah, well, pretty good, aren't they?

449
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:24,186
It's okay.

450
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:27,022
Their desires will kill them eventually.

451
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,984
After all, that is what you desire,
isn't it?

452
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:33,570
Actually...

453
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:42,246
I could sense your desire
from the beginning.

454
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:46,416
You never wanted to kill your charges,
just teach them a lesson.

455
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:50,087
That's right. Darklighter arrow.

456
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,132
Poison shouldn't take long.

457
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:57,052
But with luck, you may just
live long enough

458
00:27:57,219 --> 00:28:00,681
to watch the Charmed Ones
learn their lesson after all.

459
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:10,482
Okay, Mama's gonna take care
of everything right now.

460
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,361
What is this?

461
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:17,614
No, no, this can't be happening.

462
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,449
Leo, Chris, anybody!

463
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,119
There you are. Is everything okay?

464
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:25,831
No, Wyatt has a 102 temperature
and I think it's getting worse.

465
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:28,709
Leo, come on, your son needs you!

466
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:31,461
Honey, Leo's not here.

467
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,672
You two split up, remember?

468
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,217
A hundred and two?
Piper, that boy needs a doctor.

469
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,928
- Let me drive you.
- No, no, I got it, it's okay.

470
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,316
I heard that woman say you're a witch.

471
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,277
Oh, that. She was just being silly.

472
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:56,945
You have to help my daughter.

473
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:59,907
Okay, I've landed in
Twilight Zone...

474
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,617
Please.

475
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:04,620
Okay, that hurts.
But I need to wake up now.

476
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,622
Demons attacked us.

477
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,167
I hid Susie.
But they're gonna find her.

478
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,336
You're a witch, you can save her.

479
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:14,421
Okay, this can't be happening.

480
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,089
Chris, I need some help here.

481
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:18,217
Please.

482
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:20,928
She's just a little girl.

483
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:24,932
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

484
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,267
Tell me where you left her.

485
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,361
Fireball.

486
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,546
Where are you?

487
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:00,592
Pipe.

488
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,521
Susie?

489
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:14,565
Susie, it's okay.

490
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,733
You can come out now.

491
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,570
It's okay.

492
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:20,988
Your mom sent me.

493
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:24,491
That's it. It's all right.

494
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,161
It's okay.

495
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,538
Okay.

496
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,749
Let's get you out of here.

497
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:42,885
This can't be real.

498
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,806
Okay, it's real, go wait in there.

499
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:50,475
Hey, you.

500
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:53,604
Looking for me?

501
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:57,900
- Anyone else?
- Look out!

502
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:03,906
What the hell is going on?

503
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:06,825
You're gonna be okay, baby.
We're gonna get you out of this.

504
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:09,286
Leo!

505
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:10,579
Who are you calling?

506
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,916
My brother-in-law. He's a healer.

507
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,919
No offence, babe,
but I don't think he can hear you.

508
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:19,338
Isn't Blake calling 911?

509
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:22,007
Yeah, he is.

510
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:24,843
I know this isn't gonna make
a lot of sense to you

511
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,929
but I don't think this world is real,
you know?

512
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,931
I don't know if there are
paramedics here.

513
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:33,769
- This world isn't real?
- Yeah. If I had to guess...

514
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:40,317
...I would say it's a world of desire.
But it's not my desire, it's your desire.

515
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:43,779
I can feel how much you want
all of this for me.

516
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,405
It's true, Phoebe.

517
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:49,910
I want everything for you,
including sanity.

518
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:53,789
So if I die, promise me
you'll see a doctor.

519
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:56,708
You're not gonna die.

520
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:58,669
We're gonna get you out of here.

521
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:00,045
An empath.

522
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:02,506
You didn't tell me the middle sister
was an empath.

523
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:05,300
Sorry.

524
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:08,846
She must have been feeling his desire
when I created her world.

525
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:13,475
It's no matter.
My worlds always kill their victims.

526
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:17,312
You know why?
Because desires are empty.

527
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:19,314
They lack foundation.

528
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:23,443
This world will fall too.
It's only a matter of time.

529
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,737
I'm getting thirsty.

530
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:28,740
Okay, I'll try to see
if I can find something.

531
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:33,453
No!

532
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:42,212
Jason?

533
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:45,382
Thanks.

534
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:47,843
Fireball!

535
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:52,472
Welcome to my world.

536
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:53,974
Wait, you have a world too?

537
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,852
Yeah. All magic, all the time,
just what I wanted.

538
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,478
So you figured it out.

539
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:02,649
Well, yeah, if you mean the whole
"vortex of deadly desires" thing.

540
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:05,027
- How'd you escape?
- I have no idea.

541
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:07,446
It just sort of happened.
But I have to go back there

542
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:09,865
because Jason was shot
and I just left him there.

543
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:11,825
Paige, I gotta get back.

544
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,744
Yeah, we definitely need
to get out of here,

545
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,662
but I think we need Piper to do that.

546
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:33,597
Damn.

547
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:56,119
You're gonna be okay.
We're almost there. Okay?

548
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:24,565
Okay, I think they're gone.

549
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,483
How are we gonna find Piper?

550
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:29,111
I don't know, maybe try feeling her?

551
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:32,573
The demon created these worlds
by using our emotions, right?

552
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,993
I don't know, maybe use him as
a conduit to tap into her feelings.

553
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:38,495
Okay, it's worth a shot.

554
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,748
You getting anything?

555
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,667
Oh, I'm smelling something...

556
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:50,465
- Bless you.
- Thanks.

557
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:53,051
- Okay, try again.
- Okay.

558
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:55,762
- Over there.
- Okay.

559
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:58,015
Go that way, man.
All right.

560
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:04,771
- You okay?
- I feel her.

561
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,066
She's really scared
and she needs our help.

562
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:16,033
These worlds were fuelled
by our desires, right?

563
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,743
Well, our desire is to find her.

564
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:21,163
Okay, so maybe our combined
desires can actually...

565
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,707
...bring us to her, right?
- Yeah.

566
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:28,045
- Focus, focus, focus.
- Focus.

567
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,258
You've ruined everything.

568
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:37,095
Now they'll find the oldest sister
and come for me.

569
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,934
Unless I get to her first.

570
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:08,126
You're not demon enough to kill me.

571
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:12,047
The sweetest desire of them all.

572
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:13,882
The desire to survive.

573
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:24,393
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's about time

574
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,145
- you guys showed up.
- Athame!

575
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:29,314
Yeah, sorry, no magic here.

576
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:36,488
How does that shoulder feel?

577
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:44,788
Come on. We gotta get out of here.
We gotta get out.

578
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,084
There's nowhere to run.

579
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:53,297
You're in my world!

580
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,732
- Where are we?
- Who cares?

581
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:13,567
- Where's Jason?
- Jason?

582
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:15,903
Yeah, he was in my world
and he should have come out

583
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,613
when we got the demon, right?

584
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:20,866
- You sure it was really Jason?
- I don't know, what do you mean?

585
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:24,119
In my world, there's all these people
that I knew in the old folks' home,

586
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:26,955
maybe your Jason is just
a creation of your world.

587
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:28,332
God, I hope so.

588
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,918
Wyatt needs help.

589
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,253
Oh, my God, so does he.

590
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:40,219
- He's still breathing.
- Leo!

591
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:43,472
You're back. Where were you?

592
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,099
Heal now, ask later.

593
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:24,638
His fever's down.

594
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,306
He should sleep pretty well tonight.

595
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,934
Yeah, he had quite a day.

596
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:32,271
You're okay.

597
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:38,443
Well, I'm glad you made it
out of that other world all right.

598
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,281
Yeah, and you have Chris
to thank for that.

599
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:43,782
Chris.

600
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:46,535
Yeah, well, he should have
taken me with him to that cave,

601
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:49,663
or at least told me
where my family was.

602
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,540
Leo, give him a break.

603
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:53,667
He earned it today.

604
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:59,798
So, what about you? I heard your
social life was interrupted again.

605
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,759
Yeah. But you know,
there's always tomorrow.

606
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:07,055
- You never give up, do you?
- No. Not a chance.

607
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,850
I firmly believe there will be one day

608
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:13,520
without demons,
magic or pocket realms.

609
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:15,981
Good night, Piper.

610
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:19,693
Hey, before you go,
could you do me a favour?

611
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:25,115
You want me to heal your hand?

612
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,117
I thought you wanted a normal day.

613
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:29,244
Yeah, I did.

614
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,955
And apparently
that's not gonna be today.

615
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:43,133
- Hey.
- Hey.

616
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:46,678
- How are you feeling?
- Better, thanks.

617
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,350
So it's almost time for
my hearing with the Elders.

618
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:54,645
I thought I'd give you the pleasure
of taking me in personally.

619
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:58,232
Yeah, well, maybe I'll...

620
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:00,108
...just give you this instead.

621
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:02,653
I don't understand.

622
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:07,616
Neither do I.
Just take it before I change my mind.

623
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:12,704
Thanks for trying to warn us
about the demon.

624
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:15,040
We should have listened to you
in the first place.

625
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:18,001
As long as you learned
something at the end of the day,

626
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:20,712
that's all that matters. Right?

627
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,006
Right.

628
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:37,980
Hey, I got your message.
You sounded so...

629
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:39,898
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

630
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:41,608
I just needed to see you.

631
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,694
And feel my back.

632
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,738
- You're okay.
- My doctor will be pleased.

633
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:50,784
Listen, now that I have you here,
I have a surprise for you.

634
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:54,079
No, no, this is good. The station
manager's a friend of mine,

635
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:56,081
and we got to talking about you.

636
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:58,375
- Now, Phoebe...
- That's not what I want.

637
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:01,628
- You don't know what I'm gonna say.
- Yeah, I think I do.

638
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:05,090
And I appreciate the gesture.

639
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:07,926
But I have everything I want right here.

640
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:09,511
You do?

641
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:10,971
Yeah, I do.

642
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:14,391
You've got me, Jason Dean.

643
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:15,893
I'm yours.

644
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:18,520
So no more wooing.

645
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:20,147
Okay, no more wooing.

646
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:23,066
I guess I'll cancel our helicopter
to Carmel for dinner.

647
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:25,944
No, no, no,
maybe a little bit more wooing.
