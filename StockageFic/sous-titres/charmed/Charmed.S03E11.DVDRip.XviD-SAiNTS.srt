0
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:08,037
One teaspoon baking powder.

1
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:09,767
One teaspoon bat guano.

2
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,318
- It's starting to bubble.
- And stink.

3
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:14,445
Couldn't you have made that potion
after breakfast?

4
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:17,407
No, I'm sorry, but Phoebe has a
meeting with that DA investigator,

5
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:19,685
and I didn't want her
to go there unarmed.

6
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:21,123
Morning.

7
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:25,519
- Whoa, what is that smell?
- That would be the lovely smell

8
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:27,168
of Piper's breakfast.

9
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,124
- Hope you're hungry.
- Starving.

10
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:32,639
Probably because you
missed dinner last night.

11
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,718
Piper, I already said I was sorry
I was late, okay?

12
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:38,159
It's not like I was out carousing with
the boys.

13
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,047
I was being a force of good
in the universe.

14
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:43,201
A true force of good would
have called, or at least orbed.

15
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,367
I couldn't. Not under
the circumstances.

16
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:48,680
- Which were?
- Work-related.

17
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,602
Which means I can't talk about it.
I mean, anything that happens

18
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,959
between me and a charge
is confidential, you know that.

19
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:56,848
- Doesn't mean I have to like it.
- Oh, let me see that.

20
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,241
You know, this "all for
the good of Mankind" stuff

21
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:04,762
really puts me
in an awful position.

22
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:07,238
I have no choice but
to be understanding.

23
00:01:07,449 --> 00:01:09,565
You just have to accept
that you're engaged to somebody

24
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:12,721
- who works for the CIA.
- Wait, you work for the CIA?

25
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:15,045
You know, ever since
she became a blond...

26
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:17,920
Want something to eat before
you meet with Reece?

27
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,278
Not hungry, too nervous.

28
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:22,688
All right, well, this will help you
with your nerves.

29
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:25,881
Just a drop in Reece's coffee,
and it will out any demon.

30
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:27,841
Reaction will cause his throat
to constrict.

31
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:29,681
As he's choking, you run. Got it?

32
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:33,400
Thanks. I hadn't even considered
that Reece might be evil.

33
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:35,281
Then why are you so nervous?

34
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:38,964
Because he's probing
Cole's disappearance.

35
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:43,725
I'm not exactly looking forward to being
grilled about my demon ex, you know?

36
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:47,444
Well, as long as you don't blurt out
"I killed Cole," you'll be fine.

37
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,359
Why don't you practice saying
"As far as I know,

38
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:53,805
Cole is alive and well and could
be anywhere"? See how it feels.

39
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,842
Okay.

40
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:03,482
As far as I know, Cole is alive
and well and could be anywhere.

41
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:05,678
Very believable.

42
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:08,005
Yeah, try not to look as guilty
as you did just now,

43
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,285
you'll give yourself away.

44
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:12,884
I just can't wait for this
investigation to be over.

45
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:16,559
It will soon, it has to.
There's nothing to find.

46
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:17,918
Is there?

47
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:20,678
Of course not.

48
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,042
Be careful.

49
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:43,402
You can't hurt me.
I can deflect your power.

50
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:45,726
All of them?

51
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:55,761
Thank God.

52
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:03,641
You know, the ability
to clone myself is just

53
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:09,406
one of the powers that I've collected
over my years of killing witches.

54
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:17,765
And now, I'm about to add one more.

55
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:36,120
You're too late, whitelighter.
Your charge is dead.

56
00:03:38,529 --> 00:03:40,167
I'll see you later.

57
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:36,282
So I've got lunch with this
guy from the Chronicle

58
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,280
who wants to do a story on the club.

59
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,759
And then I've got a meeting with
these dot-com start-up guys

60
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:44,727
that want to do, like, an Internet thingy.
What are you doing today?

61
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,405
You know, just the usual.

62
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:49,601
Care to elaborate?

63
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:51,202
- Piper.
- Oh, come on.

64
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:54,839
- Just a few details, a titbit.
- It's against the rules.

65
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:57,443
Rules. Yes, see, this is my problem.

66
00:04:57,609 --> 00:04:59,679
Every time I turn around,
we seem to be violating

67
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:02,488
some stupid
whitelighter ordinance.

68
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:05,288
We just have to be careful as long
as we're under probation.

69
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:07,128
Which is never-ending.

70
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:10,687
I don't know, Leo, I don't think they're
ever gonna let us get married.

71
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,965
They will, they have to.

72
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:17,322
Nothing is gonna keep
us apart, I promise.

73
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:19,081
Natalie!

74
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:22,645
Leo, sorry to interrupt. But we've got
a major problem on our hands.

75
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:25,124
Hey, I heard something.
Athame! Athame!

76
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:27,081
No, no, no. It's okay,
she's a whitelighter.

77
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:29,849
Natalie and I go way back.
We were rookies together.

78
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:32,000
Actually, we fought together
in World War II.

79
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:34,205
All your charges need to know
is I'm a whitelighter.

80
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,688
This is not a social call.

81
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,767
I've come to warn the Charmed Ones

82
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:41,558
that a warlock just killed my most
powerful charge with this athame.

83
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:42,838
I'm so sorry.

84
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:45,927
Thank you. The real tragedy
is that it didn't have to happen.

85
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:48,120
I warned her to lay low,
and she didn't listen.

86
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:51,207
She always refused to let her magic
interfere with her life.

87
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:54,405
And now a warlock has
her power of deflection.

88
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:57,527
Deflection? Wait a minute, does that
mean he could deflect our powers?

89
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:00,163
Yes, which is why all whitelighters
have been put on alert.

90
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:02,325
We have? Why didn't
I hear about this?

91
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,360
Because you missed this
morning's staff meeting.

92
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:08,325
- You have staff meetings?
- With mandatory attendance.

93
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:11,720
Unless a charge is in need,
which Piper was.

94
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:15,329
- I had to heal her.
- Right.

95
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,400
I'll assume a demon
attacked your finger,

96
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:22,527
since healing is restricted
to such circumstances.

97
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:26,365
I believe the Charmed Ones
deserve special attention.

98
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:29,402
I've heard rumours about
such special attention.

99
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:31,082
And honestly, Leo.

100
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:40,678
Whitelighter-ese?

101
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:43,438
- Piper.

102
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:45,565
Well, I guess we know
what they're talking about.

103
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,004
All right, you guys can... chitchat
all you want.

104
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:51,807
I'm gonna go look in the
Book of Shadows.

105
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:55,604
I'll go with you. I got a look at that
warlock. I might be able to identify him.

106
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:58,488
- All right, well, it's up in the attic.
- Attic?

107
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,566
You mean the altar room, don't you?

108
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:03,288
The rules are very clear.

109
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,087
Every witch must keep
their Book of Shadows

110
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:08,878
- in a sacred and protected spot.
- Right, of course.

111
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,680
Maybe you can bring
the Book down here.

112
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,124
Yeah.

113
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:15,519
Yeah, I'll just run up to the altar room,

114
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:19,364
which, by the way, is right next to
the potions lab, and I'll be right back.

115
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:33,599
Not supposed to eat on the job.

116
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:42,040
- You sure you don't want something?
- No. I'm fine.

117
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,448
Actually, I would like
a bagel, also. Thanks.

118
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:46,928
- Excuse me, miss?
- Yes?

119
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:49,159
Miss, can we have another bagel?

120
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,768
Sure.

121
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:53,646
It's a nice place.

122
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,239
It's crowded. I guess
that's why you picked it.

123
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:00,646
It makes me think that
you're afraid of something.

124
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:13,602
- Allergies. So? So are you?
- Am I what?

125
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:17,927
- Afraid.
- Afraid of Cole? No.

126
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:20,159
- Why should I be?
- Well, several reasons.

127
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:22,126
Not the least of which is
he's a fraud.

128
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:23,808
Or a man who exists only on paper.

129
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:26,403
Wormed his way into the DA's
office for reasons unknown,

130
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:30,124
who apparently has a very dark side.

131
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:33,321
We found bloodstains in his carpet.

132
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:37,198
And a hidden cabinet full
of occult paraphernalia.

133
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:40,199
Are you telling me you don't
know anything about this?

134
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,802
No. I mean, yes, I don't
know about any of this.

135
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:50,561
Look, Miss Halliwell, I think you
know more than you're letting on.

136
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,237
But you're scared. You're
afraid that if I find out the truth,

137
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:56,003
you're gonna get in trouble.
Am I right?

138
00:08:56,489 --> 00:08:59,242
I wish I could help you. But I can't.

139
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:02,765
I'm sorry. I really am.

140
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:06,325
Listen, Cole's the kind of man who
knows how to cover his tracks, okay.

141
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:09,720
Now, if he's alive and you know
something, he could hurt you.

142
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:12,242
He could hurt your sisters too.

143
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,725
"The power of deflection
is a witch's best shield

144
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:21,208
against the forces of darkness."

145
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:23,519
Unless the forces of darkness
already have it,

146
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,123
in which case it's the great shield
against us.

147
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:30,078
All right, how did he get close enough
to get it from such a powerful witch?

148
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:32,047
Maybe he wasn't working alone.

149
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,688
Or maybe he possesses
the power...

150
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:35,521
Cloning. I was just thinking
the same thing.

151
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:38,243
The ability to duplicate one's self. But...

152
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:40,440
It can't be sustained
for long periods of time.

153
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:45,120
That's cute, how you guys
finish each other's sentences.

154
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:48,361
Happens when you work with
someone for as long as we have.

155
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:49,558
I see that.

156
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,203
Maybe we should check the Book,

157
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:53,969
see if the warlock stole
the cloning power too, okay?

158
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:56,638
All right, cross-reference
"cloning" with "warlock."

159
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,639
Here it is. A warlock named Eames.

160
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:07,040
It seems that ten years ago he
murdered a witch in Glasgow

161
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:09,717
and stole her power of cloning.
Do you recognize him?

162
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:11,203
That's him.

163
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,758
Cloning and deflection
are not his only tricks.

164
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:18,047
It says here that Eames also
killed a witch in Kenya in '89

165
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:21,599
and took the power
of transmogrification.

166
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,088
"Trans" what?

167
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,201
- The ability to change shape or form.
- The ability to change shape or form.

168
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:32,162
- Okay. So, what's his master plan?
- What makes you think he has one?

169
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:35,088
Well, the time and geography between
kills suggest that he was hunting

170
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:38,127
these particular witches, right?
It's not sport, it's strategy.

171
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:40,889
So all we have to do to catch him
is figure out what that plan is

172
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,243
and then beat him to the punch.

173
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:45,327
Right, or we can try and take him out
first before he even has a chance.

174
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:49,404
Leo, we should discuss the best way
to approach this situation.

175
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:55,159
I mean in private, if you wouldn't mind
going into another room, please?

176
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,167
Or how about this idea?

177
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:04,159
- Piper, what are you doing?
- Getting irritated.

178
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,285
Who put Lady Attitude in charge?

179
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:08,878
- She's not in charge.
- Really? Because she's acting like it.

180
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:11,882
I thought whitelighters were
supposed to guide, not dictate.

181
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:14,047
She is just trying to help.

182
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:16,399
By what? Slowing us down
and second-guessing us?

183
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,521
Introducing the concept
of caution and organization

184
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:21,725
into the manor isn't a bad idea.

185
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,164
Natalie's considered one of
the top whitelighters up there.

186
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:27,287
Oh, I bet they love her.
She's never met a rule she didn't like.

187
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:28,922
Leo, we already have a whitelighter.

188
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,762
Besides, I don't really like anybody
who doesn't trust us.

189
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:35,399
You've misread her. Natalie is cautious
because she just lost a charge.

190
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,605
She's worried the same thing
is gonna happen to you.

191
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:41,837
- You can't question her heart.
- Okay, how about everything else?

192
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:45,201
I'll talk to her.

193
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:49,844
- Now please, would you unfreeze her?
- Sure.

194
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:53,760
There you go.

195
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:57,888
- Wait a minute. What's going on?
- I gotta go talk to Piper.

196
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:00,165
- Leo.
- I'll be right back.

197
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:01,958
Piper froze you.

198
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:05,362
- She what?
- Yep.

199
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:06,558
Hey.

200
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:09,641
You want to freeze me in bed for your
own personal pleasures, that is fine.

201
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:12,323
But freezing Natalie is not gonna
make her or the Elders happy.

202
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:15,447
Well, I'm sorry. But how do you
think I feel listening to you two

203
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:19,124
clickety-clack about work when
you don't tell me anything.

204
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:22,122
I mean, she clearly knows things
about you that I don't.

205
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:25,645
- She's an old friend.
- Well, obviously.

206
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:28,607
Come on, you're not jealous, are you?
Because there is nothing...

207
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,680
Leo, I'm not jealous of her.

208
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:34,285
I am jealous of the part of your life
she gets to share with you that I don't.

209
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:37,401
You know, like where you go
all day, who your other charges are,

210
00:12:37,609 --> 00:12:40,681
- what it's like up there.
- I've taken you up there before.

211
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:42,720
Once. And I don't even
get to remember it.

212
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:46,245
It's just more rules, more stupid rules
that exclude me.

213
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:48,798
Unlike you and Natalie, who literally
speak the same language

214
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,358
- with each other.
- It is just boring shoptalk.

215
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:54,925
It's secrets. And if there's one thing
I've learned as a Halliwell,

216
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:57,239
you don't keep secrets
from the people you love.

217
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,968
Hi.

218
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:02,603
Am I interrupting something?

219
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:04,606
- Yes.
- No.

220
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:09,482
How did your thing go
with the investigator?

221
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,998
Oh, fine. At least he's not a demon.

222
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:14,400
Leo, can I talk to you
about something?

223
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,440
- Soon?
- Take a number.

224
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,206
Maybe later, okay?
Why don't you go meet Natalie.

225
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:22,444
Who's Natalie?

226
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:24,526
- She's a...
- Fellow whitelighter.

227
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:27,247
See? I finished your sentence.

228
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:30,279
That's not what I was gonna say.

229
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:39,289
You're wasting your time.
You can't scry for warlocks.

230
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:41,280
I'm not, I'm scrying for a witch.

231
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:43,360
I'm focusing the crystal
on your charge's power,

232
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,406
which, technically, is still alive.

233
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:48,684
Hi. You must be...

234
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,723
Okay. Here we go.
I think I found Eames.

235
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:55,407
Industrial district
south of San Francisco.

236
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:56,638
A warlock? What's going on?

237
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,527
We'll fill you in on the way.
Piper. Leo.

238
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:00,680
Wait, you're not going after him,
are you?

239
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:03,882
- Yeah, that would be the idea.
- You're not prepared. You don't...

240
00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:12,362
- What did you see?
- A warlock, I think,

241
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:14,724
- killing a male witch.
- Not if we can help it.

242
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:19,087
It's three against one, we should be
able to counter his power of deflection.

243
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,762
But he can also clone himself.

244
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:24,399
So then it's three against two.
Still, the odds are on our side.

245
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:26,161
Plus, we'll have the element
of surprise.

246
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:30,368
People, we're under an alert.
You can't go running off half-cocked.

247
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:32,884
- People?
- You must consult the Elders,

248
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,000
find out what they know,
what they want you to do.

249
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:38,445
And how long will that take? Long
enough to lose another witch's life?

250
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:39,638
Better one than four.

251
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:42,200
You wondered what
Eames' ultimate goal was.

252
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,439
What if it's to kill the Charmed Ones?

253
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,684
Think of the damage he could
do with all of your powers.

254
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:51,886
All right, Natalie's right. We should
definitely check with the Elders first.

255
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:55,405
- Do it quickly.
- I'll be back as soon as possible.

256
00:14:58,369 --> 00:14:59,882
So, what, we're supposed to just wait?

257
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:02,359
No. I had to say something
to get rid of her.

258
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:05,079
Didn't you hear what she said?
Consulting with the Elders

259
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:08,480
- is for your own protection.
- And siding with us is for yours.

260
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:33,318
Oh, Piper, freeze him!

261
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:35,118
He deflected it.

262
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:41,166
- What happened? Where did he go?
- I think that was his clone.

263
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:43,524
Well, the real Eames must
be around here someplace.

264
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,959
- Maybe we should get out of here.
- What about the witch

265
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:47,801
in Phoebe's premonition?
We can't leave him.

266
00:15:47,969 --> 00:15:49,163
Afraid you were gonna say that.

267
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:52,162
- What did he look like?
- I don't know. Kind of balding...

268
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,921
Sort of like that.

269
00:15:57,449 --> 00:16:00,361
Who are you?
Why did you summon me?

270
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:04,448
- That's no witch, that's a darklighter.
- Leo. Leo, get out of here!

271
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:14,524
Okay, I don't understand.
Why is there a darklighter here?

272
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:17,599
Oh, did I miss all the fun?

273
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:29,445
No, wait, I am the fun.

274
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,201
Thanks for this.

275
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:45,919
- Did you get the darklighter?
- No, but Eames did.

276
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,523
Eames?
A warlock killed a darklighter?

277
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:50,162
And took his crossbow.

278
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:52,604
That doesn't make any sense,
they both play for team evil.

279
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:55,687
Yeah, what I don't get is why Eames
had no interest in attacking us.

280
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,487
Maybe he knew he was outnumbered.

281
00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:01,602
He didn't really seem overly
concerned. In fact, he seemed cocky.

282
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:04,682
Good, you're still here.

283
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:06,921
Speaking of cocky.

284
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:09,245
I consulted the Elders,
and they want you to hold back.

285
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:11,798
They think the witch Phoebe saw
might be a force of darkness.

286
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:14,637
- A darklighter, actually.
- How do you know?

287
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:17,522
We went, we saw,
we didn't quite conquer.

288
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:20,368
You what? Leo, how could
you let this happen?

289
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,207
This wasn't Leo's decision,
it was ours.

290
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:24,929
You'll take responsibility for
a decision, but not for your lives?

291
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,442
That warlock could have killed you.

292
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:28,799
- He wasn't after us.
- That makes you lucky, not smart.

293
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:31,847
You were reckless. As the
Charmed Ones, you have an obligation

294
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,921
to serve the greater good.
You have a higher calling.

295
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:36,924
So do we.

296
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,364
I think we'd better both go up
this time.

297
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:41,561
Better lay low until we get back.

298
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:48,762
What's with the handholding thing?

299
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:51,079
That's the least of our problems.
We have to concentrate

300
00:17:51,249 --> 00:17:52,602
on finding and vanquishing Eames.

301
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,367
We can't count on scrying
to locate him,

302
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:56,201
because it just could
be his clone again.

303
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,718
I still think we need to decode
his master plan,

304
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:00,720
and then that way we
can figure him out.

305
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:02,403
I'll take Book duty.

306
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:04,600
I'll do a flow chart, see
where all this is leading.

307
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:06,600
I'll help. Anything to get rid of her.

308
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:10,324
- You mean him.
- Nah, I mean her.

309
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:26,082
What am I gonna do about you?

310
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:44,160
I've never seen the Elders
like this before.

311
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:46,524
They're worried about
what Eames is up to.

312
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:48,680
Aren't you gonna change
into your robes?

313
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:51,204
- The rules say...
- I know the rules.

314
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:53,644
I find my jeans more comfortable.

315
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:55,959
That attitude scares me, Leo.

316
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:59,241
I wouldn't be a good friend

317
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:02,640
if I didn't tell you how concerned
I am about the situation at the manor.

318
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,881
You haven't seen the Charmed Ones
at their best.

319
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:08,085
Trust me, they're talented witches.

320
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:11,998
They're also sloppy, untrained,
emotional.

321
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:15,559
And undisciplined, I know. But
that's part of what makes them great.

322
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:20,325
They don't work by rote.
They work on instinct, on passion.

323
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:22,366
I'm all for instinct and passion.

324
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:25,327
But they're too impulsive. They lead
with their hearts, not their heads.

325
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:27,997
- And they're not the only ones.
- You think I do too?

326
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,962
I think it's clear that you love them.

327
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,040
Every whitelighter loves their charges.

328
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:34,688
Not the way that you do.

329
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:37,483
Your feelings are clouding your ability
to see their weaknesses.

330
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:40,442
Weaknesses? I think their record
speaks for itself.

331
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:42,486
They took out Belthazor,
who took out the Triad.

332
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:44,088
But Belthazor is a perfect example.

333
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,319
He never should have
gotten that close to them.

334
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:49,925
I can't help but think that
your relationship with Piper...

335
00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:53,917
- Is none of your business.
- Actually, Leo, it is my business.

336
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:55,922
The Elders want to
know whether or not

337
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:57,966
I think it's getting in
the way of your job.

338
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,162
Leo? Leo?

339
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,725
That's Phoebe. The rules say
a charge's call takes precedent.

340
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,880
Leo!

341
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:24,528
Sorry, Phoebe. I forgot that you
needed to talk. What's up?

342
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:27,118
Okay. Just so I'm clear,
this is confidential, right?

343
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,361
I mean, anything that I'm about to say
to you just stays between me and you.

344
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,048
- Absolutely.
- They don't get to know,

345
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:34,200
and they're not eavesdropping
or anything right now?

346
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:36,047
Phoebe, what is it?

347
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:37,927
You need to sit.

348
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:45,162
Okay. Here it goes.

349
00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:47,967
Leo...

350
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:51,200
...Cole is alive.

351
00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:56,723
- What?
- Cole. Belthazor.

352
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:01,007
I didn't really vanquish him.
I know. I know, it's horrible.

353
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:03,729
And I've barely been able to live
with Prue and Piper ever since.

354
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,845
- But I just couldn't tell them.
- Phoebe.

355
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:08,523
I couldn't kill him, Leo.
I had every intention of doing it.

356
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:11,362
But when I got there,
and I was face to face with him,

357
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:12,928
I just couldn't kill him.

358
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:14,841
And I knew that my sisters
were going to.

359
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:18,041
- So you faked his death?
- I didn't have a choice.

360
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:21,007
Leo, I knew in my heart that
he would never try and hurt us.

361
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:25,603
Otherwise, I wouldn't have let him go.
You have to believe me.

362
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:30,044
All I knew is that I loved Cole.

363
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:34,127
And if anyone understands
forbidden love, it's you, isn't it?

364
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:37,560
My God, Phoebe, it's not even close to
being the same thing. He is a demon.

365
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,527
- He's half human.
- For God's sakes, he's a killer!

366
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:42,601
He has killed witches and innocents

367
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,124
and anything else that
has gotten in his way.

368
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:48,167
What makes you think that he is not
gonna come back here right now

369
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:52,288
- and try and kill all three of you?
- He won't. I know he's good.

370
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:54,719
No, you hope that he's good.
You want him to be good.

371
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:58,081
Why did you even tell me this?

372
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:00,918
I don't know, Leo.

373
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:04,525
I was sort of counting on you
for your guidance and support.

374
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:09,528
Well, it's my guidance and support
that got you into this mess.

375
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:12,243
I don't even know how
to begin to fix this.

376
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,281
Leo?

377
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:29,041
Leo? What's the matter?

378
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:32,326
I don't know. Feels like a witch
is being hurt. I can feel her pain.

379
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:34,121
- Is it one of your charges?
- No.

380
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:35,802
What happened?

381
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:40,967
She needs help.

382
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:46,485
Of course, I could have killed you.
But it's not your powers I'm after.

383
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:49,641
I've set my sights a little higher.

384
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:53,961
I'm looking for a few
good whitelighters.

385
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,286
Well, actually, just one.

386
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:02,448
That's all I'm missing now.

387
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:06,242
And yours will do just fine.

388
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,641
Why isn't her whitelighter helping her?

389
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:12,323
I don't know, but I have to go to her.

390
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:14,008
No, Leo, wait.

391
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:16,280
I just realized. How could
we have missed it?

392
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:19,283
The only reason Eames
would have killed a darklighter

393
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:22,168
is so that he could use the crossbow
to kill a whitelighter.

394
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:24,602
She's right, Leo, it's a trap.

395
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:27,482
I don't understand. Why would
he want to kill a whitelighter?

396
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:30,157
To gain the power to orb
up there. The only way in.

397
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:32,684
Once there, he'd be able
to decimate all whitelighters.

398
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:35,403
And that would leave all
their charges unprotected.

399
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:39,682
He would be able to wipe out all
witches everywhere, including us.

400
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:42,526
Sounds like a master plan to me.

401
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:45,726
The Elders have instituted a lockdown
and recalled whitelighters from Earth.

402
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:48,562
Leo and I are the only ones who
have retained the power to orb,

403
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:51,721
- so we can help you stop Eames.
- Must be why I feel her pain.

404
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,801
- Oh, if you could only feel it.
- I feel it.

405
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:57,368
But I won't be ruled by it.

406
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:00,202
A whitelighter who is controlled
by his emotions is useless.

407
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:04,208
The greater good must come first.

408
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:13,568
Well, this is boring.

409
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:17,398
What kind of lame whitelighter
do you have?

410
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:21,643
They must be on to you now.

411
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:25,839
I think you're right.

412
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:28,561
Which means what?

413
00:24:28,729 --> 00:24:32,005
They'll send witches to try
and stop me.

414
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:36,560
Well, if witches come, can
whitelighters be far behind?

415
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:44,439
After ten years of chasing a dream,
the dream starts chasing me.

416
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:48,723
Of course, you know,
there is a downside.

417
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:52,399
I no longer have any use for you.

418
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:57,680
What? Leo. What is it?

419
00:24:57,849 --> 00:24:59,521
He killed her.

420
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:03,886
What does your rulebook
say to do now?

421
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:12,445
I can't believe Natalie
just let her die like that.

422
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:13,724
We should've done something.

423
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,039
- Like what?
- I don't know, something.

424
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:18,518
We need to find a way to stop
Eames before he kills again.

425
00:25:18,689 --> 00:25:20,361
We should be working on
a vanquishing spell.

426
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:23,839
It's gonna be a tricky spell, though.
We have to counteract a lot of powers.

427
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:25,158
Plus, we need to do it fast,

428
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:28,799
because I don't like my boyfriend being
one of the only two targets on Earth.

429
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:35,120
We'd like to speak to Leo in private.

430
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:38,361
So if you wouldn't mind
going into another room.

431
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:41,197
If it's work-related,
you can discuss it with me.

432
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:43,001
What do you mean?

433
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:46,281
Leo?

434
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:53,442
I asked Natalie to take over as
your whitelighter. And she accepted.

435
00:25:54,729 --> 00:25:56,242
What are you talking about?

436
00:25:56,409 --> 00:25:58,559
Piper, nothing is more important
to me than your safety.

437
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:01,323
And my being here is putting
all of your lives at risk.

438
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:03,360
Leo, you have done
nothing but protect us.

439
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:05,560
You saw what happened upstairs.

440
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:08,687
I would have rushed off to help
that witch if you hadn't stopped me.

441
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:12,445
Now, I am supposed to be guiding you,
and you are guiding me.

442
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:16,204
- Leo, we all make mistakes.
- We can't afford to make them now.

443
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:18,441
Leo, if this is because of me...

444
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:22,007
It isn't, Phoebe.

445
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:24,485
It's because of me.

446
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,560
And maybe Natalie's right.

447
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:27,957
Maybe my feelings for you

448
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:30,723
are clouding my ability to guide you,
I don't know.

449
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:33,238
But all I do know is that this is no time
for self-doubt,

450
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:34,683
not with Eames out there.

451
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:39,127
Piper.

452
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,687
They want me to join in the lockdown.

453
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:48,244
Until I return, I want you to do
as Natalie asks. It's important for us.

454
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:03,282
I suggest you channel
your anger toward the warlock

455
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:05,565
you're meant to vanquish.

456
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:07,765
- Now, first...
- Okay, can we just

457
00:27:07,969 --> 00:27:09,527
have a moment to
process this, please?

458
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,879
No, it's time you stopped
focusing on yourselves

459
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:13,402
and started focusing on Eames.

460
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:17,478
You must prepare yourselves for
battle, mentally, physically, sartorially.

461
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:20,479
- I'm sorry, what?
- She doesn't like our clothes.

462
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:22,401
You need outfits that
are loose and move.

463
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:24,605
That means no more
braless, strapless...

464
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:29,077
...fearless attire.

465
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,965
Okay, but then I have nothing to wear.

466
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:50,484
Okay, tell me again
why we're doing this.

467
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:54,722
Because one bad word from
General Goody Two-Shoes,

468
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:56,527
and I'm not getting married.

469
00:27:56,729 --> 00:27:58,606
- That's a good reason, I guess.
- All right.

470
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:01,008
Let's get going.

471
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:04,047
Defeating Eames will
require split-second timing...

472
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:07,001
...and flawless teamwork.

473
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:10,526
I can't tell you what you'll be doing,
but I can tell you what you won't.

474
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:15,400
You won't be winging it.
You won't be hoping for the best.

475
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,606
The will to win is the will to prepare
to win, do you understand me?

476
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:22,359
I'm sorry, I didn't quite
get that last platitude.

477
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:27,448
You think you're so tough because
you took out Belthazor, don't you?

478
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:31,648
Let me tell you something. You're
only as good as your next vanquish.

479
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:34,764
This alley is a neutral battlefield.

480
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,286
Our challenge is to fight Eames.

481
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,884
- Our primary goal is?
- To win!

482
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:42,926
- No.
- No.

483
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:45,123
To get the crossbow.

484
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:49,685
A darklighter's crossbow
delivers arrows

485
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:51,965
dipped in a poison that
is lethal to whitelighters.

486
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:55,687
Get the crossbow,
and the immediate threat is over.

487
00:28:55,849 --> 00:29:01,799
If you have the opportunity to vanquish
Eames, by all means, seize it.

488
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:05,041
But keep your eyes on the prize.

489
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:08,160
All right, now let's pretend
I'm the enemy.

490
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,399
Oh, that is way too easy.

491
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:11,558
Very funny.

492
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:15,845
Now talk me through how you plan
to separate me from my crossbow.

493
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:19,718
- Okay, first I freeze you.
- I deflect that.

494
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:23,764
- I guess I could levitate and kick you.
- You just kicked a clone.

495
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,318
All right, how about if I send
an astral Prue as a decoy

496
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:29,606
and then, just, you know...
Oh, I'm so sorry.

497
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:32,640
Not as sorry as you would be,

498
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:35,198
if I just blinked behind you
and stabbed you to death.

499
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:37,286
Well, that would be bad.

500
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:38,888
You know what, this is too hard.

501
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:41,768
Usually in these situations, you know,
everything happens so quickly.

502
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:43,282
The adrenaline is pumping.

503
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:47,920
I want you to think using
your brains, not your glands.

504
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:49,688
Now try again.

505
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:28,319
Hey, if we don't vanquish Eames,
can we at least vanquish Natalie?

506
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:30,286
Don't tempt me.

507
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:33,361
All right, I've got the cloning portion
of the vanquishing spell done.

508
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:35,645
I'm almost there with
the transmogrification.

509
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:38,323
Mine came out a little
country-Western.

510
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:40,957
"I am rejecting your deflection."

511
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:44,163
Well, it works for me, but you
have to get it past you-know-who.

512
00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:48,363
You know, Leo never had to
approve our spells. He trusted us.

513
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:50,560
Yeah, but she said that
she needs to hear it.

514
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:54,444
You know what, what she needs,
none of us can give her. Right?

515
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:57,567
Right, still, but personal feelings
aside, you kind of have to admire her

516
00:30:57,729 --> 00:30:59,526
professionally, you know.
She's very dedicated.

517
00:30:59,729 --> 00:31:01,401
Yeah, but she's not Leo.

518
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:03,682
How's that spell coming along?

519
00:31:03,889 --> 00:31:05,447
- Great, all done.
- Good.

520
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:07,167
Here you go.

521
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:14,045
Okay. Let's nail this warlock.

522
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:16,240
All right, I'll start scrying
for his location.

523
00:31:16,449 --> 00:31:18,041
No need, I've been working
on a new plan.

524
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,404
One that will allow us to fight
on our turf, not his.

525
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:25,000
- Make him come to us? How?
- What he wants is what you've got.

526
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:28,725
- You're gonna use yourself as bait.
- If I orb in somewhere unprotected,

527
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,961
Eames should be able to track
me with his darklighter powers.

528
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:35,963
With the three of you in position, as
soon as Eames shows up, I orb out.

529
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:37,443
The advantage is all ours.

530
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:40,198
No, we can't let you do that,
it's too dangerous.

531
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:44,041
- I appreciate your concern.
- My concern is not for you.

532
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:49,485
At least not just for you.
My concern is, if you fail...

533
00:31:49,689 --> 00:31:51,839
I won't fail, I've gone
over every permutation.

534
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:54,648
So long as we follow the rules,
we'll succeed.

535
00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:11,082
Now.

536
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:18,040
- Clone.
- All right, be ready with the spell.

537
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:20,040
He could be anywhere.
Get the crossbow.

538
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:25,639
Wait. Where is he?
Why isn't he fighting back?

539
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:27,801
Maybe because we got the crossbow.

540
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:30,284
No, something doesn't feel right.
This was way too easy.

541
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:32,445
Or even worse, anticlimactic.

542
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:34,884
Well, who cares? We got
the crossbow, let's go.

543
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:49,358
- Did you get it?
- We got it.

544
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:51,685
Yeah, but we didn't get Eames.

545
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:55,525
That's all right. He wasn't our
primary goal. You've done well.

546
00:32:55,729 --> 00:32:58,368
I don't know. I think
he gave up too easily.

547
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:00,241
Maybe you were just prepared,
and he wasn't.

548
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:03,082
It was our setting, our timing,
our plan to execute.

549
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:05,120
Yeah, but we didn't get
a chance to execute it.

550
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:08,240
We got what we wanted,
and no one got hurt.

551
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:09,922
This is what happens
when whitelighters

552
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:11,317
and witches work hard together.

553
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:14,641
And thanks to you, they'll get
a chance to do a lot more of it.

554
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,720
I'll bring this up there.

555
00:33:17,969 --> 00:33:19,561
Does that mean Leo
gets to come back?

556
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:24,166
That's not my call.
I'll see you later.

557
00:33:26,689 --> 00:33:29,328
So Eames didn't fight at all?

558
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:31,966
Not at all. I flung, he fled.

559
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:36,048
- Did you wait for him? Look for him?
- No, we were playing by the rules.

560
00:33:36,249 --> 00:33:38,558
And we grabbed the crossbow
just like you said.

561
00:33:40,569 --> 00:33:42,127
The crossbow.

562
00:33:56,809 --> 00:34:00,245
She was right. Way too easy.

563
00:34:00,449 --> 00:34:01,802
No!

564
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:18,444
We followed the stupid rules,
and look what happened.

565
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:19,843
I hate rules.

566
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:22,318
I knew something was wrong.
Why didn't I trust my instincts?

567
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:25,287
Well, none of us did.
But I am going to now. Leo.

568
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:27,358
- Leo!
- Leo!

569
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:34,208
Okay, look. We... We did everything
she asked, I swear.

570
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:38,044
I know, I was watching. I wasn't
supposed to, but, enough said.

571
00:34:38,249 --> 00:34:40,240
We're through playing
by the rules, you know.

572
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:42,320
All right, now we need to stop Eames.

573
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:45,083
I know from experience darklighter
poison doesn't kill immediately.

574
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,887
So there's still a window of opportunity.

575
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:49,080
Great, so we need a plan.
What are our options?

576
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:51,883
There's only one.
Breaks the rules bigtime.

577
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,842
You mean?

578
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,408
- And we?
- Yep.

579
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:56,928
- And that will?
- I hope.

580
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:05,998
You'd think dying would be easier
the second time around.

581
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:08,683
But it sure doesn't look like it.

582
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:12,478
It's useless to fight the poison.

583
00:35:13,249 --> 00:35:17,481
Don't you know,
death's just the beginning?

584
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,924
In this case, of a lot more death.

585
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:23,758
How's it feel to know
that you will be responsible

586
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:27,399
for the end of whitelighters
and witches alike?

587
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:29,804
The end of good.

588
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:33,327
Do I hear someone coming?

589
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:36,927
No.

590
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:40,682
But I hear someone going.

591
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:33,321
- What the hell are you doing up here?
- Kicking your ass.

592
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:36,124
Don't even bother trying to orb out,
it won't work.

593
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:38,679
You see, you didn't just get
the powers of a whitelighter,

594
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:40,282
but you got their vulnerability too.

595
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:44,767
So the poison in that arrow is killing
you just like you killed Natalie.

596
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,282
It's kind of poetic.

597
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:48,440
I'm kind of in a rhyming mood,
how about you girls?

598
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:50,759
Sure, this poison isn't
working fast enough for me.

599
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:54,804
Time for amends
And a victim's revenge

600
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:59,082
- Cloning power, turn sour
- Power to change, turn to strange

601
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,564
I'm rejecting your deflection

602
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:11,005
- Wow, it worked.
- Nothing anticlimactic about that.

603
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:16,726
Here comes one.

604
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:21,087
Made your whitelighter proud.

605
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:25,044
- Thanks, but we were just winging it.
- Well, whatever you did, it worked.

606
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,769
Well, not as well as
we would have liked.

607
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:31,399
- I'm sorry we couldn't save Natalie.
- I know, me too.

608
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:32,888
But she died for the greater good.

609
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:35,085
I know she would have
made that choice herself.

610
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:39,322
Although I don't think she would've
been too keen on us orbing up here.

611
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:43,358
Which is why we gotta get out of
here before we all get in trouble.

612
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,960
Okay, wait a second. No five-cent tour,
no meet the Elders?

613
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:52,167
- We're going.
- Leo.

614
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:55,446
It doesn't matter. It's not like
we get to remember it anyway.

615
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,560
You will this time.

616
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:35,245
So I just checked the messages
at home.

617
00:38:35,409 --> 00:38:38,242
And Reece called, said he
needs to talk to you about the case.

618
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,007
Really? Did he say it was urgent?

619
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:42,720
Well, what could be urgent
about the case?

620
00:38:45,129 --> 00:38:48,599
Nothing. Actually, I can't think of
anything that would be urgent.

621
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:51,881
I can. I urgently want Leo
to walk into this bar.

622
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:55,126
He's been up there a really long time,
and I'm starting to get worried.

623
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:58,241
I don't understand how they can be
mad at him after we saved their butts.

624
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:00,599
Well, he broke some
pretty big rules while doing it.

625
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,447
Yeah, well, if they hold that
against him,

626
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:04,042
I'm crossing over to the other side.

627
00:39:04,249 --> 00:39:08,003
- Ditto.
- Yeah, ditto.

628
00:39:08,169 --> 00:39:09,841
I gotta get back to work.

629
00:39:14,449 --> 00:39:16,360
All right, so, what's in
that head of yours?

630
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:18,326
Nothing.

631
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,878
- You know that.
- Don't joke.

632
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:24,529
Phoebe, if you want to talk about it,
I'm here.

633
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:27,161
I just want to help.

634
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:30,442
I...

635
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:34,960
I was just worried about Leo too,
you know?

636
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:42,006
I'll go get Piper.

637
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:46,600
- Hey.
- Hi.

638
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:49,203
- How you doing?
- Oh, I'm great.

639
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:51,720
Actually, I'm lying. I'm awful.

640
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:57,124
I am so sorry that
I am such a screw-up.

641
00:39:57,289 --> 00:40:01,805
Hey, hey, I'm the one who should
be apologising. I let you down.

642
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:05,718
I should have been watching more
carefully. It won't happen again, okay?

643
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:09,965
Hey, hey, hey. What took so long?
What happened?

644
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:12,683
- I have some news.
- Okay.

645
00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:15,722
Well, obviously they found out
that you'd been up there.

646
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:19,245
So they decided to review
the facts of the Natalie situation.

647
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:23,488
And they unanimously
decided to lift probation.

648
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:28,047
- What?
- Piper, we're officially engaged.

649
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:32,206
- Oh, that's so great!
- That's great.

650
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:34,362
Okay.
