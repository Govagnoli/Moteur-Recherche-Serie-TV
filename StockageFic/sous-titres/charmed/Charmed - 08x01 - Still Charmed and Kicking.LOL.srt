1
00:00:00,588 --> 00:00:01,734
Last season on Charmed

2
00:00:02,421 --> 00:00:03,548
We're in some serious trouble.

3
00:00:04,028 --> 00:00:05,971
Surrounded by the forces of the underworld...

4
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:08,236
Something tells me we're not getting out of this one girls.

5
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:10,794
And the motorworld closing in...

6
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:12,458
This is it!

7
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:18,826
The Charmed Ones faked their onwn deaths.

8
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:23,415
- We can start it all over again.
- So we can get the next generation ready to pick up what we left on.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,783
Cute. I can live with that.

10
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:30,039
Now Charmed season 8 begins.

11
00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:50,061
Peter, thank you for coming by.
I really appreciate this.

12
00:00:54,794 --> 00:00:56,322
We love you, Piper.

13
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:23,219
Pretty good turn out, uh?

14
00:01:24,795 --> 00:01:25,857
Phoebe?

15
00:01:25,949 --> 00:01:27,589
No Dad, I'm Piper.

16
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:29,541
That's Phoebe.

17
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:31,702
I can't believe how many leprechauns are at my urn.

18
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,487
Well they always said their att for you.

19
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,507
It's kind a creepy.

20
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:37,223
But I guess you can't be doing picky when you're dead.

21
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:39,021
You guys are driving me crazy, you know that?

22
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:42,046
Keep your voices a ton lower and look a little more bereaved.

23
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:43,733
Agent Keyes is watching.

24
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,653
Oh don't worry. He'll never figure this out.
How could he?

25
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:50,132
I still can't figure it out.

26
00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:53,795
Yeah at least we're alive, and more importantly,
free.

27
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,994
Yeah, but do you have to keep changing your looks all the time?
I mean just pick one and stick with it, would you?

28
00:01:58,356 --> 00:01:59,698
Why?
It's fun.

29
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,681
Poor Paige.
Not a lot of people at her urn.

30
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:06,688
I know. God thank, she's not here to see that.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,152
Excuse me.

32
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:11,704
Excuse me.

33
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,581
Wow!
What's Janice Dickinson doing here?

34
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:19,358
Oh Paige!

35
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:20,964
She knew Paige?

36
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,182
Waouh, I'm impressed.

37
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:27,084
You were the best friend I ever had.
What am I going to do without you?

38
00:02:30,663 --> 00:02:32,046
- Can we talk to you a minute?
- In private.

39
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:34,362
Excuse me, what are you doing?

40
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:40,680
What's the meaning of this?
Do you have any idea who I am?

41
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:45,416
Yeah.
As a matter of fact, we do.

42
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:47,530
Paige.

43
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:48,986
I'm sorry, who?

44
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:52,880
Nice try, the jig's up.

45
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,806
Oh alright, that's fine.

46
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,837
Well somebody had to cry at my funerals, didn't they?

47
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:59,821
We were supposed to keep a low profile.
What were you thinking?

48
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:05,210
I was thinking that I obviously spent too much time in the magical world
because nobody even cares that I'm dead.

49
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:10,067
That's not true. You have mourners.
I mean there are a lots of leprechauns out there.

50
00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:11,426
I mean real people.

51
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:16,896
- Well, there is your friend Glen.
- Yeah, Glen was at your urn. And Ruthy, our neighbour.

52
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,753
- No, she was just going to get coffee.
- Oh really?

53
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:20,999
My point exactly!

54
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,129
Oh  my God!

55
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:27,125
We can explain. It's....

56
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:28,436
Don't bother.

57
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,702
You scared me.
I thought we were busted.

58
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:38,397
What are you gonna be if you don't change back?
What are you doing?

59
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,677
Apparently having an identity crisis.

60
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:47,099
Oh! So it's ok for you to change your husband into...
Ouch.

61
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,643
What's wrong?

62
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,572
It's the jingling in my head.

63
00:04:50,844 --> 00:04:52,123
Does that mean the Elders know she's alive?

64
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:55,290
No, they can't. We clocked ourselves from them.

65
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:59,073
It could be a new charge.
You know, connections with their whitelighters are automatic.

66
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:01,457
Ok. Well, just ignore it.

67
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:04,801
Easy for you yo say. You are not half whitelighter, ok?

68
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:07,848
Maybe it's one of the mourners.

69
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:10,297
It could be a demon out there.

70
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:15,072
No, no, no, no, no, no demons.

71
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:19,863
Why? It makes sense, doesn't it?

72
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,199
I mean they've probably found out we're not really dead.

73
00:05:22,503 --> 00:05:24,589
It doesn't matter. We retired.
We don't do demons anymore.

74
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:27,038
She's right. You just gonna have to forget about it.

75
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:29,430
Not so easy with the jingle jingle.

76
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,471
- What does he doing here?
- He who?

77
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:33,991
I did not even think he knew I existed.

78
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:35,181
Who is he?

79
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:39,230
I don't know his name.
He's some guy that I used to see in the elevator all the time at work.

80
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:40,721
He's kind a cute.

81
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:42,113
Yeah.

82
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:45,827
Ok people. Move now. I'll go later.
Come on, we can't risk being caught.

83
00:05:46,115 --> 00:05:47,203
Chabiti Chap chap chap.

84
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:51,139
Of course, I don't know if Phoebe ever thought me as a friend,

85
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:54,745
but I always thought of her as mine.

86
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:57,832
Oh I know for a fact she's really glad you're here, Elise.

87
00:05:59,865 --> 00:06:02,384
When I say I know, I mean it in a serious sense of course.

88
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,999
Sensing.

89
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:06,310
Of course.

90
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:14,009
I'll never realised she knew so many little people though.

91
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:15,505
Yes.

92
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:21,670
- You must be devastated Mister Bennett.
- Yeah.

93
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,798
Especially considering how it happened.

94
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,737
Was there ever an official cause of death?

95
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:27,914
Excuse me?

96
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:31,168
Oh forgive me for prying.
It's just that the news always made it sound...

97
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,360
so mysterious. And with no remains.

98
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,974
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

99
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:39,063
Oz.

100
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,014
Paul Oz.

101
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,369
And you knew my daughters how?

102
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:44,985
By reputation.

103
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:50,832
I mean, did the police ever find your son in law by any chance, Leo?

104
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:54,383
No, they think he died in the accident as well.

105
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:57,631
And now you have to raise those boys all by yourself,

106
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:02,048
in this huge house.

107
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:06,174
If you find that you need to sell it though,

108
00:07:07,332 --> 00:07:08,061
let me know.

109
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:09,831
I'll be glad to help.

110
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:12,872
You're a real estate agent?

111
00:07:13,143 --> 00:07:15,519
Specialised in the moving out problem properties,

112
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,150
you know,

113
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:20,741
people died, buying seems a little bit easy.

114
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:23,245
Get out.

115
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:27,996
Again,

116
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,339
my condoleances.

117
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:46,537
Well,

118
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,624
are they dead or not?

119
00:07:49,087 --> 00:07:50,000
They're dead.

120
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:54,407
So we can do it now.
Nobody can stop us.

121
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,887
Except for the demons,

122
00:07:56,486 --> 00:08:00,118
which is why we need to establish a fought hole
in the motorworld as soon as possible.

123
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,853
First we must wait the mour...

124
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,453
We do as I say.

125
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:05,741
Who says you decide?

126
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:08,749
There is no order in the underworld anymore.

127
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:13,637
Now that Zankou and his generation have been decimated,
it's our time to play.

128
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:16,587
Which means it's every demon for himself.

129
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:22,030
Until one demon rises to power.
And then you'll be forced to answer to him.

130
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:23,781
Is that what you want?

131
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,341
What I want

132
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,774
is to scare the living out alive people.

133
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:30,932
Literally.

134
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:37,162
- Each to his own gives.
- Fine then. Go.

135
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:44,948
Me, I want out of this hole, take over the symbolixy the power
before anybody else does.

136
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:46,699
The Charmed Ones' home.

137
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:49,411
How do you plan to get it?

138
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:52,305
I'm going to buy it from their father's estate,

139
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:54,634
after I kill him.

140
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,353
This case isn't dead.

141
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,135
I mean, you said so yourself, right?
So?

142
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,976
So don't we get back to this place, why aren't we just staying here?

143
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,431
I don't understand.

144
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,735
You've spent years trying to prove there's something else out there, right?

145
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:16,477
Some unseen power.

146
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:18,629
But then you walk away from it just like that?

147
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:19,988
Just like that.

148
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:26,110
And what about what happened to inspector Sheridan?
That thing that killed her?

149
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:30,453
Or what about that cop? He swears he saw Léo at the scene of the crime.
And that means if he's still alive...

150
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:34,740
It's over agent Murphy. The sisters are dead.

151
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:39,404
You don't believe that.

152
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:43,821
You're right, I don't.

153
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:45,981
But I want them to think I do.

154
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:49,851
If they're hidding, they're not going to the surface
without looking around.

155
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:54,722
So, we leave.
But I'm good comfortable. Completly.

156
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:56,467
But then how you'll know...

157
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:59,496
Because you're going to stay behind. That's how.

158
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:01,041
Keep an eye on things for me.

159
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:05,784
You let go. Be patient.
And give them plenty of space.

160
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:08,535
If they are still alive, they'll come home,

161
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:10,984
sooner or later.
Everyone always does.

162
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:19,634
How well did you know Phoebe?

163
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:24,713
Not as well as I liked to. But I loved to read her column .

164
00:10:24,952 --> 00:10:25,511
Really?

165
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:26,832
Yeah, every day.

166
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:31,112
I'll never got how somebody as beautiful as she was could be so incredibly insightful.

167
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:32,568
You don't say.

168
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:35,384
- Excuse me, do you mind?
- It's alright, I've got this.

169
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,095
You were saying, about Phoebe?

170
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:42,094
Just said I thought she was great.

171
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:43,958
Really great.

172
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,589
Then, why didn't you ever ask her out?

173
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:47,645
What?

174
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,920
Thanks for coming. Sorry you have to go.

175
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:52,280
Ok. Bye bye.

176
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:54,959
Piper, what are you doing?

177
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,679
What are you doing!

178
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:58,695
You can't pick up on a guy at a funeral.

179
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,743
Why not? It's my funeral.

180
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:07,352
It's ok sweetie, mummy is right here.

181
00:11:09,304 --> 00:11:10,664
Wyatt, honey, what's the matter?

182
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,303
It is known as you Piper.

183
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:20,654
It's ok buddy, alright, Dad is here,  ok?
We're all here.

184
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:22,396
Mummy.

185
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:23,860
Aunt Phoebe.

186
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,812
Ok, see?

187
00:11:26,322 --> 00:11:27,924
Poor little guy. He's confused.

188
00:11:28,276 --> 00:11:32,345
He doesn't know what's going on, neither does baby Chris.
All this change make him nervous.

189
00:11:32,697 --> 00:11:35,186
Yeah, maybe we didn't exactly think the thing through.

190
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:36,889
We didn't had time to think it through.

191
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:38,986
And it's too late to go back now.
So what do we do?

192
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:41,959
I think I have an idea.

193
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:43,390
Follow me.

194
00:11:48,782 --> 00:11:50,087
It's a good thing we kept this.

195
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,998
Yeah, but we're not supposed to use it.

196
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,484
The more magic we use,
- the more likely the demons are to find us out.

197
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:59,197
We didn't say we'll never use magic again. Besides,

198
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:00,940
I think we really need this spell.

199
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:02,148
What do you wanna do?

200
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:04,204
End up confusion, hopefully.

201
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:07,515
I've been thinking about it for the last couple of days, and all we need to do,

202
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:10,595
is each of us to come up with one look, one disguise,

203
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,787
that we wanna project to the rest of the world.

204
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:14,530
You mean like a permanent, permanent one?

205
00:12:14,825 --> 00:12:15,994
That's the idea.

206
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:18,638
How is it gonna end up confusion, especially for the boys?

207
00:12:18,998 --> 00:12:22,054
Oh because they won't see the disguises,
neither would any of us.

208
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:23,900
Ok. Just trust me.

209
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:25,820
You guys have a look in mind?

210
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,851
Ok. You know what? Nothing flash either.

211
00:12:30,427 --> 00:12:31,562
Ok, ready?

212
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,313
I call upon the ancient powers,
to mask us now and in future hours,

213
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:40,146
hide us well apparently
but not from those we call family.

214
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:45,033
Well, anything happened?

215
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,193
Do we look the same?

216
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:46,968
Yeah.

217
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:48,268
Maybe it didn't work.

218
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:53,228
It definitively worked.

219
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:55,461
Oh my Godness, is that me?

220
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,491
Is it the you you had in vision?

221
00:12:58,356 --> 00:12:59,755
Hey, I thought you said no flash!

222
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,843
It was the first look that came to mind!

223
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:03,162
I like it.

224
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:06,802
How is it you can see your other selves reflected in the mirror?

225
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:08,114
It's part of the spell.

226
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,945
You know, this just might work.

227
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,056
The jingle again.

228
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:17,680
Do you think it means something bad is gonna happen?

229
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,688
Ok.
- Hey, I'm not done!

230
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,879
It doesn't matter. You are now.
It's an identity, not a novel.

231
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:10,669
As long as it reflects who you're trying to be and where we've come from,
we're all good.

232
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:15,908
Ok. Julie, nice. Jo, Jenny, Louis?

233
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,795
Louis, you know, like Louis Amstrong? You know, the great sax male?

234
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,388
The trumpeter?

235
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:25,619
Yeah I think Dad used to listen to him.

236
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:30,291
Ok. You can deal with it, so can the government.

237
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:38,328
Voilà.

238
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,786
New identities.

239
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:41,513
Are you sure?

240
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:43,478
Only one way to find out.

241
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,639
- Let's go shopping.
- No.

242
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:48,199
- Yep.
- No, wait, no.

243
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:53,773
Come on! We have seven years of lost time to make up for!
We just have to start somewhere.

244
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:56,260
- Yeah I know, but...
- No buts!

245
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,339
We are free.

246
00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:58,978
Do you have any idea what that means?

247
00:14:59,403 --> 00:15:02,738
No more demons, no more cops.
We can do whatever we want.

248
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:04,352
I know, I know, but still...

249
00:15:04,618 --> 00:15:06,864
Would you please talk some senses to this woman?

250
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:11,607
You know what occured to me?
That real estate agent that Daryl was talking about,

251
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:12,832
if you think about it,

252
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:15,967
- he may be a ...
- Oh my God!

253
00:15:16,686 --> 00:15:18,974
If you say the d word, I might implode.

254
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:20,630
Come on you guys!

255
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:22,989
What's wrong? Isn't it what we wanted?

256
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:28,206
Yeah, it's just it's not as simple as I had hoped.
That's all.

257
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,085
You know why?

258
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:30,878
Because you haven't been out yet.

259
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,102
And you will feel so much better in a new pair of shoes.

260
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:37,140
- I don't need new shoes.
- That's the old you talking!

261
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:41,827
Come on you guys! Can't we at least try to have fun?

262
00:15:42,212 --> 00:15:43,938
Don't we owe ourselves that much?

263
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:47,570
- Yes, we do ...
- That's the spirit! Paige?

264
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:50,754
I mean Jo, shoes on with me?

265
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:54,705
I may just stay here and relax a little.

266
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:56,345
Relax,

267
00:15:57,537 --> 00:16:00,319
I like it. Relax. Come on.

268
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:11,213
He was not kidding on me.

269
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:13,916
He was to! He was pratically drawling on you.

270
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:15,052
First, I'm married.

271
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,788
Secondly he's a salesman in a woman shoe store.

272
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:19,803
What are the chances he's not gay?

273
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:22,341
Who cares? Just enjoy.
That's our new mentor, right?

274
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:23,967
Still, maybe Paige is right.

275
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:25,936
I don't think this new look is me.

276
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:27,047
I think you look hot.

277
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,919
Easy sis, don't creep me out.

278
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,598
Hey we're not sisters anymore, remember? We're cousins.

279
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:32,885
Still creepy.

280
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:38,628
Isn't there any part of you that doubts your decision at all?

281
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:42,491
No. I mean, I like new pair of shoes, so I bought new pair of shoes.

282
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:43,869
Not the shoes!

283
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:46,492
Pretending to be dead to the rest of the world.

284
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:51,497
Oh yeah. I mean obviously there are certain aspects of my life
that I really liked.

285
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:55,081
But I couldn't fully enjoy it because of all the witch stuff.

286
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:57,808
Yeah but the witch stuff is who we are.

287
00:16:58,088 --> 00:17:00,849
I mean we can't just walk around pretending we don't have powers anymore.

288
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:03,167
Yeah but Piper, nobody's saying that we have to.

289
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,234
We just don't have to use our powers every other week to save the world.

290
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:07,504
That's the only difference.

291
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:11,865
That and the fact that the last three decades of our lives are simply gone.

292
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,920
We have to give up something to gain something.

293
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:19,567
Look, you wanted a normal life more than all of us. Right?

294
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:22,175
So what changed all of a sudden?

295
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:23,988
I'm a little neurotic. What do you want from me?!

296
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:25,540
That's not it. What else is it?

297
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:27,204
It's just, it's a big change.

298
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,178
And I don't do change very well.

299
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:33,161
So you know, just let me freak out for a little while and then, you know, I'm sure

300
00:17:33,497 --> 00:17:34,688
I'll be fine.

301
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:38,488
Ok, you wanna go get a high embrace block?

302
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,504
J, I'd love to but no, I have to go check on P3

303
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:45,191
and make sure Dad hasn't done a lot of damage

304
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:47,815
besisdes it's gonna be the only thing that will pay for all these shoes.

305
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,437
You worry too much, Missy.

306
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,079
Phoebe has a life outside the magic.

307
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:05,562
Or at least she had one.

308
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:08,392
Piper has Léo. Piper has the boys.

309
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:12,166
What do I have? I have a giant sucking hole of nothingness.

310
00:18:12,696 --> 00:18:16,311
Oh please Paige, spare me the dramatics and cut to the chase, would you?

311
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:19,151
I've got an after life to live, you know?

312
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:22,094
See, even you have a life, and you're dead.

313
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:24,789
I just don't know where to start.

314
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,796
You know it's not like anydody asked for my opinion
before abandonning the Charmed legacy in the first place.

315
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:31,852
Thanks Grams.

316
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:33,987
I'm so glad you came. You've been a great help.

317
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,863
Look honey, I'm sorry.

318
00:18:36,337 --> 00:18:39,475
But you are the one who caught yourself in that mess, not me.

319
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,201
I didn't have the choice. Ok. We didn't have the choice.

320
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,801
We were going to die, the real way.

321
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:47,592
I understand, and I'm not judging you.

322
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,448
Well, maybe I'm a little.

323
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:53,785
But my point is that you've made a choice,

324
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,783
whether you were forced into or not,

325
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:57,360
and you've gotta live with that choice,

326
00:18:57,616 --> 00:18:58,719
whether you like it or not.

327
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:00,272
What if I can't?

328
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:01,822
Oh that's ridiculous!

329
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:06,925
No, it's not. I want a life outside the magic, I really do. But...

330
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,277
But what?

331
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:14,119
But it's the jingling, ok? I hear it night and day

332
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,232
which means people are constantly calling for my help.

333
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:18,496
That is just the whitelighter in you.

334
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:22,310
But that's still me Grams, and that's still magic.

335
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:25,454
So what if I can't ever really get away from it?

336
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:30,925
One thing is for sure, young lady.

337
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:35,515
You'll never gonna find what you're looking for sitting around here.

338
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,418
You want a fresh start?

339
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:41,834
Then pull yourself up by your bootstraps,
get out into the world, and try it on for size.

340
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:44,025
See what happens.

341
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:45,769
I don't know.

342
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:48,762
Hey, you don't want my advice? Don't conjure me next time.

343
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:50,092
Now,

344
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:50,875
get up,

345
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:52,740
get a grip

346
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:56,491
and don't come back until you find your thrill.

347
00:19:57,203 --> 00:19:57,722
Now, go.

348
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,947
Great, just great.

349
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:25,982
- Oups, sorry.
- Why? It's my fault.

350
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:27,558
No, alright, it's mine.

351
00:20:27,665 --> 00:20:28,858
I didn't see you.

352
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,777
Well, I saw you. That's for sure.

353
00:20:32,178 --> 00:20:34,649
I mean, how could a beautiful girl sitting around here by herself?

354
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:36,578
I'm sorry?

355
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:37,826
Nothing.

356
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:40,873
Do you mind if I join you?

357
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:42,655
Oh actually I was...

358
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:45,835
Yeah sure,why not?

359
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:46,905
Good.

360
00:20:51,592 --> 00:20:52,688
You're new around here, aren't you?

361
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:54,338
No, I'm not.

362
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:56,433
Why do you ask?

363
00:20:56,774 --> 00:20:58,414
I know this place at all.

364
00:20:58,862 --> 00:21:00,573
Pretty much everybody is regular.

365
00:21:01,014 --> 00:21:03,790
And you know I'm not.

366
00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:07,156
I definitively would remember seeing you before.

367
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:09,092
Help!

368
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,793
He took her purse!

369
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:15,996
What are you doing? Where do you go?
Are you out of your mind? You're gotta get yourself killed!

370
00:21:22,985 --> 00:21:25,056
Damnit! Why didn't I orb!

371
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,303
Would you stop it already?

372
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:31,320
I give up.

373
00:22:22,922 --> 00:22:23,955
Did you call for me?

374
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:25,130
I don't think so.

375
00:22:26,786 --> 00:22:29,185
You don't have the power to stop me whitelighter.

376
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:30,705
You obviously don't know who I am.

377
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:33,329
Which is probably a good thing.

378
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:38,376
Shh!

379
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:45,315
Doesn't that burn your hand?

380
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:53,157
Damn!

381
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:55,389
Iwa hoping for such a better fight with my first demon.

382
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,996
You are a demon, aren't you?

383
00:23:00,951 --> 00:23:01,926
Shhh!!

384
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:08,326
Now help me out here, I'm new at this.

385
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,998
Who pays for that?

386
00:23:21,794 --> 00:23:22,409
Hey buddy.

387
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:25,321
It's still kinda loaded out there.

388
00:23:25,356 --> 00:23:26,048
You're kidding me.

389
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,327
Well I'll get the girls to do the whole hocus pocus, uh?

390
00:23:29,632 --> 00:23:31,079
No, no more magic,

391
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,479
unless it's absolutely necessary. They've gotta get out of the habit from lying on it.

392
00:23:36,086 --> 00:23:37,311
Or they'll never gonna have normal lives.

393
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:39,407
Yeah, right like it's ever gonna happen.

394
00:23:40,528 --> 00:23:41,776
Why you don't think it will?

395
00:23:42,094 --> 00:23:44,422
Well, do you, Louis?

396
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,200
Come on, who are you trying to kid here?

397
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:50,130
Whether you like it or not, and you know I don't,

398
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:52,542
being magical is part of who they are,

399
00:23:53,872 --> 00:23:55,011
is part of who you are.

400
00:23:56,112 --> 00:23:57,870
You're maybe able to change your identities, but

401
00:23:58,497 --> 00:23:59,745
it didn't changed that.

402
00:24:00,627 --> 00:24:02,438
We just do the best we can.

403
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:04,522
Yeah, but what if that's not good enough?

404
00:24:06,749 --> 00:24:10,409
Leo, I don't mean to sound pessimistic 'cause I really want this to work out.

405
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:13,019
But it's not gonna be easy,

406
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,200
especially for you and Piper.

407
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:16,652
Why especially for us?

408
00:24:17,445 --> 00:24:20,145
'Cause you've got the boys to raise like that, and...

409
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:23,075
- Where is the baby model?
- I just checked on Chris, he's sleeping.

410
00:24:23,626 --> 00:24:24,220
Go on.

411
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,029
Well, don't listen to me.

412
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:29,534
Worried is Granpy.

413
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:32,517
You think I know better by now.

414
00:24:32,984 --> 00:24:36,098
I've been worried since I first found out the kids are gonna be witches.

415
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,416
You know, maybe you should go home for a while, Victor.

416
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:45,183
You know, get away from all of this.
You've been around here for about a week or so now.

417
00:24:45,804 --> 00:24:49,426
Yeah I will. Just as soon as things are ok down here.

418
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,979
Listen why won't you wash?

419
00:24:51,485 --> 00:24:52,963
I would get the rest, Leo.

420
00:25:05,177 --> 00:25:06,581
I mean you no harm, Victor.

421
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:08,136
My name is Jonas.

422
00:25:08,604 --> 00:25:09,423
I'm an Elder.

423
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:11,453
I just need to talk to you, alright?

424
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,173
Alright.

425
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:14,390
Good.

426
00:25:15,592 --> 00:25:18,945
Now I know what you're going through,
what you still must be going through.

427
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:23,148
Children should bury their fathers, not the other way around.

428
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,457
Go on.

429
00:25:25,783 --> 00:25:27,000
- We've been talking.
- We?

430
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:28,813
The other Elders and myself,

431
00:25:29,037 --> 00:25:30,505
about the boys, Wyatt and Chris.

432
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,189
Losing their parents, their aunts, it's unspeakable.

433
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,377
Especially considering who they were.

434
00:25:37,206 --> 00:25:41,415
Which is why we feel very strongly that it would be in the boys' best interet...

435
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:43,144
You're not taking them. Forget it.

436
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:45,483
Victor, you're mourning.

437
00:25:46,065 --> 00:25:48,167
You can't possibly raise them to become...

438
00:25:48,191 --> 00:25:48,919
I'm their grandfather.

439
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:50,494
That's all I need to be.

440
00:25:50,806 --> 00:25:54,460
I don't think you quite realize the extend to which our future, all our future,

441
00:25:54,749 --> 00:25:56,094
depends upon their upbringing.

442
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:57,505
I've got a pretty good idea.

443
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,275
Then you know they'll continue to be targets of evil.

444
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:03,731
Demons won't stop, but nothing to turn them to the aside or worse,

445
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:06,428
destroy them. And how would you protect them?

446
00:26:06,637 --> 00:26:07,530
I'll find a way.

447
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:10,473
They should come with me now, for their sakes.

448
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,625
Over my dead body.

449
00:26:24,241 --> 00:26:26,076
I pray you know what you're doing.

450
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:35,461
Are you still sure you don't wanna go home?

451
00:26:35,842 --> 00:26:38,138
Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

452
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:47,918
Where have you been?

453
00:26:48,293 --> 00:26:50,301
Oh, you know, just kind of a walk.

454
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:55,612
Oh, you're bleeding.

455
00:26:56,677 --> 00:26:58,246
How did that happen?

456
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:02,301
Yeah, how did that happen?

457
00:27:02,776 --> 00:27:06,872
How is that the great Elkin got his ass kicked by what?

458
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,896
Louzy witch.

459
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,541
I didn't get my ass kicked.

460
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:14,024
I could have easily killed her if I wasn't worried about exposure.

461
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:15,477
She wasn't?

462
00:27:15,723 --> 00:27:18,111
Which is why I'm not even sure she was a witch.

463
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,593
What could she have been?

464
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:20,819
An usher?

465
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,094
Whoever she was,

466
00:27:28,497 --> 00:27:30,080
she tracked me there somehow.

467
00:27:30,656 --> 00:27:32,506
Which means we'll cross pass again.

468
00:27:33,232 --> 00:27:36,147
And next time, I'll be waiting.

469
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:37,312
I don't like it.

470
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:41,041
Not with the whitelighter there too.

471
00:27:41,445 --> 00:27:42,322
There's more to this.

472
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,487
I can handle them both.

473
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:47,784
It's not like we had to worry about the Charmed Ones coming to the rescue anymore.

474
00:27:47,785 --> 00:27:51,423
Still, we should consolidate our powers regardless of the three.

475
00:27:51,848 --> 00:27:53,396
We'll kill the father in nightfall,

476
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,330
while the powerful progenie sleeps.

477
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:03,982
One week, one louzy week.

478
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,132
Are you kidding me?

479
00:28:05,989 --> 00:28:10,530
Bary Manalow? Dad, you booked Bary Manalow!
What were you thinking!

480
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:11,480
Hello.

481
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:14,121
Dominic, thank God you're here.

482
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:16,598
Are these all the receipts for the last seven nights?

483
00:28:16,885 --> 00:28:17,846
Has everything been entered?

484
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:19,251
I'm sorry. Who are you?

485
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:25,426
I'm Julie. I mean Jenny Bennett.

486
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:27,779
I'm Victor's cousin.

487
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:30,536
Niece, I'm Victor's niece.

488
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,615
Ok. So what do you do with that computer?

489
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,544
And how did you get the password?

490
00:28:36,998 --> 00:28:39,402
Uncle Victor gave it to me.

491
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:43,071
Excuse me.

492
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:47,936
New shoes.

493
00:28:48,004 --> 00:28:50,098
They look a lot nicer than they feel.

494
00:28:50,904 --> 00:28:51,882
So you work here now?

495
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:56,496
No, I'm just helping out a little you know, 'cause Victor asked me to help out.

496
00:28:58,331 --> 00:28:59,964
Wouldn't you mind if I call him to verify that, would you?

497
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,203
No, not at all. Please, knocked your socks off.

498
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:10,839
Hello?

499
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:12,868
What?

500
00:29:13,494 --> 00:29:14,249
Wait, wait, what?

501
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:17,489
Leo, we're not supposed to have familial emergencies anymore.

502
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:18,750
We're done with that.

503
00:29:20,016 --> 00:29:22,177
Alright, fine, I'm coming. But you need to calm down here

504
00:29:22,212 --> 00:29:24,723
and find a way to save our financial butts.

505
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,399
I still can't believe she's really gone.

506
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:50,809
She was always so sweet to me.

507
00:29:51,314 --> 00:29:52,977
She always had a smile for everyone.

508
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,201
She was always there where you needed her.

509
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,352
She helped me through my divorce.

510
00:29:57,697 --> 00:29:59,475
She doubled our readership.

511
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:04,132
here we go.

512
00:30:04,546 --> 00:30:05,235
Thanks.

513
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:07,682
Who are you?

514
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:10,409
I'm Julie Bennett,

515
00:30:11,094 --> 00:30:13,259
Phoebe's cousin, from her father side.

516
00:30:13,554 --> 00:30:15,894
Oh my dear I am so sorry for you loss.

517
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,253
I know you are.

518
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:20,514
I just came by to pick up some of her things,

519
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:22,630
so don't mind me.

520
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:24,486
Were you close to Phoebe?

521
00:30:25,177 --> 00:30:27,157
Yes, I was.

522
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:29,063
She was amazing, wasn't she?

523
00:30:29,783 --> 00:30:30,726
Adorable.

524
00:30:31,878 --> 00:30:33,791
The best friend I could ever ask for.

525
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:35,469
That is so sweet.

526
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:37,110
Oh I mean it. She was the best.

527
00:30:38,758 --> 00:30:40,752
I'm gonna miss her like crazy.

528
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:42,594
See now you're gonna go et make me cry.

529
00:30:42,854 --> 00:30:43,587
It's the truth.

530
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:47,969
She was more than just the heart and soul of this paper.

531
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,849
She was the daughter I've never had.

532
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,945
Oh Elise! I had no idea!

533
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,191
I mean, Phoebe had no idea.

534
00:31:02,414 --> 00:31:06,635
I mean she never told me how close you both were.

535
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:08,818
But then again, why would she have told me?

536
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:11,879
Because then obviously she didn't know this was gonna

537
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:15,082
happen.

538
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:17,551
Carry on.

539
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:30,261
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

540
00:31:36,878 --> 00:31:38,887
Ho, hi.

541
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:41,675
Hi.

542
00:31:43,831 --> 00:31:45,342
Oh that's right, you don't know who I am.

543
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:51,606
I'm Julie, Phoebe's cousin.

544
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:53,146
I'd swear I saw you at the wake.

545
00:31:53,605 --> 00:31:56,638
Oh yeah, so sorry.

546
00:31:57,641 --> 00:31:58,604
Thanks.

547
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:05,970
And you're?

548
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:07,370
Dex.

549
00:32:07,996 --> 00:32:08,809
Dex Lawson.

550
00:32:09,106 --> 00:32:11,339
- Dex Lawson. nice to meet you Dex.
- You too.

551
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:30,287
Everything alright?

552
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,365
Yeah, it's...just...

553
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:37,383
hotter here.

554
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,455
Ding!

555
00:32:41,942 --> 00:32:42,918
Nice meeting you.

556
00:32:59,996 --> 00:33:01,140
Are you out of your mind?

557
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,195
Leo told us that you fought a demon?

558
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:04,435
I can explain.

559
00:33:04,754 --> 00:33:06,378
What is this? What are you doing?

560
00:33:06,705 --> 00:33:07,921
I am trying to find a girl.

561
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,850
Ok. Look. We have been through this.

562
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:11,890
Ok. If anyone finds out we're alive,

563
00:33:12,153 --> 00:33:12,849
we're screwed.

564
00:33:13,264 --> 00:33:15,560
Do you have a death wish? Is that the problem?

565
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,224
Ok. Would you two please be quiet for a minute

566
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,415
and let me explain.

567
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:20,543
Thank you.

568
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:24,302
Firstable, I didn't intentionally engaged a demon.

569
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:25,830
Oh, don't say engaged.

570
00:33:26,782 --> 00:33:27,351
Don't ask.

571
00:33:27,902 --> 00:33:29,877
Look, I just had the ring ring in my head and

572
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:32,357
and I just figured to find answers that maybe, you know...

573
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:35,716
You're not supposed to respond to anything, anymore.

574
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:40,875
Look it's very hard not to respond to a call for help.

575
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:42,083
Paige, you have to.

576
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:43,922
Ok, we've had this conversation.

577
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:46,217
Yeah, I know we have, but that's not that easy.

578
00:33:46,402 --> 00:33:48,410
Ok, everybody just calm down a second.

579
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,783
Did you at least vanquished the demon?

580
00:33:53,872 --> 00:33:54,737
No.

581
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,943
But on the right side, he did not knew who I was.

582
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,142
That's good at least.

583
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:03,286
So what happened to the demon?

584
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:04,621
I don't know.

585
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:07,245
This chick came along and just scared him off.

586
00:34:07,853 --> 00:34:08,540
What chick?

587
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:23,779
We wait for him to come back downstairs.

588
00:34:24,778 --> 00:34:25,722
Alone.

589
00:34:26,186 --> 00:34:26,770
I don't know who she was.

590
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,315
She just showed up right after I got there.

591
00:34:28,594 --> 00:34:29,938
Do you think she was a whitch?

592
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:31,281
I don't know. Maybe.

593
00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:32,833
Maybe she was the one that called you.

594
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:35,585
No. This girl definitively did not need my help.

595
00:34:36,144 --> 00:34:37,535
Could it be a bad witch?

596
00:34:37,848 --> 00:34:40,680
And if that's true and she figures out who we are?

597
00:34:40,752 --> 00:34:43,103
I'm telling you, she was after the demon,

598
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:44,702
she was not interested in me.

599
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,622
Still she could have ided you

600
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:48,598
and that would have been very bad.

601
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:51,517
Oh for quiet now loud.

602
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:52,907
Give her a break, will you?

603
00:34:53,987 --> 00:34:55,642
Grams? What are you doing here?

604
00:34:56,003 --> 00:34:58,546
Well I'm trying to keep you from ganging up on her, that's what.

605
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:00,010
Well you're sort of dead

606
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,697
so that doesn't really concern you.

607
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:04,217
It does when my legacy is at stake.

608
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:05,177
Oh please,

609
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:06,873
I think we paid our dues.

610
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:08,536
And I'm not saying that you haven't.

611
00:35:08,864 --> 00:35:12,071
You have every right to want to live normal and common lives.

612
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:14,799
But just because you want to, it doesn't mean you can.

613
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,658
You're a little late with that speech.

614
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:18,462
Perhaps for the two of you.

615
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:19,637
But not for Paige.

616
00:35:21,477 --> 00:35:22,660
Whether or not you succeed,

617
00:35:23,174 --> 00:35:24,157
remain to be sane.

618
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:25,893
But you cannot deny

619
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:28,238
she is being called by somebody.

620
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:31,748
And you can't deny it either.

621
00:35:33,212 --> 00:35:34,115
You're right, I can't deny it.

622
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,380
Especially not right now.

623
00:35:38,352 --> 00:35:39,297
Hello Victor.

624
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:40,384
Now,

625
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,855
are you sure you don't wanna sell?

626
00:35:49,934 --> 00:35:51,197
Who are you?

627
00:35:54,053 --> 00:35:54,733
That doesn't sound good.

628
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:56,597
No, it doesn't.

629
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:57,884
Thank you for coming.

630
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,460
Ah! the girl days!

631
00:36:03,555 --> 00:36:04,715
??? Wyatt.

632
00:36:04,971 --> 00:36:05,827
- What?
- Who?

633
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:09,258
Where did he come from?

634
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,560
Behind you!

635
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,189
Thanks.

636
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:40,468
Show off.

637
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,914
She can't be all bad. She said thank you.

638
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,699
I don't know what she is.

639
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,925
She didn't stick around long enough for us to ask.

640
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:53,273
You've got to admit, that was a nice flip though.

641
00:36:53,894 --> 00:36:57,285
And a nice attitude. She didn't even care that we saw her using her powers.

642
00:36:57,624 --> 00:36:58,084
Why was that?

643
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:00,291
I think it's because she was tracking the first demon.

644
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:02,293
I mean he was the same one she was after before.

645
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:04,424
I also think she may be your new charge.

646
00:37:04,887 --> 00:37:05,440
Uh?

647
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:08,265
It's the second time she showed up right after you got a call.

648
00:37:09,247 --> 00:37:12,037
Which means she probably knows who we are and she could expose us.

649
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:13,238
She was after the demon,

650
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:14,221
not us.

651
00:37:14,621 --> 00:37:15,606
And the demons were going after Dad,

652
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:17,613
and he should be our main concern right now,

653
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,180
not this super girl.

654
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:22,195
The question is: why were they after him in the first place?

655
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:23,882
Who knows?

656
00:37:24,131 --> 00:37:24,963
Maybe to get to the boys,

657
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:26,610
or the house is some kind of trophee.

658
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:31,018
The point is, we're gonna have to go after the demon.

659
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,049
Even if it risks exposing us.

660
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:34,600
We may have already been exposed.

661
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:36,616
No, I don't think so.

662
00:37:36,984 --> 00:37:37,753
We were disguised to him

663
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,479
besides we didn't use our powers.

664
00:37:40,228 --> 00:37:42,294
The problem is we can't just vanquish the one demon.

665
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:44,534
We're gonna have to make some sort of statement,

666
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:46,896
otherwise we'll have to keep the entire underworld

667
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,051
from coming after Dad again and again.

668
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:50,052
Well here is our common goal people.

669
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,477
How could me make a statement without letting them know it's us.

670
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:12,437
I knew you'd come home sooner or later.

671
00:38:14,899 --> 00:38:15,585
You again?

672
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:16,741
Yeah.

673
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,753
Me again.

674
00:38:18,482 --> 00:38:20,536
And this time, I know you're alone.

675
00:38:21,526 --> 00:38:23,076
Just out of curiosity Victor,

676
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:26,268
who are those women at the house?

677
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:30,119
If you tell me, I promise to make your death

678
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,536
relatively painless.

679
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:33,733
J thanks!

680
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:34,840
Believe me,

681
00:38:35,237 --> 00:38:37,865
considering all the pain your daughters have caused over the years,

682
00:38:38,147 --> 00:38:39,490
that would be a gift.

683
00:38:41,468 --> 00:38:42,127
The women,

684
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:44,065
who are they?

685
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:46,676
I don't know who the other girl was,

686
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:49,349
but the others are cousins,

687
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:50,808
moving in.

688
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:51,882
No, they're not.

689
00:38:52,593 --> 00:38:53,802
I am.

690
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:03,194
You've got to be kidding me, right?

691
00:39:03,513 --> 00:39:05,975
You think that he can stop us all?

692
00:39:06,308 --> 00:39:06,999
Try him.

693
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,228
Spread the word:

694
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:28,666
leave us alone,

695
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:30,931
or he'll kill you all.

696
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:46,189
Where are the others?

697
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,140
Vainquished.

698
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:50,014
It was a set up.

699
00:39:53,845 --> 00:39:54,688
It was planned.

700
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:57,806
And not by the boy.

701
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,007
He's not old enough.

702
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:04,228
It could be

703
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:08,764
that the Charmed Ones are still alive?

704
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,686
Well, how did it go?

705
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:27,208
What do you think?

706
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,769
I think it worked.

707
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:31,200
I don't think he would have left unless he got the message.

708
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:33,059
Question is, will he deliver

709
00:40:33,277 --> 00:40:34,205
and will stick.

710
00:40:34,621 --> 00:40:35,209
I think so.

711
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:37,161
The whole underworld is afraid of Wyatt.

712
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,319
Apparently, my little guy's reputation precedes itself.

713
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:43,359
So that's it? We can get back to our lives now?

714
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,699
Whatever those are.

715
00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:47,904
Well one of them has wedding bells in them.

716
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:49,545
Later.

717
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:53,034
Ok, well, just as long as we're demon free,

718
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,134
that's all that matters.

719
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:57,588
Oh, lucky, lucky, who's finally come around?

720
00:40:58,433 --> 00:41:00,371
I told you I just needed a little time

721
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:05,197
and you know, a very big reminder of what our lives used to constantly be like.

722
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:06,090
Right.

723
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,879
We still have the little witch to contend with.

724
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:11,977
Oh no!

725
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:16,069
We don't. We don't.

726
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:17,925
You do.

727
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:19,288
She's your charge.

728
00:41:19,736 --> 00:41:20,210
No!

729
00:41:20,472 --> 00:41:21,053
Yeah.

730
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,652
Maybe you won't hear from her again.

731
00:41:26,139 --> 00:41:27,919
Has a feeling she would be sticking around for a while.

732
00:41:40,813 --> 00:41:42,266
Billy, where are you?

733
00:41:42,535 --> 00:41:43,795
We're late for class.

734
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,254
Yeah, just a minute.
