1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,513
Wait.

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,434
You don't really wanna kill me,
do you?

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,833
But how--?

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,149
We are one now.

5
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,315
I am reborn...

6
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,629
...within you.

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,034
I'll fight it.

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,191
I'll kill us both if I have to.

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,032
I won't let you hurt Phoebe.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,918
You...

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,718
...won't have a choice.

12
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,196
- Voilà!
- Oh, that looks great. Let's eat.

13
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,794
- Wait, where is everybody?
- I don't know.

14
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,188
Pass the croissants, please.

15
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,669
I don't understand. We were all
supposed to eat together,

16
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,034
you know, to celebrate.

17
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,270
Sisters. Butter?

18
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,875
Phoebe! Paige!

19
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,558
Paige.

20
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,070
Wait, Paige, did you orb in
from another room?

21
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,518
Yeah. Obviously, the landing
could still use a little work.

22
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,908
You've been practicing this?

23
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,719
Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything
until I knew for sure I could do it.

24
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,316
Food. Thank God, I am starving.

25
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,789
That's the orbing.
Burns a lot of calories.

26
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,234
Why do you think I married a chef?

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,031
I can't believe your powers
are already advancing.

28
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,031
This is just another reason
to celebrate.

29
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,957
- Leo, butter.
- Butter.

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,838
You should try the frittatas.
They're great.

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,719
You're both very welcome.

32
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,996
Oh, thank you, honey.
I just wanna eat fast

33
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,798
so I can get to work on time
for a change.

34
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,996
Well, I understand,
but, still, it's not every day

35
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,799
we vanquish The Source of All Evil.
I mean, the least you could do

36
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,030
is wait for Phoebe and Cole.

37
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,713
Oh, don't bother.

38
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,031
Cole's not here,
and all I need is a caffeine lV.

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,988
What is the matter with you people?
Our mortal enemy is gone, dead.

40
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,469
Is there nobody else
besides me happy about this?

41
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,515
Absolutely, honey. I'm thrilled.

42
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,353
Thank you for the spread.
Have a good day.

43
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
- I'm being summoned.
- What? Now? What do they want?

44
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,592
Maybe they just
wanna congratulate you guys.

45
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,479
- But--
- For the road.

46
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,956
Does he have to do that so brightly?

47
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,396
Well, that will teach me
to try and be in a good mood.

48
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,391
What's the matter with you?

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,592
I don't know.

50
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,751
I went to bed and I was really happy,

51
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,150
and then I woke up this morning,
and I just...

52
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,790
I had this horrible feeling
about Cole.

53
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,593
- Cole?
- Yeah, it's kind of hard to explain.

54
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,035
It feels like it's a premonition
that's trying to come out,

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,111
but it never quite does.

56
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,995
But whatever it is,
it's not a good thing.

57
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,276
Well, that doesn't
sound supernatural.

58
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,271
That sounds super normal.

59
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,429
You got cold feet.

60
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,997
Every bride-to-be does.
Trust me, even I did.

61
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,991
Just like that? Overnight?

62
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,878
Well, the only reason
you haven't gotten married

63
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,190
is because of The Source,
and now that he's dead,

64
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,273
you are that much closer to taking
that very long walk down the aisle.

65
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,316
I don't know.

66
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,509
It feels like there's something else.

67
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,956
- How did I get here?
- The Source's magic brought you.

68
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,031
I see you accepting that very soon--

69
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,715
You never told me I'd become
The Source if I helped vanquish him!

70
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,598
Don't be naive.

71
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,751
I told you of my vision.

72
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,911
Of you and l
doing great things together.

73
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,672
This is just the beginning.

74
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,160
You cannot change your fate.

75
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,959
As you can see,
the evil within you won't allow it.

76
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,872
I'll fight it.

77
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,156
I'll kill it. I'll find a way.

78
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,673
There is no way.

79
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,559
If you weren't clinging
to the love for your witch so vigorously,

80
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,473
it would have overtaken you by now.

81
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,234
But it's only a matter of time.

82
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,834
And after The Source
has fully assimilated you,

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,309
his power will protect you,

84
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,358
shield you from her premonitions.

85
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,114
That we can wait for.

86
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,398
Unfortunately with Kurzon,
we cannot.

87
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,153
Kurzon?

88
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,231
The underworld's in chaos.

89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,393
The Source is presumed dead,
and Kurzon will attempt to fill that void.

90
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,118
We must stop him,

91
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,840
or you'll never reclaim the throne.

92
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,199
- I don't want the throne.
- You will.

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,875
But at the moment, you're not
strong enough to vanquish Kurzon.

94
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,430
The Charmed Ones, however, are.

95
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,390
And what? You expect them
to just go after him?

96
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,549
No.

97
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,038
I expect to make Kurzon
think they will so he'll retaliate.

98
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,513
And I expect you to make sure
the witches are prepared

99
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,353
to vanquish him
before he can vanquish them.

100
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,318
I won't do your bidding, Seer.

101
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,074
You can't force me.

102
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,674
Perhaps not, but The Source can.

103
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,190
- Sorry.
- I didn't hear you come home.

104
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,396
I just got back.

105
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,116
- From where?
- I had to...

106
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,918
...get out of the house, you know?

107
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,798
No, actually I don't know.

108
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,918
Do we need to talk?

109
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,792
Phoebe, l--

110
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,276
- Damn it.
- What's the matter?

111
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,477
It's nothing.

112
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,471
It's just a migraine. I gotta go.

113
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,108
Cole, where are you--? Cole.

114
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,878
What's the matter?

115
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,873
I wish I knew.

116
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,556
It is a new era, my friends.

117
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,199
Our enemy is dead,

118
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,033
and our exile is nearing an end.

119
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,916
The tasks I have assigned
to you are vital to our cause.

120
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,036
Complete them today,

121
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,352
and tomorrow
we could all return home.

122
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,677
You will not live
to lead the underworld.

123
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,350
Have you seen my future, Seer?

124
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,270
A lone but powerful witch
will soon be on your trail.

125
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,671
You must kill her now
while she is still vulnerable.

126
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,957
Her loyalties are with
the last Source. Don't trust her.

127
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,316
And why would you
want to help me?

128
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,313
Because I've always aligned myself
with ultimate power.

129
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,677
And if you kill this witch,
nothing can stop you

130
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,831
from becoming the next Source.

131
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,558
You wanted to see me, Mr. Cowan?

132
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,158
Yes.

133
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,268
I'm gonna miss you, Paige.

134
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,160
I know I was late this morning.
I won't be anymore. I found a way

135
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,312
- to get here in the blink of an eye.
- I'll miss you as an assistant.

136
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,914
Because I'm promoting you
to social worker.

137
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,077
Thank you so much.
That's so amazing.

138
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,390
I am sticking to that
not-being-late thing, by the way.

139
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,154
You don't have to worry. You'll have
a flexible work schedule now.

140
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,679
That just caught me off guard.

141
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,196
I thought Scott was next in line for the
promotion. He has been here longer.

142
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,759
It was a tough call.

143
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,753
But after you helped Carolyn Selden,
I couldn't pass you over.

144
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,911
- Carolyn.
- You worked a miracle with her.

145
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,230
Not that I'm complaining,
but my promotion

146
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,472
isn't based solely
on her case, is it?

147
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,671
Well, if you're asking me
whether Carolyn's case

148
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,798
helped tip the scales in your favour,
then the answer is yes.

149
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,830
I already told Scott
if that's what you're worried about.

150
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,759
- This is personal gain.
- Excuse me?

151
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,117
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Cowan.

152
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,113
Congratulations, Paige.

153
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,233
Thanks, Scott.

154
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,311
- What are you doing up here?
- Nothing. Just thinking.

155
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,318
- About...?
- Cole.

156
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,118
He's a human now,
you're not gonna find

157
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,157
the answers you're looking for
in that book.

158
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,359
Well, I better find them somewhere
because I'm starting to get scared.

159
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,751
Well, of course you're scared.
Getting married is a huge step.

160
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,674
I know that.
It just feels like it's more than that.

161
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,070
- Have you tried talking to him?
- Yes, of course I have.

162
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,994
He just keeps avoiding me,
like he used to when he was...

163
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,357
Belthazor is dead.
Cole's just a man now.

164
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,557
A man that you love
more than anything else in the world.

165
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,153
I know.

166
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,869
So then why am I so damn confused
all of a sudden? It's killing me.

167
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,760
Maybe you're right.
Maybe you do need the Book.

168
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,793
What good is being a witch if you can't
use magic when you're hurting?

169
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,748
I cannot believe
that you're suggesting that.

170
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,708
- What about personal gain?
- Well, just word the spell properly.

171
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,030
Avoid it. You should know
how to do it by now.

172
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,714
Just be pure.

173
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,718
Ask your heart for the answer.

174
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,033
Just don't tell Paige.

175
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,430
I don't want her thinking
she can do it too.

176
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,875
- I hate it when you're right.
- Really? See, I usually like it.

177
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,917
Remember that spell
that I cast last week,

178
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,877
the one to help Carolyn
get her son back?

179
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,271
- Well, it had a little side effect.
- What kind of side effect?

180
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,998
The kind that gets me promoted.

181
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,790
I know, personal gain. I've already
beat myself up. You don't have to.

182
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,349
Demon!

183
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,588
Energy ball!

184
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,835
Enough of this. Bye-bye.

185
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,317
Two witches.

186
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,198
Damn her!

187
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,559
Okay.

188
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,829
Paige, you all right?

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,118
I'm fine, I'm fine. Just my ego's
a little bruised, that's all.

190
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,158
- That was odd.
- Yeah.

191
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,038
Leo.

192
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,158
- What happened?
- Same old.

193
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,748
Demon tried to kill us.

194
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,552
Yeah, a very powerful demon.

195
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,392
Strangely Source-like.

196
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,676
Can't we even get
a freaking day off around here?

197
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,478
Well, that's why
the Elders summoned me.

198
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,200
The Source's death has created
a power struggle in the underworld,

199
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,669
and killing you means
direct ascension to the throne.

200
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,311
So vanquishing The Source
meant nothing?

201
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,153
Well, it meant a lot, actually.
It set back evil, decades.

202
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,629
But that doesn't mean
it's made you any less of a target.

203
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,109
Yeah, but this demon didn't even
seem to know who we were,

204
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,918
which, by the way, I find insulting.

205
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,310
Well, he knows now,
which means you better figure out

206
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,438
who he is before he tries again.

207
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,318
Attic.

208
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,039
My love is strong
My spirit weak

209
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,270
It is an answer that I seek

210
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,000
A question burns within this fire

211
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,833
So I may hear my heart's desire

212
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,194
Phoebe, we have a--

213
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,392
Phoebe?

214
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,555
What? What's going on?

215
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,588
How did I get here?

216
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,955
That's an excellent question.

217
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,793
Oh, my God, what have you done?

218
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,718
Me? What--?

219
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,313
Who are you?

220
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,959
What's the matter?

221
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,031
Don't you recognize me?

222
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,595
I'm you. Phoebe.

223
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,108
Phoebe?

224
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,635
That's my name too.

225
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,957
Oh, boy.

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,399
Who...?

227
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,869
Who are you people?

228
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,917
And how did I get up here?

229
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,277
You don't have to be scared of us,
honey. Everything is gonna be okay.

230
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,828
Any ideas?

231
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,993
- It's your spell. Don't look at me.
- Yeah, but it was your idea.

232
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,559
Excuse me?

233
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,632
You might want to stop her
before she climbs out the window.

234
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,590
Sweetie, hi. Come here.

235
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,909
Look.

236
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,513
Hi.

237
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,550
I can explain.

238
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,280
You are dreaming.

239
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,589
Dreaming?

240
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,751
Yes, dreaming.

241
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,797
And...

242
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,236
...you're gonna wake up in your room,
and everything is gonna be fine.

243
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,431
I'm 1 0, I'm not stupid.

244
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,596
Grams!

245
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,354
Wow, I do not miss that.

246
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,272
What's going on?

247
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,472
Cole?

248
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,752
Who are you?

249
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,429
Maybe this will refresh
your memory.

250
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,316
You bastard.

251
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,433
What--?

252
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,751
What was that all about?

253
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,955
Ask him.

254
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,190
Maybe we should go look
for little Phoebe

255
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,351
before she escapes into 2002.

256
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,274
Yes, we will do that,
and you talk to your future self.

257
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,759
And fix this, fast.

258
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,797
- Future self?
- What about the demon?

259
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,110
- What demon?
- We were attacked downstairs.

260
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,748
- Paige.
- I'm there.

261
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,789
How did she get here?

262
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,636
I cast a spell
to hear my heart's desire.

263
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,509
And I guess my past self

264
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,989
and my future self showed up
to help me listen.

265
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,953
And what desire
did you wanna hear?

266
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,395
Well, that's between me and...

267
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,439
...me.

268
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,033
Come on.

269
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,392
Worried?

270
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,069
Dude, maybe you can help.

271
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,869
We're looking for a demon who can
reconstitute himself like The Source.

272
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,470
Anyone come to mind?

273
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,278
Cole?

274
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,515
Can't anybody help me?

275
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,597
Welcome back.

276
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,078
- I didn't wanna come back.
- And yet you have.

277
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,800
The Source
is getting stronger in you.

278
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,678
I've got him under control.

279
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,796
Or is it the other way around?

280
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,520
There must be something
he wants you to tell me.

281
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,154
Maybe it's that
your plan is gonna fail.

282
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,197
Because he knows Phoebe's
conjured up her own way

283
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,588
of seeing into the future:

284
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,274
Her future self,

285
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,829
somebody who'll be all too willing
to tell her what I can't.

286
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,358
What's the matter?
You didn't see that coming?

287
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,872
I don't need to see the future
to know about good witches.

288
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,114
They're overly cautious by nature.

289
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,635
Her future self
will be too afraid to say anything

290
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,951
that might make things worse
for her and her sisters.

291
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,350
She'll preserve the future.

292
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,478
How do you know?

293
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,074
I've been a seer longer
than you've been The Source.

294
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,231
You'll learn to trust my instincts.

295
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,075
- I'm not The Source.
- But you will be very soon.

296
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,437
- It's your destiny.
- My destiny is to be with Phoebe.

297
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,160
I won't change that.
Neither will this thing inside of me.

298
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,471
Your love won't be enough
to save you in the end.

299
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,834
You'll see.

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,275
Kurzon will be attacking
them again very soon,

301
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,431
this time more prepared.

302
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,910
You'd better hurry back
if you want them to survive.

303
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,998
The good old days.

304
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,196
Of course, nobody's going to
take you seriously

305
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,272
until you stop dressing like a tramp.

306
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,477
A tramp? That is so in right now.

307
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,631
Oh, you'll learn.

308
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,279
Learn what?

309
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,277
Look at us.

310
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,512
We had such promise.

311
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,999
Okay. What do you mean?
Does something bad happen to me?

312
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,390
I mean, us?

313
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,558
Okay, you know what?
I don't have time for games.

314
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,030
- Okay, there is a demon--
- Don't talk to me about demons!

315
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,279
I know plenty about demons.

316
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,428
Okay. Then please tell me
what you know about Cole.

317
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,597
Look, I'm about to marry him.
And I have this...

318
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,036
...really bad feeling.
Do you remember feeling like that?

319
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,555
I remember.

320
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,875
But I won't change the past.

321
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,951
But this isn't the past,
this is the present.

322
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,712
But it's my past.

323
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,472
And I intend to keep it that way.

324
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,074
You know, I already saw you
slap him across the face.

325
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,118
That's a pretty big coming attraction
for my life, don't you think?

326
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,430
That was between him and me.

327
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,239
I know, but you are me.

328
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,756
Oh, okay...

329
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,875
Can you give me a little hint,
you know?

330
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,712
Do you guys get divorced?

331
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,678
Does he...?
Does he cheat on you?

332
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,430
Did you ever get married?

333
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,433
What makes you think
we aren't married in the future?

334
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,350
Because there's no wedding ring
on your finger.

335
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,352
Please tell me what happened.

336
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,159
The spell wouldn't have worked
if you weren't allowed to tell me.

337
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,671
I didn't need a spell
to decide what to do.

338
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,919
You must make this decision
without using magic.

339
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,793
Just like I did.

340
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,269
Yeah, and that worked
real well for us, I see.

341
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,913
Just ask Leo to send me back

342
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,071
as soon as possible.

343
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,116
Why don't you ask him yourself?

344
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,319
Because I'm staying here
out of the path of history.

345
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,311
And don't argue with me.

346
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,550
We both know
that when our mind's made up,

347
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,790
there's no changing it.

348
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,195
Yeah.

349
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,557
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

350
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,871
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

351
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,238
- Row, row, row your boat
- Honey,

352
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,311
- Gently down the stream
- you've got to listen to me.

353
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,789
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
- We're just trying to help.

354
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,758
Life is but a dream
Row, row, row your boat

355
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,878
- She's your sister.
- Yeah, don't remind me.

356
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,991
Having a little trouble
with young Phoebe?

357
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,072
Yeah, enough to make me
wanna reconsider having children.

358
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,511
Maybe we should
just lie to her again.

359
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,076
No, I think I have an idea.

360
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,759
Stay away from me,

361
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,275
or I'll sick Prue on you.

362
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh, yeah, don't go there.

363
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,996
Phoebe, listen to me.

364
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,593
I know that this is scary,

365
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,800
but I promise you,
you are safe here in this house.

366
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,196
In your house.

367
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,430
Our house.

368
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,475
You know how Grams
talks about magic all the time?

369
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,552
And she likes to say that

370
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,519
anything is possible
just as long as you believe in it?

371
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,992
Yes.

372
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,752
Well, that's what happened.

373
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,150
Magic brought you here

374
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,311
to your future.

375
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,272
See that girl right there?

376
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,789
That is Piper, all grown up.

377
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,313
Yeah.

378
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,191
And that is her husband, Leo.

379
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,554
And I am...

380
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,513
- Me?
- Yeah.

381
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,188
I wanna show you something.

382
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,634
Do you remember this?

383
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,268
Daddy sent it to you and me
for Christmas.

384
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,192
- My album.
- Yeah.

385
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,150
Except it starts with pictures of you,

386
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,198
and it goes all the way,
if you look back here,

387
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,954
to pictures of me.

388
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,676
Why don't you go
take that over there and look at it.

389
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,428
- Nicely done.
- Yeah, at least I could get through

390
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,272
to one of my selves.

391
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,351
Having problems with geriatric you?

392
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,474
I know that woman up there
is me when I'm old,

393
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,756
but there is nothing
familiar about her.

394
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,071
I don't know how I got so...

395
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,153
-...mean.
- She doesn't have any idea

396
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,548
how to reverse the spell?

397
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,597
No, she doesn't even
remember casting it.

398
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,990
- How does that happen?
- Well, the future changes

399
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,357
with every choice we make. Some
choices change it more than others.

400
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,110
All that matters is that she is here
for a reason. They both are.

401
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,870
Yeah, but why? What's the reason?

402
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,315
To help you listen to your heart.

403
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,278
And until you do,
they won't return to their times.

404
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,352
Well, then I don't think they're
ever going to, because old Phoebe

405
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,590
is not letting go
of this grudge about Cole.

406
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,478
Talking about me?

407
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,998
Oh, my gosh.

408
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,399
Who are you?

409
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,918
Sorry?

410
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,395
That guy is Cole.

411
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,516
He's our fiancé.

412
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,355
Wait, you mean he's our prince?

413
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,557
The one who sweeps us
off our feet?

414
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,869
Prince?

415
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,192
She's talking about Cinderella.

416
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,517
That was my favourite story
when I was growing up.

417
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,194
I can't believe
that I forgot about that.

418
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,033
Well, maybe that's why she's here,
to help you remember.

419
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,909
Don't you think you should
help Paige find out who...

420
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,833
...the visitor who dropped in was,
before he drops in again?

421
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,479
Good idea.

422
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,676
Okay, we'll be right back.

423
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,398
Keep her company, will you?

424
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,312
Yeah, sure.

425
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,073
Hi.

426
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,311
Looking for me?

427
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,951
You sent me up against
the Charmed Ones.

428
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,271
- What do you take me for?
- I foresaw only one witch.

429
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,237
How was I to know who she was?

430
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,119
- That mistake will cost you your life.
- Don't be foolish.

431
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,838
Every Source has needed me.

432
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,389
My visions have brought them
all great power.

433
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,154
- I can do the same for you.
- Speak quickly.

434
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,517
I can help you destroy
the power of three

435
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,999
with one simple move.

436
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,470
I can make you the next Source.

437
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,633
It's another trick.

438
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,156
If it were, why would I have
risked my life to come here?

439
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,080
One of the witches
has cast a spell,

440
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,231
brought her past self
into the present.

441
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,518
She's a powerless child
vulnerable to attack.

442
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,716
- So?
- So kill the child

443
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,472
and the present witch is no more.

444
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,551
The entire line is extinguished,

445
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,109
and with it, the Charmed Ones.

446
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,594
- That's him.
- "Kurzon is an enemy of The Source

447
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,194
who was banished from the
underworld for inciting a failed coup."

448
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,430
I don't understand.
Why didn't they just kill him?

449
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,511
Probably because
it's not that easy to do.

450
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,238
You guys are gonna need
the power of three.

451
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,119
But if he's an enemy of The Source,
doesn't that make him our ally?

452
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,636
No, he's still evil.
He's just a different kind of evil.

453
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,838
Phoebe.

454
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,315
No!

455
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,754
- Leave the girl alone.
- Belthazor?

456
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,154
I thought you were dead.

457
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,713
He is.

458
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,077
It'll take more than that to stop me.

459
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,393
Very well.

460
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,751
The Source.

461
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,353
Cole?

462
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,080
She-- She's all right.
She just fainted.

463
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,956
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

464
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,553
I think so.

465
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,272
You saved me.

466
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,355
It was so scary.

467
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,670
He just came out of nowhere.

468
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,308
And then everything went black.

469
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,799
Here you go, sweetheart.

470
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,359
Thanks.

471
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,314
Who are you?

472
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,429
- Me? I'm Paige, I'm your--
- Cousin.

473
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,795
She's our cousin from Mom's side.

474
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,552
But we think of her as a sister.

475
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,154
We'll explain it to you
when you're older.

476
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,834
What about that scary man?
Where'd he go?

477
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,389
You don't have to worry
about him anymore, sweetie.

478
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,879
- Doesn't she?
- Leo.

479
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,349
I'm sorry, but we can't risk
her running into Kurzon again.

480
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,669
She's Phoebe's past.

481
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,116
And Cole saving her...

482
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,508
...means that he saved me too.

483
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,877
Hello? He loves us, remember?

484
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,036
I think I should take little Phoebe
someplace. Someplace safe.

485
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,919
- Do you think Kurzon will come back?
- I do.

486
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,913
I mean, you know, why wouldn't he?
He didn't fulfil his objectives.

487
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,719
He's right.

488
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,635
Okay, you're gonna have to go
with Leo for a little while,

489
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,792
- but don't worry, he'll keep you safe.
- I don't wanna leave.

490
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,951
I know, but it's just
for a little while, okay?

491
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,031
It's for our own good. Come on.

492
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,430
Come on, take my hand.

493
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,318
Now, hold on tight.

494
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,913
Are we going on a plane?

495
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,311
No, but you might see some clouds.

496
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,352
Where'd this come from?

497
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,795
That's Kurzon's.
He tried to stab me with it,

498
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,552
- but I got it away from him.
- Really?

499
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,631
You got it away from a demon.
That's impressive.

500
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,552
Why didn't he use
his powers on you?

501
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,558
Who knows?
The point is that I stabbed him,

502
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,950
which means we have
enough of his blood to scry for him.

503
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,318
Yeah, I'll go get a map and a crystal.

504
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,598
You think Kurzon
is targeting little Phoebe?

505
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,115
- Why would he?
- Well, the same reason Leo said.

506
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,077
Because she's you.

507
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,435
And if he kills her,
then there's no Charmed Ones.

508
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,477
But how could he know
that I conjured her?

509
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,959
He's psychic?

510
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,792
Or maybe the Seer tipped him off.

511
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,230
The Seer?
You think she's involved?

512
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,712
Wouldn't surprise me.

513
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,437
Well, that's just great.

514
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,310
Okay, well, we're gonna need
a vanquishing spell.

515
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,517
Cole, go with Piper, help her. Tell her
everything you know about Kurzon.

516
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,240
- Where are you going?
- Well, I'm gonna try to go

517
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,152
knock some sense into myself.

518
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,358
I need to send you back fast.

519
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,556
- Fine with me.
- Not for your sake,

520
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,711
for all of ours,
especially little Phoebe's.

521
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,958
And the only way for me to do that

522
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,033
is for you to answer the question
that I asked when I cast the spell.

523
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,350
Should I or should I not marry Cole?

524
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,555
Listen to me. A demon
just attacked downstairs

525
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,871
and nearly killed little Phoebe,
which means he nearly killed us too.

526
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,678
Oh, I know what that means.

527
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,398
Then why won't you
answer the question?

528
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,438
Because if I were to say something
that could change the future,

529
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,595
other lives could be at stake too,
not just ours.

530
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,638
Yeah, well maybe you're
supposed to change the future.

531
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,392
Maybe that's why
you were sent here.

532
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,838
If there is one belief
that you and I still have in common,

533
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,070
it's that magic happens for a reason.

534
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,318
Isn't it possible that you're
being given a second chance?

535
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,474
To do what?

536
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,837
To keep me from turning
into a bitter old lady like you.

537
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,238
Please.

538
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,591
I have lost so much already.

539
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,952
Don't make me lose myself too.

540
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,032
Sorry.

541
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,152
I can't.

542
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,711
Then I guess
you've doomed us both.

543
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,392
- Are you done with that spell yet?
- Almost.

544
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,155
Would you please stop pacing?
It's very distracting.

545
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,719
No.

546
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,919
- How'd it go?
- I still can't get through to her.

547
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,593
She didn't say anything
about the future?

548
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,752
Nope. She's worried about
the consequences of changing it.

549
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,231
But she is your future.
You can't change that.

550
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,914
Yes, we can. Our last trip
to the future proved that.

551
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,230
Phoebe's not burning
at the stake any time soon.

552
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,994
Maybe you'll let me cast Phoebe's spell
and get my own sneak preview.

553
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,799
Find out what happens
if I take that promotion or not.

554
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,313
- You got promoted?
- Yeah.

555
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,792
By way of a spell, and her friend Scott
got stuck with the consequence.

556
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,029
Personal gain.

557
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,555
If you don't vanquish Kurzon soon,
he'll become the next Source.

558
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,631
Then suddenly personal gain
won't seem so important,

559
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,791
because you'll all be dead.

560
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,554
Got him.

561
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,392
- He's across town.
- Okay, bring the crystal.

562
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,152
We'll track him on the way.

563
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,917
I would stay out
of my bedroom if I were you.

564
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,798
Unless you want to
get slapped again.

565
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,392
Be careful.

566
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,874
- Aren't you coming?
- What can I do?

567
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,598
I'm not a demon anymore.

568
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,559
Look at me.

569
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,912
Look at me!

570
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,868
You sent Kurzon to kill Phoebe.

571
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,434
- You betrayed me.
- For your own good.

572
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,433
Your love for her
was the only thing holding you back.

573
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,036
The only thing keeping you from
accepting the full power of The Source.

574
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,232
Don't you understand?

575
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,631
With her gone, we wouldn't need
the Charmed Ones to kill Kurzon.

576
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,518
You'd be able to kill him yourself.

577
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,597
Phoebe can't die.

578
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,433
Otherwise his soul dies too.

579
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,999
His love for her is too strong.

580
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,628
And I'll need that strength
if I'm to recapture what I lost.

581
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,358
"His love"?

582
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,715
The Source is finally
showing through, I see.

583
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,716
You'll have to kill her eventually.
Our plan depends on it.

584
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,110
That was your plan, not mine.

585
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,157
I want Phoebe alive,

586
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,510
and the next time you betray me...

587
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,792
...I won't miss.

588
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,631
Hello, Cole.

589
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,229
I've been expecting you.

590
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,795
What's the matter, Cole?

591
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,354
Afraid I'll tell the girls your secret?

592
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,872
- What do you want from me?
- My life back, for starters.

593
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,634
- You look alive to me.
- On the outside, maybe.

594
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,714
I can fix that.

595
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,268
You can't kill me, Cole.

596
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,634
You never could.

597
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,551
Even after The Source took you over,
a piece of you always loved me.

598
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,631
That's not always enough.

599
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,949
Yes, it can be.

600
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,914
I never married you, Cole.
I called it off,

601
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,834
and once I found out
that you were The Source,

602
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,673
my sisters and l
had to vanquish you.

603
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,114
Why are you telling me this?

604
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,159
Because I've spent most of my life

605
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,357
wondering what would have happened
if we had married.

606
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,950
It could have been different
for both of us.

607
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,953
- Well, it's too late for that now.
- Maybe not.

608
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,588
That's why I've come to you first.

609
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,228
Before I risk everything...

610
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,994
... I have to know
if there is a chance to save you.

611
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,551
I'm not sure there is.

612
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,518
- So you won't even try?
- I want to.

613
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,876
But he won't let me. He's too strong.

614
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,508
Then I'll tell Phoebe the truth.

615
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,911
I'll convince her to save you.
To save us.

616
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,919
But if you change the future,
Phoebe might die sooner.

617
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,278
- So might her sisters.
- Magic happens for a reason, Cole.

618
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,069
I don't have faith in much anymore,
but I do believe that.

619
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,915
I have to trust
that I'm meant to change this.

620
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,672
You think you're meant to save me?

621
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,509
Phoebe reminded me
that I once had hope.

622
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,550
That we had love.

623
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,469
That's why I'm doing this.

624
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,234
To keep her from living
a life of regret like I lived.

625
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,588
I'm not intruding, am l?

626
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,033
I can't believe we lost him.

627
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,959
- Oh, God, just give me a second.
- Hurry, he might still be in the area.

628
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,319
- He's at the house.
- We'll never make it back in time.

629
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,280
- Don't look at me.
- Why? You did it this morning.

630
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,435
Barely. I went downstairs alone.
Not across town with two passengers.

631
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,876
Okay, well, Paige, he'll kill Cole.
We have to try.

632
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,117
Hey!

633
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,310
I'm okay. I'm okay.

634
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,673
No!

635
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,476
Spell, spell, spell.
Quick, quick, quick.

636
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,118
Hell threw you from its inner core
But earth won't hold you anymore

637
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,556
Since heaven cannot be your place
Your flesh and blood we now erase

638
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,192
Oh, no.

639
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,472
Leo!

640
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,551
Just hold on. Hold on.

641
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,509
She saved me.

642
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,151
There's your answer.

643
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,877
Leo, please. Please, please, please.

644
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,514
She's gone.

645
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,354
What happened?

646
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,553
The spell played out.

647
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,312
You heard what you needed to hear.

648
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,913
Speaking of orbing up there,
when do I get to do that?

649
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,832
Well, you shouldn't be
in such a rush.

650
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,638
You should be proud
of what you accomplished.

651
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,916
- You saved the day.
- I didn't save everyone.

652
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,389
No, but that's the great thing
about the future.

653
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,152
There's always time to change it.

654
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,753
So Phoebe won't die that way?

655
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,515
No, if I know Phoebe, and I do,

656
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,875
she's not gonna let her future
turn out that way.

657
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,473
Good, and what about little Phoebe?

658
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,200
She went back to her time
with all this knowledge of the future.

659
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,713
Won't that cause complications?

660
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,838
I doubt it. The minute she starts
talking about magic,

661
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,072
Grams will do some hocus-pocus
to erase all that knowledge.

662
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,117
- That's nice.
- That's Grams.

663
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,317
Well, I am done. I am off to bed.

664
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,232
I have a future of my own
to change tomorrow.

665
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,235
Have you decided
what to do about your promotion?

666
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,072
Yeah, I'm gonna turn it down.

667
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,869
- What changed your mind?
- The three Phoebes.

668
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,952
She used magic to change her future,
but I used magic to change Scott's.

669
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,156
And that's not so fair.

670
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,198
I did the rhyme, I will do the time.

671
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,873
Good night.

672
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,198
So, what do you think
Phoebe's gonna do about Cole?

673
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,551
I don't know, but I don't think we'll
have to wait 40 years to find out.

674
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,873
Hi.

675
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,789
I just...

676
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,198
Had to get out of the house?

677
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,789
Yeah. Something like that.

678
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,596
Well, at least you came back.

679
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,151
You didn't think I would?

680
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,958
I don't know.

681
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,752
I've been...

682
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,837
...having a lot of
crazy thoughts lately about us,

683
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,836
and I guess I just thought that maybe
you were feeling the same way too.

684
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,229
I never told you
why I cast that spell, did l?

685
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,670
I thought it was to hear
your heart's desire.

686
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,876
It was to find out
if I should marry you or not.

687
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,148
- And?
- Do you still want to?

688
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,515
Well, it's still a part of my plans,
that's for sure.

689
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,674
Mine too.

690
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,956
It's not that I don't
still have cold feet.

691
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,510
It's just hearing my past self
remind me of Cinderella...

692
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,956
...and seeing my future self
willing to--

693
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,394
Willing to die for you...

694
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,552
And me willing to die for you.

695
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,791
I'm gonna ask you a question, and all
I want is a straight answer, okay?

696
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,473
Can you do that?

697
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,392
Okay.

698
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,072
Is there something
that you're not telling me...

699
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,829
...about you?

700
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,718
Something that I don't know?

701
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,592
No.
