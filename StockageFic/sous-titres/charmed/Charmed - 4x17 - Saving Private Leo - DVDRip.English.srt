1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,359
-Wheat-germ pancakes?
- Bagel.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,709
Bagel?

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,393
Has anyone seen
my deposition papers?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,518
I thought they were in this folder
with the cream-cheese stain.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,954
Try the one with the jelly stain.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,239
I got it, thanks.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,550
Phoebe, don't forget, my law firm's
having a party tonight.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,869
I want to show off my new bride.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,951
If I could finish my work here,
that would be great.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,350
- Cole, pancakes?
- Trying to watch my cholesterol.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,190
How about you, Phoebe?
I know you want some of these.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,874
No, you know what I want?
I want quiet.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,678
My advice column is due today.

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,955
- No pancakes?
- No pancakes.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,793
But shush with some syrup on it
would be good.

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,474
Leo, just in time for some
delicious wheat-germ pancakes.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,918
No, I don't have time.
I just came to get my toolbox.

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,550
All right, you know what? I'm not
cooking for you people anymore.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,313
From now on,
you're all on your own.

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,516
My bagel!

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,556
Could everybody please be quiet?

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,909
Oh, no. My battery died.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,159
Smoke alarm.

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,589
You know, you'd get all the quiet
you want if we had our own place.

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,029
Gotta go. I'm interviewing
personal assistants today.

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,994
Bye.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,272
And I am off to quieter pastures.

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,633
Honey, you look tired.

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,074
I've been working double shifts.

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,879
The Elders have been piling it on me
since you guys took out The Source.

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,389
What's with the toolbox?

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,678
Leo poses as a heavenly handyman.
It's actually how we met.

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,590
The Elders want me to check out
a potential whitelighter.

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,990
She's a schoolteacher
about to fall off the path.

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,275
She needs some inspiration.

36
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,559
Speaking of inspiration,

37
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,518
it's the 60th anniversary
of the Battle of Guadalcanal,

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,878
and they're having a reunion
for local veterans, so I RSVP'd for you.

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,473
Piper, I can't be seen there.

40
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,157
Well, no, it's okay. I told them
that you were your grandson.

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,511
Well, that's not it. I don't want to go.

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,749
You would have known that

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,876
if you would have asked me
or talked to me about it

44
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,632
instead of just making
decisions for me.

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,474
I'll bet she scares easily.

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,910
- Can I scare her?
- No.

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,072
Come on, Rick.
Just let me moan once.

48
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,992
One of those bone-chilling moans.

49
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,516
You know, could be the wind,
could be a ghost.

50
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,318
Just watch her.

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,877
We've been watching this place
for about 60 years, man.

52
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,031
We're never gonna find
what we're looking for.

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,474
I swear, sometimes I don't know
why I stay here with you.

54
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,232
Because I stayed with you, bro.

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
I promised to protect you
when we enlisted, and I failed.

56
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,235
I'm not gonna fail again.

57
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,834
Well, this is something.

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,673
Leo Wyatt's grandson is gonna attend
the reunion with his wife.

59
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,711
I told you one of them
would show up eventually.

60
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,029
Well, let's go.

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,236
What's the address?

62
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,197
I can't see it. Lean back, granny.

63
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,239
Can I scare her now?

64
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,071
1 329 Prescott Street.

65
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,955
- Let's go.
- Not yet.

66
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,228
You've had your fun.
Now, let me show you how it's done.

67
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,710
Rick, Rick, wait!

68
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,270
We're after Wyatt.
We're not after her.

69
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,192
Phoebe, have you seen
my keys anywhere?

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,873
No.

71
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,074
Leo is not answering my call.

72
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,229
Is it an emergency?

73
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,636
No, but I just want to talk to him,

74
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,392
so I can figure out
why he's so mad at me.

75
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,155
I mean, I can't believe it's just because
he doesn't wanna go to the reunion.

76
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,630
Maybe it's because, I don't know,
he died at Guadalcanal?

77
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,314
Yeah, but he died a hero.

78
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,993
Although, come to think of it,

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,991
he doesn't really
talk about it very much.

80
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,318
Phoebe.

81
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,279
Phoebe, come on.
What do you think?

82
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,513
I think, Piper, that I came in here
to get away from all the chatter, okay?

83
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,399
I have a deadline.
I am Working Phoebe.

84
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,078
Found them.

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,799
- Who are you?
- What?

86
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,598
- Wait, you can see me?
- More like through you.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,069
Paige, stand back.

88
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,592
Phoebe!

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,915
What?

90
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,909
We just saw a ghost, that's what.

91
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,913
Yeah, and my first one too.
I mean, that I wasn't related to.

92
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,431
It was kind of cool.

93
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,955
No, not cool.
Unless he was friendly,

94
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,509
which, considering who we are
and what we do, probably not.

95
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,478
This is great.
This is exactly what I need today.

96
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,471
- What do we do?
- You go back to your deadline.

97
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,108
I'll go get the Book
and brush up on my ghost-busting.

98
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,077
No, no, no. I'll go do it.

99
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,559
You just said you were
late for work.

100
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,917
Yeah, but I mean, he's a ghost.
Who knows where he came from?

101
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,274
What era.

102
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,553
He's like a piece
of man-hunk history.

103
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,791
Knock yourself out.

104
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,356
Recon report?

105
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,997
Well, Wyatt's grandson
is definitely living the good life.

106
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,674
- Not for long.
- Not so fast, Rick.

107
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,478
His wife was there...

108
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,710
...and she could see me.

109
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,512
A witch?

110
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,994
Plus two sisters,

111
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,116
for a grand total of three witches.

112
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,839
Listen, Rick, I was thinking maybe
we should just forget about this.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,309
Forget about what?
What Wyatt did to us?

114
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,551
The fact that he trapped us
in this hell on earth?

115
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,517
You want to forget him?

116
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,038
No way.

117
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,431
The grandson's gonna pay
for what the grandfather did to us.

118
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,359
Someday, you're gonna have
to show me how you did that.

119
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,358
No time like the present.

120
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,556
Some say hatred
can harden the heart.

121
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,951
I've found that it can also
harden the body.

122
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,594
Now it's your turn, Nathan.

123
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,672
Focus on everything
that Wyatt stole from us.

124
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,319
Our life,

125
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,353
our family, our future.

126
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,870
Feel the hatred
and bring it to the surface.

127
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,198
I did it.

128
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,549
Now, take the bayonet.
You'll need the practice.

129
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,153
Because with witches around,

130
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,834
we're gonna have to be
at the top of our game.

131
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,275
What kind of legal documents
did you draft as a paralegal?

132
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,352
Discovery, administrative,

133
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,990
pretrial, trial, motions, pleadings.

134
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,149
- What's your dictation speed?
- 1 20 words a minute.

135
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,639
How fast can you shimmer
across town?

136
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,949
Thirty miles in two seconds.

137
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,031
- Demonic powers?
- Fireballs, shape-shifting.

138
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,191
- Your last kill?
- Two years ago.

139
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,958
Two years ago? Why so long?

140
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,558
Killing's messy.

141
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,678
My services are usually
a little more discreet.

142
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,030
I'll give you a trial run, Julie.

143
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,950
I'm trying to separate my wife from
the harmful influence of her sisters.

144
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,428
The Charmed Ones.

145
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,149
It's very important for me
to keep Phoebe away from them.

146
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,072
She might be pregnant with my son.

147
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,712
You almost say that
like you love her.

148
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,597
A part of me does, unfortunately.

149
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,429
Anyway, my plan is
more insidious than overt.

150
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,989
I set off the fire alarm this morning.

151
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,559
I'll cut the power this afternoon.

152
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,598
Whatever it takes to make Phoebe's
home feel cramped and unlivable.

153
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,637
And seduce her
with the promise of a better life.

154
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,239
Exactly.

155
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,631
But it takes caution.

156
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,553
Focus.

157
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,757
I need someone to cover me
at work, watch my back.

158
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,998
Well, I'll watch
whatever part you want.

159
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,437
He couldn't believe I suspended him,
but what could I do?

160
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,068
He brought a knife
into my classroom.

161
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,834
Now he's threatening me,
says he knows where I live.

162
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,628
See, that's why I'm a plumber.

163
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,109
Pipes are a lot easier
to deal with than with kids today.

164
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,918
I always wanted to be a teacher,

165
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,548
but not at the cost of my life.

166
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,073
That's why I've decided to quit.

167
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,109
That's too bad.

168
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,271
All the good you're gonna do
in this world, gone forever?

169
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,194
- Going to do?
- I mean, can do.

170
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,759
I don't want to quit.

171
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,478
I just don't have the courage to stay.

172
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,078
Well, the only courage that matters

173
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,310
is the kind that gets you
from one moment to the next.

174
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,677
Maybe you should just
focus on that.

175
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,910
You bill as a plumber or a therapist?

176
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,478
Whatever it takes to stop the leak.

177
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,589
Which, by the way, is healed.
I mean, sealed.

178
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,114
- What do I owe you?
- This one's on the house.

179
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,670
Did you know there's a potion
in here to vanquish ghosts?

180
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,197
Yeah, you pour it over their bones.
We used it a couple years ago.

181
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,791
That's weird. Look at this.

182
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,598
- What is it?
- Leo's Medal of Honor.

183
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,639
And it's just stuffed in his old Army file
like it doesn't mean anything.

184
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,631
Maybe he's just being humble.

185
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,999
No, it's not that. It's something else.
I know it. I know him.

186
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,196
There's also a spell
to vanquish ghosts.

187
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,998
It should be in
the Book somewhere.

188
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,229
Yeah, it's in here all right.

189
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,789
The only problem is that you have
to be a ghost yourself to say it,

190
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,951
which is fairly lame.

191
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,471
- Not again.
- Oh, no, no, no!

192
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,790
I didn't save any of it.

193
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,399
I just lost half my document.

194
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,869
All right, relax.
I'll check the circuit breaker.

195
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,632
I really need to get my own place.

196
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,951
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

197
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,751
- Cole Turner's office.
- Hi, who's this?

198
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,953
I'm Julie, Mr. Turner's new assistant.
Who is this?

199
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,434
I'm Phoebe, Mr. Turner's new wife.

200
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,629
Oh, really?

201
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,553
- I didn't realise he was married.
- Yeah, he is.

202
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,154
And I really need to talk to him.
It's very important.

203
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,834
I'm afraid he's not in his office.
Can I take a message?

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,831
No, I'm sorry, you can't.

205
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,672
Look, he said he'd be
in the office all day,

206
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,355
and I really, really need
to talk to him right away.

207
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,395
Hi, baby. What, did you hire
your new assistant on the spot?

208
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,471
Well, you could have at least told her
that you were married.

209
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,793
Look, I hate to bother you,

210
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,914
but I was kind of hoping
that you could help me.

211
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,634
Power's on.

212
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,950
I just can't get any work done here,

213
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,509
and I am so pushing my deadline.

214
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,876
- What can I do?
- I can't go to the offiice, right,

215
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,075
because they're painting it.

216
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,595
- So I was wondering--
- If I knew a place you could work?

217
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,079
As a matter of fact, I do.

218
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,110
Why don't you meet me
at the Towers in 20 minutes.

219
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,316
The Towers where
the party is tonight?

220
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,710
Yeah, but that's tonight.
Nobody's using them today.

221
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,394
Okay, sounds good.

222
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,836
- You're hired.
- I'll see you there. Thanks.

223
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,429
Call me on my cell
if you need anything, okay?

224
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,919
I gotta go.

225
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,510
Nice job with the lights, sis.

226
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,319
Can't figure out
what keeps tripping the breaker.

227
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,232
Maybe it's a ghost.

228
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,998
Found this in the file.

229
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,071
The guy to the left of Leo,
does he look familiar?

230
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,671
That's our ghost, killed in action.

231
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,873
His brother's on the right.

232
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,792
They died the same day as Leo.

233
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,190
Could be a reunion
he wants to avoid having?

234
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,312
Leo.

235
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,998
Leo, I mean it this time!

236
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,233
What? What is it?

237
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,154
- Nathan.
- Yeah, we just met him.

238
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,309
Looked pretty good.

239
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,598
A little transparent, but otherwise
he looked pretty good for a dead guy.

240
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,878
Talk to me.

241
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,073
There's nothing to talk about.

242
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,998
Hey, Wyatt.

243
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,353
You're right, little brother.

244
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,636
He is the spitting image
of his grandfather.

245
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,589
Rick, don't!

246
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,075
Rick? How did he know your name?

247
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,954
Leo.

248
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,114
- I can explain.
- Rick, let's go.

249
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,911
Rick, come on, let's go. Come on!

250
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,559
I can't believe they've been
holding on this long just to hurt me.

251
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,076
What I don't understand is why
they're not transparent anymore.

252
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,276
I mean, other than
the walking through walls thing,

253
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,273
- they kind of seem normal to me.
- They've been practicing.

254
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,317
Corporealizing, so they can
move things.

255
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,152
Yeah, like butcher knives.

256
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,038
Well, they're holding on
to their pain.

257
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,633
That's what keeps them
from moving on.

258
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,472
Their pain?

259
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,232
Leo, they just tried to kill you.

260
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,472
Yeah, lucky they're not darklighters.

261
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,119
Otherwise, you would have
been killed.

262
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,679
Again.

263
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,308
You don't understand.
We were friends.

264
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,358
We grew up together
down in Burlingame.

265
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,272
I went to school with Nathan.

266
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,273
When the war came, we made a deal
with our recruitment officer

267
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,797
that we would enlist as long as
they kept us in the same unit.

268
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,475
- You were close.
- Yeah.

269
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,270
So, what do they think you did?

270
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,990
Now, we'd just got
transferred onto the island.

271
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,793
We got ambushed
outside the airfield.

272
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,358
Heavy artillery.

273
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,111
Mortar fire.

274
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,591
We couldn't keep up
with the injuries.

275
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,713
The bodies.

276
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,996
Then I heard Rick's voice.

277
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,629
Leo!

278
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,753
Leo!

279
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,598
Leo, get over here quick!

280
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,352
Get over here! Nathan's been hit!

281
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,799
Stabilise his leg!
Get him on the jeep! Go, go, go!

282
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,555
It's bad, isn't it?

283
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,914
- What hit him?
- Mortar frag.

284
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,036
They hit us with heavy artillery
out of nowhere.

285
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,191
The whole battalion's down.

286
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,512
- We gotta get him inside!
- Yeah. Up. Let's get him up.

287
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,755
Get in the tent!

288
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,715
Get the sulfa powder.

289
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,440
If we don't stop the bleeding,
he's going into shock.

290
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,474
- How many soldiers down out there?
- I don't know. They hit us so hard.

291
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,073
Maybe 1 5 or 20, I don't know.

292
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,468
I need a morphine kit.

293
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,632
You gotta help him. He needs you.
We both need you.

294
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,679
- Is there a medic out in the field?
- I don't know. I don't know.

295
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,989
Look, try and stabilise him.

296
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,832
- What are you doing?
- Going to help those men.

297
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,638
- What?
- Wilkinson will take care of him.

298
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,995
No, you're gonna take care of him!
That's Nathan on that bed!

299
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,116
There's men dying
and nobody to take care of them!

300
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,236
You're gonna choose them over us?

301
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,513
I'm sorry.

302
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,233
Wyatt! We're your friends!

303
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,957
Nathan's gonna die!
Don't let him die! Wyatt!

304
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,913
I should have stayed.

305
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,313
I should have tried to save Nathan
and get him out of there.

306
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,038
Then you would have
all died in the tent.

307
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,439
And all the guys in the field that
you did save would have died too.

308
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,194
You did the right thing.

309
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,390
And, Leo, for God's sakes,
you were awarded the Medal of Honor.

310
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,152
Posthumously, I might add.

311
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,999
I didn't deserve it.

312
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,755
Right.

313
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,833
So I suppose you didn't deserve
to be a whitelighter

314
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,072
for sacrificing your life
to save others?

315
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,189
Yeah, but were those lives any more
important than Nathan's or Rick's?

316
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,319
Or anyone else in that tent?

317
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,598
You know, a good friend
put his life in my hands.

318
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,038
And I left him to die.

319
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,149
All the good that I've done
since then can't erase that fact.

320
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,754
Maybe I didn't deserve
to become a whitelighter.

321
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,195
Hey, newsflash:
Friends don't kill each other.

322
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,397
Okay, I say we douse their dusty bones
with our magic potion

323
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,357
and vanquish their sorry asses.

324
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,717
No, you can't do that.
They didn't do anything wrong.

325
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,076
Okay. So, what do you suggest?

326
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,798
I don't know, if I could talk to them,

327
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,554
make them understand
why I did what I did,

328
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,359
then maybe they can move on.

329
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,308
Maybe you all can.

330
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,237
We need to find where they're buried
so we can summon them.

331
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,675
Before they try to hurt anybody else.

332
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,355
Yeah, like us.

333
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,755
A whitelighter. I still can't believe
they made him a fricking angel.

334
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,354
How could they reward him
for turning his back on his friends?

335
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,879
Yeah.

336
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,110
But did you see the look
on his face when he saw us?

337
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,315
Guilt, total guilt.

338
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,954
At least he knows he's living a lie
built on our corpses.

339
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,591
So what? Who cares?
I still want him dead.

340
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,270
You can't kill a whitelighter.

341
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,034
Maybe not.

342
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,513
But we can hurt him
by taking the things...

343
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,038
...that he holds dear.

344
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,509
Make him dread his eternal life.

345
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,278
We can punish him,

346
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,476
make him feel like the fraud he is,

347
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,874
by killing those he loves.

348
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,992
Who knows? Maybe then,
we will be able to kill him.

349
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,674
Payback is a witch.

350
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,795
Are you kidding me?

351
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,831
The firm leases it for parties,
retreats, special occasions.

352
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,592
I think you qualify.

353
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,877
It's so big and beautiful.

354
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,911
And big.

355
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,836
- Wait, listen.
- What?

356
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,233
I don't hear anything.

357
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,038
Exactly.

358
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,628
The caterers aren't coming till 4,
so you can use it till then.

359
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,189
And you're sure
you won't get in trouble?

360
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,272
I'm already in trouble. I'm in love.

361
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,318
I have to ask you a question.

362
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,717
Were you serious this morning
when you suggested

363
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,518
that we get a place
of our own together?

364
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,910
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

365
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,798
Wrenching a Halliwell
away from the manor,

366
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,394
it's never been done before.

367
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,948
I like a challenge.

368
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,550
It's not that I don't want to.

369
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,358
It's just...

370
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,276
How do I break up
the power of three?

371
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,395
You guys don't have to keep
living together to be charmed.

372
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,789
Not anymore.

373
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,154
The Source is dead,

374
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,912
Leo can orb you back
at a moment's notice.

375
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,389
So can Paige, for that matter.

376
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,590
If we don't do it now, then when?

377
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,113
Piper will kill me.

378
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,270
The manor's too crowded.

379
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,153
There's not enough room.
Hell, there's not enough electricity.

380
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,833
Or privacy.

381
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,918
You just enjoy
your peace here today.

382
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,551
We'll talk more tonight at the party.

383
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,070
Oh, no, the party. I totally forgot.
I didn't bring anything to wear.

384
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,754
Don't worry. You just concentrate
on your advice column.

385
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,751
I'll take care of everything.
I promise.

386
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,997
Going down?

387
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,150
My wife needs a dress
for the party tonight.

388
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,714
Something like this?

389
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,670
Classy, but too safe.
I want Phoebe noticed.

390
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,595
Not that noticed.

391
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,674
- Perfect.
- Thank you.

392
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,593
You sure you don't want to see
that red number again?

393
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,512
Just save it, okay.

394
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,875
I'm not interested.
I'm a one-woman demon.

395
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,197
You're the boss.

396
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,478
I'll be in touch.

397
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,994
Found them.
Rick and Nathan Lang,

398
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,675
buried November 22nd, 1 942,
at the local VA.

399
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,831
Okay, where's the Book?
We need the summoning spell.

400
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,395
Already ahead of you.
Who you gonna call?

401
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,194
Cute. Let's go.

402
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,877
Wait, something's wrong.

403
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,270
It's Maria the teacher.
She's in trouble.

404
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,510
- I have to go to her.
- But what about the ghosts?

405
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,910
I thought we had to find them
before they hurt someone else.

406
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,355
- If something happens to my charge--
- No, no, it's okay.

407
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,318
Go and just meet us there
when you're done.

408
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,557
It's all gonna be okay.

409
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,073
Let's go.

410
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,038
Should we wait
for the sisters to separate?

411
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,111
No, we can take care of them later.

412
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,759
We're following Wyatt.

413
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,956
Wyatt, why?

414
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,791
Because nothing pushes
a whitelighter over the edge

415
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,633
faster than losing a charge.

416
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,153
Let's go.

417
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,270
I told you, lady.
I told you, don't sweat me!

418
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,189
- Easy.
- Leo.

419
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,312
Who are you? The boyfriend?

420
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,597
Well, you've come just in time
to see the show.

421
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,637
Sit down, clown.
There's a front-row seat.

422
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,598
Listen, just put the knife down,
and we can talk about it.

423
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,555
- You wanna talk, chump?
- Greg, don't!

424
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,950
You dissed me, teach.
Got me in a whole lot of trouble here.

425
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,314
Now somebody's gonna pay.

426
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,719
Don't be afraid.

427
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,878
- Teach.
- Shut up.

428
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,235
Shut up. You're the one who should
be afraid right about now!

429
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,628
Stop it, Greg. Don't be stupid.

430
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,358
Stupid? Is that what I am?

431
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,432
If you hurt him, you will be. It'll be
the stupidest thing you've ever done,

432
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,272
and there won't be
any coming back from it.

433
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,998
Your life will be over.

434
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,232
- My life's already over!
- No, it's not. Not yet.

435
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,075
It takes more courage
to put down that knife than to use it.

436
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,832
Believe me.

437
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,679
Give me the knife, Greg.

438
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,073
- You'll call the police.
- No, I won't.

439
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,234
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

440
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,194
You did a good job
teaching him a lesson.

441
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,594
Thanks to you.

442
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,069
What did I do?

443
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,629
Helped me remember
why I wanted to be a teacher.

444
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,313
No!

445
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,074
Maria!

446
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,349
You, watch her die
like you watched us die.

447
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,033
No!

448
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,273
Maria!

449
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,793
No.

450
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,397
Let go!

451
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,909
Don't! Fight it!

452
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,275
Her blood is on your hands.

453
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,557
Maria.

454
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,998
Why?

455
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,197
She didn't do anything!
She was innocent!

456
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,112
So were we!

457
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,110
Okay, you go get
the vanquishing spell,

458
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,316
and I'll get-- Leo!

459
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,959
Don't you mean potion?

460
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,429
Remember, the spell
only works if you're dead.

461
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,876
Right. Spell, potion, whatever. Leo!

462
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,879
So does that mean we're not
interested in helping them move on?

463
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,872
To hell maybe,
that's what they deserve.

464
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,191
We went to the VA to help
misguided ghosts, not killer ghosts.

465
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,914
We don't know for sure
that they killed that guard.

466
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,550
Vanquishing potion, I'm all over it.

467
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,318
- Phoebe.
- What's the matter?

468
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,357
Don't you recognise me?

469
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,471
- What do you think?
- You look beautiful.

470
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,752
Thank you.

471
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,036
Cole is kind of splurging lately, huh?

472
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,670
Yeah, and I am not complaining.
I enjoy being the belle of the ball.

473
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,397
Well, sorry, Cinderella,
but the ball's been cancelled.

474
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,913
We have killer ghosts.

475
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,479
You're kidding.

476
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,831
You are not kidding.

477
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,520
Okay, well, is it possible that you guys
could maybe handle this without me?

478
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,238
Phoebe, they tried to kill Leo.

479
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,868
- What?
- Grudge from the past.

480
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,393
I'll go do the potion.

481
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,149
Okay, and I'll call Cole
and tell him no to the party.

482
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,993
I guess I could tell him no
for everything.

483
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,836
What's that supposed to mean?

484
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,309
Nothing, nothing.

485
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,319
Cole wants us to get our own place.

486
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,038
What? You mean move out?

487
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,670
Yeah, you know,
like normal married couples do.

488
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,279
We didn't.

489
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,670
- Yeah, but you're not normal.
- Neither are you.

490
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,079
Look, I don't want
to fight about this.

491
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,800
But I just don't like the feeling
that sometimes I have to choose

492
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,393
between my sisters
and my husband.

493
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,314
It's not about that, and you know it.

494
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,119
How long are we all
gonna stay here?

495
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,193
Another year? Another five years?
Another 50 years?

496
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,351
You know, at what point
do we move on with our lives

497
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,839
and not let evil dictate them?

498
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,473
You're right.

499
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,870
Go to your party.
We'll take care of the ghosts.

500
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,313
You hate me right now.

501
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,789
- No, I don't.
- Yes, she does.

502
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,349
Look, we can talk about this later.

503
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,351
Right now, you need to go
take care of your man,

504
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,478
and I need to take care of mine.
It's as simple as that.

505
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,674
We don't need
the power of three to do this.

506
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,914
You know, I've got
a bone to pick with you.

507
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,878
Seeing as how you practically
forced me to move in here...

508
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,712
Where's Leo?

509
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,189
I already called for him twice.

510
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,873
Leo?

511
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,671
You're half whitelighter,
see if you can sense him.

512
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,558
Sense him?
I've never done that before.

513
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,278
Well, try now.

514
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,079
- I think he's in trouble.
- Well, go find him. Now.

515
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,839
Leo.

516
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,515
I tried to stop them but I couldn't.

517
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,150
Okay, come on. Come on.

518
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,038
Let's get up, let's go over here.

519
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,838
That's it.

520
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,389
Okay, what happened?

521
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,835
They're getting even with me.

522
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,672
They killed her because of me.

523
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,275
Who? Rick and Nathan?

524
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,116
Because I left them to die,
they're making me pay.

525
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,753
Come on, let's get you home.

526
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,433
No.

527
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,230
I don't have my powers anymore.

528
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,439
What happened?

529
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,953
I can't orb or heal.

530
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,349
- But how?
- It doesn't matter how.

531
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,671
I shouldn't have been given them
in the first place.

532
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,076
That is not true.

533
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,190
Your powers must be tied
to your emotions, like ours.

534
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,998
That means you can get them back.

535
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,679
You just have to pick yourself up.

536
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,592
Don't let them defeat you.

537
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,638
You are not responsible
for their actions.

538
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,869
Aren't l?

539
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,797
They're ghosts because of me.

540
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,593
Their rage comes from
something that I did.

541
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,152
If I can just give myself to them...

542
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,151
They'd kill you.

543
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,630
Because without your powers,
you're defenceless.

544
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,229
Like a mortal.

545
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,193
- Okay, we gotta get you home.
- No!

546
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,908
Nobody else is gonna die
because of me.

547
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,957
Do you understand?

548
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,872
These are my demons, not yours!

549
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,193
Okay, just give me a minute.

550
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,392
I am gonna go, and I'm gonna
get Phoebe and Piper.

551
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,830
I will be right back, I promise.

552
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,958
Don't leave.

553
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,989
Defenceless as a mortal, huh?

554
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,679
We got him
right where we want him.

555
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,991
I don't know, Rick.

556
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,195
You don't know?

557
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,510
After waiting all this time,
you're having second thoughts?

558
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,432
No, just the opposite.

559
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,315
It doesn't feel like it's enough
just killing him.

560
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,629
I want him to suffer first.

561
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,158
Follow me.

562
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,993
Penny for your thoughts,
counsellor?

563
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,034
Just that I hope
I never disappoint you.

564
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,274
I wouldn't worry about that
if I were you.

565
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,596
Welcome aboard, Turner.
We're lucky to have you.

566
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,319
Thank you.

567
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,238
Baby, I am so proud of you.

568
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,628
You have come so far.

569
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,349
Further than anyone here in this room
could even imagine.

570
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,637
Even me, I'm seeing you
in a totally different light.

571
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,757
We've both come a long way.

572
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,639
We deserve all of this. And more.

573
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,916
Just everything is happening
so fast, you know.

574
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,718
So many changes.

575
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,157
It's a little scary sometimes.

576
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,073
So maybe we shouldn't
move out of the manor then?

577
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,912
Maybe.

578
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,756
Now who's disappointing who?

579
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,195
You could never disappoint me.

580
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,030
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Paige? What are you doing here?

581
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,752
I thought I'd track you down first.
Leo needs our help, bad.

582
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,914
- By all means, go.
- Okay.

583
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,752
Call me.

584
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,549
I'll kill you.

585
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,792
That potion only works
on my bones, remember?

586
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,190
No calling out for help, Mrs. Wyatt.
Not this time.

587
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,159
Not that he could help you anyway.

588
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,918
Come on, Rick.
Let's go, man. Let's go!

589
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,672
No, I want to enjoy this.

590
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,518
Every last beat.

591
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,876
Your husband's next.

592
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,598
There.

593
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,508
- Hey!
- Piper!

594
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,276
We'll be back.

595
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,637
Fourteen, 1 5. Come on, breathe.

596
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,118
- Where's Leo?
- He wasn't at Maria's.

597
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,794
- Where's the ambulance?
- Still not here.

598
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,949
- Is she--?
- No.

599
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,998
As long as we keep the blood flowing,
she still has a chance.

600
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,435
Put some pressure
on her wound, please.

601
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,633
Piper!

602
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,472
Leo, upstairs, hurry!

603
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,791
- What happened?
- Where have you been?

604
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,996
- Looking for them.
- And here we are.

605
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,712
You can't hurt us,
but we can hurt you.

606
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,198
Wait! You don't want them,
you want me.

607
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,237
You want to get even,
get even with me!

608
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,279
You're right. I trusted you
with my life and you left me!

609
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,316
- What's going on?
- Piper.

610
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,713
Oh, my.

611
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,393
You were our friend,
and you left us to die.

612
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,959
Quick, get the Book. The spell.

613
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,509
- Which one?
- The one only a ghost can say.

614
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,954
Do it.

615
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,917
- Ashes to ashes
- What the hell?

616
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,633
Spirit to spirit

617
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,392
Take their souls, banish this evil

618
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,709
No!

619
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,399
Rick!

620
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,068
- A little help here, people.
- Damn it, Leo, do something!

621
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,079
You're a whitelighter for a reason,
because you did good things.

622
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,238
Think of all the lives you've saved,
all the good you've done.

623
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,470
And all the lives you won't save
if you give up now,

624
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,789
including your wife's.

625
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,633
Piper.

626
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,156
Come on, damn it. Breathe.

627
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,591
Don't die. Not this way.

628
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,955
Not because of me.

629
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,599
Well, it's about time.

630
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,432
That was close.

631
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,792
Really close.

632
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,313
Everything all right?

633
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,675
Yes, it's better now.

634
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,838
Let's see, Leo lost his powers,
and then Piper died,

635
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,355
and it got really dicey
when she turned into a ghost,

636
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,114
but everything worked out.

637
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,429
Glad it was nothing serious.

638
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,631
- You ready to go home?
- No.

639
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,475
- Can't we stay a little while longer?
- Well...

640
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,993
We can stay as long as you like.

641
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,238
The place is ours.

642
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,833
- Excuse me?
- The firm's offered it to me.

643
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,594
All we have to do is say yes.

644
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,509
Well, I guess

645
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,309
now that Paige can orb to me
if something comes up,

646
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,838
and seeing as how we just proved
we could still save the day...

647
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,635
Yes.

648
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,759
Yes?

649
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,639
Yeah.

650
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,557
- Nice to see you.
- How are you?

651
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,472
- Good to see you.
- Hi there.

652
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,349
Come on.

653
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,549
You belong here.

654
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,712
I don't know.
I still don't think it's a good idea.

655
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,028
Your grandfather
would want you to be here.

656
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,594
Hey, you.

657
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,077
Dear God, I'm looking at a ghost.

658
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,798
You know him?

659
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,912
Yeah.

660
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,236
You're related to Leo Wyatt,
aren't you?

661
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,115
Yes, this is his grandson,
Leo Wyatt the third.

662
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,349
Billy! Frank!

663
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,039
I want you to meet the grandson

664
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,589
of the man who made it possible
for you to be born.

665
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,669
His grandfather died
saving my life 60 years ago.

666
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,071
You wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for that man.

667
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,231
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Wyatt.

668
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,312
My dad's been telling me stories
about your grandpa since I was a boy.

669
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,873
I'd like you to meet my family.

670
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,634
- Hey, guys, come here.
- Franklin! Surdez!

671
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,229
He's kin to Leo Wyatt.

672
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,516
He's the one
who saved your butts too.

673
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,032
God bless you, son.

674
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,990
A pleasure to meet you.

675
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,116
- Nice meeting you, son.
- Leo Wyatt.

676
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,759
- Leo.
- Oh, yeah.

677
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,353
- The medic.
- Medic.

678
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,592
What's going on? Who is that?

679
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,708
My hero.

680
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,793
Boys, boys, come over here.
I want you to meet somebody.
