1
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,261
- Listen to that baby, huh?
- Do what?

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,181
- Isn't she something?
- She's something, all right.

3
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:18,185
Oh, man, straight six,
four-speed trannie...

4
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,271
Just like the one my grandpa
gave me 60 years ago.

5
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,106
Okay, sweetie, you're barely 30.

6
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,150
You know what I mean,
that first time I was alive.

7
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,320
- All right, keep it down now, will you?
- Oh, right, sorry.

8
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,864
- So, what do you think?
- I think she's beautiful.

9
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:35,953
- What do you think?
- I think $9000 is a lot of money.

10
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,579
Ninety-five hundred, actually.

11
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,457
But that includes the original tailgate,
which I've got out back.

12
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,209
Well, that makes it
completely different.

13
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,587
Seriously, it's not easy finding
a '41 in working condition,

14
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,422
and with matching
serial numbers to boot.

15
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,802
- I know it doesn't look like much now.
- No, it doesn't.

16
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,637
But it will when I'm done with it.

17
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,514
You know, I just sand off
some of the rust,

18
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,432
adjust the carburettor,
rebuild the engine.

19
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,935
Come on, that's half the fun.

20
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,228
When I'm done with this puppy,

21
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,272
it's gonna be worth,
what, 25, 30 grand?

22
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,481
At least.

23
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:07,109
And think, maybe someday,
I can pass it on to the boys.

24
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,403
How long are you planning
on keeping this thing?

25
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,196
You know what I mean.

26
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,907
Come on, this is a second chance
for me, a chance to start over.

27
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,495
- All right.
- Yes.

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,832
- I love you.
- I bet you do.

29
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,168
Okay, but seriously,
the boys don't ride in it

30
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,420
without car seats and helmets
and, like, elbow pads.

31
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,629
- Promise.
- Okay.

32
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,506
Let's go write it up.

33
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,708
What? You saw the Angel of Death
and you're only telling me this now?

34
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,585
Well, I didn't wanna worry you.

35
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,004
- Well, where did you see him? When?
- This morning.

36
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,381
Downtown with Leo.

37
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:55,008
But I don't think
it means anything, really.

38
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,887
Piper, the only person that sees him
is the person he's coming after.

39
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,305
No, that's not necessarily true.

40
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,016
We all saw him last time
and nothing happened.

41
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,726
That's because
we were protecting the guy

42
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,438
who was next on his list,
who incidentally, he got.

43
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,732
You're right,
but if he really wanted me,

44
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,776
he could have taken me
right then and there, right?

45
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,444
Okay, you have a point.

46
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,364
So maybe I just thought I saw him.

47
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,409
Maybe I'm doing what I usually do
around this point in my life.

48
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,287
Okay, you lost me.

49
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,749
We're demon-light,
the boys are happy and healthy,

50
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,086
Leo and I are doing fine,
so maybe I'm doing what I always do

51
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,796
when everything
is going well in my life.

52
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,715
I'm waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

53
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:38,302
That would be like the Manolo Blahnik
of shoe-drops, okay?

54
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,887
I'm cancelling my lunch date.

55
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,930
- No, no, no, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

56
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,142
No, you can't use my neurosis
to justify your own.

57
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,769
You're just looking for an excuse
to get out of the date.

58
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,771
I am not,
and that's besides the point.

59
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,023
No, that's exactly the point.

60
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,609
Now, Henry asked you out
and you said yes, so you're going.

61
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,736
I don't want to.
I don't even like him that way.

62
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,655
Which is clearly why you said yes.

63
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,451
So you're gonna go
and if I see Death, I'll call you.

64
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:06,163
Fine, but if he gets you,
I am never talking to you again.

65
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,635
This is taking a really long time.

66
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,345
He'll show.

67
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:24,681
Maybe you were a little too cryptic
with your clues.

68
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:29,019
Well, I couldn't exactly tell the entire
underworld that I'm a witch, okay?

69
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,356
If this doesn't flush him out,
nothing will.

70
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,650
You're getting a call? Here?

71
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,276
Yeah, great reception, huh?

72
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,987
Hey, Piper, can I call you back?

73
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,197
Yeah, sure, no problem.

74
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,367
I was just, you know, calling to see
how you're doing, if you're okay.

75
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,786
<i>- That's all.
- Why wouldn't I be?</i>

76
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:46,995
No reason, just checking.

77
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,040
- Piper, what's going on?
- Hello, demon.

78
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,292
Wait, what, demon? What demon?

79
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,753
We're trying to lure out the demon
that took Billie's sister

80
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,338
and find out what happened to her.

81
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,048
Well, no, no, no.

82
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,466
<i>You can't do that right now.</i>

83
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,552
Why, Piper, what's happening?

84
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,053
- Phoebe.
- Would you?

85
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,973
<i>Well, see, the thing is,</i>

86
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,227
I may have seen
the Angel of Death today.

87
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,522
What? When?
Oh, my God, are you okay?

88
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:17,568
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just, you know,
I'm calling to...

89
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,070
- Have you seen him?
- Who, Death? No.

90
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,655
Okay, well, that's good, that's good.

91
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,156
<i>- Maybe you shouldn't...
- He's here.</i>

92
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,075
Gotta go, gotta go.

93
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,081
You the one
that's been asking about me?

94
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:35,961
Maybe. Are you the one that
took that little girl 15 years ago?

95
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,671
Her name's Christy, I think.

96
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,381
Nobody's supposed to know
about that.

97
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,677
- Well, the demon that hired you does.
- Yes, but how do you know?

98
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,095
And why do you care?

99
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,722
Let's just say it's personal.

100
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,891
Really?

101
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,517
Billie.

102
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,275
Nice try, witch.

103
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,778
Billie, are you okay?

104
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,865
No, I'm not okay.
I just lost the only clue to finding her.

105
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,412
So do you have
any brothers or sisters?

106
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:14,833
No. Well, not that I know of.
My parents were foster parents, so...

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,169
That's right. Do you ever wonder...?

108
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,462
Wonder who my parents are?

109
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,048
- Yeah.
- No.

110
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,341
What happened happened, right?

111
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,426
Nothing I can do about it.
I don't look back.

112
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,636
I tell my parolees that too.

113
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,888
Don't look back,
there's nothing you can do about it.

114
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,765
That's actually very good advice.

115
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,144
- You have a great smile.
- Thank you. So do you.

116
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,063
Thank you.

117
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,191
- Can I take this?
- Oh, sorry, we didn't even look yet.

118
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,652
- Okay, take your time.
- Thanks.

119
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,154
- Actually, I should probably be going.
- Me too.

120
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,822
Had a great time though.

121
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,783
I did also.

122
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,993
Your half is 14.50.

123
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,454
I gotta get some change.

124
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,255
- Hello.
- Hey, are you all right?

125
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,714
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

126
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,216
What do you mean?
Did you see Death?

127
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,176
No, just saw a cad.

128
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,594
<i>Nothing fatal though.</i>

129
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,680
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

130
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,181
<i>No, don't worry about it.</i>

131
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,474
Did you see him again?

132
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,435
Well, no, but Phoebe
is out fighting demons.

133
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,645
So, what's new?

134
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,106
<i>What's new is she shouldn't be
doing that with, you know,</i>

135
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,899
the Angel of Death lurking about.

136
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,359
<i>Fair enough, okay.</i>

137
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,611
- I'm on my way home.
- Okay, but are you driving?

138
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,322
- Be careful driving.
- Yeah, okay, bye.

139
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,366
I got 15.

140
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,954
Yeah, guess what, I got 20.
Keep the change.

141
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,378
Leo? Leo?

142
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,130
Right here.

143
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,884
What are you doing under there?
Get out, get out, get out.

144
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,969
- What's the matter?
- What do you mean?

145
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,306
What if it fell? You could be crushed,
you could be killed.

146
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,891
Don't be silly, it's up on jacks.

147
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,226
So? You never know.

148
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,396
- You worry too much, you know that?
- Well, what else is new?

149
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,065
Come on, I know what I'm doing.
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

150
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,195
What's the matter? Talk to me.

151
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,449
- Nothing, it's silly.
- Not if it's bothering you, it's not.

152
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,910
I've learned by now that,
if you're worrying about something,

153
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,412
then there's usually
a good reason for it.

154
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,624
- Great.
- You don't do well by worrying.

155
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,001
You do well by doing,
that's your process.

156
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,128
Worry first, kick ass later.

157
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,755
You don't do good on your heels.

158
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,340
You like to take control.

159
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:31,386
- I do, don't I?
- It's when you're at your best.

160
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,096
Right.

161
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:41,855
I love you.

162
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,866
All right, mister.

163
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,286
I know you're lurking somewhere.
And if you want something,

164
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:00,916
you need to get your grim-reaping ass
down here or stop bugging me.

165
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,460
There's no need to be rude.

166
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,130
I was only trying to do you a favour.

167
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:11,218
Favour? Well, I don't want
any favours from you.

168
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,970
Oh, you'll want this one.

169
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,349
You know, my job was so much easier
before I met you and your sisters.

170
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,476
It was so much less complicated.

171
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,186
For what it's worth,

172
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,982
I don't think taking people's lives
should be all that easy to do.

173
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,901
It never is. Still, it's inevitable.

174
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,736
You're not taking me.

175
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:30,988
You're right, I'm not.

176
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,075
I'm taking Leo.

177
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,997
- What?
- It's curious, I actually feel bad.

178
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,457
No doubt a reflection
about my knowing you.

179
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:47,754
Don't normally get to know people long
in my line of work, obviously.

180
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,339
You can't have him.

181
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,592
You don't have a choice.

182
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,845
That's why I came earlier.
I wanted to warn you.

183
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,181
To give you time to prepare.

184
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,017
- To say goodbye.
- No.

185
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,103
I'm afraid you don't have much time.

186
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:10,319
- Why?
- I'm not about why or how, Piper.

187
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,988
I'm simply when. You know that.

188
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,201
It's not right and it's not fair.

189
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,827
Not after everything
we've gone through

190
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,495
and everything
we've been promised.

191
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,208
There's a reason for everything,
even this.

192
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,877
You know that too, Piper.

193
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,421
I am sorry.

194
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,730
<i>Hide him from sight
So I might fight</i>

195
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:51,527
<i>Ignore which leaves bereft
My husband from the Angel of Death</i>

196
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,076
Leo?

197
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,581
- Leo!
- What?

198
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,917
- What's the matter?
- Oh, thank God.

199
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,546
What happened?

200
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,593
Hello?

201
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,764
Okay, okay, hold on a second.
It's Paige.

202
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,933
<i>- What?
- What?</i>

203
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,393
What do you mean, what?

204
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,063
Do you have any idea
what is going on down here? Do you?

205
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,524
Wait, slow down.
What's the matter?

206
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:35,070
You are never gonna believe it.

207
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,450
Sorry, excuse me.

208
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,760
Piper, I know the spell didn't work out
like you wanted it to,

209
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,888
but at least it bought us
some time, right?

210
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,848
Yeah, but the Angel of Death
is still after him.

211
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,934
- It's only a matter of time.
- But time is on our side.

212
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,228
I mean, now that the whole town
looks like Leo,

213
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,688
Death has gotta be confused.

214
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,523
We can use the confusion
to our advantage,

215
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,817
until we can figure out
how to really save Leo.

216
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,444
And how exactly
are we gonna do that?

217
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:16,862
I mean, we can't watch him,

218
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,239
we can't protect him 24 hours a day,
he wouldn't let us.

219
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,659
And besides, he could fall
in the shower or trip down the stairs.

220
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,119
It could be anything.

221
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:25,454
We'll find a way.

222
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:27,915
Where's Billie?

223
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,501
She's upstairs, trying to find
the demon who took her demon.

224
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,127
Why don't you go
keep an eye on her,

225
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,921
make sure
she doesn't get herself killed?

226
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,464
- Wait, are you sure?
- Yeah.

227
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:39,134
We don't need the Angel of Death
looking for two people in this house.

228
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:43,013
Okay, I'll be upstairs if you need me.

229
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,811
We're gonna figure out
how to save him.

230
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,688
Save who?

231
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:55,901
What?

232
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,496
Well, it's about time.

233
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,710
You...

234
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,047
Painful, isn't it?

235
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,549
You...

236
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,263
It was so simple.

237
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,849
Any lower-level demon
could understand.

238
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,602
Do what you're hired to do,
then disappear.

239
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,604
But you didn't do that, did you?

240
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,816
Somebody was asking questions,
nosing around.

241
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,276
I had to cover my tracks.

242
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:41,572
No, covering tracks
is what I do, Reinhardt.

243
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,073
You just had to shut up.

244
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,326
I'm curious.

245
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,746
Do you have any idea
who it was that was asking questions?

246
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,291
- No.
- A witch.

247
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:56,003
One who also happens to be the sister
of that girl you kidnapped,

248
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,921
lo those many years ago.

249
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:01,925
- So?
- So, she tricked you.

250
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,218
Tried to get you to talk.

251
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,053
Yeah, but I didn't say anything.

252
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,892
Only because I stopped you first,
because that's what I'm hired to do.

253
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,943
What are these?

254
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,362
Living trophies.

255
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,532
Others who didn't do
as they were told.

256
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,828
You see, this goes beyond you,

257
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:33,749
or me,
or even that little girl you took.

258
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:38,837
There's a far more powerful force
at work here.

259
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,388
One that doesn't
wanna be found out.

260
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:59,024
Hey, hi. Okay, okay.
This is good news. I found him.

261
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:02,236
Supposedly, his name is Burke,
he's some demonic bounty hunter,

262
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,446
but the good news is
he gets to keep his prey.

263
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,573
So if we found him,
we would be able to...

264
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,243
Phoebe?
Hello, are you listening to me?

265
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,120
Yeah, I'm sorry.

266
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,249
It's just Leo's in
a lot of trouble right now.

267
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,458
What, why?

268
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:22,089
Well, it's a long story, but basically,
the Angel of Death is after him.

269
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,759
Are you telling me
the Angel of Death really exists?

270
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,095
Yes, unfortunately.

271
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,264
Piper and Paige are downstairs

272
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,183
trying to figure out a way
to keep him from getting to Leo,

273
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,726
and Piper sent me up here
to help you.

274
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,896
Okay, well, good. I mean, hopefully,
we can find Burke really fast.

275
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,190
- I have a spell right here...
- Billie, I'm sorry.

276
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:43,193
I'm so sorry, but I just don't think
that I can do this right now.

277
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,114
Look, I know, I haven't known Leo
as long as you, Phoebe,

278
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,409
but I care about him a lot too.
I mean, he's practically family to me.

279
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,829
Yeah, but he is my family.

280
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,414
Like my sister is to me.

281
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,043
Yeah. I know.

282
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,089
Look, Billie, I'm really sorry,
I'm just torn.

283
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:07,050
You know, I wanna help you,
I really do,

284
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,803
but I feel like
I should be helping Leo right now.

285
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,308
Well, then, you stay here
and I'm gonna go,

286
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,019
because I have to find out
what happened to her.

287
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,189
Billie...

288
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,736
Why didn't you tell me?
You don't think I have a right to know?

289
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:30,240
No, you do, I just...
I didn't know how to tell you.

290
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,244
I can't believe
this is happening, you know?

291
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,079
I can't believe that I'm...

292
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,208
You're not going to, okay?
I won't let it happen.

293
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,544
How, huh? By hexing every man
so he looks like me?

294
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,088
- It's not gonna stop him.
- No, okay, that wasn't the plan.

295
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:49,218
It's not what I meant to do, all right?
I'm scared too.

296
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:53,263
Okay, look, honey, I'm sorry.
Okay, I just...

297
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,059
I don't know what to feel,
I don't know what to do.

298
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:59,394
Then don't do anything,
just let us figure it out.

299
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,605
How, huh? I'm mortal.

300
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,942
I've been given a death sentence
by the one guy who means it.

301
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:11,823
You know, there's just
so much that I still wanna do

302
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,617
and I don't know where to start.

303
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,911
I know, but listen.

304
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,373
Okay, you just need to stay here,
you just need to stay put and...

305
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,792
Well, what about the boys?
What about Chris and Wyatt?

306
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,755
- I gotta go see Wyatt. L...
- No, no, it's not... it's not safe.

307
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,717
How am I supposed
to tell him, huh?

308
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,679
How do I tell him that?

309
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,141
Okay, listen.

310
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,602
You just gotta trust me, okay?

311
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:46,525
I mean, we're gonna fix this.
We will.

312
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:52,531
But until we do,
you just have to stay here.

313
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,659
We mean it. Do you understand?

314
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,265
I trust you said your goodbyes.

315
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,685
I'm not gonna let you do this.

316
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:26,398
Piper, we've been through this already.
Now, where's Leo?

317
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,234
I'll get it.

318
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:35,449
Oh, hi. Do you mind
just putting it on the table?

319
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,332
Here are the shirts. You're lucky
we had them ready when you called.

320
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:50,005
Hi, okay, let me show you
to the grandfather clock.

321
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,049
- Thanks.
- What's the meaning of this?

322
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,551
What can I tell you?
I run a very busy household.

323
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:58,889
And you are?

324
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,475
I thought we should talk,
after what happened at lunch.

325
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:03,977
Henry?

326
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:06,772
All right, thanks, huh?

327
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:12,152
I told you, I'm not going to
let you take my husband.

328
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,197
You've obviously no idea
who you're dealing with.

329
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,699
You seem to have
a faulty receiver, ma'am.

330
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,368
I'm gonna have to go
get some tools.

331
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:23,038
Okay, well, please, hurry back,
I don't want it to get any worse.

332
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,165
I know what I'm doing.

333
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,795
Magic won't protect him
for long, you know?

334
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:33,841
I'll find him. I always do.

335
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,389
Well, you know, Henry,
I'm just a little weirded-out right now.

336
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:42,891
- But why?
- Well, Henry,

337
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:46,019
the thing is, there are just
too many reasons to go into.

338
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,772
More secrets, huh?

339
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,316
I wanna know what went on at lunch.
Everything was going fine...

340
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,444
Yeah, well, you know,
I promise we will talk about that.

341
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:58,448
However, right now,
you're obviously a bit upset,

342
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,369
and frankly, not yourself.

343
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,204
Fine.

344
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:16,258
Hey, you know,
the meter's running, pal.

345
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,093
Take a break.

346
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,387
Fine by me.

347
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:36,153
- Who are you?
- If you can see me, then you know.

348
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,114
It wasn't easy finding you.

349
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,910
Although I must admit,
I did rather enjoy the challenge.

350
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:45,496
- Please, I...
- Don't bother.

351
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,789
Trust me, I've heard it all before.

352
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,918
But I don't understand why.

353
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,547
I mean, my first life
ended prematurely.

354
00:20:56,507 --> 00:21:00,719
And I gave up being a whitelighter
and an Elder so I can live again.

355
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,057
So I can love again.

356
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,809
You're telling me that
that can't happen now?

357
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:11,855
All life ends, Leo, sooner or later.

358
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,735
Well, can I at least
see my son again?

359
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,086
I mean, here's the thing.

360
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:36,839
We should have hope
that it's not all that bad, right?

361
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,465
I mean, look around.

362
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:44,096
These guys are back to normal
and the spell obviously wore off.

363
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,892
- Hi, I'm looking for my husband?
- Ma'am, if you'll just wait.

364
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,811
No, his name is Leo Wyatt.

365
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,813
They called and said
he was in some car crash.

366
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,773
- I just need to know...
- Just a moment, please.

367
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,192
No, actually, I need to know
where my husband is right now.

368
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,695
- Did you say his name was Leo?
- Have you seen him?

369
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:02,823
- I'm one of the doctors on his case.
- Case? What do you mean, case?

370
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,867
Your husband was admitted
about a half hour ago,

371
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,451
but we've managed to stabilize him.

372
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,120
Okay, so that's good, right?

373
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:09,913
Yes, that's good,

374
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,708
but we really won't know the extent
of his injuries until we operate.

375
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,752
- We're prepping him for surgery now.
- Surgery?

376
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,005
Yeah, it's called
an exploratory laparotomy.

377
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:19,965
To find out whether or not
his internal bleeding

378
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:23,594
is from a splenic laceration or a tear
in one of his kidneys or aorta.

379
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,930
Okay, wait, slow down, in English.

380
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,307
Is it life-threatening?

381
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,018
Yes, it is.

382
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,690
I can't believe this is happening.

383
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:38,901
We're doing everything we can,
I promise you.

384
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,278
I can't do this,
I can't handle this right now.

385
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:42,654
Please try to be positive.

386
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,449
What are you doing?

387
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,618
I can't do this.
This can't be happening.

388
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,703
Well, you can't freeze
this problem forever, Piper.

389
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,122
I'm sorry, but you can't.

390
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,795
Can I see my husband, please?

391
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:23,320
- Hey.
- What happened?

392
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:24,655
You're in the hospital.

393
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,491
You had an accident,
but you're gonna be okay.

394
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:30,828
You've always been a bad liar.

395
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,502
They're gonna take you in
for surgery soon.

396
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,838
But I'll be waiting for you
when you come out.

397
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:43,966
- Tell the boys...
- No, stop it.

398
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:47,219
You can tell them everything,
once you get out of here.

399
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,807
We're gonna beat this, Leo,
just like we always do.

400
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:54,476
- Piper...
- No, listen to me.

401
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:57,312
You can't give up.
You gotta fight this.

402
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,190
I can't do this by myself.

403
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,614
Ma'am, we're ready for surgery.

404
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:11,034
Don't give up.

405
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,165
I love you.

406
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:19,168
You too.

407
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,014
How's he doing?

408
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,227
Look, you know, I've been thinking.

409
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:40,063
- Something is not right about this.
- Paige...

410
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,775
No, I'm serious. Look, Piper,
things like this don't happen to us.

411
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:46,320
I mean, what if this
isn't just an accident?

412
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,113
What if there's something
demonic behind it?

413
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,323
What are you talking about?

414
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,283
Angel of Death told you
Leo was supposed to die,

415
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,453
which means we were way past
random chance when the truck hit him.

416
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,704
You're grasping at straws.

417
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,623
Maybe, but according
to that cop over there,

418
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,082
they have the driver in custody,

419
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:02,252
which means this could very well
not be an accident after all.

420
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:03,670
How does that help Leo?

421
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,923
If there's something magical
going on here,

422
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,800
maybe something magical can fix it.

423
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:11,637
Okay, see what you can do.

424
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:14,765
- Where are you going?
- To cheat Death.

425
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,536
Usually, I charge admission.

426
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:36,954
That demon was mine.

427
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,582
"Was" being the operative word.

428
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:45,420
I'm afraid the one who hired me
isn't ready for you to discover the truth.

429
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,005
Yeah, and who might that be?

430
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,174
Wouldn't you like to know?

431
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,469
Perhaps, then you could get
some answers about your sister.

432
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:55,305
My sister? How did you know...?

433
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,980
I always wanted a witch for a trophy.

434
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:12,656
- Thought you could use a little backup.
- Oh, thanks.

435
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:16,076
- What about Leo?
- Piper will call if she needs me.

436
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:17,286
What's this guy's deal?

437
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:20,080
Well, someone hired him
to take out Reinhardt,

438
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:22,166
the same someone
who knows about my sister.

439
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:25,127
What do you say
we get some answers?

440
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,299
What do you want from me?

441
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:33,135
I've already told you,
there's nothing I can do.

442
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:34,928
It's Leo's time.

443
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:39,600
I'll get Wyatt to heal him somehow.
He's not dead yet.

444
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:42,519
No, but he soon will be.

445
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:44,521
You said there was a reason
behind this.

446
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:47,191
There's a reason behind everything.

447
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,151
That's why it's called
the grand design.

448
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:50,444
But specifically this.

449
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,363
You made a point of telling me
that there was a reason.

450
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,157
Just like you made a point
of warning me

451
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:57,326
it was going to happen
in the first place.

452
00:26:57,493 --> 00:26:58,535
Right.

453
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:01,246
I'm not asking you to save Leo,
because I know you can't.

454
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:03,916
I'm just asking you
to tell me who can.

455
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:09,421
I need to know why this is happening,
especially if it was not an accident.

456
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:12,007
I'll pull every connection I have

457
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:14,426
if you just point me
in the right direction.

458
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:20,349
You know, I could get
in a great deal of trouble for this.

459
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:27,064
I don't know what the greater reason is,
but I do know there is one.

460
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,442
Perhaps you should speak
to those who know more

461
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:33,111
about the grand design than I do.

462
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:39,243
Thank you.

463
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:51,129
An avatar?
What are you trying to do?

464
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:57,845
I'm trying to save my husband's life,
any way I can.

465
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:05,602
The very fact that you dare put me
in a room with an avatar...

466
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,939
Shows the open-minded view
she is capable of having.

467
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:12,234
Says the one whose single-minded
beliefs nearly destroyed us all.

468
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:16,780
Listen, I'm only interested
in talking about Leo right now,

469
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:19,783
and I have it on very good authority
that one or both of you

470
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,119
can tell me why this is happening.

471
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,706
So I'm listening.

472
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:27,457
I don't know
what you're talking about.

473
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,751
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

474
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,753
Look, I don't care how it happens,

475
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,130
I don't care who does it,

476
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:36,758
but one of you is going to save Leo,
because both of you owe him.

477
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,180
Are you telling me
that you won't heal Leo?

478
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,143
Or you, that you don't have
the power to fix this?

479
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:51,273
Well, somebody say something!

480
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,193
It's not that we won't, Piper.

481
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:55,819
We can't.

482
00:28:56,195 --> 00:28:58,655
Using our powers to save Leo...

483
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:02,993
It's a path that neither Elder
nor avatar can travel.

484
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:05,370
Hang on a second.

485
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:08,874
Are you telling me that the first time
you two agree on anything

486
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:11,543
is when you decide
to let my husband die?

487
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:16,673
- I don't think so.
- I'm sorry.

488
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,759
No, you listen to me.

489
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:21,887
Leo, at one point in his life,
believed in both of your causes.

490
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:26,266
He devoted his life,
at the expense of his family,

491
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:27,476
to those beliefs.

492
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:29,811
And you're telling me
that you won't save that life?

493
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,857
Why the hell can't you tell me
what's going on?

494
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:35,692
What is your big secret?

495
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:42,908
We don't have the authority
to share that information.

496
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:45,410
Fine. Well, if you don't,
then who does?

497
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:49,039
You might wanna think twice
before going there.

498
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:51,208
Going where?

499
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,544
You're going to need your sisters.

500
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:06,807
- Hi.
- Hi.

501
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:09,393
Sorry, I left without talking before.

502
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,727
I can't talk now, so...

503
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:13,689
- Well, that's not what I came for.
- Why are you here?

504
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:16,066
- I need help. It's about my brother-in...
- Hold it.

505
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:17,943
You can't storm out on lunch
and shine me on,

506
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,862
then show up here
like nothing happened.

507
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:22,072
- I didn't...
- Let's talk about why you're upset.

508
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:25,242
Okay. Here's the thing.

509
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:28,078
I have no issue, you know,
going Dutch with guys.

510
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:30,372
I do it, you know, a lot, totally fine.

511
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,542
But I guess, I just kind of feel,
hey, maybe it's old-fashioned

512
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:37,337
that when someone specifically
asks me out on a date, that maybe...

513
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:38,714
- Who did that?
- You did.

514
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:40,090
- L... No.
- Yeah.

515
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:44,761
You said, "Would you like
to go for lunch on a date?"

516
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:47,890
I said, "Would you like
to go for lunch at Nate's?"

517
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:52,269
Okay, that's really embarrassing.

518
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:57,482
The embarrassing part of the story
is that I did want to make it a date.

519
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:01,612
And I didn't ask you because
I was scared you were gonna say no.

520
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,781
Misunderstandings.

521
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:08,285
- So, what can I do for you, Paige?
- Here's the thing.

522
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:10,621
I need to speak to somebody in jail.

523
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:14,124
The catch is
it has to be completely private,

524
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,126
and you can't ask me why.

525
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,465
How exactly
is this gonna help Leo again?

526
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:23,634
Henry, please stop fishing.

527
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:28,847
What's going on?
Who's she, my PD?

528
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:31,141
Thanks, Jack.

529
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:37,481
All right, no one's on the other side,
the cameras are off, he's all yours.

530
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:39,191
Thank you.

531
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:41,109
Hope you know what you're doing.

532
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:43,779
Yeah, hey, I hope you know
what you're doing too, lady.

533
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:47,533
I mean, you're a great-looking lawyer
and all, but I gotta get out of here.

534
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:51,995
- I'm not a lawyer.
- Oh, no? Then what are you?

535
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:56,834
Actually, I'm a witch.

536
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:05,717
What the hell? Where are we?

537
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:08,846
How did we get here?
What the hell was that?

538
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,180
Truth potion, Lenny.

539
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:13,809
You're gonna tell me what's going on
and who is behind this.

540
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,937
Behind what?

541
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:20,482
Hey.

542
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,318
Hey, I feel pretty good.

543
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:25,696
- What was that stuff?
- Never mind.

544
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:27,364
The truth, now.

545
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:30,534
All right, okay.

546
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:34,163
The truth is I don't really have
a license to drive a tow, I forged it.

547
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:36,373
I'm not really from Jersey,
I'm from Kansas.

548
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,333
- What?
- I took the gig to pay back the bookie.

549
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,503
I didn't really lose the money, I stole it.
That's after I slept with his wife.

550
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,089
No, tell me about the accident.

551
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:45,674
Which demon is behind this?

552
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:48,177
Demons? You wanna talk demons?

553
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:49,887
- Yeah.
- All right.

554
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,555
I stole from the collection plate,

555
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:53,557
promised to return the money
and gambled it away.

556
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:56,894
Well, actually, I rigged the game
and made some dough,

557
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,105
and then I lost it putting
on a pick at the track.

558
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:02,566
Paige, what are you doing?

559
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,693
This is the guy
who crashed into Leo.

560
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,738
Although I'm beginning to think
it really was an accident.

561
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:10,532
It wasn't. Get rid of him.

562
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:16,079
Now, I wonder what would happen
if I put this right here.

563
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:21,919
No. Don't. Just put it down, please.

564
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,754
It'll kill me, I swear.

565
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:25,714
Oh, you might wanna keep
that in mind.

566
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:27,674
So I guess that means
you value your life.

567
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:30,093
Enough to start answering
some questions?

568
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:33,263
I already told you,
I don't know anything.

569
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,140
- I just do as I'm told.
- You're lying.

570
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:36,975
You knew who I was,
you know about my sister.

571
00:33:37,142 --> 00:33:39,937
Now, tell us who hired you,
or you're dead.

572
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:43,607
What?

573
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:50,989
You know, a phone call
would have done the trick.

574
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:54,451
- We're running out of time.
- And so is Leo.

575
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:11,718
Wait a minute. Are we sure
we know what we're doing here?

576
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:12,928
Phoebe?

577
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:15,222
Piper, I would do anything to save Leo,
you know that,

578
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,974
but this is freaking me out a little bit.

579
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,809
I mean, has anyone
ever done this before?

580
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:20,519
Well, we met
the Angel of Destiny before.

581
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:22,229
I know, but we've never
summoned him.

582
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:24,481
He came to us, okay?
I'm just saying.

583
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:27,150
Phoebe, I can't lose Leo. I won't.

584
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:36,160
<i>Power of three, we summon thee</i>

585
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:40,164
<i>And call to us the Angel of Destiny</i>

586
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:48,005
Who are you to summon me?

587
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,591
You don't look like the one
we've met before.

588
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:53,719
There are many destinies
and many angels.

589
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:55,846
- Do you know why we called you?
- Yes.

590
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:59,057
But there's nothing I can do for you.
This is Leo's destiny.

591
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:01,018
Why? Who says?

592
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,395
- Who do you think?
- Don't go there.

593
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:06,273
Listen, lady, I've jumped
through a lot of hoops to get you here,

594
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,483
and I want some answers,
and I mean fast.

595
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,693
Easy, Piper.

596
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:13,155
This was not any random accident.

597
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:15,699
There's more to it than that
and I want to know what.

598
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:17,201
Who says there's more?

599
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:18,702
The Angel of Death.

600
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:20,996
- And an Elder.
- And an avatar.

601
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:24,041
Looks like I'm going to have
to have a little chat with them.

602
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,627
First, you're gonna have
to have a little chat with me.

603
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:30,380
Now, I don't understand this whole
grand design thing, nor do I want to.

604
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:33,467
But if your only concern
is where we end up,

605
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:36,678
isn't it up to us, with free will and all,
how we get there?

606
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:38,388
Go on.

607
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:41,892
Just explain to me why Leo
is destined to die right now.

608
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:45,062
What does it mean
for the whole big picture?

609
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:51,276
Because maybe there is a way for us
to get there that he doesn't have to die.

610
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,948
You have to give us a chance.
You at least owe us that.

611
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:08,627
There's one more battle
on the horizon for you three.

612
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:11,421
One unlike you've ever faced before.

613
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:16,593
One you won't see coming
and one you may not survive.

614
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,472
What does that
have to do with Leo?

615
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:22,266
The loss.

616
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:25,561
The pain will motivate you,
all of you, to fight,

617
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:28,105
without which
you will have no chance to prevail.

618
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:33,527
Won't you please try to let us
find a way to do this without Leo dying?

619
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:37,656
What exactly do you have in mind?

620
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,917
My sister, is she alive or not?

621
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:52,504
All right. All right, I'll talk.

622
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:55,883
Billie, wait.

623
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:58,427
What are you guys doing here?
Who's that?

624
00:36:58,677 --> 00:36:59,970
Someone that can save Leo.

625
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:01,638
But we're gonna need his help.

626
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:03,974
We don't have a lot of time.

627
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,310
Leo is about to die any second

628
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:09,146
and this was the only way
we could think of to save him.

629
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,231
How?

630
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:16,945
By doing to Leo what he does
to his trophies, freezing them.

631
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:20,449
But that's only if
I agree to help, right?

632
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:23,243
I mean, blondie here
knows how to torture all right,

633
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,661
but she can't freeze anyone.

634
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:26,663
What's your point?
What do you want?

635
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,832
It's a little thing called amnesty.

636
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:33,295
You don't come after me,
you don't touch me.

637
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:35,172
I'm completely free.

638
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:38,842
And I don't have to talk to you
or anyone else about her sister.

639
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:40,177
No, no, no, you can't do this.

640
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,304
- He knows something.
- I know, sweetie, I know.

641
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:45,224
And I swear, we'll find your sister,
I promise.

642
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,684
But this is Leo's only hope.

643
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:52,814
Okay.

644
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:55,108
Deal?

645
00:37:58,821 --> 00:37:59,863
Go ahead.

646
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:11,917
What's going on?

647
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:15,587
Where am I?

648
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:20,884
It doesn't matter.

649
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:23,053
All that matters
is you're gonna be safe.

650
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,222
What do you mean?
What's going on?

651
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:30,227
Remember when I told you
you just had to trust me?

652
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,688
This is the only way.

653
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:34,356
The only way?

654
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:37,693
Piper...

655
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:41,947
I have to lose you to save you.

656
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,909
It's just our screwed-up destiny

657
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:48,871
and you kind of got caught
in the middle.

658
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:51,456
I'm so sorry.

659
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:54,710
It's all right, I...

660
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,130
We've been through worse.

661
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,676
No. We haven't.

662
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:05,762
We're gonna get through this.

663
00:39:12,603 --> 00:39:13,896
Of course we will.

664
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:17,107
It's time.

665
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:33,790
I love you.

666
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:35,959
I love you too.

667
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,837
You will find your sister, Billie.

668
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:21,463
It's your destiny.

669
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:28,387
If you prevail, he will be returned.

670
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:30,764
If not...

671
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:52,035

672
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:01,461
Wait. No.

673
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:04,214
I did what you asked, didn't I?

674
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:07,634
I kept her from finding out
about her sister.
