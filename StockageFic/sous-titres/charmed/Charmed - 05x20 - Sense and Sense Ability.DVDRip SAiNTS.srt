1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,032
<i>Hush, little baby, don't you cry</i>

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,795
<i>Auntie's gonna buy you a pumpkin pie</i>

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,398
<i>And iF that pie
Doesn't taste real good</i>

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,792
<i>Auntie's gonna buy you
Some other kind oF Food</i>

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,873
<i>And iF that Food
Doesn't Fill your tummy</i>

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,028
It's a lucky baby.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,319
I'm sorry, it's the only thing
I can do to soothe him nowadays.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,357
Why would you be sorry?

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,988
Because normally I don't like
to embarrass myself

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,152
until the fifth or sixth date.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,309
Yeah.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,596
Humiliate, why?
You got a great voice.

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,479
Better than most
of the singers I book at the club.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,758
Oh, you're just being sweet,
not that I mind sweet.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,594
- Now, why don't you like to sing?
- Something called the eighth grade.

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,275
Graduation. I was supposed
to sing the school song.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,951
Eight hundred people are watching,
the band is playing, I get up,

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,270
and no sound comes
out of my mouth.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,993
I completely froze.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,350
To make matters worse, I ran out
and missed my own graduation.

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,953
- No.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,271
I think eighth grade
sort of sucks for everybody.

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,557
Yeah, mine just
kind of sucked publicly.

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,478
That was nice. I...

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,631
...haven't had that in a while.
- Had what?

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,870
Well, I like talking to you.

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,430
- I like talking to you too.
- And I like kissing you.

28
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,553
Kissing's good.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,754
- And I'm kind of nervous.
- Me too.

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,918
I should get you more wine.

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,311
I'll get it. It's in the kitchen, right?

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,958
Leo, Piper, help!

33
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,993
What's the...?

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,600
- You okay?
- Get out. Get out. Nate's...

35
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,633
...here.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,558
Hey, Nate, buddy, how you doing?

37
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,517
Good. Good.
I didn't hear you come in.

38
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,035
Yeah, how about that?
Kind of like magic.

39
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,272
What? Where am I?

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,391
You're back from the dead, dear.

41
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,394
What? How?

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,949
A simple "thank you" will suffice.

43
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,678
Wait a minute.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,479
Who are you?

45
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,237
Let's not strain your mind
with too much information.

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,509
All I want, in exchange for your life,

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,398
is a meeting with your king.

48
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,471
My king? He'll never agree to it.

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,558
Or I can put you back
where I found you.

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,639
Tell your king

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,238
that if he works with me, I'll serve him
all three Charmed Ones on a platter.

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,628
You're after the Charmed Ones?

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,678
No, dear.

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,394
I'm after their baby.

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,078
Yes, Jason, I'm meeting with
the syndication consultants today.

56
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,629
But I've been doing
some preliminary research,

57
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,712
and we've got Ann Landers,
Dear Abby, and E. Jean,

58
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,791
but if Atlanta folds,
the South will be mine.

59
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,949
I bore him.

60
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,272
Yeah, well, I don't care if the South
thinks my column is too edgy, okay?

61
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,398
I think the South
could use a little edge.

62
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,597
What is that? What is it?

63
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,237
- Kazi vanquish.
- Another one?

64
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,750
- Paige is on it.
- Yes, of course I'm excited.

65
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,148
Can't you tell that I'm excited?

66
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,878
I just miss you.
When are you coming home?

67
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,600
Okay, Mommy's got one
last picture left. You ready?

68
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,591
Here we go. Smile, smile, smile.

69
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,678
- One, two, three.
- I know. It's just a lot to get used to.

70
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,391
All right, I give up.

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,950
Hey, big guy, you want
to do the popcorn machine?

72
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,998
Yes, he does.

73
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,199
Pop, pop, pop, pop...

74
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,593
Yeah, see, now he smiles.

75
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,756
Okay, let's get you ready
for the fair, okay?

76
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,309
I'm telling you, it's not gonna fit.
Nothing fits anymore.

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,799
If he keeps growing at this rate,

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,991
we're gonna have to send him
to college by next week.

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,919
Well, he will in these.
I just got them yesterday.

80
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,112
- Are you hurting him?
- No, he's just hungry.

81
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,958
- Are you sure?
- Jason, hang on a sec.

82
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,315
- That's his hungry cry.
- Thanks.

83
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,676
People, I am a terrible mother.
I am bad at this.

84
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,796
I don't even recognize
my own child's cries.

85
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,188
It's a subtle difference.

86
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,552
Okay, well, what about this
maternal bond I hear so much about?

87
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,153
Jason, I gotta call you back.

88
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,992
Paige.

89
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,317
Everything okay?

90
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,270
Better than okay.
I am gonna have a love life.

91
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,796
- You're making a love potion?
- No, I'm making a stun potion.

92
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,951
So that lovers
will be stunned by you?

93
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,633
No, so Kazis will be stunned by me.

94
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,394
- You're in love with a Kazi demon?
- Try to stay with me, people.

95
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,280
I am making a stun potion
so that I can maybe have a date

96
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,317
that doesn't end with,
"Nate, you gotta leave.

97
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,317
I have to clean
some demon guts off the ceiling."

98
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,988
Nate, much cuter
than a Kazi demon.

99
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,790
The potion you hold in your hand
is designed to stun, but not kill, Kazis.

100
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,109
But I so enjoy killing them.

101
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,993
But since the Kazi king creates his
demon minions out of his own body...

102
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,310
If we get the king,
then we get the Kazis.

103
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,631
- But we don't know where the king is.
- But that's why I did the stun potion.

104
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,155
So if we capture one of his minions,
we can torture him...

105
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,198
Then the king will feel the pain
and come in for the rescue.

106
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,679
Or the minion will break

107
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,037
and spill his guts
on the whereabouts of the king.

108
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,111
Okay, the finishing sentence thing,
not cute.

109
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,590
We're just trying to tell you it's
a good plan. An oldie, but a goodie.

110
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,309
Okay, let's go, guys.
The fair waits for no witch.

111
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,512
Oh, no, the fair's today?
I have to work...

112
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,554
No, you will not finish that sentence.
We are going to the fair as a family.

113
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,278
- You promised.
- I know I did.

114
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,796
And I really, really want to go, but the
syndication meeting is this afternoon.

115
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,076
Do you really wanna miss
Wyatt's first street fair?

116
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,071
He doesn't have
a lot of firsts left, you know.

117
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,198
Yeah, he does. He's got
his first date, first bad grade,

118
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,351
first backfired spell,
many, many firsts.

119
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,880
- I'll bring my cell phone.
- Bring the potions too, just in case.

120
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,758
Got mine.

121
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,833
How dare you summon me here?

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,468
Do you have any idea
who you're dealing with?

123
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,631
Save your threats, they bore me.

124
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,832
Are you interested
in the Charmed Ones or not?

125
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,911
What exactly do you propose?

126
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,073
A partnership. But you'll get
all the credit for the kill.

127
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,916
The power,
glory you've been seeking. Yes?

128
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,959
- And what will you get?
- I'll get my hands on the child.

129
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,912
There's a law.

130
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,196
Killing that child
is punishable by death.

131
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,830
I know. I wrote the law.

132
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,668
And I have no intention of killing him.

133
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,717
Then why?

134
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,917
I had a vision,

135
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,756
a mere taste of the future
of the child,

136
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,310
of power like we've never known.

137
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,636
But I didn't see enough.
I need to know more.

138
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,637
I must lay hands on the child.

139
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,149
Which is why I'm going to help you
take out the witches.

140
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,474
- How?
- With this ancient magic.

141
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,590
I can both weaken them
and gain their child's trust.

142
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,716
Come on Wyatt, wake up. Come on.

143
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,155
Got a pony, see? Pony.

144
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,834
Come on, guys. Watch your step
when you get down.

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,468
Why don't you take him over
to see the clown?

146
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,429
No, clowns are scary. And besides,
balloons are a no-no for infants.

147
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,949
Come on, put the camera away.
You're missing all the fun.

148
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,634
Taking pictures of him is fun for me.

149
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,679
I mean, if you want to talk to someone
about missing out, talk to Phoebe.

150
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,833
Hi, Elise.

151
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,270
No, I'm not on my way yet.

152
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,908
I'm at a fair with my nephew.

153
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,594
Well, yeah, of course
I'm gonna be at the meeting.

154
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,435
I will be there. I will be ready.
I will be on.

155
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,352
Yeah.

156
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,029
I know. I know.

157
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,277
You know what, let me call you back.
Let me call you back.

158
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,872
Kind of sad when a mime
is making fun of your phone usage.

159
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,632
Yeah.

160
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,476
Everyone hates mimes.
You do know that, don't you?

161
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,518
Okay, so I have five minutes.

162
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,910
Is there a ride
I can go on with him real quick?

163
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,314
Okay, that's pathetic.

164
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,670
Phoebe, you are pencilling in
rides with your nephew?

165
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,319
For crying out loud, it's Saturday.

166
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,318
I know, but I think I'm gonna be
working Saturdays from now on.

167
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,073
Do you think I'm happy about this?

168
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,869
There are many things I've been in my
life. A workaholic is not one of them.

169
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,110
If you're not happy with it,
why are you doing it?

170
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,919
- Who says I'm not happy?
- You just did.

171
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,433
I blame your very handsome
but very pushy boyfriend.

172
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,909
National syndication
is a huge opportunity.

173
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,993
And, yes, it was Jason's idea,
but I agreed to it. And I am happy.

174
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,957
I'm really happy.

175
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,752
Hello?

176
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,716
Yeah, okay.

177
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,716
Don't like monkeys.

178
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,399
Hold on. Let me call you back.

179
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,516
Leo, germs, cover the baby!

180
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,672
All right.

181
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,592
I don't think Wyatt liked Mr. Monkey.

182
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,150
Did he scare you?
He did. He scared him.

183
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,151
Oh, it's okay.

184
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,836
- Is he hungry?
- No, that's his tired cry.

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,878
Yeah, I think he's just overstimulated.
Maybe we should go home.

186
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,270
All right, you guys are the experts.

187
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,153
Why don't you orb,
and I'll go develop this film.

188
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,753
Okay, we'll walk you to the car.

189
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,715
I think that stupid monkey
got dust in my eye.

190
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,472
- Do you hear that ringing?
- No.

191
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,395
All done? Good boy.

192
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,037
It's time, then.
I can send my warrior in.

193
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,593
No.

194
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,432
The witches are infected.

195
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,515
But the monkey's curse
is designed to punish.

196
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,390
So it won't take their senses

197
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,711
until the moment the witches
need them most.

198
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,389
- Hi.
- There you are.

199
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,431
Yes, I'm so sorry.

200
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,359
Phoebe, this is Mark Roberts
with the syndicators.

201
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,795
- Hello.
- Laura Robins with Marketing.

202
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,188
- Hi.
- How are you?

203
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,477
- Richard Jean, our image consultant.
- Richard, hi.

204
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,880
I'm so glad you guys could make it.
Thank you so much.

205
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,191
Jason tells me you're the best. I look
forward to hearing your thoughts.

206
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,839
Glad you could make it.

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,116
I'm really sorry.
Do you hear that buzzing?

208
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,111
Well, if I can start.

209
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,953
I'd just like to dive right in
with a congratulations, Phoebe.

210
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,634
I love your column.

211
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,836
And I also want to say,
not only am I an image consultant,

212
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,553
but I'm a fan as well.

213
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,833
I'm sorry?

214
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,839
I said, I'm a fan.

215
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,233
Oh, you... Oh, that's sweet.

216
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,630
Thank you so much. Thank you.

217
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,031
I think you're beautiful,
stylish, approachable.

218
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,316
That's why I don't want
to alter your look too much.

219
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,869
"Author a book"?

220
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,316
Wow, I don't know
if I'm ready for that.

221
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,675
You know, one step at a time.

222
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,831
- I'm sorry?
- What?

223
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,674
I'm sorry, sometimes I mumble.
I said "your look," not "your book."

224
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,876
Oh, right, the hook.

225
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,996
Yeah, to be honest with you,
"She has the answers,"

226
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,037
it's kind of lame, right?

227
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,352
Any ideas?

228
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,630
Well, l...

229
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,837
- I mainly do image.
- Actually,

230
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,190
I'm the advertising consultant.

231
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,716
<i>Are you okay?</i>

232
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,228
I'm... I'm...
I think I'm gonna have to leave,

233
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,392
because I'm not really feeling too well.
So thank you.

234
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,317
Phoebe.

235
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,757
Wow, you look beautiful.

236
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,313
You've already said that.

237
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,756
Yeah, but you look crazy beautiful,
so it bears repeating.

238
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,671
Okay, now I'm blushing, and my
lipstick won't match my cheeks.

239
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,957
Well, since you're already blushing,
I have a little bit of a surprise for you.

240
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,593
But don't hate me, all right?

241
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,160
You're not gonna propose, are you?

242
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,551
- No.
- In that case, I like surprises.

243
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,079
Good.

244
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,751
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a special treat for you tonight

245
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,639
to make your happy hour
just a little happier.

246
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,510
Local girl, Paige Matthews,
in her debut.

247
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,555
Are you kidding?

248
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,557
Come on,
I thought you liked surprises.

249
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,232
This is a bad surprise. Bad.

250
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,914
Eighth grade was
a long time ago, Paige. Come on.

251
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,119
Yeah, but that turned out
to be the worst day of my life.

252
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,158
All my friends laughed at me.
Bobby Maynard dumped me.

253
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,351
You dated a guy
named Bobby Maynard?

254
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,236
That is not the point.

255
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,429
Look, I'm already losing my voice.
This... This is the sound of panic.

256
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,795
Look, Paige, you don't have to sing
if you don't want to.

257
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,316
You just strike me as the type of girl
who likes to face her fears,

258
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,959
not run from them.

259
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,711
This one is for all
the Bobby Maynards in the world.

260
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,800
<i>Isn't it</i>

261
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,518
Paige, wait.

262
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,672
Paige?

263
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,114
Paige, is that you?

264
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,509
<i>Billy. Billy, are you here?</i>

265
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,316
<i>I hope the creature
didn't get you too.</i>

266
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,592
<i>Oh, Billy.</i>

267
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,308
Paige! Piper!

268
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,670
If you're here,
I need you to come out to the open

269
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,274
and, like, flag me down
or something, okay?

270
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,589
Hello?

271
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,230
Anyone? Hello?

272
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,357
I lost my hearing during
the biggest meeting of my life!

273
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,351
I can't hear a thing!

274
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,949
What?

275
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,519
I can't hear you!

276
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,517
Oh, okay. Okay.

277
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,750
I need your help.
Magic's got to be behind this.

278
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,112
What are you doing?

279
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,991
Oh, I get it. I get it. Charades.

280
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,394
Okay, yeah, yeah.

281
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,069
You're a monkey. Yeah, okay.

282
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,992
You're a monkey.

283
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,912
Oh, you're an angry monkey.

284
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,836
Oh, you're pissed. You're...

285
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,151
PMS monkey?

286
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,753
No, no, of course not.

287
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,399
Okay.

288
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,308
Ball.

289
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,991
Fireball.

290
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,392
Okay. Yeah. A demon monkey
stole my hearing.

291
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,273
And your voice too. Oh, honey.

292
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,236
I don't understand
why you can't heal my eyes.

293
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,356
I don't know, your vision is just gone.

294
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,397
- Well, how is that possible?
- You hear something?

295
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,874
I don't know.

296
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,678
You hear puppets?

297
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,034
I'll find Phoebe and Paige
after I put the baby down.

298
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,077
- Where am I?
- In the conservatory.

299
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,356
Just try and stay calm,
and try not to worry.

300
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,592
You hear voices. Voices, right.

301
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,231
- Piper!
- I'm so glad you're here.

302
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,551
I can't see a thing,
and I wrapped my car around a pole.

303
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,278
- And I know it sounds crazy,
- Piper!

304
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,635
But I think it has something to do
with that mangy monkey.

305
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,791
- Piper!
- Where are you?

306
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,190
Who put that there?

307
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,198
Oh, my God. Piper, you're blind.

308
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,998
Yeah. Phoebe, I just said that.

309
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,879
Now, can we talk about
how a monkey could do that?

310
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,350
- What did she say?
- What did who say? The monkey?

311
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,112
He didn't say anything.
He covered my eyes,

312
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,030
- and stole my eyesight.
- I think the monkey stole

313
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,952
your eyesight
when he covered your eyes.

314
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,639
Phoebe, are you listening to me?
That's just what I said.

315
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,950
You are acting like
you can't even hear me.

316
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,793
Piper, it's no use,
I can't even hear you.

317
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,111
- The monkey stole my hearing.
- Oh, he got you too,

318
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,517
which means somebody
sent that flea-infested primate after us.

319
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,750
We've gotta find Paige.

320
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,072
Why are you clapping?
This is not funny.

321
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,719
What's the matter, Paige?

322
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,472
Paige? Where's Paige?

323
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,118
What's going on?

324
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,593
I see.

325
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,595
- Well, I don't. Where is Paige?
- She just can't talk.

326
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,309
Excuse me, this is either
someone's sick, sick joke,

327
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,990
or someone's working
on a massive evil plan!

328
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,038
Whatever it is, you guys are
in danger without your senses.

329
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,636
Piper, you're the most vulnerable,
so I want you to stay next to Wyatt.

330
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,519
- His force field will protect you.
- Okay.

331
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,995
Paige, a Kazi attack
could be deadly right now.

332
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,469
Make sure we're stocked up
on stun potion.

333
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,511
Where are we going?

334
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,708
<i>Phoebe, check the Book oF Shadows,
see what you can find out</i>

335
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,519
about evil monkeys and demons
who control them.

336
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,833
Come on.

337
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,712
Paige.

338
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,918
First we wait on a monkey,
and now what?

339
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,315
What are we waiting on now?

340
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,149
You're waiting on me. Get used to it.

341
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,630
Unlike you, I don't charge in
like a wild bull.

342
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,839
I prefer to take my time
and succeed.

343
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,958
I say enough time has passed.

344
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,519
Perhaps.

345
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,434
First, we need to find out
if the monkey's magic has taken effect.

346
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,797
If so, you can send in your warrior

347
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,520
while I make my move for the baby.

348
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,235
How do we figure out if the monkey
has done his job?

349
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,719
Common sense.

350
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,950
You dare mock me?

351
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,908
On occasion. But not at the moment.

352
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,996
This totem...

353
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,638
...was created to trap senses.

354
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,115
But with my magic,

355
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,670
I can borrow what's inside here.

356
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,308
So that's what this is all about.

357
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,836
You want to steal
the Charmed Ones' senses.

358
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,672
Why?

359
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,831
You'd be surprised what you can do

360
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,754
with a set of eyes,
a pair of ears, a voice.

361
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,515
You might even be able to trick
an infant into believing

362
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,432
you're one of the family.

363
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,274
Now...

364
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:46,040
...let's see that beautiful baby boy.

365
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,793
Okay, little guy, what is it?
What is it?

366
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,669
Do we need a diaper change?
No, not that.

367
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,230
Okay, how about
the popcorn machine?

368
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,512
That always works for Daddy, right?
Right? Okay, here we go.

369
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,750
Pop, pop, pop, pop...

370
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,791
No popping.
Okay, forget the popping.

371
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,997
Okay, it's all right. Hello?

372
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,675
Leo?

373
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,434
Yeah, just came to check on you.

374
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,756
How did you know it was me?

375
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,511
Well, you shuffle your feet.
You're a shuffler.

376
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,399
Looks like your other senses
are already taking over for your vision.

377
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,519
Not fast enough. Okay,
tell me what I'm doing wrong here.

378
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,240
That fussy noise usually means gas.

379
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,228
- Try putting him over your shoulder.
- Okay.

380
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,358
Alrighty, here we go. Oh, now.

381
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,829
- Better?
- No, not better.

382
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,231
I don't know all his tricks
and noises like you guys do.

383
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,470
And at least before, I could see him.

384
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,518
Well, the love is there.
The rest will follow.

385
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,112
You know, it's just a myth

386
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,236
that all mothers
instantly bond with their children.

387
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,392
Well, I'm not worried about all other
mothers. I'm worried about this one.

388
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,755
Well, from where I stand,
you look like a pro.

389
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,112
- He's already calmed down.
- He has? Oh, he has. Okay, good.

390
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,710
Leo, bring Piper up here.
I think we found something.

391
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,313
Here, take him.

392
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,357
I don't want him left alone
for a second

393
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,353
while all this stuff
is going on here, okay?

394
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,870
The monkey didn't come
after us on his own.

395
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,112
Someone very powerful
is behind all of this.

396
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,594
The question is, who?

397
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,957
Hello? Anybody in here?
Give me a sign.

398
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,232
All right, speak and spell.

399
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,391
Tell me what you two know.

400
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,114
Okay, listen to this. Centuries ago,
a sorcerer created a monkey

401
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,710
to steal his enemies' senses. Only
the sorcerer mistreated the little fella,

402
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,950
so the monkey stole
his master's voice

403
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,271
and was turned into a wooden totem
as punishment.

404
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,749
So this whole monkey business about,
you know,

405
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,191
speak no evil, hear no evil,
see no evil is a real thing?

406
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,473
What?

407
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,198
Never mind. Read my lips.

408
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,639
Is there anything in here
that will get our senses back?

409
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,910
Piper, I can't hear you!

410
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,672
What do we do?

411
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,351
Paige is proposing violence
against the monkey.

412
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,318
Well, I'm inclined to agree,

413
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,631
but I really think the monkey
is the least of our worries.

414
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,791
Yeah, I didn't hear
what you just said.

415
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,678
But if you're wondering
who's behind this,

416
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,956
<i>I was about to look in the Book.</i>

417
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,836
Oh, no, it's Elise. Piper, you're
the only one that can talk to her.

418
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,228
Tell her I'm sick.

419
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,595
- Tell her... Tell her...
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

420
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,079
Okay.

421
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,468
Hello?

422
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,551
Hi, Elise.

423
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,553
Phoebe?

424
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,593
Yeah, she's here. She's lying down.

425
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,193
I don't know,
inner-ear infection maybe?

426
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,396
Oh, no, not you, Elise.

427
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,869
We just got workers
around here all day.

428
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,312
What is going on over there?

429
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,152
- Kazi demon!
- Gotta go.

430
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,719
- Three o'clock.
- What? What?

431
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,388
Twelve o'clock!

432
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,388
Did I get him?

433
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,111
Wyatt, danger.

434
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,836
How about that time?

435
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,470
You killed Aunt Pearl's couch.

436
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,717
- Did I get the Kazi?
- I can't hear you.

437
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,997
Phoebe, what's happening?
Phoebe, talk to me.

438
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,073
Phoebe.

439
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,832
<i>Little baby, don't say a word</i>

440
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,357
<i>Mama's gonna buy you
A mockingbird</i>

441
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,557
<i>IF that mockingbird won't sing</i>

442
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,432
Is she gonna be okay?

443
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,352
I think so.

444
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,751
Crystal cage is ready.

445
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,878
Do you hear that?

446
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,119
- I don't hear anything.
- It sounds like singing.

447
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,351
<i>- Wyatt.
- IF you let this Force Field down</i>

448
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,314
<i>You'll still be
The best little baby in town</i>

449
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,516
Piper! Wyatt, careful, it's...

450
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,229
Leo, what's going on?

451
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,117
You'll pay for that.

452
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,112
- Is Wyatt okay?
- Wyatt's okay.

453
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,319
- Where's Leo?
- Leo?

454
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,076
Why isn't he answering us?

455
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,430
- Where's my warrior?
- Captured.

456
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,870
That's your fault.
You said you would weaken them.

457
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,519
And I did.

458
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,433
However, I failed to account
for their whitelighter.

459
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,795
But don't worry,
he won't get in our way again.

460
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,793
I say we launch another attack now.

461
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,557
First I need to know
the witches aren't on to me.

462
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,438
If they figure out
that I want their baby,

463
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,034
I'll never get my hands on him.
Now, please...

464
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,037
...let me concentrate.

465
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,158
There you go. Is that better?

466
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,992
Okay, there you go.

467
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,675
Yeah, that's better. It's okay, baby.
Daddy will be home soon.

468
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,158
- You did it! You calmed him down!
- Phoebe.

469
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,119
It's strange.
After, you know, I lost my vision,

470
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,989
I was forced to use
my maternal instincts, which is good,

471
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,639
because I wasn't really
sure I had them.

472
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,633
I know.

473
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,517
I'm getting pretty good
at reading lips.

474
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,309
I think you just said, "I know."
What do you know?

475
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,436
That we'll find Leo.

476
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,834
Okay, that's weird.

477
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,638
How did you know
that's what Paige wrote?

478
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,872
I mean, you can't see it,
and I didn't say it. So how did you...?

479
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,718
I'm not sure.

480
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,678
I guess maybe we're developing
some sort of sixth sense?

481
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,068
That's what it must be, right?

482
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,391
Well, whatever it is,
we gotta use it to help find Leo.

483
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,151
Start the interrogation.

484
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,069
We will be in the nursery.

485
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,798
You gonna be okay
to get down the stairs?

486
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,190
Oh, yeah. I'm getting the hang
of this blind stuff.

487
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,749
Besides, I grew up in this house.

488
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,113
Wrong answer.

489
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,592
Is somebody here?

490
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,117
<i>- Nate.
- Nate is here?</i>

491
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,832
You want me to get rid of him?

492
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,877
I can't do that, Paige.
I mean, first of all,

493
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,874
I'm not the best listener right now.
And second of all, he's your boyfriend.

494
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,560
You lost your voice
when you were singing with him...

495
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,918
Wait, how could that be?
You were with him at his piano bar.

496
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,232
You lost your voice
when you were on-stage singing,

497
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,197
because he wanted you
to sing for him?

498
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,669
Oh, that is so romantic.

499
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,559
And humiliating.
Yeah, I see your point.

500
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,593
Okay, I'll go deal with him.
But you owe me one.

501
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,511
Hey, Phoebe. Is Paige here?

502
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,114
Paige isn't home.

503
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,071
I saw her car in the driveway.

504
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,631
Can you repeat that? Just slowly.

505
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,753
Yeah. I said, I saw her car
in the driveway.

506
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,837
Oh, yeah, her car.

507
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,958
See, what I meant to say
is that she just can't talk right now.

508
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,109
Right. Yeah, that's my fault.
I tried to show her off at the club.

509
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,998
I mean, she's got
such a good singing voice,

510
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,913
and I thought maybe I could help
her get over her fear, you know...

511
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,150
Why are you looking at my mouth?

512
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,634
I got something in my teeth?

513
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,552
Okay, look...

514
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,955
...I got a little swimmer's ear
going on.

515
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,351
Yeah, I fell asleep
in the tub last night.

516
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,312
So I'm not really getting a lot of this.

517
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,759
But I did get the part about your teeth,
and they're very nice, white.

518
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,678
I just want to say I'm sorry. If I could
just speak to her for a second,

519
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,798
- maybe I could clear this up.
- Not a word. Not a word.

520
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,557
I'll tell her you came by,
and I'll have her call you, okay?

521
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,871
- All right.
- Goodbye, Nate.

522
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,719
Okay, I would pretty much
do anything for my sisters,

523
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,634
but making me do that
was plain mean, Paige.

524
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,236
Don't try to change the subject,
Paige. Here's your flowers from Nate.

525
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,437
And personally, if you ask me,
I think that Nate deserves more.

526
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,828
Hey, did you ever think

527
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,594
that maybe your Kazi buddy here
can't read?

528
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,073
- I tried to tell her that.
- He did?

529
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,559
Yeah, but not about literacy.

530
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,109
Kazi warriors are base-level demons.

531
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,191
Where's our whitelighter?

532
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,396
I don't know.

533
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,392
Yeah, I know, we'll see.

534
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,471
Who sent you?

535
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,671
Wait, wait! Hold on a minute.
Please, I'll tell you.

536
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,273
- It was the Crone.
- The Crone?

537
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,271
- The Crone sent you?
- Yeah.

538
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,472
<i>Check the Book, see what
you can find out about the Crone.</i>

539
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,279
What does the Crone want with us?

540
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,798
If I tell you that, she'll kill me.

541
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,272
My warrior's suffering.

542
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,759
I can feel his pain.

543
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,073
- He needs my help.
- He needs a muzzle.

544
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,197
He just gave them my name.

545
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,875
If he tells the Charmed Ones
my plan,

546
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,190
I'll never get my hands on that baby.

547
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,394
He wouldn't have a chance
to tell them anything

548
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,670
if we would just attack.

549
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,991
They're torturing him again.

550
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,756
Very well. I'll spare your warrior
any more suffering.

551
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,197
Along with you.

552
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,916
Okay, I didn't do that.

553
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,114
Someone else did that.
I did not do that.

554
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,679
<i>Did you find anything in the Book?</i>

555
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,236
Yeah, the Crone,
that's what I was afraid of.

556
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,789
Is there a vanquishing potion
for her?

557
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,028
Good. Okay, let's hit the kitchen,
we gotta be prepared for anything.

558
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,392
She's okay. She's with Wyatt. His
force field will protect her. Come on.

559
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,078
Who's there?

560
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,076
Leo found the monkey totem,
and I got my voice back.

561
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,391
- Oh, my God, where is he?
- In the kitchen with Phoebe.

562
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,472
They're working on a potion
to vanquish the Kazi king.

563
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,359
Don't worry, I'll take care of Wyatt.

564
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,272
Okay.

565
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,839
Okay.

566
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,473
Be right back.

567
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,959
What's that smell?

568
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,031
It's like charcoal.

569
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,829
Burnt Kazi flesh.
We just vanquished his warrior.

570
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,514
Oh, that must be it.

571
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,270
There, there now, Wyatt.

572
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,271
Don't be afraid.

573
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,396
I just wanna hold you.

574
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,355
<i>Hush, little baby
Don't say a word</i>

575
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,796
<i>Mama's gonna buy you
A mockingbird</i>

576
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,792
Okay, let's go people,
Mama wants to see again.

577
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,953
Piper! We think that the Crone
is behind this!

578
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,759
So we're making a vanquishing potion
so we can get her!

579
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,229
Phoebe, I am blind, not deaf.

580
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,278
And Paige said we were going after
the Kazi king.

581
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,919
What did she say?

582
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,196
Leo, is that you?

583
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,272
Paige? But you're supposed
to be watching Wyatt,

584
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,550
and you said Leo had come back.

585
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,552
Oh, my God.

586
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,952
<i>Mama's gonna buy you
A diamond ring</i>

587
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,998
That's my sweet boy.

588
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,037
You're safe now.

589
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,633
Hands off, hag!

590
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,678
Wyatt, help, we're in danger.

591
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,669
- What's going on?
- His force field is protecting her.

592
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,271
If you hurt him, I will kill you!

593
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,633
What is she doing to him?

594
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,792
Paige, can you orb him to you?

595
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,792
<i>Wyatt.</i>

596
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,598
- She can't.
- I know.

597
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,069
- Should we...?
- I don't know, try it.

598
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,878
- Wyatt.
- Wyatt.

599
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,751
I've seen everything.

600
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,196
Such power.

601
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,033
Such power.

602
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,918
You want to see real power, lady?

603
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,554
I can see. I can see. Hi.

604
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,758
I can hear. Paige?

605
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,952
Can I just say...

606
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,189
What?

607
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,673
Anything.

608
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,796
Damn, it's good to hear me speak.

609
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,235
- Okay, so we're all good.
- What about Leo?

610
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,197
Oh, no, did I kill the hag too soon?

611
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,630
Oh, if she hurt him, you know,
I'm gonna have to revive her

612
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,711
- and kill her again.
- Hurry, see if you can

613
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,950
get a premonition
off the smudge mark.

614
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,791
It's okay, honey, we'll find Daddy.
You know, sooner or later.

615
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,193
What just happened?
How did she...?

616
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,510
Because my nephew is a genius.

617
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,636
Takes after me.

618
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,598
Oh, God.

619
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,034
- Are you okay?
- The Crone.

620
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,189
Dead.

621
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,799
And you can see?

622
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,997
Yeah. It was strange.
Like, when it mattered most,

623
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,077
we could almost
read each other's minds.

624
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,676
Yeah, it's always been there.

625
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,592
We never noticed before.

626
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,275
Well, maybe not consciously,

627
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,238
but it's always been part of what's
made the power of three so strong.

628
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,879
Sorry I couldn't get here sooner.

629
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,710
It was awful, I couldn't orb.

630
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,871
But guess who could?

631
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,359
Apparently,
he sensed his Daddy in need.

632
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,830
- He sensed me, and he orbed?
- Yeah, he's coming into his powers

633
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,877
really, really fast.

634
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,393
You nervous?

635
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,312
A little. You know, a lot.

636
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,756
Well, he's gonna be fine.

637
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,871
- We all are.
- I know.

638
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,277
Not going so good?

639
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,113
- National syndication's a big deal.
- Yeah, that's what Jason said

640
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,713
when he told me.

641
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,515
And Elise and all the other reporters.

642
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,557
And I was so busy listening
to all of them

643
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,553
that I didn't ask myself
what I wanted.

644
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,280
Which would be what?

645
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,873
To spend time with my family.

646
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,508
Yay! Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

647
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,392
To ride rides with my nephew

648
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,949
and to not be one of those annoying
cell-phone people

649
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,519
that the mimes make fun of.

650
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,517
So, what are you gonna tell Jason?

651
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,674
I'm gonna tell him exactly
what I just told you.

652
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,351
And as my boss,
he's not gonna like it.

653
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,431
But as my boyfriend,

654
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,194
there are ways
of bringing him around.

655
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,679
We do have ways.

656
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,753
I was supposed to sing a song
for Bobby Maynard,

657
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,388
but he didn't inspire me much.

658
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,073
So, Nate Parks...

659
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,876
...this one's for you.

660
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,276
<i>Never know how much I love you</i>

661
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,519
<i>Never know how much I care</i>

662
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,038
<i>When you put your arms around me</i>

663
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,313
<i>I get a Fever that's so hard to bear</i>

664
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,994
<i>You give me Fever</i>

665
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,912
<i>When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight</i>

666
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,358
<i>Fever</i>

667
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,917
<i>In the morning</i>

668
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,229
<i>And Fever all through the night</i>

669
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,433
<i>Now you've listened to my story</i>

670
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,029
<i>Here's the point that I have made</i>

671
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,033
<i>Fever</i>

672
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,030
<i>Till you sizzle</i>

673
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,229
<i>What a lovely way to burn</i>

674
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,434
<i>What a lovely way to burn</i>

675
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,396
<i>What a lovely way to burn</i>

676
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:09,157
<i>What a lovely way to burn</i>
