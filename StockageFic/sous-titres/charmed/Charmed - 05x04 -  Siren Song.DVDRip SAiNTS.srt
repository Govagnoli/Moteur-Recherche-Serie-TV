1
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,135
Ladies, my name is Cole Turner.

2
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,736
I won't hurt you.

3
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,738
It's too late for that,
don't you think?

4
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,366
Phoebe, I'm telling you,
I'm not evil anymore.

5
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:38,121
I come to you, a man.
Nothing more, nothing less.

6
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,416
Vanquish this evil
From time and space

7
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,991
- Don't stop.
- But it's time.

8
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,244
Can't you feel it?
Your wife is almost here.

9
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,038
My wife, Melissa.

10
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,583
Yes, didn't I mention?

11
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,044
I always like to let the wives
watch their men die.

12
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,046
David?

13
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,339
Now.

14
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,607
Oh, your husband was so much fun.

15
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:50,152
It's time to snap out of it
and feel the pain.

16
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,952
- David?
- Oh, he can't hear you.

17
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,622
- Not anymore.
- Oh, God!

18
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:07,211
You see, I was burned for my sins.

19
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,379
Only fair you should burn too.

20
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,679
Death did us part, Cole.

21
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,765
Just because you figured
out a way to come back,

22
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,184
doesn't mean that I didn't keep
my end of the bargain.

23
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,269
Come on, Phoebe, a quickie divorce?
Don't...

24
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,855
I thought since we weren't
gonna ride off into the sunset...

25
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,316
You want sunset, I can have us
on horseback in 5 seconds.

26
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,903
What, are you gonna steal a horse
from one of those Apocalypse guys?

27
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,282
Haven't I proven to you
that I am not evil anymore?

28
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,451
Cole, we've been through this, okay?

29
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,079
Your powers are evil,
your blood is acidic,

30
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:45,290
and everything that you are, you stole
from the demonic wasteland!

31
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,751
This morning, my firm
agreed to pro bono work.

32
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,253
You can't say that's evil.

33
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,258
If you used demonic mind control to
convince your firm to do it, then, yeah.

34
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,636
I used my powers to vanquish three
demons this week, what about that?

35
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,972
Cole, it doesn't matter
who you're helping.

36
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,016
If you're using your evil powers,
then it doesn't count, okay?

37
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,519
And I would think that after everything
we've been through,

38
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,728
you'd understand this.

39
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,189
- Traffic delayed the fire trucks' arrival.
- Hello?

40
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,316
And neighbours fear some
residents may be trapped.

41
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,110
Cole, are you listening to me?

42
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,320
- Hello?
- The flames are so intense,

43
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,115
fire-fighters have been unable
to get inside to help.

44
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,492
- Cole?
- We're gonna stay with this story.

45
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,785
Cole?

46
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,288
If you're just joining us,
a fire is raging out of control...

47
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,166
- People are trapped in there?
- I don't know. Hey!

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,836
Breaking news. A man has just
emerged from the burning building.

49
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,254
- Unbel...
- He saved that woman!

50
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,463
He saved her.

51
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,310
Paige?

52
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,609
- Paige?
- Yeah, just a second.

53
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,158
Are you trying to kill us?

54
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,744
No, I'm trying to get
a little attention around here.

55
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,414
Which, these days, seems
to require a small explosion.

56
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,500
Well, excuse me for trying to focus.

57
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,586
Focus? Paige, ever since
you quit your job,

58
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,880
you've been on some weird
witchcraft mission.

59
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,631
Now, I miss my sister,

60
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:44,720
and I cannot stand the constant
reek of your potions.

61
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,555
Well, since when
do your nasal passages

62
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,223
take precedence over my potions?

63
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,686
Since I got pregnant and my senses
went into overdrive.

64
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,980
But that's all right, you know.
You've been busy.

65
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,815
Maybe you haven't noticed.

66
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,693
Look, I gave up a promising career
so I could focus on the craft.

67
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,862
And no offence, Piper,
I still got a lot to learn,

68
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,364
which means I can't just sit
around the house chitchatting.

69
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,241
Paige, I don't wanna chat.

70
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,701
I got problems here.

71
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,913
Jeez, you're like my husband
with boobs.

72
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,419
What the hell was that?

73
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,380
That was the latest
in a series of wacky tricks

74
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,008
my growing baby
is playing on my body.

75
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,801
You know, because
the constant nausea

76
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,846
and the torturous breast pain
was not enough.

77
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,265
But the orbs, is that normal?

78
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,892
This is what I'd like to know.

79
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,269
You're half whitelighter like the baby,
did you ever...?

80
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,438
Burp white light? No.

81
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,190
What else is happening to you?

82
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,150
What's happening is,
I think my baby

83
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,694
is trying to turn me
into some kind of pacifist.

84
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,323
What does Leo say about this?

85
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,995
Well, mostly Leo says,
"Sorry, honey, I gotta go."

86
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,623
Earlier today, south of Market,

87
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,125
a storage building burned
to the ground in what...

88
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,335
Oh, good, you're home.

89
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:01,046
You would not believe
what's happening with my...

90
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,464
Did you see this?

91
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,217
- You came home to watch TV?
- No, look.

92
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,887
Is that Cole?

93
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,097
Oh, my God.

94
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:13,725
I can't believe he's doing "look at me,
I'm a good guy" routine on prime time.

95
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,978
- Phoebe must be thrilled.
- She should be.

96
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,314
The Elders said the woman he saved,
Melissa, is a future whitelighter.

97
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,899
And if he hadn't saved her,

98
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,777
she would never get do the good
that will earn her her wings.

99
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,529
Well, speaking of whitelighters,

100
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,990
I dreamt an animated musical
last night.

101
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,367
- Is that normal?
- Normal?

102
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,287
Yeah, in case you haven't noticed,
which I know you haven't,

103
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,623
my body, my thoughts, my dreams,
have all gone wonky.

104
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,834
Well, I'm sure it's just normal
pregnancy stuff.

105
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,044
I mean, we can talk about
this later if you want to.

106
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,380
Oh, I think you should
talk about it now.

107
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,465
Well, I think this attack
on Melissa was demonic,

108
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,093
and the Elders want me
to watch after her until she's safe.

109
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,220
Fine. Go.

110
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,222
Not the crying thing.

111
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,185
Leo, I have growing
powers inside of me,

112
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,728
powers that I do not understand.

113
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,688
And the only person who does
understand them

114
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,440
never has time to talk.

115
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,400
Add that to raging hormones,

116
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:07,404
and I guarantee you I am absolutely
entitled to do the crying thing.

117
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,410
Okay, is that normal?

118
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:17,372
I am sure that it's just all this arguing
that's got the baby upset.

119
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,957
Leo, the baby is an inch long.

120
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,293
All this arguing
is upsetting the mommy.

121
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,004
Okay, honey, look, I'm sure that
it's nothing to worry about.

122
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,798
Right now I need to watch
after Melissa,

123
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:30,469
and you need to figure out
who's after her.

124
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,263
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,858
You want me to orb
his butt back here for you?

126
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,237
No, he's right.
Innocents come first.

127
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:53,659
Besides, the smell of his aftershave
was making me want to vomit a little.

128
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,118
Where are you going?

129
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,370
To Darryl.

130
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:00,165
To see if the police found anything
at the crime scene that might help.

131
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,252
Okay, not to sound too simplistic,
but if she's a whitelighter-to-be,

132
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,462
doesn't that mean
that we're after a darklighter?

133
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:10,050
No, darklighters use poison arrows.
They don't usually set fires.

134
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,885
Why would a demon
want to kill her anyway?

135
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,054
I don't know,
but the sooner we find out,

136
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:18,267
the sooner I'll probably be able to finish
a conversation with my husband.

137
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,482
I'm not here. Go away.

138
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,819
If it isn't the little wife.

139
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,990
Actually it's not. My marriage is over.
All except for the paperwork.

140
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,950
Don't let your readers
hear you say that.

141
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:38,036
Who wants to take advice from the
woman who's divorcing Superman?

142
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,496
Elise, he's no hero.

143
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,791
And if you're here to make me give
an interview, that's exactly what I'll say.

144
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,503
Which is why you will be getting
the interview instead.

145
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,422
Excuse me?

146
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,091
- No, I'm not a reporter.
- No, but you're the wife.

147
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,344
It's called human interest.

148
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,973
Call your husband
and get an exclusive with him.

149
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,975
Consider this a personal favour.

150
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,978
By "favour," I mean order.

151
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,442
Elise.

152
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,361
Woman to woman, okay?

153
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,656
Cole was the love of my life.

154
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,659
And I'm finally learning
to live my life without him.

155
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,497
Now, calling him for a favour would
be opening up a can of worms

156
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,124
that I have worked so hard to close.

157
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,459
Woman to woman,

158
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,045
if you're still describing this guy
as the love of your life,

159
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,838
then the can is open,
the worms are out,

160
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,841
and you may as well
use them to go fishing.

161
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,311
Shouldn't you be home
with your wife?

162
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,563
Probably.

163
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,154
Rough day?

164
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,990
Rough month.

165
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:01,161
You know what might make
you feel better?

166
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,747
A little music.

167
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,007
Earlier today,

168
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,219
a local man rescued a woman from
a burning building south of Market.

169
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,805
The five-alarm fire
is now completely extinguished.

170
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,766
- What?
- No word yet on what caused the fire,

171
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,060
and police are waiting
to talk to the victim,

172
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:28,438
who has been taken to San Francisco
Memorial in critical condition.

173
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,691
- She's alive?
- Doctors have hopes for her recovery.

174
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,693
- I'm sorry, what?
- And her rescuer is...

175
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,238
You have no idea how lucky
you just got.

176
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,924
All right, let's get this
over with, shall we?

177
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,930
What was going through your mind
while you were in the fire?

178
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:07,186
Well, mostly I was hoping that
one of the powers I picked up

179
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,938
from the demonic wasteland
would protect me from the flames.

180
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:13,275
You know what? Let's just forget it.
Let's just forget this whole thing.

181
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,777
No, no, no. No, I'm sorry.

182
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,864
I'll rein it in.

183
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:22,201
All right, what was going through
your mind when you were in the fire?

184
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:28,248
I was thinking,
"I hope I make it out of this.

185
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,667
I'd hate to never see my wife again."

186
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,669
- Cole.
- I'm serious.

187
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,713
All day, everything I do,
I'm thinking of you.

188
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,049
Okay, do you think this
is some kind of game?

189
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,676
Do you have any idea how
disturbing it was for me

190
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,803
to watch you walk
through a wall of fire?

191
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,681
Well, I saved a woman's life.
How is that disturbing?

192
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:49,561
Well, because you have more powers
than any demon I have ever met.

193
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:53,065
And the city may think that
you're just this brave guy,

194
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:57,027
but I know the truth, okay,
and it's freaking scary.

195
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,614
I will not use my powers
for anything but good.

196
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:04,243
I know you believe that.
And I know you want it to be true.

197
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,246
But, Cole, it's just a matter of time...

198
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,957
You're wrong.

199
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,128
Cole, evil is inside of you.

200
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,800
It's who you are. And no amount
of good deeds will ever change that.

201
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,218
You're wrong.

202
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,971
And if I have to hunt down and kill
every demon in San Francisco

203
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,139
to prove it to you,
then that's what I'm gonna do.

204
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,891
Cole.

205
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,811
What about the interview?

206
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,939
You know me so well, make it up.

207
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,656
- Paige?
- In the attic.

208
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:46,743
Okay, so the good news is,
it's not a darklighter...

209
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,163
That's what I've been telling her.

210
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,084
- Shut up!
- I told you, I don't know anything!

211
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,672
Paige, what are you doing?

212
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,592
Relax, Piper.
I summoned him into a trap

213
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,845
so he could tell me which of his
lovely friends is trying to kill Melissa.

214
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,638
I'm sorry, did you say relax?

215
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:10,767
You brought a darklighter into
our home, and you want me to relax?

216
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,478
Don't worry, the Book of Shadows
is safe, it's downstairs.

217
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,897
I'm not worried about the Book.

218
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,317
Paige, you have whitelighter genes,
which means this guy could kill you,

219
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,986
not to mention my husband
and my unborn child!

220
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,906
Please, it's not like he's
in a power position or anything.

221
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,495
Okay, I was wrong.
Blow him up!

222
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,959
What the hell?

223
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,296
Crossbow!

224
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:52,893
See, this is why we do not summon
darklighters to the house!

225
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,562
Noted. Now, what the hell
is going on with your powers, lady?

226
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,440
I don't know.
I think my half-whitelighter baby

227
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,485
thought that fireworks would
be prettier than demon guts.

228
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,779
Okay, you need to teach
your also half-witch baby

229
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,198
the joys of maiming
and killing demons.

230
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,741
Get that thing away from me.

231
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,369
Leo!

232
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,120
What, are you gonna
tell on me now?

233
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,997
No. We need help.

234
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,376
Especially if my baby's gonna
be messing with my powers.

235
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:20,212
Look, Melissa's husband's lungs
were incinerated

236
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:21,880
before the apartment burned.

237
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,090
Leo!

238
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:26,134
And Darryl said three other men
died the same way recently.

239
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,720
So the fact that Melissa is
a future whitelighter

240
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,473
might be just a coincidence.

241
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,476
For God's sakes, Leo!

242
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,820
- Hello?
- Yeah, what's up?

243
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,238
What's up?

244
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,031
Now you don't even
come home when I call?

245
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,450
Well, I haven't had a chance
to get in and heal Melissa.

246
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,829
She's in really bad shape, but I think
the doctors are about to come out.

247
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,081
Yeah, okay, well, we're in pretty
bad shape here too.

248
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:59,126
- We've had some demon to deal with.
- Sir, that phone is for staff only.

249
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:00,502
Okay, just one second.

250
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,337
Now's my chance.
I have to go.

251
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,756
No, you don't understand.
My powers are on the fritz,

252
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,342
and I have no idea how to con...

253
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,012
- trol them.

254
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,473
Hey!

255
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:31,783
Maybe he got disconnected.

256
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,703
Oh, no, he hung up on me.

257
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,706
Okay, vanquish demon first,
kill husband later.

258
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,292
Let's just get to the Book...

259
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,711
Leo.

260
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,671
What?

261
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,050
It's so beautiful.

262
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,260
What is?

263
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,222
Hello? Anybody home?

264
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,140
Leo.

265
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,898
Hey!

266
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,864
Orb her out, Leo!

267
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,534
Kiss this, bitch.

268
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,331
Oh, bad baby.

269
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:38,016
I hit her with flowers?

270
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,727
You're welcome.

271
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,325
- At least that power still works.
- Are you all right? What happened?

272
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:59,371
Before or after you were
making out with the demon?

273
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,207
Well, I'll just go get the Book.

274
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,460
- Honey...
- No, don't you "honey" me.

275
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,297
Leo, our pacifist offspring

276
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,633
just turned my best offensive power
into flowers.

277
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,719
Which got me blown out a window.

278
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,472
Are you all right?
Did she heal you?

279
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:18,724
Oh, is that what you think?

280
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,852
Because I'm self-healing now,
that you don't need to be around?

281
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,729
No, I don't think that at all.

282
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:27,024
Look, let's just focus on what's
going on with your powers.

283
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:30,360
No, I am sick and tired of focusing
on everything but us!

284
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,946
I feel like I'm going through
this whole pregnancy by myself,

285
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,198
and I do not like it!

286
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,116
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I have a job.

287
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,868
Yeah, you have a wife too.

288
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,246
I think I found the demon.

289
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:44,041
- Am I interrupting something?
- Yes.

290
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,334
What does the Book say?

291
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,504
Well, "As a mortal, the Siren fell
in love with a married man,

292
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,048
but when they were caught,
the man was held blameless."

293
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:52,549
Typical.

294
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,552
"The village women cheered
as they burned her to death,

295
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,721
and her rage turned her into a siren,

296
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:01,099
a vengeful demon who seduces
married men with her song,

297
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:04,311
then destroys the couple with
the very flames that consumed her."

298
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,812
Lovely.

299
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,106
Nothing we can't handle
with a good potion.

300
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,733
You sure?
You didn't feel her power.

301
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,028
Looked to me like you felt
a little bit more than her power.

302
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,738
Yeah, right, like I really wanted to.

303
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,907
- Well, if you were home instead...
- What?

304
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:19,993
What am I supposed to do?
Abandon my charges, clip my wings?

305
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,581
I expect you to care and notice
and ask what's going on with me.

306
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:28,377
I expect you to make me a priority and
not just when demons are involved.

307
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:31,296
- Piper, Leo.
- Look, it's not like I'm out golfing

308
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,048
or screwing around, you know.

309
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,592
I'm working,
and my work is very important.

310
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,345
- I'm not saying that it isn't.
- Then what are you saying?

311
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:41,265
- You guys?
- Forget it, you don't understand.

312
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,225
I don't understand?
You don't understand.

313
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:46,645
Well, I understand that your charges
are more important than your family.

314
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,939
You have no idea what
I go through every day.

315
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:52,359
Yeah, well you have no clue
what I go through every day.

316
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,030
That can't have been good.

317
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:58,949
What happened?

318
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,494
Well, I tried to tell you guys.
Orbs were swirling and...

319
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,748
Where...? Where am I?

320
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,750
Freeze her again.

321
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,548
What just happened here?

322
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,719
- Melissa, wait!
- Oh, my gosh!

323
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,388
Hey, that's my power.

324
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,564
Okay, why do I have the feeling
my day is about to get worse?

325
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,323
Hold on.

326
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,909
Almost there.

327
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,751
Was it the Charmed Ones?

328
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,506
Smells that way.

329
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:58,258
There were only two?

330
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,553
Lucky you didn't meet all three.

331
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,848
You wouldn't have had the luxury
of calling me for healing.

332
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,728
You should leave
before the witches find you.

333
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:13,106
I want them to find me.

334
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:16,193
Save me from having
to sing for their husbands.

335
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:21,615
So eager for vengeance.

336
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:24,201
You foolish girl!

337
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:27,746
You barely got away the first time.

338
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:33,168
I wasn't ready for them.
This time I will be.

339
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,464
But how can you hope to fight
such powerful witches?

340
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:40,050
They may be powerful,

341
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:45,597
but they are no different than any
other woman when it comes to love.

342
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,815
I need to go after Melissa.

343
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,775
And what, blow her up?

344
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:59,945
Damn it. Look, give Daddy
his powers back now.

345
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,363
Don't blame my niece.

346
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,658
She magically swapped your powers
because you were not communicating.

347
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,201
We were communicating.

348
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,120
We were just communicating loudly.

349
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:11,874
Well, think what you want.
I think my niece is a genius.

350
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,835
She did exactly what any good
marriage counsellor would have done.

351
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,421
A good marriage counsellor
would have swapped our powers?

352
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:20,632
No, she would have made you walk
a mile in each other's shoes.

353
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,093
Abracadabra!

354
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:29,433
- Nice job.
- You did all that with "abracadabra"?

355
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,685
No, I used a spell.

356
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:34,354
I just always wanted to say that.

357
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,523
Come on, we need to go make
the Siren's potion

358
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,442
before she starts singing again.

359
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,986
Shouldn't we concentrate
on swapping our powers back?

360
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:43,113
Come on, now, Leo.
You know how that works.

361
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,073
You two are only gonna
get your powers back

362
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,159
once you've learned your lessons.

363
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,454
I hate that.
It's just so very "after-school special."

364
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:02,758
Okay, what's with all the chatter
in my head?

365
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:06,637
It's probably one of my charges.
Does anyone sound panicked?

366
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,305
How do you differentiate?

367
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,517
Wait, do you hear these
voices all the time?

368
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,978
- Pretty much.
- Can we just focus on the Siren?

369
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:18,815
Power swap or not, if she came after
you once, you're still vulnerable.

370
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,193
Hey, you're still married too.
She might come after you.

371
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,653
Yeah, technically.

372
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:26,949
Besides, if she's stupid enough to go
after Cole, it'll be her swan song.

373
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:31,578
Knocking.
Okay, I'm hearing knocking sounds.

374
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:33,539
Yeah, honey, we all are.

375
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,292
- Cole!
- What?

376
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:40,337
- I knocked.
- Doors, people use doors.

377
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:44,299
No time. I came to warn you,
there's a siren in town.

378
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,302
- I think she might be the one who...
- Set the fire? Yeah, we got that.

379
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,015
- What was that?
- Hey, how did you do that?

380
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,059
I don't know,
but I'm feeling really nauseous.

381
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,937
Oh, God. And I'm not.

382
00:23:57,104 --> 00:24:00,649
Wait, how...? Why...? Why does
he have my pregnancy symptoms?

383
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:02,484
Wait, wait, what? You're pregnant?

384
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,444
Well, I was, but now I think Leo is.

385
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,030
No. No, no, no.

386
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:10,367
Relax, you guys. Leo blew the door up,
he didn't cover it with flowers,

387
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,911
which means clearly
you're still pregnant.

388
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,414
Then why...?

389
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:18,000
Because magic has
a sick sense of humour.

390
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:20,419
- Just enjoy it.
- Are your boobs always this sore?

391
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:23,547
I'm a little confused.

392
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:27,384
Cole, maybe you should leave.

393
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:31,889
Phoebe, this siren is dangerous.

394
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:37,227
And since your powers are obviously
a little off, maybe I could help.

395
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,520
We don't need your help.

396
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:41,023
We got enough demons
to deal with around here.

397
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,155
Fine.

398
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:51,033
I'll find her and vanquish her myself.

399
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,246
He's trying so hard to be good.
Maybe...

400
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,791
Phoebe, we've been down
this road before.

401
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:02,628
Panic! Somebody's panicking!

402
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:04,421
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

403
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:07,382
It's close. I think it might be Melissa.

404
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,468
- Is the Siren after her?
- No.

405
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:11,970
She seems more overwhelmed
than scared.

406
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,805
Yeah, everything
that she's been through.

407
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,475
- I have to go to her.
- You're not going anywhere.

408
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,769
- She's going.
- Me? Why?

409
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:22,105
Because you have Leo's powers now.
That means you're the whitelighter.

410
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,733
No, no, no. But that doesn't mean
I know what to do.

411
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,777
I think that's the point.

412
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:29,071
Walk a mile in each other's shoes.

413
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:33,325
You have to hurry.
Paige will show you how to orb.

414
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:35,160
I have to stay here
and make the potion.

415
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,371
- I'll do it.
- Come on, come on.

416
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,249
- She's giving me a migraine.
- But...

417
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:49,216
So are you ready to kick
some demon ass, sis?

418
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,557
Okay, we're here. Now what?

419
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,934
I don't know.
I mean, she's afraid of us.

420
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:01,061
I don't wanna make her more upset.

421
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:04,565
Let's just cast a spell to help her deal
with what she's been through today.

422
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:08,819
Call me crazy, but somehow I don't
think witchcraft is the solution here.

423
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,737
Well, I'm out of ideas.

424
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:14,283
You know, Paige,
there is another part of you.

425
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,702
Your first father was half whitelighter.

426
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:19,663
Yeah, he also had blue eyes.
Doesn't mean that I do.

427
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:24,209
Who are you?
Why won't you leave me alone?

428
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,378
Melissa, we're just trying to help you.

429
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,922
- And get you some clothes...
- Get away from me!

430
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,633
Just leave me alone!

431
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:36,638
Another charge is in trouble.

432
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:38,140
Oh, big trouble.

433
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:39,683
You go after her. I've gotta go.

434
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,811
What? No, you can't expect me to...

435
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:47,357
I'm not a whitelighter, I'm a witch.

436
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:54,781
What?

437
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,539
Was that French?

438
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,131
Nice shot.

439
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,967
I was aiming for the plant.

440
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,762
These powers are useless.
They're completely out of control.

441
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,932
Well, that's because you're a little
out of control. You just need to relax.

442
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:23,143
Relax? I'm sore all over,
I'm without my powers,

443
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,270
and I'm about to have
to fight a demon!

444
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,981
My own aftershave
is making me sick.

445
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:29,608
How does Piper do this?

446
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:32,528
Well, she, too, sometimes
gets a little cranky.

447
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:33,820
The Elders are gonna kill me.

448
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,698
If anything happens to my charges,
they're gonna clip my wings and...

449
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,202
Oh, this is ridiculous.

450
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,745
Piper!

451
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:43,997
Piper!

452
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,794
Why do they call it morning sickness
if it lasts all day?

453
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:51,588
What the hell?

454
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,757
- A rooster?
- Long story.

455
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,344
Since when do you speak French?

456
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:59,471
Whitelighters speak
whatever language,

457
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:01,598
their charges are speaking in.

458
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,601
We've been together four years,
and I don't know this?

459
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:06,270
- Well...
- Hey, where's Paige?

460
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:09,106
- Because this potion's almost ready.
- She is with Melissa.

461
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:11,191
And she's not real happy
about it either.

462
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,861
- Help me, Leo.
- I gotta go. Somebody's calling.

463
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,238
Okay, Piper, wait.
I need help with your powers.

464
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,532
And with your nausea.

465
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,618
Well, honey, I'm sorry,
but somebody is really in trouble.

466
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,370
But I'm really in trouble.

467
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:25,080
Try saltines.

468
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:30,961
Okay, here are your crackers.

469
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:34,173
Here's a pad and a pen.
We need a summoning spell.

470
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,175
Now I'm supposed to rhyme?

471
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,260
Yeah, no rest for the whiny.

472
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:40,888
The potion won't work on the Siren
unless we can find her.

473
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,931
Do it.

474
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,438
Where is the Siren?

475
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:04,411
I'm sure you two
will want to be alone.

476
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:27,726
Patience.

477
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:31,980
Right now I need to sing
for your witch.

478
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:41,573
Hey, let's hear the spell, Leo.
We got a siren to vanquish.

479
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:50,749
O singing lady of the dusk

480
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:54,211
Who preys on men
Turns love to lust

481
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:57,214
- We hearken ye...
- "We hearken ye"?

482
00:29:57,381 --> 00:30:00,551
What, are we trying to summon
a leprechaun here?

483
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:02,845
I told you I wasn't very good at this.

484
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:06,306
Give me that. It's okay, honey.
We'll just rewrite that last line.

485
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:11,436
- What's going on? Is it all over?
- No, you're just in time.

486
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:14,523
We have a potion, a barricade,
we almost have a summoning spell.

487
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,400
Well, okay, let's get to it.

488
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:18,151
Wait, where's Melissa?

489
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:21,280
Melissa.

490
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:22,865
Well, she got herself arrested.

491
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:25,159
I know, I know.
I was trying to talk to her,

492
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:26,910
and then I was just
running after her,

493
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,621
and she kept running, and she
ran into the middle of the street,

494
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,957
and she caused a big,
giant traffic accident.

495
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:36,461
- Paige!
- Well, you know, she'll be safe now.

496
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,172
In jail.

497
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,299
Paige, you were supposed
to be taking care of her.

498
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:42,885
Look, don't you get it?

499
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,428
This could be the final straw,

500
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:47,681
the beginning of a downward spiral
from which she may never recover.

501
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:53,812
I'm sorry, I...

502
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:05,866
I don't know what's wrong with me.

503
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,494
Dude, it's the crying thing.

504
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,079
- It's the hormones.
- Really?

505
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,040
I just thought that was an excuse.

506
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,833
Welcome to our world.

507
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:19,421
What happened to Melissa?

508
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,048
Word travels fast.

509
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:22,633
I feel like she's in trouble,

510
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,719
but I'm getting so many
damn signals, I can't find her.

511
00:31:25,928 --> 00:31:28,847
Wasn't she supposed to be the one
charge I didn't have to worry about?

512
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:31,850
- Cole.
- I'm sorry, Piper, I tried.

513
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:34,728
Yeah, well, while you were trying,
I evaded assassins,

514
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:38,106
I prevented two crimes of passion,
in Portuguese no less,

515
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:39,733
and delivered a baby.

516
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:43,612
I think the least that I could ask for
in return is a little help from my family.

517
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:46,657
Well, I told you I wasn't any good
at this whitelighter thing.

518
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:48,992
But it's in you.
It's half of who you are.

519
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:50,494
Obviously the latent half.

520
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:51,745
No, Paige,

521
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:54,790
it's the half that made you become
a social worker in the first place.

522
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:58,502
But it's like when you quit your job,
you quit half your personality.

523
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:02,589
My job is being a full-time witch,
and I intend to be good at it.

524
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:05,342
I don't think there's a problem
with me concentrating on magic.

525
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:08,178
There is when you're in such a hurry
to get back here for a vanquish

526
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:10,180
that you leave an innocent
alone and in pain.

527
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,517
Paige, it's our compassion,
not our powers,

528
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:16,061
that separates us
from the bad guys.

529
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:18,438
It's the part of you
you can never afford to lose.

530
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:21,108
And it's that part of you
that Melissa needs now.

531
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:24,945
I guess I'd better
get back to her, huh?

532
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:33,495
You know, you're a pretty
good whitelighter.

533
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:37,958
Well, I learned from the best.

534
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:58,020
How did you get them
to let you in here?

535
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:00,939
I have a friend who's a police officer.

536
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:02,983
And he knows I'm not
here to hurt you.

537
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:06,862
Look, I know you don't know me.

538
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:09,698
And after everything
you've been through today,

539
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:11,617
I know you have no reason
to trust me.

540
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,827
Who are you?

541
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:15,913
What are you?
What do you want from me?

542
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:21,043
My name is Paige Matthews.

543
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:26,298
And I'm a witch
and a sort of part-guardian angel.

544
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:31,136
I know it's a lot to process
and really hard to believe,

545
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:34,431
but I really do just wanna help you.

546
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:38,560
I feel like I'm going crazy.

547
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:44,525
Yeah, I think after what you've been
through today, anybody would.

548
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:50,697
My friend, he's working
on getting you out of here.

549
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:54,368
I don't care.

550
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,954
I don't care if I ever get out of here.

551
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:03,710
Melissa.

552
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:10,008
I'm so sorry about your husband.

553
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:15,597
I just can't believe that he's gone.

554
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:18,976
Yeah.

555
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:28,819
Phoebe's not anywhere.

556
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:30,904
What if Phoebe
underestimated the Siren?

557
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,365
What if the Siren
has Phoebe and Cole?

558
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:35,242
- Can you sense her?
- I've been trying.

559
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,952
But there's all this chaos
in my brain.

560
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,956
I keep hearing voices, and there's all
this pain, and I can't isolate anything.

561
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:43,375
I know it's hard, but you have to try.
Breathe.

562
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:47,004
Concentrate.

563
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:51,466
Screw that.
Let's just cut to the chase.

564
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:56,263
Phoebe?

565
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,348
Cole's place?
Did you sense her here?

566
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:03,187
No, I just decided to rely on some
good old-fashioned common sense.

567
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:05,063
- Phoebe?
- Okay, well, that's not working.

568
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,442
And we can't orb all over town trying
to find her. You have to sense her.

569
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:12,279
- Well, I can't.
- Piper, you have to.

570
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:37,846
She's almost here.

571
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,849
It's too bad.

572
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,477
I was actually having fun with you.

573
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:01,036
Cole.

574
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,122
He was cute,

575
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,625
but this is still my favourite part.

576
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:18,095
Nobody hurts me and gets
away with it, you little witch.

577
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:20,013
Wanna bet?

578
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:27,020
You're alive?

579
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:29,523
That's not possible.

580
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:32,234
Cole, that was
the vanquishing potion.

581
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:34,444
I know.

582
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:39,116
I want her for myself.

583
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:47,207
Do me a favour, make it hurt.

584
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:07,060
Piper, you have to focus.

585
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:11,106
Take a deep breath

586
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,445
and imagine white lights flowing
around you, flowing through you.

587
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,740
If I breathe any more,
I'm gonna pass out.

588
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:21,617
Damn it, Piper.

589
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:27,372
I hear those voices.
I feel that pain all the time.

590
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:30,626
How do you think I do it?
How do you think I separate myself?

591
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:31,960
I don't know!

592
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:33,754
By coming home to you.

593
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:38,717
Now, I've been walking around
in your life all day,

594
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:41,303
and I honestly don't know
how you handle it.

595
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:46,183
But the way I handle mine

596
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:49,269
is by coming home to you.

597
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:58,946
It's your love that keeps me whole
and sane and balanced.

598
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:03,659
And I need you to allow me
to do the same thing for you right now.

599
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:09,373
So look into my eyes and breathe.

600
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:18,423
- Piper!
- Oh, God.

601
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:21,718
Phoebe.

602
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,389
Cole, get off of me!

603
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:27,224
Leo! Piper!

604
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:30,394
I think he'll come in handy
with your sisters.

605
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:34,940
Leo, it's all you.

606
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:48,704
Leo, come on, now, focus!

607
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:55,502
Hurry!

608
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:13,478
Phoebe, wake up.

609
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:15,856
Come on, come on.
Wake up, Phoebe!

610
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:20,152
Oh, no.

611
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:22,196
Heal her.

612
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:24,323
- What?
- You can do it.

613
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:45,886
Hey, how you doing?

614
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:51,850
Phoebe.

615
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,061
I didn't mean to.

616
00:39:58,148 --> 00:40:00,067
I'm sorry.

617
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:36,103
- I'm a nag.
- No, you're not.

618
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,189
Yeah, I am, and that's why we
don't have our powers back yet,

619
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,400
because I'm a nag
and I never learn...

620
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:44,903
Piper, I'm the reason why
we don't have our powers back.

621
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,614
I've been an insensitive lout,
and I clearly haven't gotten...

622
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,492
Leo, your work is very important.

623
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:54,830
- Not more important than my family.
- Guys.

624
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:56,999
I mean, you're pregnant,
and you need me,

625
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:59,042
and I should have understood
that instead of...

626
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:01,211
But I could have been
a little more patient.

627
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:03,130
- Guys?
- What?

628
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,927
I just thought you might
wanna take cover.

629
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:15,475
- Hey, I'm not nauseous.
- Hey, I am.

630
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:17,644
Wait, that's not good news.

631
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:20,063
What about your powers?

632
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,197
Very nice.

633
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:30,240
No more floral arrangements.

634
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:33,285
Yeah, I guess I got in touch
with my inner whitelighter.

635
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:36,830
Yeah, helping Melissa
helped me too.

636
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:39,708
It's good to know I have it in me.

637
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:49,051
What?

638
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:12,699
Hey, look who's back to using doors.

639
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:17,621
Yeah, I'm trying to limit
my use of powers.

640
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:19,498
Probably a wise decision.

641
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:27,673
So did you get my flowers?

642
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,424
Yep.

643
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:31,385
"Sorry I tried to strangle you"?

644
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:36,098
Probably not a card that the florist
gets to write every day, huh?

645
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:41,562
- I didn't...
- I know.

646
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:44,940
I know you're sorry.

647
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:46,942
I know you were under
the Siren's spell.

648
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:49,361
You do know her magic
feeds on love?

649
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,321
Cole...

650
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:54,158
She couldn't have lured us
if we didn't love each other.

651
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:58,203
Right. So once again
our love was nearly fatal.

652
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,581
I never would've hurt you
if I wasn't under her spell.

653
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:05,377
Most men don't try to kill their wives
when they're under the Siren's spell.

654
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:07,963
Most men just kiss and die.

655
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,132
- But because you're a demon...
- I'm not...

656
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:13,510
Okay, well, because you have
demonic powers, and a lot of them,

657
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:16,346
you became a bigger threat
than the Siren.

658
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:20,642
And that's only one way
out of a thousand

659
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:22,811
that your powers can
turn against me.

660
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:31,987
I guess I didn't want you to be right.

661
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:38,535
Neither did I.
