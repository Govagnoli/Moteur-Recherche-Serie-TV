1
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,428
- Paige, where you been? You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry, I got tied up.

2
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,055
Where? At Richard's?

3
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:16,600
No, I was at work.
Get your mind out of the gutter, missy.

4
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,770
Hey, you're the one that orbs home
to find lingerie.

5
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,147
Two times. I did that twice.

6
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,775
Yeah, it's about the only time
we ever see you anymore.

7
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,569
- Why did I come? To get picked on?
- Because we love you.

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,071
We kind of miss you.

9
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,074
I am not at Richard's that much.

10
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,328
Fine, maybe I am. But I am just
an orb away if you need help.

11
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,372
The thing is,
we just gotta be careful.

12
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,542
If we stray too far from each other,
demons take advantage.

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,378
We've learned that lesson
the hard way a few times.

14
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,964
I know, I know, I get it.

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,217
I just really don't wanna think of us
living together in 50 years.

16
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,928
Twenty, 30 years, tops.

17
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,556
We can move to Hong Kong
so I can see Jason whenever I want.

18
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,684
How do you say "dream on"
in Chinese?

19
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,104
- Impressive.
- Berlitz.

20
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,731
Okay, what about you, missy?

21
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,817
- Spill it!
- Spill what?

22
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,194
Come on, you and Greg?

23
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,071
Put out any fires lately?

24
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,073
Is that supposed to be
a fireman reference?

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,950
- Yeah, you like it?
- Wait a minute.

26
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,994
You're going out with a fire-fighter?

27
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,329
Proof positive
you haven't been around much.

28
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,416
Let's see, they've been seeing
each other for about three weeks,

29
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,253
and someone, I won't say who,
although it's not the fireman,

30
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,505
is avoiding taking it to the next step.

31
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,968
I'm not avoiding.
I'm just a little reluctant, that's all.

32
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:36,054
My dear, it is time
to get back in the saddle.

33
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,182
Now a cowboy reference.

34
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,350
Piper, you just need to relax
and let it happen.

35
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:44,062
Easy for you to say. You weren't
sleeping with an angel for three years.

36
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,192
Yeah, but you were nervous when you
and Leo first started... You know?

37
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:52,696
I seem to remember that you used
to freeze him during all the good parts.

38
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,615
Hey, maybe you should...

39
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,617
No. I'm not freezing Greg.

40
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,869
I'm so nervous,
I'd probably blow him up.

41
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:03,415
- Well?
- Gutter, gutter, gutter.

42
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,125
What are you guys talking about?

43
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,710
Stuff.

44
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,172
- Hey, where you going?
- I gotta go work on the next demon...

45
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,757
...stration.

46
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,884
Why don't you relax
and have a drink with us?

47
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,220
Thanks, but I didn't
come here to relax.

48
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,098
That is one bitchy whitelighter.

49
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,600
You're telling me.

50
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:25,020
Hey, Piper, why don't you go talk
to the guilt machine over there?

51
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,574
Bianca.

52
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,455
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

53
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,875
There'll be time to explain later.

54
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:48,961
But for now...

55
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,303
You know, all work and no... Hey!

56
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,982
Are you okay?

57
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,026
Yeah, I think so.

58
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,654
What happened? Who was she?

59
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,532
I don't know.

60
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:34,358
- Is that the mark?
- No, it looked more like a bird.

61
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:38,612
A bird? So maybe the Audubon Society
sent the demon after us?

62
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,364
Just keep looking.

63
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,075
Guys, I'm telling you, I'm fine.
Don't sweat it.

64
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,285
- You sure she wasn't a darklighter?
- I'm sure.

65
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,204
What else would be after
a whitelighter?

66
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,789
I don't know.
That's what worries me.

67
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,457
Piper blew her away,
what's the big deal?

68
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,126
The big deal is someone
tried to kill you, Chris.

69
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,088
Look at me. Not a scratch, nothing.

70
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,923
How did she get that close
to you anyway

71
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,675
if you didn't even know
who she was?

72
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:02,719
- We really ought to fix that, you know.
- Come on, who's after you?

73
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,138
Has it crossed your mind
that maybe she wasn't after me?

74
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,723
Maybe she was trying
to get to them.

75
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,726
- Kind of makes sense.
- Finally, somebody's listening.

76
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,563
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got some work to take care of.

77
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,903
- He's not telling the truth.
- Leo, maybe there's nothing to tell.

78
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,906
- Could you sense anything?
- From Chris?

79
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,658
No, I can never sense
anything from him.

80
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,579
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking

81
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,416
that if we figure out who she was,
we might figure out who Chris is.

82
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,960
Well, we're not gonna find it in here,

83
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,795
at least not until we have
more to go on.

84
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:40,465
So you guys know where
I'm gonna be if you need me.

85
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,925
Yeah, I gotta go too.

86
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,429
Wait, you're just gonna let them go?

87
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,598
What do you want me to say?
They have lives too.

88
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,266
Besides, what more can we do?

89
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,436
Figure out who the demon is and
make sure nobody else is after him.

90
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,689
I'll get it, you just keep checking
on the Book, okay?

91
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,150
No, Leo, really, I'd rather you...

92
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,117
Can I help you?

93
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,077
Yeah, is Piper home?

94
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,954
Who's asking?

95
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,374
- I'm Greg. She's expecting me.
- Leo, I got it.

96
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,211
Sorry. Running a little late.

97
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,590
- Leo? As in your?
- Yeah.

98
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,843
One and the same.
Leo, Greg. Greg, Leo.

99
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,428
Nice to finally meet you.

100
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,889
Thanks. "Finally."

101
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,976
So are you gonna be okay taking care
of everything? Wyatt and Chris?

102
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,522
Yeah, absolutely.

103
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,235
Really, everything will be fine.
If anything comes up, I'll call you.

104
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,738
Okay, thanks. Good night.

105
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,751
Will you marry me?

106
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,879
You're asking me now?

107
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,463
Here?

108
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,757
This is still our spot, Bianca,

109
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,926
no matter what he's done to it.

110
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,428
Marry me.

111
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,723
On one condition.

112
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:57,603
You come back to me. Safely.

113
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,271
Have I ever let you down before?

114
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,697
What's that?

115
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,534
Chris!

116
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,330
Are you okay?

117
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,584
Yeah. Yeah, I don't think
it had time to transmit.

118
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,050
I cannot believe he's sending
probes after us now.

119
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,635
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

120
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,845
No. No, you're not.

121
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,640
- You're gonna stick to the plan.
- But he knows.

122
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,267
No, if he knew, he wouldn't
have sent the probe.

123
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,520
You have to go back, Chris.

124
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,522
It's the only way to stop him.

125
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,066
It's the only way to change all this.

126
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,585
Morning.

127
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,755
- Wow.
- Wow?

128
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:10,676
One of the most powerful witches in
the world and all you can say is "wow."

129
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,345
I don't know, maybe I just need
a little more inspiration.

130
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,896
- Well?
- I...

131
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,941
I still think "wow"
pretty much covers it.

132
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,362
You better be careful,
because a girl could get used to this.

133
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,823
That's the plan.

134
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,368
Did you tell your sisters
you were moving out?

135
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,290
- No.
- Look, it just...

136
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,877
It hasn't really been the right time.
Things have been a little funky and...

137
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,712
There's never a right time.

138
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,674
You don't understand. Piper would
probably blow a major gasket,

139
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,927
and then we've got
all the family obligations

140
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,054
and, like it or not,
we're stronger together.

141
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,683
You gotta do something for you.

142
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,772
Can I get that?

143
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,860
It's the house.

144
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,821
Hello?

145
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,573
Yeah.

146
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,493
When I said I needed you,
I meant a fully clothed you.

147
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,288
Oh, please, Leo.
What's the big emergency?

148
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,666
What would you say if I said whoever
attacked Chris was called a Phoenix?

149
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,629
Well, I would say "What's a Phoenix?"
And then you'd probably tell me.

150
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,756
Well, they're a family
of assassin witches

151
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,801
who are very elite, very powerful and
were born with a distinctive birthmark

152
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,304
symbolizing the rise
from Salem's ashes.

153
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,805
Does the Book say what they want?

154
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,225
Just whatever bounty they're after,

155
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,394
which in this case is Chris,
which means they're still after him.

156
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,188
They won't stop until they succeed.

157
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,106
Did you call Phoebe and Piper?

158
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,025
No. Phoebe's at work

159
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:53,612
and Piper came in kind of late,
so I didn't wanna disturb her.

160
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,950
Did she come home alone?

161
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,911
- I don't know.
- Hey.

162
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,373
- Talking about me?
- Morning. Hi. No.

163
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,626
Listen, Wyatt's been fed,

164
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:12,881
and I'm gonna get some coffee
and Paige will fill you in.

165
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,301
What's going on?

166
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:20,556
Oh, Leo just found out
that a coven of assassin witches

167
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,267
called "the Phoenix" are after Chris.

168
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,435
So that's what you guys
were talking about?

169
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:30,482
Yeah, in the beginning,
and then I just kind of asked him

170
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,110
if you'd maybe come home
with anybody.

171
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:37,281
- I see.
- Did you?

172
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:42,077
Oh, come on! If a girl can't ask that,
what can a girl ask?

173
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,746
Actually, no.

174
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,041
I'm sorry.
Maybe he's just not the right guy.

175
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,794
No, it's not Greg. It's just me.

176
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,422
It's just weird now that I'm a mom.

177
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,593
I feel like I'm
betraying Wyatt somehow.

178
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,511
I think you're just betraying yourself.

179
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,930
Yeah, I know, it's just weird.

180
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,975
So a coven of assassin witches?

181
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,020
- Yep.
- Maybe we should call Phoebe.

182
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:11,440
No, I think we can do this by ourselves.
I don't think you have to bother her.

183
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,775
What if we need the power of three
after we find them?

184
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,320
You didn't need the power of three
to blow up the last one.

185
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,529
No, but...

186
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,823
So we need to try this whole
power of two thing,

187
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,366
learn how to be flexible, right?

188
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,161
So you stay here,
I'm gonna go get the scrying crystal.

189
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,711
Phoebe, I offered you the time off,
take it.

190
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,463
Go see Jason in Hong Kong.

191
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,841
It's just another airport, another city.

192
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,844
You can always send in the column.

193
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,805
E-mail, fax machine!

194
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:47,184
It's the 21 st century
and I'd like to welcome you to it.

195
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,562
When I say "take time,"

196
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,022
I don't mean a vacation.

197
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,817
Go live there for a while,
give it a shot.

198
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,403
- Elise, l...
- Go!

199
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,197
I want you to listen to me.

200
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,033
It's time I gave you
some advice for once.

201
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,578
Don't let it be work.

202
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,288
What do you mean?

203
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:12,125
There's a whole generation of women
out there who followed the dream,

204
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,254
built successful careers,

205
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,714
but at the expense
of everything else.

206
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,967
I'm not saying I think
they all made mistakes,

207
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,136
because some of them
are very happy.

208
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,389
But some of us aren't.

209
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,599
Trust me,

210
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:32,104
you don't wanna
wake up one day and realize

211
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,856
that all you've got is your career.

212
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,405
Hi, how's it going?

213
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,074
- Can I help you?
- Hopefully.

214
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,202
Yeah, see, we just moved in
from out of state,

215
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,079
and wanted to get to know
our neighbours.

216
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:50,998
Oh, well, welcome.

217
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,083
- Where did you move from?
- Phoenix.

218
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,751
Really?

219
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,880
Please, come in, come in.

220
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,883
Thank you.

221
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:08,223
- Nice place.
- Yeah, real nice.

222
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,933
Thank you.

223
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,435
Mommy, Mommy.

224
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,312
Mommy. Mommy, can I play with...

225
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,439
Bianca, can you give Mommy
a minute, okay?

226
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,024
Okay.

227
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,109
Go and play with your toys.

228
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,612
- I'll be right in, okay?
- Okay.

229
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,572
Now what?

230
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,783
Look out!

231
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,871
The kid.

232
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,211
Hurry, Bianca.

233
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,379
They can re-form?

234
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,884
Apparently. Which means the one
that attacked Chris can too.

235
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:01,985
You really shouldn't try
to orb anymore, you know?

236
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:03,487
It could kill you.

237
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,155
Is that what you want?

238
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,616
If that's what I wanted,
you'd already be dead.

239
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:11,036
All I want is to bring you back.

240
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:12,996
How did you know I'd be here?

241
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:16,041
Same reason you knew
I'd be waiting here.

242
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:21,380
- I mean, this is still our spot, isn't it?
- No.

243
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:25,050
This is what we hoped it would be.

244
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:28,387
This is what we were trying to preserve
for our future. Do you remember?

245
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,265
We were naive to think
we could change anything.

246
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,725
- To stop him.
- You don't believe that.

247
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,981
- Or at least you didn't.
- Well, I do now.

248
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,732
What happened to you, Bianca?

249
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,943
How did he turn you back?

250
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,821
That's not important.

251
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:49,741
What is important is I was interrupted
in stripping you of your powers.

252
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:53,370
And if I don't finish what I started,
you'll die soon.

253
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:56,039
Think of it as an infection.

254
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,375
And I'm the only one
with the antidote.

255
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,210
Here or there, I am dead anyway.

256
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,837
No.

257
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:05,299
He gave me his word
he wouldn't hurt you.

258
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,634
Please, Chris.

259
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,971
Don't make this any harder
than it has to be.

260
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,479
Wait, how old is the little girl?

261
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,899
I don't know. Four, 5?

262
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,694
Chris!

263
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,490
Bianca...

264
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,045
Oh, my God, what is that?

265
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,464
- I don't know.
- Doesn't matter, just heal him.

266
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,717
Why didn't he tell us about that?

267
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,761
Why doesn't he tell us
about a lot of things?

268
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,015
What's the problem?

269
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,558
He's not healing.

270
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:59,645
Something's draining his powers
and blocking mine, it's like a virus.

271
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,021
A virus named Bianca.

272
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,106
- You think she did this?
- It's gotta be.

273
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:07,361
But it doesn't explain why she would
come back from the future to kill him.

274
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,113
Well, somebody had to have sent her,
she's a hired gun.

275
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:14,076
Well, we have to find her to save him,
figure out what she did...

276
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,453
What is it?

277
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,125
Oh, my God. He loves her.

278
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,796
- Loves who? Bianca?
- Yeah.

279
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,464
She broke his heart.

280
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,351
Engagement ring.

281
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:43,021
Obviously an acrimonious split.

282
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,440
Well, at least we have
something to scry for her now.

283
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:50,612
You work on the vanquishing potion
in case she's not in the mood to help.

284
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,243
Bianca.

285
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,332
Bianca.

286
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,294
Welcome to
the Halliwell Memorial Museum.

287
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,714
A tribute to magic and, of course,
the Charmed Ones.

288
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,508
Please remember there is no
digi-capturing, no holographing

289
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:15,137
and most certainly no magic allowed
while inside the museum.

290
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:16,513
That's a big one.

291
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,766
Don't worry about those probes, folks,
they're merely scanning for witches.

292
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:24,438
As we pass through the foyer, note the
family portraits hanging on the walls

293
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,983
which date all the way back
to the witch trials.

294
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,322
Nicely done.

295
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,783
Around you, you'll notice just a few
of the many mythological creatures

296
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,413
the legendary sisters transformed into
in their demon-fighting heyday.

297
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,502
The Charmed Ones were responsible
for over 1,000 demon vanquishes

298
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,838
before they were finally
vanquished themselves.

299
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,551
Now, the time is 25 years ago.

300
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:58,013
Imagine yourself standing here
on this very floor

301
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,849
when the Charmed Ones
were reborn.

302
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,322
Okay, what was that?

303
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,325
I think that means
you're supposed to be here.

304
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,170
Scares them every time.

305
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:34,174
Let's go to the kitchen where many
of the sisters' potions were brewed,

306
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:37,302
some of which are available
for purchase in the gift shop.

307
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,016
Of course, the attic was
the preferred spot for potion-making,

308
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,061
principally because that's where they
kept the famed Book of Shadows,

309
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,896
which is where we're headed next.

310
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,359
A little background on the manor itself.
It was actually destroyed...

311
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:03,078
- Hey, you two, move along.
- Wait for it.

312
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:09,835
Are you deaf? I sa...

313
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,219
Come on.

314
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:34,151
We should be safe here
until the museum closes.

315
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,361
Then we'll go get the Book.

316
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,198
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

317
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:43,243
It's just sometimes I forget
who you really are.

318
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,204
Hey.

319
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,788
Come here.

320
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,335
You mean how I used to be, Chris.

321
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:53,337
Before I met you.

322
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,882
So, what do we do now?

323
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:02,012
We say goodbye.

324
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,457
Who are you
and what do you want?

325
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,084
Where's the grimoire?

326
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,919
One more time. Who are you?

327
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,880
Who do you think I am...

328
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,511
...Mother?
- Bianca?

329
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,596
In the flesh.
Now, where's the grimoire?

330
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:48,392
I have to get the Charmed Ones
off my tail fast. I need a spell to do it.

331
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,561
I don't understand,
how is this possible?

332
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,105
Look, I don't have time
for reunions, okay?

333
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,816
And I won't make the same mistake
a thousand other demons have.

334
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,359
Now, where's the damn book?

335
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,072
Thanks.

336
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,119
- Where is the inhibition spell?
- How is that gonna help?

337
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,329
I know the Charmed Ones,
I studied their history.

338
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,039
This is when they want
separate lives.

339
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,834
If I release certain inhibitions,
I can get them to pursue them.

340
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,377
The spell won't last long.

341
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:18,505
It just has to distract them
so I can get what I came for.

342
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,258
Got it.

343
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:22,801
Thanks.

344
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,220
Wait.

345
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,931
Do you have to leave so soon?

346
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,516
Can't I help?

347
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:33,187
Yeah.

348
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:36,190
Someday, when I ask you
what it feels like to kill,

349
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,441
don't lie to me.

350
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:40,736
Don't tell me you don't feel a thing.

351
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,872
Hang in there, buddy.

352
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:55,876
We found Bianca,
she's at her mother's.

353
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:57,794
- Little Bianca?
- No, the one we want.

354
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:02,674
Here. Something for Chris
to remember her by, or not.

355
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:07,763
Got the vanquishing potion,
so after we orb over there, I'm gonna...

356
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:15,062
- You're gonna what?
- I'm gonna move into Richard's house.

357
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,773
- Are you? Good for you.
- That's a great idea.

358
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,609
And I think I'm gonna go check out
what's going on in Hong Kong.

359
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,277
- Cool.
- Hang on a second.

360
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:23,987
This isn't you guys.

361
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,657
You must be under some kind of spell.
You have to fight this.

362
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:28,951
- How can you fight your heart?
- Or your hormones?

363
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,327
Yeah.

364
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,579
Will you drop me off
on the way to Richard's?

365
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:35,415
- I would love to.
- Paige, Phoebe, listen to me.

366
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:38,627
Wait.

367
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,844
What do I tell them?

368
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:51,932
Don't tell them anything.

369
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:56,061
Just stick to your cover story. The less
they know about the future, the better.

370
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:59,106
- What if they find out who I really am?
- They won't.

371
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:02,526
Not as long as you can
pass yourself off as their whitelighter.

372
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:04,570
You're sure I won't lose my powers
when I go?

373
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,697
Not with this spell,
that's why we need it.

374
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:11,743
But just remember, protect baby Wyatt
and you protect the Charmed Ones.

375
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,829
Keep them alive for our future.

376
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:17,666
Great. No pressure there.

377
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:21,044
Chris, you know you're
the only one who can do this.

378
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,381
You're the only one
who can save us.

379
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,550
If I make it back.

380
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:30,012
Baby, you have to make it back...

381
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,764
...if you wanna marry me.

382
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,316
You really know how
to motivate a guy.

383
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,784
- Sure you can summon the real Book?
- Yeah.

384
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:55,537
- Away from him?
- Yeah.

385
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:57,539
But we won't have much time
once it gets here.

386
00:24:57,748 --> 00:24:59,249
His demons will be all over us.

387
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,502
We won't need much time.

388
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,755
Just long enough
to send you back to them.

389
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:14,306
Hurry.

390
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,975
Before he finds us.

391
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,688
Paige?

392
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:24,191
Phoebe, get back here right now.
That's an order.

393
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,695
Wyatt's sleeping
and the monitor is in the kitchen.

394
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:30,864
Okay, Piper, but you can't go.
What about Chris?

395
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,075
Wish me luck.

396
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:48,507
Come on. We're going home.

397
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:12,739
- Hey, hold it.
- Why?

398
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:16,869
Because I just wanna make sure
that you're sure about this.

399
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,912
What's the matter?
Am I not acting sure?

400
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:23,667
Yeah, it's just that, well, you've been
a little reluctant until now.

401
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:26,587
And I guess I'm just curious,
why the change?

402
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:30,007
Who knows? Who cares?

403
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:32,593
All I know is I want...

404
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:34,845
Oh, my God.

405
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:39,391
What? Are you out of your mind?

406
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:42,102
What are you, a peeping Elder now?

407
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,318
What's going on?
What am I doing here?

408
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,613
What are you doing here?

409
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:56,116
Counteracting a spell
that Bianca apparently cast on you.

410
00:26:56,533 --> 00:27:01,163
- What kind of spell?
- One that lowers your inhibitions.

411
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:05,334
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah. Yeah.

412
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:07,377
So did she get Chris?

413
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,379
Yeah, and I'm hoping
if we can break the spell

414
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:12,508
on Phoebe and Paige,
we might be able to get Chris back.

415
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,843
Right, okay, so let's go.

416
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:19,973
You need to turn around,
because you don't get to see anymore.

417
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,072
Hi, how's it going?

418
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,742
- What are you doing here?
- Moving you back home. Hit her.

419
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,833
No time to explain. Come on. We gotta
get Phoebe or we'll never get Chris.

420
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,839
Just let me finish what I started.

421
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,217
You'll feel better soon, I promise.

422
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,469
That's it.

423
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:00,848
Easy does it.

424
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,684
Slow breaths.

425
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,231
- What did you do to me?
- I just saved your life.

426
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:11,733
By taking away my powers?

427
00:28:19,158 --> 00:28:21,326
How are you gonna
bring me back anyway?

428
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:23,078
That spell's a one-way door.

429
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:24,788
It only goes backwards in time.

430
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,040
He created a new spell
because of you.

431
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,710
- One that works both ways.
- I'm touched.

432
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,379
You should be. He's gone to
a lot of trouble to get you back.

433
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:33,964
Yeah, I see that.

434
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:37,301
You know, you don't have
to believe me, Chris,

435
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,052
but this really is for the best.

436
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:41,346
Oh, really? How's that?

437
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:43,765
Because this is
your only chance to live.

438
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:46,393
If I fail, he'll just keep sending
more assassins back

439
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,896
and all they'll have
to bring home is a body.

440
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,398
Doesn't matter.

441
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,235
There's nothing left in the future
anymore anyway.

442
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:18,383
It's time.

443
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:23,430
I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna leave you.

444
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,352
Here.

445
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:31,939
This will remind you
why we're doing this.

446
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,815
And what's waiting for you here.

447
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:40,948
Just make sure you take care
of the guards, okay?

448
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:44,535
Then get out of here.
Because if he finds you,

449
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:47,996
if he knows you betrayed him,
he'll kill you.

450
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:50,123
Don't worry.

451
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,042
I can take care of myself.

452
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:12,312
"I call upon the ancient power
To help us in this darkest hour

453
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,439
Let the Book return to this place

454
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,860
Claim refuge in its rightful space"

455
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:25,617
- It worked.
- The spell, find the spell.

456
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:31,373
"Hear these words, hear the rhyme

457
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:33,375
Heed the hope within my mind

458
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,419
Send me back to where I'll find

459
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:38,922
What I wish, in place and time"

460
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,351
Bianca!

461
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,607
Go! Go!

462
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:06,325
You really expect me to
jump into this thing like before?

463
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,368
Not without a fight, no.

464
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,290
How can you be so cold?

465
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:17,544
How can you stand and pretend like we
never meant anything to each other?

466
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:19,379
I don't have a choice.

467
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:22,132
Bianca, please don't do this.

468
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:24,927
Don't give up on everything
that we fought for.

469
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:27,095
I'm not.

470
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:29,890
I'm just hoping
we can find another way.

471
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,645
Ready?

472
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,067
Hey, future girl!

473
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,576
- You were saying?
- Wow, she is good.

474
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:54,456
I can kill her in half the time
it takes you to think about it.

475
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:56,375
We still have enough potion
to vanquish you.

476
00:31:56,542 --> 00:32:00,420
Maybe, but then you really will have
to hope the power of two will do.

477
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:01,672
Won't you, Paige?

478
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:05,551
Oh, you'd be surprised
what's in the history books.

479
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:07,803
Now put the vials down slowly.

480
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,181
Bianca, don't. Let her go
and I promise I'll go with you.

481
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:13,308
Chris, what are you doing?

482
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:17,813
If you kill her, there won't be a future
for us to go back to and you know it.

483
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,983
- What are you talking about?
- You'll see if you live long enough.

484
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,194
Piper, freeze them.

485
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:28,490
Okay, I get why she didn't freeze,
but why didn't he freeze?

486
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:30,659
- Unless he's a...
- I'm a witch too?

487
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:34,079
That's right.

488
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:38,417
Part witch, part whitelighter.
Just like you, Paige.

489
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:40,961
- You lied to us?
- I had to.

490
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:43,088
It was the only way
I could get you to trust me.

491
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:44,631
Trust you?

492
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,425
Never mind,
it doesn't matter anyway.

493
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,218
So that's it, you're just gonna leave?

494
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:49,595
I don't have a choice.

495
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,139
She stripped my powers.

496
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:55,851
Leo is gonna have to fix
that floorboard without me.

497
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:00,856
Let's go.

498
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,377
Welcome home, Chris.

499
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:36,350
Hello, Wyatt.

500
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,650
There's gotta be a spell
in here somewhere.

501
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:46,610
To take us to the future?
I don't think so.

502
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:50,280
Well, Bianca's a witch, she could do it,
how could she do it?

503
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:51,698
We don't know how.

504
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,450
How did we do it five years ago?

505
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:55,118
The Elders made
that happen, remember?

506
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:57,830
Well, you're an Elder,
make it happen.

507
00:33:57,996 --> 00:34:00,541
- That was a unique situation.
- This isn't?

508
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:03,168
I don't like this either.
Don't you think I wanna save him?

509
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,379
I don't know if I wanna save him
or kick his ass.

510
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:08,632
That still doesn't change
all the good he's done.

511
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:11,301
You're singing a different tune.
You've come a long way, baby.

512
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:15,389
Okay, despite all his secrets,
I still believe that he came back

513
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:18,725
to protect Wyatt and that is enough
for me to wanna save him.

514
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:21,103
The question is how?

515
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,357
- Leo.
- What?

516
00:34:25,524 --> 00:34:26,859
Fix the floorboard.

517
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,861
Maybe he was trying
to tell us something.

518
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:30,279
- Who? What?
- Maybe.

519
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:35,701
Maybe that's where Bianca was
taking him. To the attic in the future.

520
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:38,412
But that would still be there
in the future, wouldn't it?

521
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:39,997
Yeah, unless we fixed it.

522
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:43,417
Or used it to send him something,
something that he needed.

523
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:47,129
- Like what?
- His powers.

524
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:04,188
They're no threat to me.

525
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:08,901
Et tu, Chris?

526
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:11,653
Of all the people to betray me...

527
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,822
I didn't go back to betray you, Wyatt.

528
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,116
I went back to save you.

529
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,785
Save me? From what?

530
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:20,704
From whatever evil it was
that turned you.

531
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:23,373
That's always been
your problem, Chris.

532
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:27,586
Stuck in the old
good-versus-evil morass.

533
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:29,379
I'm so past that.

534
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:32,132
It's all about power,
it's as simple as that.

535
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,219
And whoever has
the most power wins, is that it?

536
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:36,970
That's it.

537
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,806
That's why I keep
this museum intact.

538
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:42,309
To remind everyone the power
from which I was born,

539
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:44,019
and that which I possess.

540
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:47,064
Too bad the rest of the city isn't faring
as well as your shrine here.

541
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:52,653
You know, if anyone else tried what
you tried, I'd kill them on the spot.

542
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,863
But you...

543
00:35:57,032 --> 00:35:58,784
I've forgiven Bianca,
I can forgive you too.

544
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:02,120
If you promise
never to cross me again.

545
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:03,455
You know me better than that.

546
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:05,541
You said you could talk
some sense into him.

547
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:06,792
Leave her out of this.

548
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:16,510
Pardon me?

549
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:28,021
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

550
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:33,026
There you go.

551
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:38,157
Okay, put it back.

552
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:42,411
You promised you wouldn't hurt him!

553
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,288
And you promised you'd turn him.

554
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:47,833
Just like I turned you,
or at least I thought I had.

555
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:51,170
Chris, please.

556
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:53,839
I didn't bring you here to die.

557
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:55,465
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

558
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:00,721
I think.

559
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:05,976
Have you lost your mind?

560
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:11,481
I don't need you.

561
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:23,535
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it fast.

562
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:25,204
I can't hold him for long.

563
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:35,714
"Power of witches, rise
Come to me from across the skies

564
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,883
Return my magic, give me back

565
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,677
All that was taken from the attack"

566
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:45,933
No!

567
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:55,984
Bianca. Bianca.

568
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:58,195
No. No. No.

569
00:37:58,362 --> 00:38:00,155
Haven't we been here before?

570
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:03,617
Maybe we will be again.

571
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,204
Maybe.

572
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,670
You can finish what we started.

573
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:20,676
Hurry.

574
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:24,012
Take the spell
so he can't send anyone else.

575
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:27,432
Go.

576
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:35,107
"Hear these words, hear the rhyme

577
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:36,608
Heed the hope within my mind

578
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:42,614
Send me back to where I'll find
What I wish, in place and time"

579
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:47,202
No!

580
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:55,752
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

581
00:38:57,713 --> 00:38:58,797
Nice spell.

582
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:01,341
Yeah, but we just put it in there,
like, two seconds ago.

583
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:03,635
- The way time travel works...
- I don't wanna know,

584
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:05,679
I already have
a little headache, thanks.

585
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:08,891
You have some serious explaining
to do, young man.

586
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:11,602
I know.

587
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:15,105
Listen, I'm sorry I lied to you,
I really am, but...

588
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:17,733
No, no buts, it's about time
you tell us the truth. Now.

589
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:22,279
I can't.
But not because I don't want to.

590
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:25,657
There's only so much I can tell without
the future being changed too much.

591
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:29,036
Isn't that your whole point?
To come and change the future?

592
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:32,706
Yeah, but that was supposed to be
more like a surgical strike.

593
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:34,291
To save Wyatt.

594
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,585
To save Wyatt.

595
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:39,421
What about Bianca?

596
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,094
Bianca won't be a threat
to anyone anymore.

597
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:48,472
I'm sorry.

598
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:51,975
Me too.

599
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,855
So you still all right
with me hanging around?

600
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,322
Absolutely.

601
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:07,825
But the next time you're in trouble,
you tell us.

602
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:10,828
Trust works both ways.

603
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:13,163
Okay.

604
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,228
If I can't save you,
I swear to God I'll stop you.

605
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:53,662
- Hey.
- Hey.

606
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:56,915
What's going on?

607
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:59,793
Well, I've been thinking.

608
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:02,379
Does that mean I'm in trouble?

609
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:07,176
I think it's time we make
some changes around here.

610
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:13,557
What kind of changes?

611
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:17,936
Like I think you should move
to Hong Kong with Jason

612
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:21,023
and you should move in
with Richard.

613
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:25,944
I never said I wanted that.

614
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:31,033
You didn't have to,
the spell did that for you. And you too.

615
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:37,706
Well, we can't leave you alone.
We have to stick together.

616
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:40,667
No, I know, believe me. I know.

617
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:44,463
But you can't keep sacrificing
your lives forever.

618
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,048
And neither can I.

619
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:50,302
Mom did that, Grams did it,
and even Prue.

620
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:53,055
And look what happened to them.

621
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:56,642
It's not a legacy I want us to inherit.

622
00:41:57,768 --> 00:42:00,896
What if is doesn't work out,
us going our separate ways?

623
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:03,899
Well, we'll worry about it then.

624
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:08,904
You sure about this?

625
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:13,075
Yeah, I am.
