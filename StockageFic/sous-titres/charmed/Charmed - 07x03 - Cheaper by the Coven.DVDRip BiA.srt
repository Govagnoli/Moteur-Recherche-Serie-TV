1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,629
I have things to do too, you know.

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,173
I have all these parents on my back now.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,969
Oh, and my freshman's potions class?
Let's see, I ordered 500 dried toads.

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,805
What did I get? Five hundred wet ones.

5
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,183
It's hard for me
to get on board with this

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,561
when Piper, the mother,
is against doing the wiccaning.

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,980
Grams is here to convince her.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,982
Look at Wyatt.

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,237
He didn't have one until he was six
months old, and he almost turned evil.

10
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,281
Look at that sweet face,
you want a repeat of that?

11
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,991
No, of course I don't.

12
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:37,621
Hear me now, hear my cries
Spirit from the other side

13
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,748
Cross now the great divide

14
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,587
You mean she is still
lying about her age?

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,926
What? What?

16
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,470
Not a good time, girls. I'm busy.

17
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,515
- You're dead.
- It doesn't mean I can't have a life.

18
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,560
Oh, well. All right.

19
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,646
- Hi.
- Hello, darlings.

20
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,191
Oh, sweetie.

21
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:09,528
Oh, so, what brings me down here?

22
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:14,032
- A wiccaning for your great-grandson.
- Providing Piper doesn't kill us.

23
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,660
A wiccaning?
I thought we already did that.

24
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,161
Not for baby Chris.

25
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:25,169
Help me out here. Last time I knew,
he was a six-foot Whitelighter?

26
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:29,298
Yeah, that was Chris from the future.
This is baby Chris, now.

27
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,383
Piper and Leo had this night...

28
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,679
Do you really need us to explain this
to you or can you be happy to see him?

29
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:36,889
Good gracious.

30
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,100
Wyatt has a little baby brother!

31
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,353
Oh, he is sweet.

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,731
So when does Piper want to do this?

33
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,400
Well, technically, never.

34
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,486
You can't deny this child
his ancestral blessings,

35
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,447
It's a witch's compass for good.

36
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:57,701
I mean, who knows what terrible
evils could befall him otherwise.

37
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,537
That's the kind of stuff
Piper needs to hear.

38
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:10,380
Wyatt, don't pick on your little brother
like that. Now give it back!

39
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,970
What was that all about?

40
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,015
He's fine, probably
orbed himself up to his room.

41
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,767
He's having a hard time.

42
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:25,604
His dad's never around,
his little brother gets the attention,

43
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,606
he's chased by the Underworld.

44
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,900
He's gonna have to get used to it.

45
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,069
He's two.

46
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,197
Right. Oh, here. Okay.

47
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,159
I'll go up and apologise.

48
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,996
Still think this was a good idea?

49
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,001
Girls!

50
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,300
Shelf!

51
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,435
Looks like I didn't get here
a minute too soon.

52
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,621
Oh, no, that's okay, Gerry.
Just get here whenever you can.

53
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,916
Okay, thanks. Bye.

54
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,667
You okay, Piper?

55
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,044
Yeah, why?

56
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:15,214
Well, a beer shipment delay
so close to the weekend,

57
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,549
I expected there'd be more fireworks.

58
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,428
Oh, no, it's no big deal. We'll
just charge more for the ginger ale.

59
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,472
I'm kidding!

60
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,059
There you go. I don't know what,
but something's going on.

61
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:31,438
No. You know how people just
leave things up to a higher power?

62
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,317
Well, I'm trying to live my life
without any powers.

63
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,444
Makes for a lot less stress.

64
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,613
Piper!

65
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,532
Until now.

66
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,035
What's that face for?

67
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,872
Your sister can't come by
without there being something wrong?

68
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,374
- What's up?
- Nothing.

69
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,379
Nothing's up, you know.
Why would you think anything is up?

70
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,006
I just came by to tell my sister

71
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,384
that I won a Reader's Choice Award.

72
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:03,595
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

73
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,015
Maybe there's one more thing.

74
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,018
Something happened today
after we summoned Grams.

75
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,188
What? What?
Why did you summon Grams?

76
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:17,359
For Chris's wiccaning. It was Paige's
idea, not mine, don't blame me.

77
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,570
What did I say?
I don't want any magic.

78
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,782
My kids can't have a completely normal
life, but I've gotta give it a shot.

79
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,159
Yes. I think we should start tomorrow.

80
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,494
Because a...

81
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,621
A demon attacked Wyatt.

82
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,207
And you wait till now to tell me?!

83
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,627
I didn't want to worry you,
and he's okay, Piper.

84
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,297
Leo!

85
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,549
Oh, hi, sweetie. How are you?

86
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,010
Don't "sweetie" me. Where are the boys?

87
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,263
They're fine.
Paige took them to Magic School.

88
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,348
Leo, now!

89
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,975
Leo!

90
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,644
Honey, are you sure
you want him down here?

91
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,440
Considering that he can't
even tell good from evil any more.

92
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,193
Well, you know, lost soul and all.

93
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,946
Oh, Paige filled me in.

94
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:07,659
Okay, first of all, our children's
safety is Leo's number one priority,

95
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,287
no matter how lost he may be.

96
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,580
Leo!

97
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,832
What's the matter? What happened?

98
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,835
A demon attacked Wyatt.
He's okay. He's at school.

99
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,670
- What kind of demon?
- No idea.

100
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,714
It had some sort of creepy mask.

101
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,509
Oh, and it struck me down
with a lightning bolt.

102
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:27,179
I can't believe this is happening.
I can't do this again.

103
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,640
I'm gonna go down, find out who it was.

104
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:34,353
Down there? As in the Underworld?
Hang out there a lot, do you?

105
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,605
Best place to vanquish demons.

106
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,276
Listen, Piper,
far be it for me to meddle...

107
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,486
Then don't!

108
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:46,323
You're pressing your luck
being here in the first place.

109
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,867
Yeah, I know about the wiccaning.

110
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,705
I don't know why
you're being so stubborn about it.

111
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,667
I mean, what better way
to ward off demon attacks?

112
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,336
The demon went after Wyatt,
not his brother.

113
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,380
More reason to protect Chris.

114
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:05,717
Except for the fact that Wyatt's
wiccaning didn't really protect him.

115
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,511
It almost destroyed you,

116
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:11,139
or do you not remember
your friend the Necromancer?

117
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:15,269
I just need to find out
who the hell is after my son.

118
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,070
I saw that, Wyatt.
Give that back to your brother

119
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,739
while I find out
who's trying to kill you!

120
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,702
Whoever it is can't get to him here.
These guys are protected.

121
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,538
Wyatt is. His brother
is not protected from him.

122
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,583
It's gotta be tough.
He's a new kid on the block.

123
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,294
Suddenly he's yesterday's news.
I mean...

124
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,338
Spoken like a true older brother.

125
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:56,602
Progress reports? The year hasn't
gone on long enough to be any progress.

126
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,521
Afraid I can't help you
with that, Miss Matthews.

127
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,024
But I did find something
on masked demons.

128
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,277
- Paige. What have you got?
- A couple of possibilities.

129
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,906
Could be an Aztec demon,
Chinese false face demon.

130
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,367
- Any of those look familiar?
- No, Ben, sorry. They don't.

131
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,871
When I took this job, I had no idea
how much work it would be.

132
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,874
Who knows what I'm letting
slip through the cracks.

133
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,418
- I think I found the first thing.
- What?

134
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,462
Your nephew.

135
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,633
Wyatt, where did you orb
your little brother?

136
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,388
No, Paige, he's not here.
Where the hell is he?

137
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,268
I hope this is yours
'cause it sure isn't mine.

138
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,729
Thank God. I got him.

139
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:46,360
- Hi there, you. And you.
- Oh, man. Hi.

140
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,737
I stepped on the porch
and all of a sudden

141
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,822
the little guy flies into my arms.

142
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,575
Yeah, his brother orbed him
from Magic School.

143
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:57,329
- Oh, is that normal?
- Has been lately.

144
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,333
Victor, what are you doing here?

145
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,504
And a big hello to you too, Penny.
I was invited for a wiccaning.

146
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,589
Oh, sorry.

147
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,676
Wiccanings are only
for magical family members.

148
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,761
That's not what Paige says.

149
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,888
Paige doesn't know all the rules.

150
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,809
I can see this is gonna go well,
but it doesn't matter who was invited

151
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,270
cos there isn't going to be a wiccaning.

152
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,147
Paige thinks if she crams
enough family members

153
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,233
down my throat, I'm gonna give in.

154
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,194
It's not gonna work
because nothing is working.

155
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:32,447
There is some creepy-ass demon
after my son,

156
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,701
and now Wyatt wants
to orb his brother all over creation

157
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,661
for God only knows what reason.

158
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:41,707
Isn't that boys being boys?
There's always gonna be sibling rivalry.

159
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:45,502
No, actually, it's not.
This is not them fighting over toys.

160
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,088
They nearly kill
each other in the future.

161
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:52,342
You know, there's an easy way
to nip this thing in the bud.

162
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,094
What would that be exactly?

163
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,725
Snakes and Ladders,

164
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:04,146
a very unfortunate halter top,

165
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,857
but I don't see a little black book.

166
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:10,194
- I do.
- Oh, thank you.

167
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,323
- Don't want me looking up boyfriends?
- They were in a much bigger book.

168
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:18,243
These contain spells I used
on the girls when they were younger.

169
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,287
You used spells on my daughters?

170
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:24,041
Every now and then.
Hey, you try raising three girls

171
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,752
by yourself, keeping them in line.

172
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,213
How else to stop them
from misbehaving?

173
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,924
Gee, I don't know, by talking to them?

174
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,217
Talking?

175
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:38,180
- How's about we find that damn spell?
- That's your answer for everything.

176
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,265
I was essentially a single parent.

177
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:43,268
Patty was dead and it's not
as if you were around.

178
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,270
You wouldn't allow me to be!

179
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,148
Okay! Do I need to find
something to separate you?

180
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,860
Your daughters only ended up
saving the world every other week.

181
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:55,280
It might have had something
to do with the way I raised them.

182
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:59,201
Found it:
"Spell to Resolve Sibling Rivalry".

183
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:03,205
Oh, good, good. I'll get the boys
and you call your sisters.

184
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,123
We'll get rid of the rivalry,

185
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,126
then use the Power of Three
to vanquish the demon.

186
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,753
Great, more magic.

187
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,924
- Do you have any other suggestions?
- I have a suggestion.

188
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,263
The next time Ask Phoebe wins an award,

189
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,765
you should probably try calling Phoebe.

190
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,517
Let me get back to you, Diane.

191
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,563
Sorry, research. So, what's going on?

192
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,523
Did you just hear what I said?

193
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,484
Yeah, I wasn't trying
to snake the award from you.

194
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,736
I was gonna accept it on your behalf.

195
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:39,157
I was under the now very mistaken
impression you were taking time off.

196
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,870
Just one second. Yeah, this is Leslie.

197
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,331
- Hey, Rachel!
- Research?

198
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:49,251
Oh, no, this is personal.

199
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,920
Yeah, can I call you back? Great.

200
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,922
Now where was I?

201
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,887
You were making an excuse about
how you're about to accept an award

202
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:04,099
- for something you didn't write.
- Actually, I did write it.

203
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:15,944
Congratulations.

204
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:21,783
Phoebe, when I write these columns,
I'm really trying to channel you,

205
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,661
and your, you know, your vibe.

206
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,624
- Spare me the false humility.
- It was pretty false.

207
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,044
Why don't we go to this thing together?

208
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,588
You can go and accept
the award yourself.

209
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,882
No, I think that you should go accept it

210
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,635
and maybe bring one
of your phone pals with you.

211
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:49,019
Let's make this quick. I have four angry
parents waiting for me in the office.

212
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,314
Well, there's my other grandson.

213
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,066
Come along, darling.

214
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:57,361
I need you to stand
by your little brother, right there.

215
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,905
You do know what you're doing?

216
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:02,658
Paige, dear,
we're getting our wiccaning.

217
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,535
I said maybe.

218
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,664
We have a few more pressing issues
to deal with at the moment.

219
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,249
What changed your mind?

220
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,836
Nothing, although it's getting
harder and harder to say no

221
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:17,256
with the arrival of a new
family member every five minutes.

222
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,260
Are you two ready to finally get along?

223
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:27,474
Pass your petty jealousies
to darkest night

224
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:31,562
Let these feuding siblings
no longer fight

225
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,401
Okay, shouldn't those stop now?

226
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:40,237
Grams, are you sure
this is the right spell?

227
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,865
Remind me never
to go on sabbatical again.

228
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,620
'Cause that Leslie is such a jerkface!

229
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,081
- Oh, please, you so like him.
- I do not!

230
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,750
- You do too.
- I do not, Piper.

231
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,794
- I do not!
- Do too!

232
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:59,173
- Why don't you marry him?
- Why don't you just marry Leo?

233
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,382
Cos I already did.

234
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:03,135
Leo, I wanna get married.

235
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,389
Girls, he's here! Piper, blast him!

236
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,979
Girls...

237
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,321
Any more great ideas?

238
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,327
I am so outta here!

239
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,537
Phoebe, do not go out that front door!

240
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,414
- Try and stop me!
- Phoebe!

241
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,460
Blow my head off, why don't you!

242
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,337
Come on, it was an accident!

243
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:41,131
No one leaves
until I reverse that spell.

244
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,133
- Phoebe, don't.
- I mean it.

245
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,927
- Sayonara.
- Paige.

246
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:50,015
- Phoebe, don't leave this house!
- Why not? Paige did!

247
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:52,226
She probably went to Magic School.

248
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,811
I'm going to the Reader's Choice Awards.

249
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,023
You've got more important things
to worry about.

250
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,153
Way to go, Grams.

251
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,280
Piper, don't be rude!

252
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,991
It's not my fault,
it's the stupidest book.

253
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,245
You said the stupid spell
would work. It didn't! So...

254
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,163
Let this girl quick as a sneeze

255
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,917
Stop this snit and quickly freeze

256
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,087
That's better.

257
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,756
Why is my daughter a statue?

258
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:26,385
She's fine. She'll thaw out in a minute.

259
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:29,972
Yeah. How do I know
she won't be this way forever?

260
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:34,351
That it won't backfire
like your last brilliant spell?

261
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,854
Have you heard a peep out of those boys?

262
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,731
No, because the spell worked.

263
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,692
Pulled the rivalry out of them.

264
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:45,195
Unfortunately, it went
into the nearest set of siblings:

265
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,697
In this case, the girls.

266
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:50,492
They know everything
that's going on in their adult lives.

267
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,036
The difference is, they're not adults.

268
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,081
Yeah, well, tell me
how to get 'em back to normal.

269
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,876
Easy, I have
to figure out a reversal spell,

270
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,128
hopefully before the demon returns.

271
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,506
We gotta get the boys
to Magic School. They'll be safe.

272
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,259
- Fine, tell me how to get there.
- You don't.

273
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,344
Magic School is not for mortals.

274
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,264
They'll have to make
an exception, won't they?

275
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:16,351
Forget it, Victor.
Call Leo. He'll take them.

276
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,104
Leo!

277
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,287
Kind of an odd place
for an Elder to visit.

278
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:41,043
Then again, the word is, you can't get
enough of the dark side these days.

279
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,796
Someone from the Underworld
is after my son. I want to know who.

280
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:49,718
You mean a demon? Nah! I don't think so.
They know better by now.

281
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,970
Obviously, somebody doesn't.

282
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:57,142
Tell me, what makes you
so sure it's not an Elder?

283
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:01,063
Someone who thinks that maybe
your friend Gideon was right.

284
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,649
No more Elders
are gonna die by my hands.

285
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,984
I can't say the same thing for demons.

286
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,612
Can you even tell
the difference any more?

287
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:18,288
You know, I'm kinda liking
this new side of you. It's not as goopy.

288
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,290
Who's trying to kill my son?

289
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,587
You want an answer?
You'll find it in there.

290
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:43,105
Looks like the only threat
to your son is you.

291
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:44,648
No! It's a lie!

292
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,817
The Pool never lies!

293
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,576
Okay, try this.

294
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,745
Words that cast a sibling glow...

295
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,540
Piper!

296
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,085
What? I told you, I'm not doing this.

297
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:08,672
I'm not writing anything down.
I'm not doing magic.

298
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:15,512
Do you remember
the first time you were this age?

299
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,184
When I sat you and your
sisters down and we had "the talk"?

300
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,563
Grams, I already know all about sex.

301
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,026
No offence, I don't want to talk about
it with you, cos that's really gross!

302
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:34,198
No, not the sex talk, silly.
The witch talk.

303
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,658
So, what did you tell us?

304
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:41,205
My being a witch was such
an important part of my life

305
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,167
and what it meant to me and what
it might mean to you someday.

306
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:53,008
Did you tell us that Prue
and Mom were gonna die?

307
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:57,179
Or that Leo was gonna lose his marbles?

308
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:02,184
Or that demons were gonna be chasing
after us all the time everywhere?

309
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:07,981
Piper, I didn't know any of those
things were going to happen.

310
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,900
But if I did,

311
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:14,321
I would have done everything
in my power to stop it.

312
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:18,492
Baby.

313
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:25,123
I'd like to think that being a witch
gave you the inner strength you needed

314
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,294
to deal with all those
sadnesses in your life.

315
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,757
- Did you ever think about that?
- No.

316
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,052
You called?

317
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,764
No, but hi!

318
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:45,561
Victor called you, he's in the other
room. Piper, where are you going?

319
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,605
- What's up?
- Hey, Leo.

320
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,774
Hey, you don't look so good.

321
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:55,237
Dad, you could try maybe being a little
nice to Leo. What do you think, huh?

322
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:58,907
- You okay? You don't seem...
- She's fine. We're fixing it.

323
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,412
Leo, we need you to take the boys
to Magic School for their safety.

324
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,043
Do you have a problem with that?

325
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,923
Never mind, we'll just keep them here.

326
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,133
I can take 'em.

327
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,179
- You don't look like you can.
- What are you saying?

328
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:23,932
- I don't know what's wrong with you.
- Nothing is wrong with me!

329
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:29,146
- Where are you going?
- To protect my children.

330
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:35,652
You know, I don't understand why
you guys have to be so mean to Leo!

331
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,821
You know, in case you haven't heard,

332
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:42,284
he's kind of going through a hard time
right about now! I mean, geez!

333
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,790
We've gotta turn these girls back fast.

334
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:52,920
I'm gonna finish the spell
and get Paige.

335
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:56,006
Make yourself useful, okay?
Get Phoebe.

336
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,555
I'll take one of those.

337
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:07,976
This is so cool,
they didn't even card me!

338
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,103
Didn't expect to see you here.

339
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,147
I changed my mind cos it's my award

340
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:15,025
and I'm not gonna share it
with anybody, so there!

341
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,319
Phoebe, are you drunk?

342
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:20,614
If I could please
have everyone's attention.

343
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:24,493
This year's winner of the San
Francisco Readers' Choice Award

344
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,037
for single best column

345
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:30,666
is the Bay Mirror's Phoebe Halliwell.

346
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,879
Hey, it's not too late. If you still
want me to go up there for you, I can.

347
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,923
Yeah, nice try.

348
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:45,180
Thank you. I mean, this is so awesome.

349
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:48,892
This is so, like,
totally, amazingly awesome!

350
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,228
Really totally awesome! Thanks.

351
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,064
In your column...

352
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:57,901
Yeah, you mean the bestest column
in all the world?

353
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,572
Yes. You gave great advice
to that woman.

354
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,242
I'm curious, was it based
on something that happened to you?

355
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:10,831
Yeah, actually, it did happen to me.
It was very sad. Okay, next question.

356
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:13,917
Wait, would you mind
telling me what that thing was?

357
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:16,587
You mean...
You mean what happened to me?

358
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:19,506
It was actually something
that happened to me.

359
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,092
- If I can answer the question?
- Oh, yeah.

360
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,970
I'm lucky enough
to work with Phoebe at the paper.

361
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:26,722
A few years back, this girl,

362
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:29,558
she dumped me
and I was really broken up about it

363
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:32,144
cos I thought she was the one, you know.

364
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:35,731
And the whole thing made me
gun-shy about relationships.

365
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:38,692
Anyway, Phoebe takes me aside
one day and she says...

366
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,069
She says, "Let me
tell you about the one.

367
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:44,281
The one is the person
who sees you for the idiot you are

368
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:47,826
but they still want you
in their life. That's the one."

369
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:51,371
I said, "Phoebe, that's great advice,
and not just for me."

370
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,958
And I guess that's really
how it got in her column.

371
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,963
Thank you, yeah, that's what happened.

372
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,218
Thank you.

373
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:08,138
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

374
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:12,726
I was so scared and so nervous
that I thought I was going to hurl.

375
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:17,064
You're welcome. Are you all right?
You still seem a little...

376
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:24,404
Yeah, I'm fine.
I can't believe I just hugged you.

377
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,114
I have to go.

378
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:33,288
Ben?

379
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,499
Miss Matthews.

380
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,793
Stop calling me Miss Matthews. Paige.

381
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,463
Okay, Paige, is there something
that I can help you with?

382
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,383
I would like to talk to you
for a bit, if I could?

383
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:50,722
Paige, what's going on?
What'd you call me out here for?

384
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,396
That.

385
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:03,068
- My God, how old are you anyway?
- Twenty-one.

386
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,571
Okay, big mistake.

387
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:08,490
No. One kiss, okay?

388
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:10,951
That's it.
We're not going to second base.

389
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:14,413
- Oh, come on.
- She said no.

390
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,417
Robbing the cradle,
you should be ashamed of yourself.

391
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:21,503
Come along, dear.
Time to grow up.

392
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,630
I'll dream about you.

393
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:43,734
Wyatt!

394
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:11,887
What?

395
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:41,625
This is Leslie. Hello? Hello?

396
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,379
Give it to me, I'm calling him myself.

397
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:47,089
No, don't you dare.

398
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:49,341
Do you want to know
if he likes you or not?

399
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:52,761
Yeah, but wait!
If he asks, I'm not here, OK?

400
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:56,098
- I'm not even in the house anywhere.
- Okay, already.

401
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:57,432
Okay.

402
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,395
Phoebe and Leslie sitting in a tree
K-l-S-S-l-N-G

403
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:04,314
No! Hey!

404
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,108
Stay here. Protect the boys.

405
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:08,777
You, come with me.

406
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:15,868
Close the door.

407
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,995
I found the demon who's after Wyatt.

408
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:21,582
You did? When? Where?

409
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:24,918
- There he is!
- No, you're making a huge mistake.

410
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,797
- Get out of here! I'm warning you!
- Penny, what are you talking about?

411
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:31,967
I saw this monster
attack Wyatt at Magic School.

412
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:34,678
- That wasn't me.
- It sure looked like you!

413
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:38,640
I know it did. I can explain! It must
have been some kind of shape shifter.

414
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:41,977
I don't know any shape shifters
who can get into Magic School

415
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:43,812
or any who have Elders' powers!

416
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,147
What are you saying?

417
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:47,733
He attacked me.
I was trying to protect Wyatt.

418
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,318
Yes, from yourself!

419
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:52,988
- I hate when they fight.
- The stupid magic is ruining our lives.

420
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:56,492
It's already ruined mine
because now Leslie knows I like him

421
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:59,119
and I can never leave the house again.

422
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:01,497
This is my son. I would never hurt him.

423
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:05,042
Just like you would never
hurt an Elder? Or kill one?

424
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:09,463
- Who are you talking about?
- You know who I'm talking about.

425
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,508
Gideon.

426
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,677
I don't care what you say,
he would never hurt his son.

427
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:18,180
- How would you know?
- Because I'm a father!

428
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:23,810
Victor, you have absolutely no idea
what the magical world is capable of.

429
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:28,565
He may not have an idea, but I do.
I am not capable of that.

430
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,653
No?

431
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,030
Even after all you've been through?

432
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:37,032
Look at yourself.

433
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,326
Is it so hard to believe

434
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:44,248
that maybe some dark alter ego of yours
might be acting on your true feelings?

435
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:45,958
What true feelings?

436
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:49,878
That maybe deep down inside,
you think Gideon was right.

437
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:53,006
Your son doesn't belong in this world.

438
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:56,093
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

439
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,221
Then how else
do you explain what happened?

440
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:03,100
Where else could
that demon have come from?

441
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:14,194
Change of plans.

442
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:17,823
We're not reversing the rivalry spell.
Or at least not yet.

443
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,449
Why not? I thought...

444
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:24,830
No, listen, if adult Piper were to find
out that Leo was trying to harm Wyatt,

445
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:28,542
it would devastate her.
She wouldn't be able to fight him off.

446
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:31,420
We're talking about my daughter.
I get a say in this.

447
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:34,965
No, with birthdays
and holidays you get a say.

448
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:38,594
With magic and demons, what I say goes.

449
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,597
Now, if you'll excuse me.

450
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:53,525
I told the girls to stay downstairs
until we settle this.

451
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,194
There's nothing to settle.

452
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,071
If you don't mind,
I'm demon-proofing the attic.

453
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,782
I want to keep the children safe.

454
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,118
Wait. Believe it or not,

455
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:06,330
I really appreciate what
you've done for my daughters.

456
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:10,459
Buttering me up won't do you any good.
I'm not reversing the spell.

457
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:12,794
I don't expect you to.

458
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:16,840
But I do expect you to understand
that even though I couldn't be there

459
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,176
when they were growing up, I'm here now.

460
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:21,345
And I want to do what's best for them.

461
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:23,639
- We already are.
- No, we're not.

462
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:27,392
And since I want
to reverse the spell and you don't,

463
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,270
I think we should bring in a third party

464
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:33,315
to break the tie, so to speak.

465
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:34,983
A third party?

466
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,653
Who'd you have in mind, their mother?

467
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:41,114
Yes. That's exactly who I had in mind.

468
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:43,784
Do it!

469
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:45,577
Oh, all right.

470
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:48,997
But she's not going
to side with you, you know.

471
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:54,378
Mom!

472
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:58,715
- Victor.
- Wow.

473
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,175
Patty, you look great.

474
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,970
Oh, stop trying to sweet-talk her.

475
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,471
What's going on?

476
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:11,061
There's nothing more
I can tell you about the demon.

477
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:14,314
You can tell me where it came from.

478
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:16,567
I have to know, did it come from me?

479
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:17,818
Tell me.

480
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:21,029
Oh, what's the matter?

481
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:23,198
Are you in pain?

482
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:24,867
Please, I...

483
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:28,579
I have a problem.
You kind of have a temper.

484
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:32,499
And if I don't tell you, then,
well, you'll probably choke me to death.

485
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,377
And if I do tell you
and you don't like the answer,

486
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:38,005
well, then you'll probably
choke me to death.

487
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:39,339
I won't hurt you.

488
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,592
Yeah, that's not much of a guarantee.

489
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:46,847
But you could swear
on the head of your precious son.

490
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:48,473
Leave him out of this.

491
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,435
There's that temper thing.

492
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:53,729
I'm not leaving until I get an answer.

493
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,947
I'm telling you,
she would never get over it,

494
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:06,408
her own husband
trying to kill their child?

495
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,785
- We don't even know it's Leo!
- Mom...

496
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:11,705
What if it is? You trust
Leo to look after those boys?

497
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,875
- Better than keeping them locked...
- OK, guys!

498
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,460
- Can I just say?
- No.

499
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:19,796
- Victor's right. No, Mom.
- Patty!

500
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:24,051
We have to reverse the sibling spell
and get the girls back to being adults

501
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:27,304
so that they can vanquish this thing,
whoever it is.

502
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:31,517
- The danger to Piper...
- She's in more danger if we don't.

503
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:34,686
Listen, Patty, I know these girls.

504
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:37,189
I've been with them
every step of the way.

505
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:38,524
We're their parents.

506
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,449
- Oh, well, then fine.
- Mom!

507
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:50,160
I can see I'm not needed here.

508
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:53,080
No, come on, come on. I...

509
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:56,750
She always was a bad loser.

510
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:59,086
Well, she'll get over it.

511
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:02,756
By the way, Victor, I have a question.

512
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:04,842
Why'd you call on me to settle this?

513
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,802
Girls were in trouble and...

514
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:10,180
...you were the only person
I could think of, dead or alive.

515
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:16,270
Still, it was teenage trouble. That's
kind of unfamiliar territory for us.

516
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,772
Look, I know we had our troubles,

517
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:22,901
but I think that
if we'd been given the chance,

518
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,988
we'd have done a really
good job raising those girls.

519
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:31,952
- You want to see 'em?
- Are you kidding?

520
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,787
Wait, wait.

521
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:37,291
When you said the girls reverted,
what exactly did you mean?

522
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,334
You'll see.

523
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:43,088
- Mommy! Hi, Mommy!
- Hi, Mommy!

524
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:47,801
- Mommy, let's sing a song, okay?
- I see the problem.

525
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:51,138
There's another.
Your mother took the reversal spell.

526
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,765
That's okay, I've got one
of my own. Calm down!

527
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:56,810
Mommy, I met this boy
and he's really, really cute.

528
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:59,813
We'll talk about the boy later.
And everything else.

529
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,317
We've got so much to catch up on.
Right now, stand over there.

530
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,402
- Is Leo a demon?
- Now!

531
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:07,154
- OK.
- Please.

532
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:10,407
- She said now, Phoebe.
- I heard her, Piper!

533
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:12,659
- OK, OK.
- Today, Phoebe!

534
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,912
You're so bossy!

535
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:21,502
Reverse the spell from the Book
and please restore what was... took

536
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:24,254
I made it up when I was nine.

537
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,889
How does this work?
You remember everything?

538
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:38,352
Oh, my God. Yes. Leslie.

539
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,313
Oh, my goodness.
I tongued a student.

540
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,275
Piper, there's something I've
gotta tell you about Wyatt and Leo.

541
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:48,946
No, Dad, I already know. You're right.
Leo would never hurt Wyatt.

542
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:53,200
We overheard everything
you guys were talking about.

543
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:56,578
OK, let's go. We've got a demon
to kill and a child to save.

544
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:04,878
That's our girl.

545
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:09,466
Are you sure this is gonna work?

546
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:11,760
How many times
are you gonna ask me that?

547
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:13,595
Sorry, just nervous.

548
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:16,223
I just wish we knew
what the hell was going on.

549
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,975
Whatever's going on,

550
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:22,187
I'm pretty sure the demon
has something to do with Leo.

551
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:24,398
What? I'm just saying.

552
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:27,109
Do you ever wonder
what it would have been like

553
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:29,778
if Mom and Dad both raised us?

554
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:32,197
All the time.

555
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:41,165
- Oh, my God.
- Piper, it's not Leo. Throw the potion.

556
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,587
- OK, that should have worked.
- Piper!

557
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,930
You promised that the potion would work.

558
00:34:57,097 --> 00:35:00,142
It was supposed to!
I couldn't have made it any stronger.

559
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:03,812
Well, why didn't it? We can't stop
someone from stealing my son?

560
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:07,733
Okay, you need to calm down and
just try to focus on how to find them.

561
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,861
Girls, I think your mother
may be on to something here.

562
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:14,156
This seems somehow
vaguely familiar to me, that's all.

563
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:15,741
Familiar how?

564
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:19,703
I'm not sure. You said you saw
the demon appear at Magic School.

565
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,039
Do you know
what Wyatt was doing before?

566
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:23,248
Sleeping?

567
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:26,043
Or maybe... dreaming.

568
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,921
He appeared in the attic
when everyone was arguing.

569
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,172
In front of Wyatt.

570
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:33,008
The demon showed up
after Grams snapped at Wyatt.

571
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:35,052
Tell me what's going on.

572
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:41,016
When you were a little girl, right
after your father and I split up...

573
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:44,770
You started having bad dreams.
Doctor called 'em night terrors.

574
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:48,106
He said it was your
subconscious way of blaming yourself.

575
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:50,359
Piper is the cause of your divorce?

576
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:54,238
No, no. No, of course not. It was...

577
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,114
Other things.

578
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:59,326
All this family history
stuff is really interesting,

579
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,829
but how is this
gonna help us find Wyatt?

580
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:06,542
I think what they're saying
is it's the same thing.

581
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:09,837
Wyatt is blaming himself
just like you blamed yourself.

582
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,839
Except because Wyatt is powerful,

583
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:15,217
he made his night terrors
come to life when he felt conflict.

584
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:20,055
Why would he make something up
to hurt himself? And why Leo?

585
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:23,892
Because... I'm the bad guy.

586
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:27,771
As far as he's concerned,
if I hadn't killed Gideon and saved him,

587
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:31,483
I wouldn't be so lost.
I'd be around here, I'd be home.

588
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,194
- He thinks it's his fault.
- That's ridiculous.

589
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:37,322
No, it's not. I can relate.

590
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,579
How did you figure this all out?

591
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:46,832
Let's just say somebody
helped me look in the mirror.

592
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:48,500
So how do we find him?

593
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:51,086
We go to where he thinks it all started.

594
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:53,964
Where I killed Gideon.

595
00:36:55,632 --> 00:37:00,262
This is gonna get your Mommy and Daddy
back together... one way or the other.

596
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,681
That's what you want most of all,
isn't it?

597
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,418
It's not your fault, Wyatt.

598
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:34,296
None of this is.
You didn't do anything wrong.

599
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:39,343
I'm the reason things are all messed up.

600
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,969
Not you.

601
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:46,350
You and Chris and Mommy
mean everything to me.

602
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:51,647
You're the things
that keep me from falling apart.

603
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:57,569
Come on, baby, come home.

604
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:00,864
Daddy's not going anywhere, I promise.

605
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:22,094
I'm so sorry.

606
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:25,097
It's not your fault,
it's not anybody's fault.

607
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:30,227
Still, I don't know what to do.
I don't know how to find my way again.

608
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:32,729
Yes, you do. You just have to try.

609
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:54,626
Can I come in?

610
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:57,212
Sure, it's your office.

611
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,840
- May I sit down?
- Please, please.

612
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:06,805
I just came by to thank you
for what you did yesterday.

613
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:08,515
Are you kidding me?

614
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:12,186
After that nice long hug,
I figured I came out ahead on the deal.

615
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:15,439
Yeah, that was
the three martinis talking.

616
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,611
Well, you had wine,
and just one glass, but anyway.

617
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:25,115
Well, I hugged you because I was just,
you know, grateful for what you did.

618
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:28,452
- You squeezed me pretty tight.
- I was pretty grateful.

619
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:31,246
There was nothing else
besides gratitude?

620
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:33,290
What would you like there to be?

621
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:36,043
Just admit it, you like me.

622
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,836
How can you be so sure of that?

623
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:41,423
Oh, I don't know,
the 28 phone calls in two hours.

624
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:43,967
Caller ID.

625
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:50,682
Yeah, well, that was because
my redial button was broken.

626
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:52,976
So it just kept redialing you.

627
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:55,812
You were the last number
I called. So it just...

628
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,439
Right.

629
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:02,277
Well, thank you.

630
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:14,790
If she turns around,
it means she likes me.

631
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:18,710
Come on, Phoebe, don't let me down.

632
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:21,421
You can do it. Turn around.

633
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,053
Thattagirl.

634
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:43,735
Are you OK?

635
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:46,822
Yeah.

636
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:52,035
It's just...
leaving's always the hardest part.

637
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,412
I shouldn't have...

638
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,455
No, no, no. I'm glad you did.

639
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,916
I wanted to be here for this, for them.

640
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:02,504
It's just... hard,

641
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:05,465
you know, the price I pay
for being dead, I guess.

642
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:13,473
We missed a lot.

643
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:16,935
Not being able to raise them together.

644
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,521
I know.

645
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:23,775
But we made up for it
a little bit today, didn't we?

646
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:25,027
Yeah.

647
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:28,280
All right, already.
Break it up, kids entering.

648
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:31,033
Grams? You coming down?

649
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,035
Oh, she's being a martyr.

650
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:36,205
Grams, please!

651
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:37,539
Last call, woman!

652
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:38,916
Oh, very well.

653
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:41,168
Just so we're clear,

654
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:44,922
my way would have worked too.
Nevertheless, you're all forgiven.

655
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:48,217
- Except Leo.
- Why not me?

656
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:50,093
Because I owe you the apology.

657
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:53,138
I'm sorry I thought you were evil.

658
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:55,140
Not that you could blame me.

659
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:58,352
- That's an apology?
- I'd take it if I were you.

660
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,896
Let's do this before I change my mind.

661
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:16,245
I call forth from space and time

662
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:19,206
Matriarchs from the Halliwell line

663
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:22,751
Mothers, daughters, sisters, friends

664
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:27,130
Our family spirit without end
