1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,590
It's even brighter than
it was an hour ago.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,998
It's like magic and science
and fairy tales all rolled up into one.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,033
Actually, it's ions speeding
into the Earth's magnetic field,

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,395
and then they collide
with air molecules.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,989
Do you guys think it's weird
that the aurora borealis

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,628
is happening the night before
the Wiccan Festival of Lights?

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,918
I've been so busy planning for the
baby, I forgot tomorrow's a sabbat.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,152
Yep, it's definitely a time
of renewal and growth.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,833
Oh, please don't say growth.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,391
If this little thing gets any bigger,
I'll never be able to snap back.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,558
Hey, is that a shiver?
I think I detected a shiver.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,554
- You should go inside with that shiver.
- I'm fine. I'm feeling fine.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,709
You didn't look so fine

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,235
when you were bent over the toilet
puking your guts out today.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,073
Nausea, headaches,
all a normal part of pregnancy.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,233
Along with gas, heartburn,
a constant need to pee.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,152
It sounds fun.

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,869
Another golden goose.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,871
You would think
the magical community

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,395
could find maybe something else
to give to the baby?

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,120
- No, it's the hot item this year.
- Clearly.

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,397
Yeah, I could definitely melt this down
and make a fashionable ring.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,033
You are not keeping that.

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,714
Here, goosie, goosie, goosie!

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,069
As much as I am enjoying
this spectacle,

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,196
I think we should really
send those things back.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,595
Dad is in town tomorrow,
he wants to stop by for a visit.

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,156
He does get very Darrin Stephens
about our whole magic thing.

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,151
Yeah, we should maybe
have Leo ask the Elders

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,197
what the policy
is on magical gift returns.

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,590
We don't want a curse
put on the family or anything.

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,796
Yes, good idea.

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,912
I wonder what the Elders
want this late.

34
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,991
Well, I don't know,
but you go find out.

35
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,593
And keep it down
when you come back,

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,512
because I'm gonna head up.

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,552
- Or maybe down.
- Piper.

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,914
- Piper.
- Piper.

39
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,399
Leo.

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,552
What's going on?

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,917
I don't know. I can't heal her.
She won't come to.

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,276
Okay, to the hospital. Come on.

43
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,920
You scared us.

44
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,311
Me too. Guess I'm not
so invincible after all.

45
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,040
Yeah, maybe we need to start
taking better care of you.

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,713
No, it was my fault.

47
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,110
Everybody was telling me
to slow down.

48
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,352
It's not your fault.
We're all in uncharted territory.

49
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,309
The Elders said that this was a special
child, and anything can happen.

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,549
Let's not forget that.

51
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,635
How are you feeling?

52
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,355
Tired and weak.

53
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,438
Well, I've got your test results here,
but I can't find your chart.

54
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,160
- When are you due?
- Six weeks.

55
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,958
And who is your regular doctor?

56
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,359
We don't have one.

57
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,953
We've sort of been seeing
alternative medical practitioners.

58
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,717
You don't have an ob-gyn?

59
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,469
We're training to be midwives.

60
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,349
I'm open to all forms of healing,

61
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,073
but a woman in her third trimester

62
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,754
should have had ultrasounds
and blood work done by now.

63
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,349
A medical doctor could have
caught your condition earlier.

64
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,309
My condition?

65
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,674
Toxemia.

66
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,832
It's a form of high blood pressure
in pregnant women.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,639
Do you deal with unusual
stress in your life?

68
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,553
Very unusual.

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,358
Is it serious?

70
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,275
Toxemia restricts blood flow
and food and oxygen to the placenta.

71
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,592
It can result in a small baby,
a premature delivery,

72
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,149
or it can lead
to other complications,

73
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,151
none of which you need
to worry about now.

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,392
Most women respond quickly
to the treatment.

75
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,279
Okay, so give me the treatment.

76
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,436
The treatment involves a no-salt diet,
no stress, and lots of bed rest.

77
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,591
Do that and the symptoms
should reverse.

78
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,432
I'll be back later to check on you.

79
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,912
Well, that's probably
why I couldn't heal you.

80
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,435
High blood pressure isn't just physical,
it's a state of mind.

81
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,959
No stress and bed rest.
Do you think you can handle that?

82
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,918
Yeah, I can handle that.
I'll do anything.

83
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,278
So will we.

84
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,077
Oh, I have waited a lifetime for this.

85
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,313
The aurora borealis
is a rare sight indeed, sir.

86
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,511
It's much more than that.

87
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,956
Two centuries ago,
when I became an apprentice,

88
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,796
I devoted my life to sorcery and
the black arts, and do you know why?

89
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,439
No, sir.

90
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,196
In the hope that an ancient prophecy,
which my mentor kept hidden,

91
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,828
would one day come to pass.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,353
Has it?

93
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,910
Look up. The signs are converging.

94
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,791
The future of all magic hangs
in the balance, and only I know it.

95
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,316
- And now I know it too, sir.
- Why, yes you do.

96
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,072
That's why you're going to help me

97
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,312
by attacking the Charmed Ones
tomorrow with fireballs.

98
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,109
Fireballs? No, no, fireballs
are useless against those witches.

99
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,432
Well, actually, you'll be lucky
to have any fireball power at all

100
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,477
if things happen the way
I expect them to.

101
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,118
Sounds like suicide, sir.

102
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,595
Suicide? Sacrifice.

103
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,958
It's an opportunity of a lifetime
to have power over good forever.

104
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,274
This is a kind of mission
that turns demons into legends.

105
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,115
Your name will go down in infamy.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,833
- Really?
- Yes.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,116
- What's your name again?
- Stanley.

108
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,990
Stanley.
Stanley, it all starts with you.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,597
Attack the witches. Go down fighting.
Secure your legacy.

110
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,069
I'll do my best, sir.

111
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,233
Greetings from the Dead Sea.

112
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,998
What did you eat over there?

113
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,789
It's not me, it's the sulphur in the mud.
It has healing properties.

114
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,077
You know, people come from
all over the world just to get this stuff.

115
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,710
Yeah, well, we want Piper to feel
like she's in a spa, not some sewer.

116
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,039
I guess you're right.
I just wanted the best for her.

117
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,235
I know, sweetie.

118
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,472
We're gonna take good care
of her and the baby, I promise.

119
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,200
- Hello?
- There she is.

120
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,750
Welcome home, honey.
Or should I say, "Your Highness"?

121
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,675
Because from now on,
we are your loyal subjects.

122
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,513
We even turned your bedroom
into a royal throne room.

123
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,272
Let me take you there now,
my queen.

124
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,795
All right, knock it off,
before I cut your heads off.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,949
- I don't want any special treatment.
- Piper, we love you. Let us love you.

126
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,998
Yeah, I mean, as your sisters,
and your midwives,

127
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,075
we feel it's our duty to provide you
with solitude and serenity and...

128
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,031
A gaggle of geese.

129
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,398
I thought you were gonna
get rid of those.

130
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,999
You said you were
gonna ask the Elders

131
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,388
on magical gift-return policies.

132
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,797
Okay, you guys, it's fine.
Everything is fine.

133
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,949
It's not gonna bother me.

134
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,588
I'm not gonna let anything bother me,
for the sake of my daughter.

135
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,835
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,831
I'll take you upstairs.

137
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,951
I thought you said you tied them up.

138
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,270
I did, but the little flockers
got loose.

139
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,556
Okay, we have to do better
than this for Piper.

140
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,358
I mean, if we can't
keep geese away from her,

141
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,278
how are we supposed to protect
her from demons?

142
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,668
Okay, you're right, you're right.

143
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,319
We should take turns
guarding the manor.

144
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,871
You know, who knows what kind
of weirdo stuff's gonna show up here.

145
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,920
Oh, my goodness, it's a unicorn.

146
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,991
Yes, it is. In our kitchen.

147
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,957
Is that another baby present?
You think, maybe?

148
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,118
Yeah, the best one ever.

149
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,677
Okay, Paige, while unicorns
may be very magical and cool,

150
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,512
I'm not so sure it's appropriate
for a baby.

151
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,154
Oh, come on now.
Our little niece will grow into it.

152
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,390
I'm not so sure about that.
Have you seen those hooves?

153
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,232
And how are we gonna
baby-proof that horn?

154
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,549
Hey, look, there's a card.

155
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,909
"From: EI."

156
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,718
EI? Do we know anybody
in Spain?

157
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,394
Paige, I don't care who it's from, okay?
It just can't be here now.

158
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,630
It's way too much stress
for Piper and the baby, okay?

159
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,313
So just orb it out of here.

160
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,313
I can't. Unicorns are
mythical beasts from another world.

161
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,913
Where do you propose I orb it to?

162
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,039
I don't care where you orb it to,
just get it out of here, okay?

163
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,670
Fine, I'll orb it somewhere safe
and tie it up until we figure it out.

164
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,671
- What was that?
- I can't orb it.

165
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,188
Okay, stand back.

166
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,796
<i>Take this beast
BeFore I end her</i>

167
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,951
<i>Ship her back
Return to sender</i>

168
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,233
Wait, why aren't my powers working?

169
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,874
Apple.

170
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,839
- Nothing.
- Oh, no.

171
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,318
I can't levitate. I'm grounded.

172
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,272
- Something's wrong. I can't orb.
- Yeah, yeah.

173
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,795
I was trying to go find out
how to get rid of the geese...

174
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,552
And why is there a unicorn
in the kitchen?

175
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,517
Forget the unicorn.
Our magic's down too.

176
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,914
- It is?
- Okay, whatever hit us,

177
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,832
we have to assume
also hit Piper, okay?

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,912
And she can't find out about this until
we know what's going on, because...

179
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,315
- Hello? Where is everybody?
- Why is she out of bed?

180
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,708
- I don't know.
- Go put her back.

181
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,552
Go, go.

182
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,909
All right, Paige,

183
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,152
you take the magical farm animals
and put them down in the basement.

184
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,311
<i>I'm gonna get the Book,
and I'll meet you down there.</i>

185
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,638
All right, you're Spanish.

186
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,639
Why are you on your feet?

187
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,951
I was coming down to get some food.
A person could starve around here.

188
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,553
Hi. Bye.

189
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,034
All right, well, come on upstairs.

190
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,191
I'll get your food.
You're supposed to be on bed rest.

191
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,516
Okay, well, "bed rest"
doesn't actually mean...

192
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,669
Yes, it does.

193
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,549
The doctor said,
"Stay off your feet and relax."

194
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,753
Here, Mr. Unicorn.

195
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,394
Relax. Everybody keeps
telling me to relax.

196
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,552
Like it's something you do.
Like switching off a light.

197
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,159
You need to learn how
to do it, Piper,

198
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,311
if you're gonna get
your blood pressure under control.

199
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,277
My blood pressure would
not be a problem

200
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,795
if we had been seeing a doctor
like we were supposed to.

201
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,996
I knew that was coming.
Come on, sit down.

202
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,755
Don't treat me like a baby factory.
I can sit myself down.

203
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,233
All these fears
about a magical baby,

204
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,153
and "don't let the doctors find out,"
and "we'll buy a birthing ball,"

205
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,231
and "Paige and Phoebe
will be midwives."

206
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,391
And you know what?
We were wrong.

207
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,715
How can you say that?

208
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,797
Because, somehow,
in the middle of all this,

209
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,916
we forgot the most
important thing of all:

210
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,439
What's best for the baby.

211
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,236
Well, that's not fair. A lot of people
decide to have babies at home.

212
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,637
Maybe so,
but I was not one of them.

213
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,030
And this baby is not even
out of the womb yet,

214
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,509
and I'm already screwing up
as a mother.

215
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,838
- You haven't screwed up.
- Yes. I did, Leo. I did.

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,036
I have a disease
that is threatening our baby,

217
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,875
and I could have avoided it
if I had just trusted my instincts.

218
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,200
Well, what are your instincts
telling you now?

219
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,674
To have this baby in a hospital.

220
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,319
Okay.

221
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,311
I'll make arrangements today.

222
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,029
Oh, really? And what happens when
she's delivered in swaddling orbs?

223
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,879
We'll deal with it then.

224
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,352
From now on, I want you
to feel safe and secure, okay?

225
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,519
No! No magic, no magic, no mag...

226
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,678
It's just too much stress
on your body.

227
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,396
Like that mess on the floor
is not gonna stress me out?

228
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,117
Well, I'll clean it up.

229
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,673
Hello?

230
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,033
Sure.

231
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,828
It's one of your charges.

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,513
Since when do they
use the telephone?

233
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,073
Since I've been ignoring them to spend
more time with my lovely wife.

234
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,551
Excuse me.

235
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,199
Hello.

236
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,356
There you go.

237
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,432
Come on, come on. Come on.

238
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,470
Okay, look at this. Check this out.

239
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,393
<i>The whole Book has been erased.</i>

240
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,033
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

241
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,156
<i>And without the Book,
I don't know how to find out.</i>

242
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,199
It's like someone's taken the magic
and erased it from our entire family.

243
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,990
I think it's bigger than that.

244
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,918
Oh, was that from one
of our golden geese?

245
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,829
Yeah, I don't think we're gonna
be able to return them now.

246
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,594
What is going on?

247
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,159
You know, this all started
when el mystery mare arrived.

248
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,073
Maybe she's a Trojan unicorn
sent to suck away our magic.

249
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,038
No, I doubt it. Unicorns are
the essence of good magic.

250
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,634
If anything, they should
enhance our powers, not steal them.

251
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,994
What about the sky last night?

252
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,591
What, the northern lights
on the eve of a sabbat?

253
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,079
Yeah, it could be a mystical sign,

254
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,037
but don't those normally
come in threes?

255
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,599
Where's the third?

256
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,589
Have you been experiencing

257
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,593
uncontrollable emotional
mood swings in the last week?

258
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,394
Am I that transparent?

259
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,997
No, but read your horoscope.

260
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,350
Jupiter, Mars and Saturn
are all in Gemini.

261
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,397
That only happens once
every 300 years.

262
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,989
Holy Hannah!

263
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,317
It's like the universe is practically
screaming at us to get our attention.

264
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,875
- Yeah, but what is it trying to say?
- I don't know.

265
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,798
But I got a lot of
research books in the attic.

266
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,029
I'm gonna go check them out.

267
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,315
Okay, I'll meet you up there.

268
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,313
I'm gonna try to figure out
a way to wrangle the geese.

269
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,238
Good luck.

270
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,439
Hey, who the hell are you?

271
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,111
They call me Stanley.

272
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,113
I was afraid of that.

273
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,918
At least it's a level playing field.

274
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,158
<i>Tonight, Tabitha is going
to get her revenge</i>

275
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,199
<i>on all oF Harmony.</i>

276
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,438
Like that spell would have worked.

277
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,958
- What was that?
- What?

278
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,348
That.

279
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,276
Oh, that. That's probably the girls
trying to run down the geese.

280
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,195
Tricky birds, you know.

281
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,759
Listen, I'll go help out. You relax.

282
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,638
Hey!

283
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,789
My name will haunt
you to your grave.

284
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,949
- What was his name again?
- I don't remember.

285
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,428
What's with the leftovers?

286
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,791
Well, his magic ran out just like ours.

287
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,754
Okay, so we have no powers,
demons have no powers.

288
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,512
- What is going on here?
- I don't know.

289
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,750
I got a call from a charge,
and her powers are down too.

290
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,876
So I unplugged the phone
in case we get more calls.

291
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,234
I don't want Piper to panic.

292
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,395
Well, it's official.
Magic's down everywhere.

293
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,679
- I thought you tied her up?
- I did, she eats through everything.

294
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,757
Oh, God, what time is it?
That's probably Dad.

295
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,117
- I'll get the unicorn.
- We got the body.

296
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,838
Ready?

297
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,275
- Come on, dead guy.
- Hello? Anybody home?

298
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,919
Let's go.

299
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,597
Hello?

300
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,592
Somebody get that.

301
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,192
Phoebe, Paige,
I'd like you to meet Doris.

302
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,154
Doris?

303
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,551
My new wife,
and your new stepmother.

304
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,039
Hi.

305
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,597
How are you married?

306
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,079
We didn't even know
you were dating.

307
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,958
Or that you date at all,
for that matter, Dad.

308
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,391
- Well, it happened pretty fast.
- Yes, we met on the singles cruise.

309
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,552
Oh, that trip to Mexico,
that was a singles cruise?

310
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,676
- I'm a man of many mysteries.
- Clearly.

311
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,592
Where's Piper?
I want to share the good news.

312
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,950
Oh, God, no, that's okay.
She's upstairs resting.

313
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,588
We found out last night that
she has a blood-pressure condition.

314
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,995
- She's okay?
- Oh, yeah, she's fine, don't worry.

315
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,838
At least, don't let her
see you worry anyway.

316
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,914
Poor thing. Young women today
are under so many pressures.

317
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,593
Is she eating enough garlic?

318
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,716
Because it dilates
the blood vessels, you know.

319
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,155
Oh, well, we'll have
to fix some of that up.

320
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,675
Oh, let me take that for you.

321
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,678
- We're all out of hangers.
- Hey, Dad.

322
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,791
Hey, Piper.

323
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,635
I heard the news.
You shouldn't be on your feet.

324
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,472
Dad's got some news of his own.

325
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,669
Gently, though, Dad.

326
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,071
We don't want her to drop
that calf right there on the stairs.

327
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,155
Piper, I want you to meet Doris,

328
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,514
my new bride.

329
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,032
Yeah.

330
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,111
- Hello, Piper.
- Hi.

331
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,999
Hi, Doris.

332
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,833
Welcome to the family, I guess.

333
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,513
I know it's kind of sudden.

334
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,035
But sometimes when life
drops a peach at your feet,

335
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,668
you gotta stop
and make some cobbler.

336
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,357
That is always my motto,
isn't that funny?

337
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,476
Apparently they met
on the singles cruise.

338
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,517
Did you know Dad
goes on singles cruises?

339
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,950
Oh, it was like in the movies.

340
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,272
Our eyes met across the buffet bar.
Your dad is so handsome.

341
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,552
And, well, I told him, don't eat the rolls,
you know, too much processed flour.

342
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,115
Anyway, we stayed up
all night long talking,

343
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,118
and by the morning, we just knew.

344
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,548
She devastates me.

345
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,313
Okay, I put away the uni... cycle.

346
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,711
- What unicycle?
- It's a baby gift.

347
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,078
- Hey, Victor.
- Leo.

348
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,433
Hello, I'm Doris.
I'm your new mother-in-law.

349
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,751
Oh, hi.
I guess I missed a lot, didn't I?

350
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,359
Okay, now that we've all met,

351
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,154
maybe the two lucky newlyweds
should check into the hotel,

352
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,430
because it's crazy here,
and then we'll call you...

353
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,556
Oh, no. We're not going anywhere.

354
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,832
- You're not?
- No, I volunteered at the hospital.

355
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,195
We can stay
and help take care of you.

356
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,759
You can?

357
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,032
I look forward to some
real mother-daughter bonding.

358
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,031
You do, huh?

359
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,789
Well, you know, now that
we figured out you're staying here,

360
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,712
let's get Piper off her feet, shall we?

361
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,117
- You can't leave me alone with her.
- Yeah, yeah.

362
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,919
We have to, because what if
that's another magical baby gift?

363
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,915
- Come on, upstairs.
- Come on.

364
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,552
- Can I help you?
- To save magic? I hope so.

365
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,352
Okay, sorcerers
don't just drop by our house.

366
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,351
What makes you think
we're not gonna vanquish you?

367
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,154
Because you can't.

368
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,749
Didn't you get my message?

369
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,394
My apprentice was supposed
to drop by this morning.

370
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,350
Oh, that guy. He's dead in our closet.
But he didn't give us a message.

371
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,357
Because he was the message.

372
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,553
To demonstrate
the dire nature of our situation.

373
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,716
So you're saying demons
don't have power either?

374
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,351
Down to the last imp.

375
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,195
There's fear and panic everywhere.

376
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,354
Demons stuck in the underworld
with no way up,

377
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,159
others stuck topside
with no way down.

378
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,079
Oh, poor little evil creatures.

379
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,629
Well, I see your flowers
haven't died yet.

380
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,989
They will,

381
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,314
with no gnomes or garden nymphs
to spin their delicate magic.

382
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,436
Don't go getting all enchanted on us.

383
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,955
Oh, don't worry.

384
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,635
I hate good magic, fairy tales,

385
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,634
wishes on stars, and children
who believe in Santa Claus.

386
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,992
Mortals don't know it exists,

387
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,038
but magic infuses
all their hopes and dreams.

388
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,040
Stand back. I think he's gonna
break out in song.

389
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,633
Oh, hardly.

390
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,199
Nothing would give me
more pleasure

391
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,755
than to watch it all ripped
from the world.

392
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,033
So why not just sit back
and watch the show?

393
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,639
- Why come to us?
- Because I want my power back.

394
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,633
Magic must be saved,
and it's up to us.

395
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,072
Us? We're us. You're them.
We don't help thems, sorry.

396
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,391
You can't fix this by yourselves.

397
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,518
That's why you invited me
here to your back yard.

398
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,636
But together,

399
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,075
together we can
interpret the signs.

400
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,319
You were right about the signs.

401
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,474
Okay, so, what do you propose
that we do?

402
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,838
A summit between good and evil
to discuss the crisis.

403
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,709
Of course, there'd be certain rules.
No guns, no knives, et cetera.

404
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,278
You know, the exit's that way,
so if you wanna just:

405
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,237
We don't have much time.

406
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,075
The longer magic is down,
the harder it is to restore.

407
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,353
My cell phone's on the back
in case your sister changes her mind.

408
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,591
Cronyn, huh?
When do sorcerers have cell phones?

409
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,352
You think that's bad?

410
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,116
I got a taxi waiting out front. Call me.

411
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,748
I don't trust him.

412
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,515
Yeah, but I kind of liked his whole
world-without-magic speech.

413
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,631
- It was very Capra.
- It was pure crappa.

414
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,358
I don't wanna help evil.

415
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,112
What evil?

416
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,750
A sorcerer wants to arrange
peace talks for the whole magic crisis.

417
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,672
Oh, yeah, and Phoebe's
actually considering it.

418
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,991
Well, of course I'm considering it.
The future of magic is at stake here.

419
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,991
Not to mention
the future of my niece.

420
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,516
<i>And what else do we have right now?
No powers, no Book, no Elders.</i>

421
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,835
Phoebe's right. Without magic,

422
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,594
Piper and the baby are vulnerable.
We can't protect them.

423
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,159
Okay, fine, but if there's a meeting,

424
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,390
we're going in heavy
in case it's a trap.

425
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,120
Okay, but Cronyn said no weapons.

426
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,315
And you trust him?

427
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,717
Leo, I'm gonna need some saltpetre
and cayenne pepper from the kitchen.

428
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,757
- For what?
- A homemade arsenal.

429
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,957
Phoebe, would you kindly
get an aerosol can?

430
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,396
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time to lock and load.

431
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,316
I knew this gift basket
would come in handy.

432
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,989
And lucky for you,
I am always ready for emergencies.

433
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,513
You should have seen
our first date.

434
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,509
Your father spilled steak sauce
all down the front of his shirt.

435
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,712
And Doris pulls out a bottle
of stain remover from her purse.

436
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,275
Of course, I licked it
off your chin first.

437
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,918
Oh, that's so sweet.

438
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,589
Hi, honey. What are you doing?

439
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,670
I'm just taking Paige some spices.

440
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,992
She's gonna make a homeopathic
remedy to help you relax. See you.

441
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,598
Homeopathic medicine?
You're into homeopathic medicine?

442
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,638
I knew I was gonna love this family.
This is unbelievable.

443
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,110
My first husband passed away
a couple of years ago. Heart attack.

444
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,840
And the first thing I did
when we got home from the cruise

445
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,833
is put your father
on a low-fat, high-fibre diet.

446
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,071
And a monthly colonic.

447
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,672
Hi, Phoebe.
Come, sit, talk with us, please.

448
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,434
Oh, I can't.
I have a big meeting at work.

449
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,915
- You have hairspray I could borrow?
- You have hairspray.

450
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,435
Yeah, but mine is non-aerosol,
and it's a really big meeting,

451
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,876
so I need aerosol
for that super-firm hold, you know.

452
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,152
- Check my bathroom.
- Great.

453
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,995
Oh, honey, you know what?
There's no cheese knife here.

454
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,878
Would you mind
going downstairs and getting it?

455
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,957
Absolutely, baby doll.

456
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,440
Oh, girls,

457
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,037
I just wanted to let you know
how I feel about your father. I...

458
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,875
I just feel so, so lucky.

459
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,873
He's... He's the most
special man I've ever met.

460
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,549
Thank you.

461
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,676
That's the sweetest thing
you could ever say to us.

462
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,950
Well, it's true.
You know, he's so...

463
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:48,468
He's so kind, and he's so sensitive,
and he's the most exciting lover.

464
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,875
Oh, I mean, girlfriends,
he can go all night. I'm not kidding.

465
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,074
- You hear? Gotta go to that meeting.
- Don't leave me.

466
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,237
That was Cronyn.
He says he'll meet us in an hour.

467
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,868
He suggested one of his,
you know, dark chambers.

468
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,036
I suggested Manny's Pizzeria.

469
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,760
Nice. Public venue.
Way to go. What is that?

470
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,275
- This would be a pipe bomb, dear.
- Oh, what...?

471
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,431
I was good at chem lab
in high school.

472
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,319
- How's the candle coming?
- Fine. Needs a few minutes to set.

473
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,436
- You sure it'll give us smoke?
- Total whiteout.

474
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,437
As long as you
put six parts saltpetre in there.

475
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,909
Okay, we have:

476
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,312
One flammable spray can,
one lotion-bottle bomb,

477
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,075
smoking candle,
two sharpened nail files,

478
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,750
four cayenne pepper-spray straws,
and assorted rings and bracelets?

479
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,231
Kind of makes you appreciate
your powers, doesn't it?

480
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,868
We don't need no stinking powers
to kick some demon ass.

481
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,069
Well, maybe you don't.

482
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,037
You're a little better
at the mano a mano stuff.

483
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,873
Speaking of, I have some
extra gifts for you, my dear.

484
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,479
Hey.

485
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,434
These were mine,
and now they'll be yours.

486
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,758
Chain-mail top from my club days.

487
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,435
Steel-toed boots
from my mosh-pit days.

488
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,757
Handcuffs from last Friday.

489
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,796
Hey, do you think
we're making a huge mistake

490
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,439
by not telling Piper about this?

491
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,830
No, absolutely not.
I think she needs to relax.

492
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,554
I agree. Piper's not just carrying
the next generation Halliwell.

493
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,512
She's carrying
the next generation of magic.

494
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,429
Then let's go save them.

495
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,395
Okay, the last question is,

496
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,678
"What is your lover's
favourite article of clothing?"

497
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,277
It has to be your grey cardigan.
Am I right?

498
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,874
As always, baby doll.

499
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,633
Okay, that's 19 out of 20.

500
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,352
That makes our romance rating:
Jalapeño hot.

501
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,556
Hey, somebody get in here.

502
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,473
Hi.

503
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,632
I may be stuck in bed,
but I am not stuck on stupid.

504
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,199
I know that something's going on.

505
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,195
Well, you wanted a doctor,
and she told you to relax,

506
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,311
so relax.

507
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,717
How can I relax when I know that
you're hiding something from me?

508
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,514
All the strange noises
and weird behaviour.

509
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,557
Why don't you just tell me
what's going on?

510
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,039
Okay. I'm sorry, you guys.
We need a moment.

511
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,833
A magical moment.

512
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,470
All right, then.

513
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,349
Okay, well, it's really nothing
to worry about.

514
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,995
Magic has disappeared
from the world,

515
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,435
and Phoebe and Paige went
to have a summit meeting with evil

516
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,358
so they can fix it.

517
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,670
See? Nothing to worry about.

518
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,958
I see. Okay.

519
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,158
I am not gonna
get upset about this.

520
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,518
I am just gonna
blow you to pieces.

521
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,072
See, I tried to tell you.

522
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,316
Oh, no!

523
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,352
Listen, I'm sure it's nothing.

524
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,397
- Phoebe and Paige will...
- Leo, no.

525
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,757
My water just broke.

526
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,669
This is Merrill, our highest-ranking
wizard and personal mentor.

527
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,399
Kane, top advisor to the warlocks.

528
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,039
Check their bags for weapons.

529
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,510
Like we'd attack in front of civilians.
That's why we chose a public place.

530
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,476
You can't be too safe, you know.

531
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,797
What's with the candle?

532
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,398
We thought we'd try a Wiccan ritual
or two to try to bring back magic.

533
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,438
Let's get down to business.

534
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,271
Okay, well, wait a minute, bubs.

535
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,597
How do we know you guys
aren't packing weapons?

536
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,549
- You mean like this?
- Hey, now.

537
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,111
Did it just get very quiet in here?

538
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,875
You don't think we'd pass up
the opportunity

539
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,072
to take out the Charmed Ones,
now, do you?

540
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,512
No!

541
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,951
How did you do it?

542
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,276
This place must have been
crawling with customers.

543
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,954
We paid them to leave.

544
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,271
Of course, the owner wanted to stay,
but he's browning in the pizza oven.

545
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,671
What about magic?
Who's gonna fix it?

546
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,034
I got that covered.

547
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,356
Which is more
than I can say for you two.

548
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,752
If you don't think we came
prepared for this moment,

549
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,273
you are sadly mistaken.

550
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,873
We better fight our way out of this
or die trying. You ready?

551
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,155
Don't let them out alive.

552
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,516
What are we doing?
Why are we sitting here?

553
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,511
We need to go to the hospital. Now.

554
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,036
You need to relax. Your water broke.
It's no need to panic.

555
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,714
No, you are wrong.
My due date is six weeks away.

556
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,871
This baby is not ready
to come out.

557
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,270
- Please, take me to the hospital.
- Okay. Okay.

558
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,112
I just got off the phone
with your doctor,

559
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,430
and she said don't move
until she gets here.

560
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,875
- She's coming here?
- She's on her way now.

561
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,793
There, see?
Everything's gonna be okay.

562
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,632
I need Phoebe and Paige.
They trained so hard for this.

563
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,279
They should be here now.

564
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,635
I called Phoebe's cell phone.
There was no answer.

565
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,956
Well, can't you just, you know,

566
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,429
pop over there and get them
in that special way you do?

567
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,158
Kind of got a problem
with that right now.

568
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,879
Oh, my God! Contraction.

569
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,508
Okay, okay, just breathe.

570
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,357
That's it.

571
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,919
Piper needs all the love and support
we can give her right now, Leo.

572
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,310
- Go and get her sisters.
- Please.

573
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,678
You stay by her side
and keep her safe.

574
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,353
Okay.

575
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,871
Okay, it's over. I'm okay.

576
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,114
Now, the doctor said
I need to keep you warm.

577
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,114
So I'm gonna change all the sheets
and all these wet blankets, all right?

578
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,190
Hey, what if the baby comes
before the doctor gets here?

579
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,237
Do you know what to do?

580
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,311
I know exactly what to do.

581
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,638
Alrighty, then.

582
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,869
Where's Dad?

583
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,315
Oh, he decided to go with Leo.

584
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,837
But don't worry,
you still have family here.

585
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,476
- Where's Cronyn?
- He had business to attend to.

586
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,632
Yeah, I'll bet.

587
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,590
Did Cronyn bring down magic?

588
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,878
- He doesn't have the power.
- No, but you do.

589
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,752
Of course, you're his mentor.

590
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,309
What happened to magic?

591
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,316
Answer the lady's question.

592
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,476
Centuries ago,

593
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,196
I unearthed a quatrain
from the tomb of a wise apothecary.

594
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,870
<i>When three planets burn as one
Over a sky oF dancing light</i>

595
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,715
<i>And magic will rest on a holy day</i>

596
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,953
<i>to welcome a twice-blessed child</i>

597
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,477
Those are the signs that we saw.

598
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,911
The aurora borealis,
the planetary alignment,

599
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,195
the Wiccan sabbat.

600
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,920
Wait, back to the twice-blessed
child business, what is that?

601
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,593
- Cronyn is not after us.
- He's after Piper's baby.

602
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,919
Oh, my God!

603
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,672
That's why he led us here
to our slaughter,

604
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,359
so the power of three
couldn't find him.

605
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,431
When do we get our powers back?

606
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,309
When it's too late to use them.

607
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,712
The house line is dead.

608
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,350
Magic won't return to the world
until the baby is born,

609
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,478
which should be any minute.

610
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,433
Finally, Leo.

611
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,990
- Who are you?
- I'm here for your baby.

612
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,914
It'd be easier
if you'd just relax, Piper.

613
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,279
Breathe deeply.

614
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,268
And push.

615
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,918
She's fully effaced and dilated.

616
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,473
It won't be long now.

617
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,474
You can't have my baby.
I won't...

618
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,749
No, no, no.

619
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,717
He's not gonna hurt her
while she's in labour.

620
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,110
Okay, well, what if Leo's hurt,
or Dad?

621
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,714
There's only one way to save them.

622
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,473
A unicorn's horn
is pure, concentrated magic.

623
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,910
See, I told you all magic
wasn't down.

624
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,599
Okay, how did you know that?

625
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,440
Because the wizard stole the prophecy
from an apothecary,

626
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,079
an agent of good magic.

627
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,755
Wait, that would mean that the Elders
knew what he wrote.

628
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,394
Look, the card says "From: EI,"
that's gotta be for "the Elders."

629
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,114
They knew magic was gonna go down,
and that we'd be in danger.

630
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,395
Why didn't they just tell us?

631
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,068
They tried. Leo got a call
from the Elders, remember?

632
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,629
Then Piper passed out, and we
had to take her to the hospital.

633
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,438
And then they sent us
this little present.

634
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,910
I guess your magic is not affected
by what happens on Earth.

635
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,595
- What was that?
- The witches?

636
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,993
You stay here.

637
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,196
Where is my father?
What did you do to him?

638
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,799
Don't worry about such things.
Childbirth is painful enough.

639
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,395
If you do anything to my baby,
I will kill you.

640
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,430
I will hunt you and kill you,

641
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,955
even if it means coming back
from the dead.

642
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,429
And don't think
I won't find a way to do that.

643
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,990
We are not going
to hurt your baby, Piper.

644
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,118
We're going to raise her as our own.

645
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,316
She's going to be a powerful leader.

646
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,357
A great force of evil.

647
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,797
You should be proud, very proud.

648
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,869
Okay, one vanquish spell.

649
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,114
Stupid witch. You could have killed
the both of you.

650
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,477
She caught me off-guard.

651
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,676
Just get down here.

652
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,790
Get away from me!

653
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,791
Her contractions
are less than a minute apart.

654
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,319
Oh, God, please not now.

655
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,799
Step aside, bitch!

656
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,198
Yeah, that's our job.

657
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,158
Move, even breathe,
and she's dead.

658
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,675
- Vanquish him, Phoebe.
- Your sister will die.

659
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,679
You can still save the baby.

660
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,199
Oh, my God.

661
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,395
I'm warning you.

662
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,713
- Kill him.
- How can I?

663
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,154
Do it.

664
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,433
Phoebe, if you love me you will send
this crazy bastard straight to hell.

665
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,709
Now!

666
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,189
<i>Beast oF legend, myth and lore
Give my words the power to soar</i>

667
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,749
<i>and kill this evil evermore</i>

668
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,439
Is everybody okay?

669
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,353
I feel like I'm dying.

670
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,279
Oh, baby's coming.
Baby's coming. Okay.

671
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,152
It's okay. You're okay.

672
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,080
Okay, you're doing great, sweetie.
Yes, you are.

673
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,832
Let's see what we have here.

674
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,355
Oh, I see a head of dark hair.

675
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,155
- You do?
- What'd you expect, a blond?

676
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,270
- What did I miss?
- A lot!

677
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,953
Victor needs help.

678
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,754
- Here. Take this.
- Okay, okay.

679
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,070
Okay, breathe.
Keep breathing, keep breathing.

680
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,037
- It's okay.
- Breathe. Don't forget to breathe.

681
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,592
Very good. Okay, relax.
Relax, you're okay.

682
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,557
- Dad.
- Yeah, honey?

683
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,631
I'm sorry about your demon wife.

684
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,552
Oh, hush, don't think about that.

685
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,553
- I'm right here, baby.
- It's okay.

686
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,633
You okay? You're all right. Okay.

687
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,032
You're doing great.
You're doing great.

688
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,354
- Push, okay? Last push.
- I can't.

689
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,637
- You have to. Big one, big one! Push.
- You can do it.

690
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,234
- I can't!
- You can. You can.

691
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,550
- Yes, you can.
- Okay, push.

692
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,358
Push. Push.

693
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,390
Come on. Push.

694
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,790
Oh, I guess magic is coming back.

695
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,030
- Here we go. Here we go.
- That's it, baby.

696
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,196
I see a shoulder.

697
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,229
- And another shoulder.
- Push. Push!

698
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,675
An arm. And another arm.

699
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,191
Oh, it's something else,
something else.

700
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,235
Hi, baby. Hi.

701
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,519
You're okay. You're okay.

702
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,558
Look.

703
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,629
Is that what I think it is?

704
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,152
If you're referring to Mr. Winkie
between the legs, yes.

705
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,992
- It's a boy.
- You mean I get a boy?

706
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,873
Here you go, Mama.

707
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,509
Hi.

708
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,110
Hi, little guy, what are you doing?
Look what we did.

709
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,713
I see.

710
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,509
It's a miracle.

711
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,672
A little miracle.

712
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,758
He's beautiful.

713
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,232
Oh, you are safe,

714
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,915
you are loved,
and you are wise.

715
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,836
How you doing?
