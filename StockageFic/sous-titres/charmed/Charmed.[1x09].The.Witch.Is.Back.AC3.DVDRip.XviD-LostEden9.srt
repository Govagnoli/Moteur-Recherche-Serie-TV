1
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,949
- Matthew?
- Hello, Melinda.

2
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,035
Why?

3
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,620
Why did you betray me?

4
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,207
You got what you deserve.

5
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,960
So you never loved me?

6
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,880
All the passion? All the heat?

7
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,466
I had to make you trust me.

8
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,302
It was the only way
to share your powers.

9
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,597
And so now you have them.

10
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,933
So why would you turn me in?
You know I'll burn.

11
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,771
Had to keep my secret.

12
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,315
Well, you can keep your trinkets too.

13
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,448
- I'll find another witch to give it to.
- Maybe not.

14
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:17,493
What magic is this?

15
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,246
I'm taking back the powers
you stole from me.

16
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,542
<i>Outside of time, outside of gain</i>

17
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,754
<i>Know only sorrow, know only pain</i>

18
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,839
No!

19
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,329
Rex.

20
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:03,456
Good morning, Prue.

21
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,708
I've left a few things for you
to catalogue.

22
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,461
A marvellous shipment
from an estate back east.

23
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,755
- I'll get right on it.
- Thanks.

24
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,273
At last.

25
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:32,026
Freedom.

26
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,820
The world has changed.

27
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,240
What time is this?

28
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:41,910
- Excuse me?
- Where am I?

29
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,371
- Who are you?
- Matthew Tate.

30
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,000
And if you freed me from that locket,

31
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,170
you are a descendant
of Melinda Warren.

32
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:01,597
- Thank you.
- For what?

33
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:08,395
I tricked you into using
your power on me.

34
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:10,772
Now I have it.

35
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:20,782
Behind you, witch.

36
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:25,120
- How did you do that?
- I can share your powers,

37
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:27,289
but you can't share mine.

38
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,544
- What do you want?
- I want what Melinda took from me.

39
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:35,380
I want all three powers back.

40
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:42,179
Defend yourself. Stop time.

41
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:44,431
I can't.

42
00:03:44,764 --> 00:03:47,475
So you're not alone.

43
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:49,811
There are others.

44
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:56,484
And the family name
is now Halliwell.

45
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:58,486
Prue? Are you okay in there?

46
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:14,627
Hey. Did you see that?

47
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:26,842
I was just sitting there, you know,
reading sports,

48
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:28,927
having a cup of Joe, and bam,

49
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:33,056
this guy comes flying out of nowhere,
you know. Weird clothes,

50
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:35,517
bad manners.
Nearly fell right on top of me.

51
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:37,644
- When you say "fell"...?
- I mean fell.

52
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:40,689
You know, like from way up there,
I guess. I don't know.

53
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:44,025
- That's a ten-story drop, sir.
- Twelve.

54
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:47,571
And you're telling us that he just got up
and walked away without a scratch?

55
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:50,782
- That's what you're saying?
- Got a better explanation?

56
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:53,285
Excuse us.

57
00:06:57,372 --> 00:06:59,124
All right, Trudeau.

58
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,794
Pull out your secret ghost hunter
decoder ring, and let's hear it.

59
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:04,337
Look, Morris, I don't know, okay?

60
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:07,632
All I know is whatever happened
started up there in that office.

61
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:12,721
- So let's find out whose office it is.
- I already know.

62
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:15,056
It's Prue's.

63
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:22,313
So I suggested we add crab satay
to the lunch menu, and it was great.

64
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:24,107
Sold out. Do you like crab, Leo?

65
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:26,943
- You know what I'd love, Piper?
- What's that?

66
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:30,280
Is the ratchet extension.
Could you hand that to me?

67
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:32,073
Sure.

68
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:39,998
I know that.

69
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:41,541
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

70
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:45,837
Go away.

71
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:49,257
- Be right back, Leo.
- No problem.

72
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:53,344
- Stop it.
- My sentiments exactly.

73
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:55,888
Stop hinting around
and ask him out already.

74
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:58,015
- Give him your crab.
- Don't be disgusting.

75
00:07:58,224 --> 00:08:00,935
- Don't be so shy.
- What if he says no?

76
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:03,145
- Yeah, like that'll happen.
- No, I'm serious.

77
00:08:03,354 --> 00:08:06,607
- So am I.
- I'm very serious. I've never...

78
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:08,609
...you know...

79
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:12,238
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

80
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:14,031
You've never asked
a guy out before?

81
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,700
Not on a real date, no.

82
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:19,787
Am I the only person in this family who
inherited the take-a-chance gene?

83
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,540
Probably, because if I remember
my biology correctly,

84
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:25,751
it's attached to
the can't-mind-my-own-business gene.

85
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,336
Go!

86
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:34,009
Well, part of the pipe is stuck,
but I'm almost finished here.

87
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:35,845
Terrific. Can I get you some tea?

88
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:38,305
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Okay.

89
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:44,186
- What would be great?
- Nothing.

90
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:47,481
Leo!

91
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,567
Leo?

92
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:53,195
Frozen. Quick,
have your way with him.

93
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:55,072
Do you never stop?

94
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:59,451
- Looks like a Kodak moment to me.
- Phoebe, you're such a help.

95
00:08:59,618 --> 00:09:01,412
Smile.

96
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:07,334
You guys, we are in serious trouble.

97
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,840
- Hi, Leo.
- Hey, Prue.

98
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,218
Hey. Sisters, upstairs. Now.

99
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,852
Webster. Hannah Webster.

100
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:28,355
You said you heard some noises
in here. What kind?

101
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:31,483
It's hard to say.

102
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,777
It almost sounded like

103
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:36,488
a struggle of some sort.

104
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:39,908
- A fight, perhaps.
- Yeah, and then we heard a crash.

105
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:43,078
And I assumed that was
the window breaking,

106
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:46,248
and we came in to check on Prue,

107
00:09:46,414 --> 00:09:48,041
and then she just went running out.

108
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,960
What did she say? What happened?

109
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:53,964
Nothing, actually. She just left.

110
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:56,132
She was quite agitated too.

111
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,301
She didn't say where she was going,
did she?

112
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:00,428
No. No, sorry.

113
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:02,847
Okay. Thanks, Mr Buckland.

114
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:06,059
CSI will be done with the windows
soon, and you can have them fixed.

115
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:08,895
Believe me, inspector,
I really don't care about the window.

116
00:10:09,062 --> 00:10:10,438
I only care about Prue.

117
00:10:16,152 --> 00:10:20,490
Look, maybe you ought to ask
the captain to assign somebody else.

118
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:23,535
Prue and I aren't dating anymore.
There's no conflict, okay?

119
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,703
I'm fine with this.

120
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,873
Okay.

121
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,085
Okay.

122
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:37,090
I thought that went exceedingly well,
didn't you?

123
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:40,385
You may have proven
the legend of the locket true

124
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:43,304
and that the little witch is charmed,

125
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:46,766
but now we have a 17th-century
warlock running around.

126
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,893
I think he'll stick out.

127
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,355
Yep. But then again,
if the legend does hold true,

128
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:54,774
Matthew's got a one-track mind...

129
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:58,277
...just like we do.

130
00:10:58,444 --> 00:11:00,947
He won't be difficult to find.

131
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:03,491
Stop worrying, Hannah.

132
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:07,119
You're gonna get wrinkles
on your horns.

133
00:11:09,914 --> 00:11:12,041
What did he say his name was?

134
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,001
Matthew Tate.

135
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:16,963
And somehow he knows that
we're related to Melinda Warren.

136
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:20,257
<i>The Book of Shadows Melinda?
Our ancestor?</i>

137
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:23,302
The one who burned at the stake
and started this whole mess.

138
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:25,721
Yeah, he came out of the locket.

139
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:28,015
And he has strong powers,
stronger than mine.

140
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:30,309
I mean, he did the weirdest thing.

141
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:34,063
One minute, he was in front of me,
the next, he was behind me,

142
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,816
and then 12 stories down.
Landed right on his feet.

143
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:39,443
If it walks like a warlock
and talks like a warlock...

144
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,737
Yeah, well, he's powerful,

145
00:11:41,904 --> 00:11:44,865
and he means business, and he wants
all three of our powers.

146
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:46,784
Can I see the locket?

147
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:50,996
We have to figure out who he is
before he finds the two of you.

148
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:55,209
No!

149
00:11:57,962 --> 00:12:00,756
You said Matthew came out
of the locket?

150
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:03,759
I think I just saw Melinda
put him in.

151
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,177
You saw the past?

152
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:09,848
- But you only see the future.
- Not anymore.

153
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:12,142
We always knew that our powers
would grow.

154
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:17,022
Yes, but somehow I thought
I was gonna get to fly.

155
00:12:22,444 --> 00:12:23,612
They wanna countersue?

156
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:26,490
Fine, bring it on. I'll eat them alive.

157
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:29,618
Plus, we can double-bill
and get away with it.

158
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,622
Excuse me.

159
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:36,291
Are you Arnold Halliwell?

160
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:39,169
Yeah.

161
00:12:39,336 --> 00:12:40,962
And who are you, Robin Hood?

162
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:49,179
Tell me where your sisters are.

163
00:12:49,888 --> 00:12:51,973
What sisters?

164
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:54,309
I'm an only child.

165
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:58,772
Let me go, or I'll sue you.

166
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:05,654
Lawyers have not changed.

167
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:12,827
I was right.
It was Melinda in my vision.

168
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:14,746
Isn't she beautiful?

169
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:18,625
She kind of looks like Mom.

170
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,795
Listen to this. "And because
the warlock had stolen her love,

171
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:24,839
she cursed him into the pewter heart
where he could spend eternity

172
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:27,092
knowing the sting of betrayal."

173
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,346
- That must be what I saw.
- And I let him out early. Great.

174
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:34,849
You're not kidding. The legend says
that the warlock must never be freed,

175
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:38,186
or he will destroy the Warren line.
That'd be us.

176
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:41,856
Well, he'll have to take a number and
get in line behind the other warlocks.

177
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:44,859
We've never been up against
anyone like him before.

178
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:46,569
- So, what do we do?
- I say we hide.

179
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:49,405
No, we have to find out exactly
what we're up against.

180
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:52,325
And we start with the locket
and how it wound up on my desk.

181
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:56,079
Prue, your work's on the news.
Check it out.

182
00:13:56,245 --> 00:14:00,249
<i>Witnesses claim they saw a man
fall 12 stories. The twist?</i>

183
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,628
<i>He apparently got up
and walked away unharmed.</i>

184
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:05,713
We gotta find him
before he hurts anybody else.

185
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,673
Especially an innocent.

186
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,510
- There's that I word again.
- Look, Andy's on TV.

187
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:14,138
<i>This has been the most unbelievable
thing I've ever seen.</i>

188
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:15,473
He's here too.

189
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:20,186
<i>And this guy, he just landed
out of nowhere.</i>

190
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:24,148
Andy. What a surprise.

191
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:28,152
- How you been?
- I need to talk with Prue, Phoebe.

192
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:31,405
Prue? Wow, how out
of the loop am I?

193
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:33,574
And here I thought
you guys broke up.

194
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:35,993
It's not about that.
It's police business.

195
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:39,580
Oh, well, she's not home.
She's at work.

196
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:41,332
No, she's not.

197
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,875
Then I don't know where she is.

198
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:46,587
<i>But I'll tell her that you
stopped by, okay? Ciao.</i>

199
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:51,425
A man fell out Prue's office window,
which is suspicious enough,

200
00:14:51,842 --> 00:14:53,636
but then a man matching
the same description

201
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:55,679
went and killed a lawyer
down the street.

202
00:14:55,846 --> 00:14:57,223
A lawyer named Halliwell.

203
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,768
Now, I know she knows who he is.

204
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:03,771
One more time, Phoebe.
Where's your sister?

205
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:07,107
Where's your warrant?

206
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:23,123
Great, so now I'm being hunted by
a warlock and the San Francisco P.D.

207
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,417
Nobody ever said you led
a boring life, Prue.

208
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:29,213
- Maybe Andy can help.
- You wanna have that conversation?

209
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:30,797
"Hey, Andy, I hate to bother you,

210
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:35,636
but a 17th-century warlock is trying to
kill me and my sisters. Any thoughts?"

211
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:38,805
Okay, it was a bad idea,
but the point is, we need help.

212
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:41,642
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
more than Andy can give.

213
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,686
What we need is someone
who's done this before.

214
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:46,646
Someone like Melinda Warren.

215
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,691
Okay, so what are we
supposed to do?

216
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:52,569
Reach back in time, grab her
and tell her that we need her help?

217
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:56,531
Yes. And I know exactly how to do it.

218
00:15:56,698 --> 00:16:00,952
As long as you both don't mind
losing a little blood.

219
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,871
Am I the only one
having second thoughts?

220
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:04,956
- Yes.
- We don't really have other options.

221
00:16:05,123 --> 00:16:07,667
But aren't we, like, raising the dead?
What if she's all...?

222
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,961
<i>I read the Book of Shadows
very carefully.</i>

223
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:13,048
She will come back as a real,
live person, flesh and blood.

224
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:16,718
She will have her powers too.
Our powers.

225
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:18,219
What's that for?

226
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:20,972
Well, the spell works by
blood calling blood.

227
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:23,641
So it shouldn't hurt much.

228
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,519
I lied. I lied.

229
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:30,690
Okay, come on, you guys, it'll be
just like that summer by the lake.

230
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:34,903
Remember? We made a blood oath
to be friends forever, not just sisters.

231
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:38,239
- I remember my finger got infected.
- Yeah, but the oath worked.

232
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:41,451
And I couldn't go in the water for three
weeks. Don't hand me that knife.

233
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:43,661
- How are you gonna cut yourself?
- I'm not.

234
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:47,999
- Piper?
- I can't stand the sight of blood.

235
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,543
Evil beings have blown up in our attic.

236
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:53,463
Disintegrated to dust right
before our very eyes.

237
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,840
And you're afraid of
a little drop of blood?

238
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,259
- Okay, just cut my finger.
- You do it.

239
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,307
Okay, here.

240
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,572
<i>Melinda Warren, blood of our blood</i>

241
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,950
<i>Our great- great- great- great-
great- great- grandmother</i>

242
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:25,077
<i>We summon thee</i>

243
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:40,468
Blessed be.

244
00:17:51,312 --> 00:17:55,274
No, don't rip the dress
to make it fit me.

245
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:59,361
Oh, no, I'm not ripping it.
It's called a zipper. See?

246
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,741
A wise witch made this.

247
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:07,077
Yeah, and wise witches in this century
keep a low profile.

248
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:09,705
You slip this dress on,
you'll blend right in.

249
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:12,791
It's so odd to be here again,

250
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,961
to breathe and feel.

251
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,214
What sheep has wool so soft?

252
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:21,925
A synthetic one.

253
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:25,345
So did it take you long
to make the dress?

254
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:27,931
Make it? No, I bought it.

255
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,225
Oh, you must be rich.

256
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:32,186
Oh, she's got credit cards.

257
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:35,272
- Oh, wow, Melinda, you look great.
- Oh, thank you.

258
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:38,859
- How do you keep your legs warm?
- We drink coffee.

259
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,779
Oh, sorry, I let myself in,
and it didn't occur to me that...

260
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:44,531
Leo, oh, it's okay.

261
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,743
- This is...
- Our cousin Melinda.

262
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:50,871
- Nice to meet you.
- Leo's fixing our plumbing.

263
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:54,875
- What's that?
- We've got to go now.

264
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,545
To work with one's hands
is a great gift.

265
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:01,965
Well, I am a true labourer:
I earn that I eat, get that I wear.

266
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:04,926
Owe no man hate,
envy no man's happiness.

267
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,679
- Shakespeare.
- Shakespeare.

268
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,724
Wasn't that fun? Okay, let's go now.

269
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:18,106
He is a treasure, Piper.

270
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:20,275
Why are you telling me?

271
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:29,743
Well, hello, Matthew.

272
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,037
We've got to do something
about his clothes.

273
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:34,372
Who are you?
How do you know me?

274
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:37,125
The short answer is,
we're the ones that gave the witch

275
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,877
the locket that had you freed.

276
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:41,713
I suppose you could say
that we're partners.

277
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:45,466
- I work alone.
- No, not in this century, you don't.

278
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:47,510
You're new in town,

279
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:49,804
new in time.

280
00:19:50,013 --> 00:19:51,806
You need our help.

281
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:57,145
I see you've been shopping.
Find what you're looking for?

282
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:00,398
I want Melinda Warren's children.

283
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:03,651
Talk about your coincidences.

284
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:07,113
You see, we have the means
to find them for you,

285
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,033
and you have the ability
to take their powers.

286
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:12,660
Come.

287
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,247
What?

288
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:17,748
How'd you find me?

289
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:20,293
Prue Halliwell, the Halliwell attorney,
now here.

290
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,628
You are leaving a trail, my friend.

291
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:24,589
And that has got to stop.

292
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,928
Once Matthew had what he wanted,

293
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:34,265
he told the town council
I was a witch...

294
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:36,642
...and they arrested me.

295
00:20:37,184 --> 00:20:39,520
Then they burned me at the stake.

296
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:41,856
Why didn't you save yourself?

297
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:44,150
Yeah, why didn't you use
your powers to escape?

298
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:46,986
I had a daughter.

299
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:49,363
Her name was Prudence.

300
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:52,658
She meant everything to me.

301
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:57,037
If I had used my powers,
I would've proven Matthew's charge.

302
00:20:57,204 --> 00:20:58,998
And Prudence would've burned too.

303
00:20:59,957 --> 00:21:01,876
No, I thought,

304
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:03,752
"I'll accept this

305
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,298
and pray some kind soul will take pity
on my daughter

306
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:09,049
and raise her in a safe home.

307
00:21:09,675 --> 00:21:12,886
Only then can
the Warren line continue."

308
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:16,724
And it must've worked,
because here you are.

309
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:20,019
Why do Warren witches lose their
moms so early?

310
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:26,525
Phoebe, I can't change the past,
but I think I can protect the future.

311
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:30,779
How? Matthew is so strong,
and he has this wild power.

312
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:33,323
He can be at one place
and then another.

313
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:35,576
- In the blink of an eye?
- Exactly.

314
00:21:36,076 --> 00:21:37,369
It's called blinking.

315
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,497
He must've copied it
from another witch.

316
00:21:40,664 --> 00:21:43,208
I stripped him of all the powers
he copied from me,

317
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:45,669
but who knows what
other powers he still has.

318
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:47,546
What do you mean,
copied from you?

319
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:50,716
Matthew's gift is to copy
the power of a good witch

320
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:52,384
when it's used against him.

321
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:54,011
Then he definitely has mine.

322
00:21:54,177 --> 00:21:58,098
Once he's copied a power,
it has no effect on him.

323
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:01,309
Should he gain all three powers,

324
00:22:01,476 --> 00:22:03,854
he will be impossible to vanquish.

325
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:08,942
- So, what do we do?
- We curse him back into the locket.

326
00:22:09,317 --> 00:22:10,777
And if we can't?

327
00:22:19,995 --> 00:22:23,456
Are these pants
meant to be so tight?

328
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,084
Absolutely.

329
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:28,253
No wonder your men frown
all the time.

330
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,005
It's a wonder they can even walk.

331
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:32,424
- So is this right?
- Oh, yeah.

332
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:35,635
If it pleases you to look, look.

333
00:22:38,012 --> 00:22:40,140
I wasn't looking...

334
00:22:40,306 --> 00:22:41,975
...much.

335
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,645
Why the false modesty?

336
00:22:45,812 --> 00:22:47,689
I don't understand.

337
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:53,653
Well, it's a very complex issue
these days.

338
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:58,700
I mean, there's political correctness,
sexual harassment.

339
00:22:58,866 --> 00:23:00,952
Don't get me started.

340
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:04,580
What a strange time this is.

341
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:11,170
So open, yet so closed,
where even a warlock feels shame.

342
00:23:11,337 --> 00:23:13,172
Hannah...

343
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:16,968
- What the devil?
- Rex, I told you I'd get him dressed.

344
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:19,554
Yeah. Ten minutes ago.

345
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:25,143
We've tried on many things.
She says it is difficult to choose.

346
00:23:25,351 --> 00:23:27,270
Playtime's over, big boy.

347
00:23:27,436 --> 00:23:29,856
You have a job to do.

348
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:34,569
Remember, he goes back
from whence he came

349
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:37,113
once his task is completed.

350
00:23:37,405 --> 00:23:40,324
I can't believe I don't remember
all the ingredients.

351
00:23:40,491 --> 00:23:42,243
It's been a while since
you cursed Matthew.

352
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,703
Yeah, like 300 years.

353
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:46,163
Whatever you don't remember
should be in the book.

354
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:48,165
<i>The Book of Shadows.</i>

355
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:50,960
Oh, my, it's gotten so thick.

356
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:53,504
- It wasn't always?
- No. No,

357
00:23:53,671 --> 00:23:55,923
but obviously, each generation
of Warren witches

358
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,509
has added to it over the years
and has made it so.

359
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:00,302
Have you added anything?

360
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:03,013
Us? Are you kidding?
We're new at this.

361
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,891
We can't just make up our own spell...
Wait, can we?

362
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:09,144
All things in time, Phoebe.

363
00:24:09,353 --> 00:24:10,688
The book will grow as you grow.

364
00:24:10,855 --> 00:24:13,816
And sometimes you add to it,
sometimes it teaches you.

365
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:15,693
Oh, here's the curse.

366
00:24:20,281 --> 00:24:21,865
Just start writing.

367
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:25,411
- No ink?
- No.

368
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,043
Grams must've added this one.

369
00:24:34,002 --> 00:24:36,171
To increase patience.

370
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:39,591
I bet she used that spell a lot
raising us, huh?

371
00:24:39,758 --> 00:24:41,718
We weren't
all troublemakers, Phoebe.

372
00:24:41,885 --> 00:24:44,054
I was not a troublemaker.
I was just...

373
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:45,681
A pain.

374
00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:47,849
- A free spirit.
- A handful.

375
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:49,393
A Warren.

376
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:51,270
It's a family trait.

377
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:54,815
So are the short tempers,
the great cheekbones,

378
00:24:54,982 --> 00:24:58,694
the strong wills and,
of course, the powers.

379
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,362
All blessings.

380
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:03,031
All signs of where you came from.

381
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:05,450
This book is your connection.

382
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:07,119
And it began with me.

383
00:25:07,577 --> 00:25:09,704
Well, let's make sure
it doesn't end with us.

384
00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:11,873
We need to get going.

385
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:17,546
This is Prue.

386
00:25:17,754 --> 00:25:19,047
You've already met.

387
00:25:19,214 --> 00:25:23,552
This is Piper, and this is Phoebe.

388
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:26,054
Such marvellous paintings.

389
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:28,265
You cannot feel the brushstrokes.

390
00:25:28,473 --> 00:25:29,641
Yeah.

391
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:32,435
Remind us to take you to the movies
when this is all over.

392
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:36,064
This is the address of Quake.
Piper works there.

393
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:40,068
May I suggest that you go there next
and take her power?

394
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:44,239
Hannah will drive you.

395
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:52,413
The curse is really simple,

396
00:25:52,622 --> 00:25:54,833
as long as you have
the ingredients I need.

397
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:57,752
Phoebe can do the spices,
and I'll chop the scallions.

398
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,463
This is so cool.
We've never done a curse before.

399
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,550
Oh, I'm glad.
They're not to be taken lightly.

400
00:26:03,716 --> 00:26:07,428
I just feel like there's so much
we could be learning or doing

401
00:26:07,595 --> 00:26:09,472
if we had the right teacher.

402
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:13,726
Well, I'd savour my first gift before
I move on to the next one.

403
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:16,646
I see pictures. What's to savour?

404
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:21,317
No, but you see visions
of the future and the past

405
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:24,654
that'll allow you to protect
and to heal.

406
00:26:25,655 --> 00:26:27,031
Did you hear that, Prue?

407
00:26:27,406 --> 00:26:30,660
Prue, stop looking for Andy.
He should be long gone by now.

408
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:33,704
Yeah, he'll be back.
Probably with a warrant.

409
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:37,124
Yeah, like Andy
would ever arrest you.

410
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:40,670
So do we have everything?

411
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:42,588
Actually, there's a few herbs
we don't have,

412
00:26:42,755 --> 00:26:44,257
but I can get them at the restaurant.

413
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:48,135
Yeah, the only problem is the feather
from a spotted owl.

414
00:26:48,344 --> 00:26:51,180
- Is that a problem?
- Well, they're an endangered species.

415
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,685
Certain animals from your time
aren't really around anymore.

416
00:26:55,893 --> 00:27:00,022
- Why?
- Deforestation, pollution...

417
00:27:00,189 --> 00:27:02,525
It's a long story.

418
00:27:02,691 --> 00:27:04,193
Do you think they have one
at the zoo?

419
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:06,529
What's a zoo?

420
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:09,323
In theory, it's this big
garden kind of place

421
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,742
where all the animals
are caged, and it's...

422
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:13,702
You know what?
I'll work on the feather.

423
00:27:13,911 --> 00:27:15,913
Piper, can you handle the herbs?

424
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,958
Yeah, after I get to Quake, though
I might have a problem getting out

425
00:27:19,124 --> 00:27:21,085
because I'm supposed to work
the night shift.

426
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:24,380
Well, I'll come with you and bring back
the stuff if you get hung up.

427
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:26,382
No, you can't leave the house.

428
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:28,550
You are the two Matthew needs.

429
00:27:29,051 --> 00:27:31,887
Yeah, we'll be fine. How could
Matthew even know about Quake?

430
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:41,563
I have waited over 300 years
for my revenge.

431
00:27:41,939 --> 00:27:46,527
As soon as Piper gets here,
I shall have it.

432
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:51,907
You go ahead into the kitchen.

433
00:27:52,074 --> 00:27:54,493
I'm gonna cough on Martin
and tell him I'm highly contagious

434
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,203
- so I can go home.
- Love the plan.

435
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,455
Hey, Piper.
Did your sweetie find you?

436
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,083
- My what?
- That guy with the English accent.

437
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:04,544
He called earlier to see
if you were working today.

438
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:19,017
Now I have your power.

439
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:22,020
And I see Melinda's here. Good.

440
00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:24,564
She will die at my hand.

441
00:28:27,943 --> 00:28:29,986
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

442
00:28:30,153 --> 00:28:33,198
It was Matthew. He's gone.

443
00:28:33,365 --> 00:28:36,117
But he copied my power.

444
00:28:41,665 --> 00:28:45,043
All right, I found a spotted owl at the
museum where I used to work, stuffed.

445
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,045
But we only need one feather.

446
00:28:47,212 --> 00:28:49,381
Good. Maybe that'll keep it down
to a misdemeanour.

447
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:52,467
- Look, I'll be back as soon as I can.
- Okay.

448
00:29:32,924 --> 00:29:34,801
Come on, answer.

449
00:29:37,345 --> 00:29:39,555
<i>Hi, we're not home.
You know the drill.</i>

450
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,725
Prue, pick up.

451
00:29:42,892 --> 00:29:44,143
Phoebe?

452
00:29:44,352 --> 00:29:47,355
- Are you guys there?
- Phoebe, I'm here.

453
00:29:47,563 --> 00:29:49,357
<i>Okay, you guys need
to be really careful.</i>

454
00:29:49,523 --> 00:29:51,359
<i>- Phoebe?
- Matthew was here.</i>

455
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:54,570
<i>- He could be on his way.
- The machine is off.</i>

456
00:29:55,363 --> 00:29:57,239
Line went dead.

457
00:30:02,244 --> 00:30:04,205
Matthew.

458
00:30:04,372 --> 00:30:07,041
- We meet again.
- Yes.

459
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:09,877
And the sight of you
still makes me ill.

460
00:30:10,252 --> 00:30:14,548
Funny, the fact that I can now
destroy your line forever

461
00:30:14,715 --> 00:30:17,551
makes you so much
more appealing.

462
00:30:18,552 --> 00:30:21,472
- You think I won't stop you?
- How?

463
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:24,516
You made your curse before,
and you still burned.

464
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,061
And yet I'm here now, aren't I?

465
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:28,896
You're nothing more
than a dead witch

466
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:32,358
watching over stupid girls
who are about to die themselves.

467
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:35,069
- You won't touch them.
- Too late.

468
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:37,446
I already have two of their powers.

469
00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:39,073
I just need the third.

470
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:42,242
I believe her name is Piper.

471
00:30:42,451 --> 00:30:46,246
- Unless you wanna freeze me.
- Go to hell, where you belong.

472
00:30:57,674 --> 00:31:00,093
So that's why
they brought you back.

473
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,720
Isn't it?

474
00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:04,264
You think you can curse me again.

475
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,393
Hell, I might just kill you now.

476
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,103
Go ahead.

477
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,398
- I've already given them the curse.
- You're lying.

478
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:15,942
Am I?

479
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:21,907
The one with the feather,
where is she now?

480
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:23,658
Where's Prue? Tell me!

481
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:25,911
- She's at...
- Yes?

482
00:31:26,495 --> 00:31:27,829
The zoo.

483
00:31:29,122 --> 00:31:31,917
Then that's where I'll kill her.

484
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,794
And then I'll come back
for the other two.

485
00:31:35,212 --> 00:31:38,465
That way, you can watch them die...

486
00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:42,177
...and I can watch you suffer.

487
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:52,395
And then...

488
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:54,481
...you'll be next.

489
00:32:10,705 --> 00:32:11,789
You lost him.

490
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,668
We've had this conversation before,
Rex. Please stay out of my mind.

491
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:19,923
- Well, did he copy Piper's power?
- I have no idea.

492
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:23,593
Something happened in the restaurant,
though, because he just took off.

493
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,053
And so did they.

494
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:27,388
And why didn't you follow him?

495
00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:29,724
I tried. Why don't you just follow them
right now?

496
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:33,311
Because I haven't mastered
that ability yet, unfortunately.

497
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:39,233
We need Matthew to provide us
with the sisters' powers.

498
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,486
Otherwise, we don't stand
a chance in hell.

499
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:45,198
Find him.

500
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:52,538
- Prue? Melinda?
- In here.

501
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,501
- Are you okay?
- It was Matthew, wasn't it?

502
00:32:57,668 --> 00:32:59,920
Yes. But don't worry, he's gone.

503
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:02,381
He found us at the restaurant,
and he copied my power.

504
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,342
He said he was gonna kill you,
and I was...

505
00:33:04,508 --> 00:33:05,968
It's all right, Phoebe.

506
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:08,346
But we've got to hurry
before Matthew gets back.

507
00:33:08,512 --> 00:33:10,014
Did you get all the herbs?

508
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:11,849
Yeah, all we need now
is the feather.

509
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:14,560
Good. Prue's taken care of that.

510
00:33:15,644 --> 00:33:17,313
How?

511
00:33:42,796 --> 00:33:44,590
Andy, what are you doing here?

512
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:47,634
You're gonna have
to come with me, Prue.

513
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,267
- I found Matthew.
- I can see.

514
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:57,436
I need to find Prue and stop her.

515
00:33:57,644 --> 00:34:00,355
No, you're supposed to be after
Piper and Phoebe.

516
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:03,525
- I don't under...
- I got the power of premonition.

517
00:34:03,692 --> 00:34:06,945
With it, I saw the eldest
working on the curse.

518
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:09,364
- Help me find her.
- No.

519
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:12,409
No, no, this is no time
to be distracted.

520
00:34:12,576 --> 00:34:14,494
You must stay on track.

521
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:16,747
You must obtain the last power.

522
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,291
But the curse will end me.

523
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,002
They brought Melinda Warren
back from the dead to do it.

524
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,921
- They did what?
- I will not go back to oblivion.

525
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,048
Listen.

526
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:28,675
Just listen to me.

527
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,636
If they're planning to send you back,

528
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,513
they'll have to cast the spell
at home.

529
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,390
So?

530
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:37,309
So Prue will have to return there
to do it.

531
00:34:37,517 --> 00:34:39,561
Which is where you can thwart her...

532
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:41,771
...and then gain the power to freeze.

533
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,525
I've already tried.
They'd rather die than give me that.

534
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,204
Try again.

535
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:10,467
Now, for the last time, Prue,
why the feather?

536
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:13,052
I told you, I already had it
from before.

537
00:35:13,261 --> 00:35:14,345
Before what?

538
00:35:15,096 --> 00:35:17,640
You can say it, "Before breaking
and entering the museum,"

539
00:35:17,807 --> 00:35:20,018
which, of course, you did
after you obstructed justice.

540
00:35:20,476 --> 00:35:22,562
How did I obstruct justice?

541
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,647
Come on. Don't play dumb.
I know you too well.

542
00:35:24,814 --> 00:35:26,399
You're in a lot of trouble here.

543
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:28,901
Trouble which I can't help you out of
unless you help me.

544
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:32,322
- Maybe I should talk to a lawyer.
- You really wanna go there?

545
00:35:32,488 --> 00:35:35,616
You really want me to arrest you,
is that it?

546
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:39,704
What's the matter with you, Prue?
This isn't a game.

547
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:41,372
This is very serious.

548
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:43,875
Andy, please, you have to let me go.

549
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,169
No.

550
00:35:46,335 --> 00:35:48,087
I can't look the other way
anymore, Prue.

551
00:35:48,296 --> 00:35:50,923
This isn't just me.
It's Piper and Phoebe.

552
00:35:51,132 --> 00:35:52,466
Just tell me what's going on.

553
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:55,511
For once in your life,
will you just trust me?

554
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,847
It's your only choice, Prue.

555
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,182
Andy, I'm sorry,
but I really have to go.

556
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,936
No, you can't. Prue...

557
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,984
Prue, get back here.
You don't know what you're doing!

558
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:18,909
We're ready now.
All we need is the feather.

559
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,995
And Prue. What's keeping her?
You don't think...?

560
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:23,706
No, she should be fine.
Matthew already copied her power.

561
00:36:23,873 --> 00:36:25,833
Besides, I sent him to the zoo.

562
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,085
She's probably stuck in traffic.

563
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,297
When she returns, we'll add
the feather and seek out Matthew.

564
00:36:31,505 --> 00:36:33,674
Do you think he's gonna
be hard to find?

565
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:36,010
Not at all.

566
00:36:36,468 --> 00:36:39,722
I've waited too long
for this moment to hide.

567
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,475
This is our battle, Matthew.
Leave them alone.

568
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:46,312
I will have what I came for.

569
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,525
Your powers and your death.

570
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:53,027
Piper!

571
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:55,988
- Freeze me, witch.
- In your dreams.

572
00:36:56,155 --> 00:36:57,823
I said, freeze me.

573
00:36:58,323 --> 00:36:59,825
Save yourself.

574
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:03,495
No? Then save your sister.

575
00:37:03,662 --> 00:37:06,039
- Phoebe!
- Save yourself.

576
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,586
Give me that feather.

577
00:37:21,054 --> 00:37:22,389
Piper, now.

578
00:37:24,349 --> 00:37:27,269
<i>Outside of time, outside of gain</i>

579
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:31,398
<i>Know only sorrow, know only pain</i>

580
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:34,526
- No!
- It's what you deserve!

581
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:37,779
This is not the end!

582
00:37:48,248 --> 00:37:50,750
Yes, it is.

583
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:53,461
This is for eternity.

584
00:37:58,508 --> 00:38:02,178
- I followed him, he failed.
- Bloody hell.

585
00:38:02,345 --> 00:38:03,555
What do we do now?

586
00:38:04,806 --> 00:38:06,933
I don't know.

587
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,185
We're gonna have to think
of something fast, though.

588
00:38:09,352 --> 00:38:12,564
He's gonna be none too pleased
to learn that we have failed.

589
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,566
It wasn't a complete failure, right?

590
00:38:14,774 --> 00:38:18,194
I mean, we outed them,
proved they're the Charmed Ones.

591
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:19,654
I mean, that has to count.

592
00:38:19,988 --> 00:38:22,323
It'll buy us a little bit of time,
but precious little.

593
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,783
You should've listened to me.

594
00:38:23,992 --> 00:38:26,619
We should've taken care
of them ourselves.

595
00:38:26,786 --> 00:38:29,581
Yeah. You're right, Hannah.

596
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:31,708
We should've done.

597
00:38:34,669 --> 00:38:37,338
You're gonna wake a judge up
at this hour? Are you nuts?

598
00:38:37,505 --> 00:38:39,841
I'm getting an arrest warrant, Morris.
End of discussion.

599
00:38:40,008 --> 00:38:41,884
Based on what?

600
00:38:42,635 --> 00:38:44,470
Stealing a feather?

601
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:47,724
He'll bust your rank. You'll be cleaning
out parking meters for a living.

602
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:49,559
So I should just let it go, is that it?

603
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:52,145
What about evading arrest?
Am I supposed to let that go too?

604
00:38:52,353 --> 00:38:54,522
Damn right.
Unless you wanna tell the judge

605
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:58,109
exactly how that little lady
got away from you.

606
00:38:58,276 --> 00:39:00,987
By the way, exactly how did
she get away from you?

607
00:39:01,195 --> 00:39:03,990
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Trudeau.

608
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:08,244
Take my advice. Let it go.

609
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:10,871
Don't embarrass yourself.

610
00:39:20,297 --> 00:39:22,717
Leo? You're here.
Why are you here?

611
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:26,137
I thought I'd work on the plumbing
in the downstairs bathroom.

612
00:39:26,345 --> 00:39:27,721
Oh, now's not really a good time.

613
00:39:27,888 --> 00:39:30,891
We're getting our cousin Melinda
ready to go away.

614
00:39:31,058 --> 00:39:33,561
Can you come back later?
Like, tomorrow?

615
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:36,647
- Sure. No problem.
- Leo?

616
00:39:37,231 --> 00:39:38,315
Yeah?

617
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:41,527
Would you like to go out sometime?

618
00:39:41,694 --> 00:39:43,112
With me, that is?

619
00:39:43,737 --> 00:39:45,531
I'd love to.

620
00:39:45,698 --> 00:39:48,575
- Give me a call.
- Okay.

621
00:39:54,665 --> 00:39:57,710
- Who was it?
- It was Leo.

622
00:39:57,918 --> 00:40:00,462
- Is he gone?
- We're perfectly safe.

623
00:40:00,629 --> 00:40:02,631
Then let's begin.

624
00:40:03,757 --> 00:40:06,135
- We can't take those back.
- Why not?

625
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:09,972
Because that means you're leaving.

626
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:13,183
- But I have to go.
- Why?

627
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:16,853
Why can't you stay here and have
the life that you should've had?

628
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:20,148
Because this isn't my time.
It's your time.

629
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:22,276
And Prue's and Piper's.

630
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:24,653
We don't mind sharing.

631
00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:28,991
You three give me great joy.

632
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,077
I've seen the Charmed Ones.

633
00:40:32,244 --> 00:40:36,707
Good witches,
women of strength and grace.

634
00:40:43,463 --> 00:40:44,798
Tell me what you see.

635
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,389
I see the future.

636
00:40:52,556 --> 00:40:57,435
Many more generations
of my beautiful daughters.

637
00:40:59,104 --> 00:41:01,481
I see my dreams fulfilled.

638
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:04,484
Oh, thank you for that.

639
00:41:24,295 --> 00:41:26,130
<i>Melinda Warren</i>

640
00:41:26,297 --> 00:41:28,550
<i>Blood of our blood, we release you</i>

641
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:34,806
Blessed be, my daughters.

642
00:41:34,973 --> 00:41:37,308
I love you.

643
00:41:50,947 --> 00:41:52,949
I'm gonna miss her.

644
00:41:53,783 --> 00:41:55,326
Me too.

645
00:41:57,328 --> 00:41:59,664
We can always bring her back.
