0
00:00:03,289 --> 00:00:06,247
All right, I know that it seems like
she's being a little neurotic,

1
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:07,762
but high school was hard for her.

2
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,442
Really, really hard.

3
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:13,047
You know, she was kind of like
Jan Brady, the middle sister,

4
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:15,797
- not quite sure where she fits in.
- Jan who?

5
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:18,441
Okay, ready or not, here I come.

6
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,759
Okay, no matter what,
just be supportive.

7
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:30,358
Wow. You look great.

8
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:32,878
Really, really, really great.

9
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,882
Leo, two "reallys" would've
been plenty.

10
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:37,318
I look ridiculous.

11
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:38,718
- No.
- No.

12
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:40,368
- The feathers and...
- Really...

13
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:42,563
- Yeah.
- Great.

14
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:44,287
I'm gonna go to my ten-year reunion

15
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:47,407
and win Most Likely to Scare
People Away at the Door.

16
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:53,444
Come on, Piper. Isn't this supposed
to be a fun thing, you know?

17
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,247
Going back and seeing all
your old friends?

18
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:58,048
You weren't by any chance popular
in high school, were you?

19
00:00:58,489 --> 00:00:59,478
Well, I was...

20
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:00,998
I mean...

21
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:04,045
Is there a right answer
to this question?

22
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,848
Leo, I didn't like high school,
not even a little bit.

23
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:08,488
I was nobody in high school.

24
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:11,528
Piper, you were not a nobody.

25
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:13,441
Prue, you were class president.

26
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:15,804
You have no idea what it's like
on the other side.

27
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:17,688
Yeah, you're right, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:21,762
I just... I had this stupid idea that I'd go
back in ten years and show them,

29
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:25,160
and all I'm gonna show
them is that I'm a big-haired freak.

30
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:27,445
All right, you do not look like a freak,
you just...

31
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:28,928
You don't look like yourself.

32
00:01:29,449 --> 00:01:32,885
Well, if I could go as myself,
I wouldn't be having this problem.

33
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,487
Wait, you mean,
so this is like a costume party?

34
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,238
What I mean is
I'm this superpowerful witch,

35
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,560
who's engaged to a whitelighter,
saving the world from evil

36
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,606
on a daily freaking basis.

37
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:48,920
And all these people are gonna see
is the same pitiful loser

38
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:52,479
who still lives at home with her sisters
and her unemployed boyfriend.

39
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:55,280
Did you put a lot of hairspray
on that hair?

40
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,009
- No.
- Well, then all is not lost.

41
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:01,241
By the time I'm done, you are going
to be the hottest chick at the reunion.

42
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:02,928
Really?

43
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,160
Who do you think helped Phoebe
go blond?

44
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:08,562
Hey, speaking of Phoebe, maybe you
guys should invite her to join you.

45
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,287
She's been kind of distant lately.

46
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,407
Leo, when you find out
your boyfriend is a demon

47
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,642
and then you have to vanquish him,
a little alone time is in order.

48
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:20,604
Besides, I think
she's kind of avoiding me.

49
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:23,647
You know, I mean, I never really liked
Cole, and then I tried to warn her.

50
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,640
I think it's a whole
wounded pride thing.

51
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:28,239
- What do we do?
- We double-team.

52
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:31,799
You help Phoebe with her demons,
and I will help Piper with hers.

53
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:38,165
I made you from my own blood,

54
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:41,003
found you a flawless body
and housed you in it.

55
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:43,359
- You were supposed to be my...
- Masterpiece?

56
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:44,723
I'm not a painting, Kierkan.

57
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:48,082
That blood gave me your powers.

58
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:50,365
Your lust for life.

59
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:54,199
Yet you hold me captive in this soul
and you expect me to be grateful?

60
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:57,759
Belthazor was more powerful
than either of us.

61
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,957
Where is he now?

62
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,763
Vanquished by the Charmed Ones.

63
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:09,568
Is that fear I'm sensing?

64
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,407
Is Kierkan, the dark and powerful
alchemist, afraid of three little witches?

65
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:19,723
Perhaps I should suck you into
your little mixing bottle and start again.

66
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,359
There's always room
for improvement.

67
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,081
I have a better idea.

68
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,118
No!

69
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,083
I will find you, Terra.

70
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:45,924
You belong to me.

71
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:49,759
I don't care.
This has to be huge. And done.

72
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,647
And done before the stock IPOs.

73
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:53,401
All right, and...

74
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:54,843
And please tell the music guy

75
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:57,523
that I don't wanna hear any more
of that '90s techno crap.

76
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,805
Okay, this is a computer game
for the new millennium.

77
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:02,688
I want it to freaking sound like that.

78
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:15,087
Bye now.

79
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:24,562
Well, I've never been a man before.

80
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:27,681
Walking should be interesting.

81
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:30,768
What the hell is going on?

82
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:33,159
I want you to take me
to the Charmed Ones.

83
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:36,647
- What?
- The witches, you fool.

84
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,083
They go by Halliwell.

85
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:40,398
Hey... Hey.

86
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:41,888
Hey, help me!

87
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:43,484
Hey.

88
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:44,724
Nice try.

89
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:49,005
But nobody can hear you.
You're just a trapped soul now.

90
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:50,602
Only I can see you.

91
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,889
I don't know. Maybe we should go
back to the Betsey Johnson,

92
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:50,883
you know, the cool club-chick look as
opposed to the classy club-owner look.

93
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:52,641
Yeah, or we could just wrap you
in a sheet

94
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:55,118
and send you as a Hare Krishna.
What do you think about that

95
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,768
since we already tried
everything else?

96
00:05:56,929 --> 00:05:58,760
I'm sorry. I just don't think
I can do it.

97
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:01,045
I can't go there and face
all those horrific people.

98
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:03,598
I mean, come on, why do you
even care what these people think?

99
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:06,158
Only a former cheerleader
could ask that question.

100
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:09,448
All right, look. I realize that high school
was very hard for you,

101
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:11,804
but you are just not that shy,
awkward girl anymore.

102
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:12,958
- But...
- No.

103
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:16,166
Now you are going, and you're
going to have a great time, young lady.

104
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:18,797
- You are not the boss of me.
- Oh, I am too.

105
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:21,728
Besides,

106
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:24,357
nothing could be worse
than my date last night.

107
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:26,042
What do you mean?
I thought he was nice.

108
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:28,086
Oh, I have one word for you:
Halitosis.

109
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:29,843
And he only scored a two.

110
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:32,239
Oh, Prue, please don't tell me
you're making lists again.

111
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,365
Of course I am. Lists are good.
Why waste your time

112
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:35,848
if it's not gonna work out?

113
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:38,204
Well, maybe I can look
around the reunion for you.

114
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:41,167
I'm sure there's lots of eligible
ex-football players

115
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:42,921
for the head cheerleader.

116
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:44,886
Younger men are not on my list.

117
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,240
Hey, have you guys seen
my glasses?

118
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,683
- No.
- Sorry.

119
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:51,567
Damn.

120
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,358
Pheebs. Are you sure you don't
wanna come tonight?

121
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:59,805
You can work the bar
and make some yucky drinks

122
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:01,527
for some ex-cheerleaders.

123
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,479
As much fun as that sounds,
I have a ton of schoolwork

124
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:07,209
that I need to catch up on, so
I'm gonna be at the library all night.

125
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:08,961
Phoebe, look, we just want you
to know

126
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,882
that if you need to talk at all,
we're here.

127
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,638
I know that. I'm okay.

128
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,879
Really? Because you haven't spent,
like, five minutes

129
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:19,165
in the same room with us
for over a week.

130
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,162
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:24,844
It's just there are some things,
some answers, that I need,

132
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:27,603
and I sort of need to find them
for myself, you know?

133
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,882
Soul-searching?

134
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,882
Definitely searching, yeah.

135
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:35,286
But I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

136
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:38,804
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

137
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:39,958
Have fun tonight.

138
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:50,523
Piper Halliwell?

139
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:52,687
You still living at home?

140
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:55,078
Justin Harper.

141
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,485
- Is that you?
- Hey.

142
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,207
Hey.

143
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:03,684
- So who's this? Ex-boyfriend?
- Oh, don't worry about him, Leo.

144
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:05,407
He's just a friend from school.

145
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,719
Besides, he had
a really big crush on me.

146
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,959
He used to follow me around
like a puppy dog.

147
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:13,558
- Are you going to the reunion?
- Oh, yeah.

148
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:16,289
Nostalgia struck, thought I'd
drive around the old neighbourhood.

149
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:19,921
- Ten years. It's unbelievable.
- Yeah.

150
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:23,968
We were just actually heading
to P3 for the planning committee.

151
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,643
We have a lot more food
than we have room for.

152
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:30,085
- Would you mind?
- Absolutely.

153
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,167
Great.

154
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,446
Here you go. Look at you, Justin.
All grown up.

155
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,243
Yeah, you too. Phoebe, isn't it?

156
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:39,598
Prue.

157
00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:41,518
Prue. Right.

158
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:44,518
Sorry.

159
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:47,249
Well, looks like you got all the help
you need, which is good,

160
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,923
- because they're calling.
- No, you can't cut out on me.

161
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:52,478
- I need you tonight.
- I'll be back in time for the reunion.

162
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,685
- I promise.
- Double extra promise.

163
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,327
I wouldn't miss it.
I'm gonna have the prettiest date ever.

164
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,680
Please. Look. You found them.

165
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,842
- Why don't you just get out of me?
- I have to get one of them alone.

166
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:16,079
The transfer's a little...

167
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:19,082
...messy. I can't do it just anywhere.

168
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,241
Look, I'm begging you, I...

169
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:23,798
I can't stand this anymore.
I can't breathe.

170
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:25,527
I feel like I'm suffocating.

171
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:27,725
That's because your soul is dying.

172
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:30,119
It'll be easier if you don't fight it.

173
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:08,439
Cole, if you can hear me...

174
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,077
...I can't stand lying anymore.

175
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:14,963
I have to tell my sisters
that you're alive.

176
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:16,448
That I let you go.

177
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:19,521
And that you would never do
anything to hurt us...

178
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:22,480
...and that you love me.

179
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:26,965
I just don't know how to do it.

180
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:30,200
I need...

181
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:33,322
I need...

182
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:47,443
No!

183
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,368
Guys, it's still crooked. Can't you see
those creases in the middle?

184
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:17,520
- Just straighten it. Move it.
- Now, just remember:

185
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:21,728
Even if you can't tell them that you're
Super Witch, you can still act like it.

186
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,722
Oh, my God. Missy Campbell.

187
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:28,199
- Homecoming queen.
- Oh, please. That's ancient history.

188
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:30,200
You can do this.

189
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:38,847
Missy, is that you?

190
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,840
Piper. Piper Halliwell.

191
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:46,041
We had chem together,
and Miss Fowler...

192
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:48,358
...for English?

193
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,001
Right.

194
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,602
Piper.

195
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:56,557
You used to sit in the back of the class
drawing pictures on your jeans.

196
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:59,966
Yes! Yeah... That...
Yep, that was me.

197
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:04,641
Wow, your skin has really
cleared up. Acutane?

198
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:09,087
No, no... No. I guess,
you know, ten years.

199
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,079
Is there anything
I can do to help, or?

200
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:15,763
Do you know what would be great?

201
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,721
Can you get this trash out of here?

202
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:21,679
Absolutely. l... Yeah, I can...
I can totally do that.

203
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:25,478
I know where the Dumpster is
and everything.

204
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,802
All right, that's it. She needs me.

205
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:31,483
She's gotta find her legs
on her own sometime.

206
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:32,638
Sorry?

207
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:34,999
Remember when she ran
for freshman class secretary?

208
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:37,125
She got so nervous
that you had to go up on-stage

209
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,041
and finish her speech for her.

210
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:40,921
See? I knew
that you remembered me.

211
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:43,080
Why did you call me Phoebe?

212
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:47,720
Listen. You plagued
my high school existence.

213
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:49,887
I pretended not to remember
your name.

214
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:53,007
A guy's gotta turn the tables every,
you know, ten years or so.

215
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,562
Excuse me.

216
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:10,160
I plagued
your high school existence?

217
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:12,604
Please. I was your willing slave,
and you know it.

218
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:16,719
- You did me a favour, though.
- I did?

219
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:20,040
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, see, I don't go
for women like you anymore.

220
00:13:20,849 --> 00:13:24,524
- Women like me?
- Well, number one on my list:

221
00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:26,441
No women who make me drool.

222
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:29,080
They hold way too much power.

223
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:33,363
- What?
- You have a list?

224
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:39,685
Piper, what are you doing?

225
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:42,724
Missy asked me
to take out the trash, so...

226
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,368
So...

227
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:48,006
...you own this place, all right? Tell
somebody else to take out the trash.

228
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:49,887
Prue, I can't.

229
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,165
Look, I can't explain it,
but being around these people

230
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:54,763
makes me feel exactly like I did
when I was 16.

231
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:56,601
Invisible and inferior.

232
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,408
You want me to beat them up?
Because I'll beat them up one by one...

233
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:03,960
No. Look, it's not them. It's just me.

234
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,038
All right. So, what are you
gonna do about it?

235
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:10,604
- Take out the trash.
- Piper.

236
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:14,605
Okay, I'm gonna take out the trash
and try and get a grip,

237
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:16,168
and then I'm gonna
come back in here

238
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:18,320
and do something about
these streamers and balloons,

239
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:21,128
because, what,
are we still at the prom?

240
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,363
Oh, my God.

241
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:53,639
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

242
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:03,327
Thanks for the lift.

243
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:14,159
You better be as powerful
as they say you are.

244
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:27,408
Help me out.
What is our sister's name?

245
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:31,238
If you get out of my body now, I might
not have to vanquish your sorry ass.

246
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:33,121
Not as weak as you seemed
after all.

247
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,560
That'll change.

248
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:41,726
You only scored a four.
That is just so sad.

249
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:45,404
Excuse me, but you only scored
a five. Out of ten on my list.

250
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,118
Right, so I got an F, but, dude,
you got an F-minus.

251
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:53,043
Ouch, that's a bad
high school flashback.

252
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:57,482
Hi. Okay, hi. Don't really think that
that's the best way

253
00:15:57,649 --> 00:15:59,162
to deal with your reunion jitters,
okay?

254
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:01,524
What? Oh, okay.

255
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:05,361
Piper, can you move your
hors d'oeuvres to the other table?

256
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:09,078
Heather wants to use that one
for the then-and-now photos.

257
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,922
Sure. Whatever you say.

258
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,360
No, you stand up to her.

259
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:15,962
- You can do it.
- I can?

260
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:17,847
- Yeah. You can do it.
- Okay.

261
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:19,158
Hey, bitch.

262
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:21,841
Move the trays yourself.

263
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,806
All right.

264
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:26,958
That was great.

265
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:30,758
Although the "bitch" part
might have been a little much, but...

266
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:34,327
- Prue, help me.
- All right, what's wrong?

267
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:40,884
Nothing. I just don't feel very well.

268
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:42,807
- I should go home.
- Oh, no, you don't.

269
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:46,519
I am not letting you skip your reunion,
all right? You did great just now.

270
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:49,203
- I just need to rest. I'll be back.
- No.

271
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:51,803
You get back here by 6, otherwise
I'm gonna come and get you,

272
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,119
and it won't be pretty. Got it?

273
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:56,008
Okay.

274
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,047
Caducas ex animas

275
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:26,959
Vita aetas anima

276
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:36,523
What? What the hell?

277
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,962
The spirit who possessed you,
with whom did she replace you?

278
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:42,921
What?

279
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:47,839
Oh, God. Oh, God. She stabbed me.

280
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:49,602
Focus!

281
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,603
She's a woman with brown hair.

282
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:56,480
She... We followed her
from Prescott Street.

283
00:17:56,649 --> 00:17:58,799
The pink house on Prescott Street.

284
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:01,402
What was her plan?

285
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:07,161
She was... She was saying something
about wanting to kill some guy.

286
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,007
Something about revenge.

287
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:14,283
Predictable. After all,
that's exactly what I would do.

288
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:17,527
How...? How am I still alive?

289
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:21,401
Oh, no. Not still. Again.

290
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:24,841
My specialty, along with this.

291
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:41,762
Benjamin Colerige Turner
died in 1888,

292
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:44,443
although there's no date of death
for his wife.

293
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:46,679
That's odd, there should
be some record of that.

294
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:50,405
They had a baby though,
didn't they, I think?

295
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:54,323
Yes, a son. Cole Turner,
born in 1885.

296
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,919
Never got to know his father,
unfortunately.

297
00:18:57,129 --> 00:18:59,962
Cole Turner. That can't be.

298
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:04,088
Well, that's strange. There's no
date of death for him either.

299
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:05,648
Must be another clerical error.

300
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:08,164
Can't imagine he's alive
and kicking at 115.

301
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:11,877
No, can't imagine that.

302
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:24,718
Don't you get it?
He's going to find us.

303
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:27,722
Okay, I'll say it again slowly.
Try to follow this time.

304
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:29,766
I'm not going to tell you
what my powers are.

305
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:34,558
I can't figure out
if you're stubborn or stupid.

306
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:37,880
If I can't fight him,
he's going to kill us.

307
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:42,527
He's looking for me.

308
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:46,960
I can feel him. He's getting close.

309
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:50,367
Well, get out of my body,
and I'll help you fight him.

310
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:53,002
I can't survive without a body,

311
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:55,285
and I'd much rather
your soul die than mine.

312
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:05,040
My sisters will figure out
what you've done and...

313
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:08,167
And what? What do you plan to do?
Wave to them from the mirror?

314
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:10,524
You're nothing
but my reflection to them.

315
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,805
I controlled my arm at P3.
I used my voice.

316
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:15,164
- I'll get stronger, and when I do...
- Wrong.

317
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:17,889
You'll get weaker,
and in a few hours you'll die.

318
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:20,199
And there's really nothing
you can do about it.

319
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:22,482
Well, then you better
watch your back.

320
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:25,482
Because if I die, my sisters will
make you wish you died with me.

321
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:31,318
Care about you a lot,
these sisters of yours.

322
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:41,682
Think they'd come running
to help you fight off an angry demon?

323
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:45,881
Hello, I'd like the number
for P3, please.

324
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:47,923
What do you think you're doing?

325
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:50,649
Well, you may have a death wish,
but I don't.

326
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:53,846
And if you won't help me,
I know someone who will.

327
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:57,682
Are you almost finished with that?

328
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:00,044
Because I need you
to help the DJ set up.

329
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:06,647
That's the third time
that's happened.

330
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:09,127
That's too bad.

331
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:10,882
Oh, man.

332
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:14,087
Okay, you guys, just don't panic,
because there's plenty of time.

333
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:17,241
Heather, get the bags.
Melissa, the streamers. Let's go.

334
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:19,805
Man, I think Missy's
gonna have an embolism.

335
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:22,358
Yeah, can you hand me
those glasses?

336
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:26,481
It's weird, though, right?
I mean, those balloons?

337
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:28,367
She used, like, three pounds of tape.

338
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:30,167
Scotch tape, hardly sturdy.

339
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:34,278
Yeah, but I still think
you might have a poltergeist.

340
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:38,439
- A what?
- You know, a ghost that plays tricks.

341
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:41,124
Yeah, I know what a poltergeist is.

342
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:42,847
But do you really believe
in that stuff?

343
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:46,160
Yeah, absolutely.
Makes life interesting.

344
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:53,117
- What?
- Nothing, it's just that...

345
00:21:53,569 --> 00:21:57,198
...I think believing in the supernatural
should definitely be on my list.

346
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:04,767
- P3.
- Prue?

347
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:07,124
- It's me.
- Piper, what's wrong?

348
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:11,802
l... I got home, and there was
a demon in the house.

349
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:13,368
Are you okay? Did you freeze him?

350
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:16,121
Freeze him? That's good.

351
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:22,009
No, he got away. And he had this wild
hair and these intense, bulging eyes,

352
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:24,319
and he said he was gonna
come back.

353
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:26,559
All right. Look in the Book of Shadows
for a vanquish,

354
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:28,765
and I'll pick up Phoebe.
We'll meet you at the house, okay?

355
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:31,238
Okay, but hurry. Because he could
come back any minute.

356
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:32,882
All right, bye.

357
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:37,007
Where's the Book?

358
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:39,967
You just made a big mistake
calling my sisters home.

359
00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:41,528
Is that what you think?

360
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:44,601
- That is what I know.
- Well, here's what I think.

361
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:47,044
When your precious sisters
come home,

362
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:49,564
I'll kill you and possess one of them.

363
00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:53,119
And if that one won't help me,
I'll simply repeat the process.

364
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,200
So, what do you say, Piper?

365
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:58,167
One dead demon
or three dead witches?

366
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:04,523
- The Book of Shadows is in the attic.
- Good choice.

367
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:10,282
- Hello?
- Hey, all right, don't panic.

368
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:13,043
But Piper found a demon
in the house, and I'm on my way...

369
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:14,688
Was it...?

370
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:17,682
Wait. What...?
Who was it? What demon?

371
00:23:17,849 --> 00:23:21,762
Well, he had wild hair and bulging eyes
and said that he would be back.

372
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:24,602
Anyway, I'm on my way to the library
to pick you up, all right?

373
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:25,838
So just meet me out front.

374
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:30,284
- Phoebe?
- Actually, Prue, I'm not at the library.

375
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:31,878
Well, where are you?

376
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:34,519
Downtown, at the Historical Society.

377
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:37,681
I needed to do some research
for a project.

378
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:42,359
All right, it's fine. I'll come and
pick you up, just meet me out front.

379
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:43,848
Bye.

380
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:05,599
I can't wait for your sisters.
Can't I just do the spell myself?

381
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:08,761
No, it's a power-of-three spell.
You can't do it by yourself.

382
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:12,443
What kind of witch can't kill
a demon without her sisters?

383
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:14,679
What the hell kind of demon
has a panic attack

384
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:16,441
when her boyfriend
comes to visit?

385
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:19,927
Hi, this is where you freeze him.

386
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:25,646
Interesting move, Terra.

387
00:24:26,249 --> 00:24:28,479
The dagger in the heart.

388
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:31,762
Crude, but I can't say
I wouldn't have done the same.

389
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:34,962
Of course, now I will.

390
00:24:35,129 --> 00:24:37,359
Kierkan, there's something
I need to tell you.

391
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:40,362
You just pissed off
one of the Charmed Ones.

392
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:43,158
Piper?

393
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:46,277
Prue, I have the spell.

394
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:52,244
Let flesh be flesh
And bone be bone

395
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,798
The alchemist
Shall transform none

396
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:56,960
Cruel scientist of evil born

397
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,324
With these words
Face the fire's scorn

398
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:00,638
No!

399
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:02,517
I could've helped you.

400
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:06,326
Now she'll destroy you.

401
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,082
All right, what did you say
his name was again?

402
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:23,286
Kierkan. But he's dead.
So, what are we doing up here?

403
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:26,168
Well, because we have to at least
acknowledge the fact

404
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,479
that there's some kind
of she-demon after us, Piper.

405
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:30,568
Why?

406
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,640
"I could have helped you,
now she'll destroy you"?

407
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:36,358
- It's not exactly cryptic.
- Said by a demon. Demons lie.

408
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:39,039
So I say we get rid
of the ugly little bottle

409
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:40,324
and get on with our lives.

410
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:42,401
Piper, this bottle is our only clue.

411
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,323
I mean, maybe he was lying,
but maybe he wasn't.

412
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:48,526
You know, sometimes demons
actually tell the truth.

413
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:51,125
Well, I have a party to get ready for.

414
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:53,559
Changing your clothes again?

415
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:55,321
Definitely.

416
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:01,601
- Prue, I'm dying.
- What?

417
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:06,205
I'm dying to get out of these clothes.

418
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:08,407
Are you sure you don't mind
if I leave?

419
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:11,920
No, go ahead. We'll let you know
if we find anything.

420
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:17,642
What's up with her?

421
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,403
That's funny. I was kind of wondering
the same thing about you.

422
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:23,167
Phoebe, why did you lie to us?

423
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:27,197
Why did you say that you were gonna
be at the library all night?

424
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:33,077
Okay.

425
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:38,118
I wanted to check out Cole's ancestry,
and I knew that you wouldn't like it.

426
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:43,323
You have to know that you can talk
to me, and I'm not gonna judge you.

427
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:45,684
I mean, if you still have feelings
for Belthazor...

428
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:47,999
No, I don't still have feelings
for Belthazor.

429
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:49,807
I still have feelings for Cole.

430
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,601
I mean, he was half human.

431
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:54,407
He tried to kill us
for two months, Phoebe.

432
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:57,402
Half human or not,
that still makes him a bad guy.

433
00:26:57,569 --> 00:27:00,037
But he didn't kill us
because of his good side, Prue.

434
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:02,325
Which was very good.

435
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:04,281
I mean, his dad was a statesman,

436
00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:06,440
who did all these
amazing things. Look.

437
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:10,320
His good side and his evil side,
they're both dead.

438
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,245
And I don't think separating them
in your mind

439
00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:14,922
is going to help you
let him go.

440
00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:20,326
I just really need to believe
in his good side right now, Prue.

441
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:23,602
All right.

442
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:26,363
Let's just focus on the demon
that's after us now, okay?

443
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:28,327
Okay.

444
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,446
Okay, we vanquished
your boyfriend.

445
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:39,160
Now, why don't you give me my body
back and save yourself while you can?

446
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:43,447
The only way I know how to get out
of the body is a knife to the heart.

447
00:27:43,609 --> 00:27:45,327
You don't really want that, do you?

448
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:47,684
So tell my sisters,
and they will come up with a spell

449
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:49,965
to get you out of me safely.

450
00:27:50,129 --> 00:27:51,960
And then in exchange,
we'll let you go free.

451
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,847
And give up the power to freeze?

452
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:57,088
A chance to be one
of the infamous Charmed Ones?

453
00:27:57,249 --> 00:27:59,444
No, thanks. I think I'll stay.

454
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:01,520
But don't worry, it'll be over soon.

455
00:28:01,969 --> 00:28:03,607
It's easier if you don't fight it.

456
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:05,999
Well, if my sisters don't figure
you out and destroy you,

457
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:07,761
my boyfriend, Tom, will.

458
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:09,518
Wow.

459
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:15,603
Tom. You scared me,
I didn't hear the door.

460
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:19,280
I didn't use the door.
Did you just call me Tom?

461
00:28:20,969 --> 00:28:21,958
Did I?

462
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:24,724
Forgive me.

463
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:33,962
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

464
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,166
It's just your kisses seem different.

465
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:39,048
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

466
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:41,518
That's just because I've never
wanted you so much.

467
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:45,160
Piper, what's my name?

468
00:28:49,649 --> 00:28:51,924
You just couldn't leave
well enough alone, could you?

469
00:28:56,649 --> 00:28:59,163
That's okay. He's too cute to kill.

470
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:03,038
And anyways, by the time
he wakes up, you'll be gone.

471
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:07,122
Besides, I have a party to attend.
And lots to celebrate.

472
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:12,048
Apparently, alchemists
can transform anything, you know,

473
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,439
like water into gold,
energy into matter.

474
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:17,840
They even have the ability
to bring the dead back to life.

475
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:20,079
But it doesn't really say
anything about...

476
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:22,927
- That's weird.
- What?

477
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:25,762
Piper just left without Leo,
and she didn't say goodbye to us,

478
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:27,999
or come up and show us
what she's wearing or anything.

479
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,080
Here's the bottle
under alchemist's tools.

480
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:31,768
- What's it say?
- "Essence bearer:

481
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:33,687
An alchemist would use a bottle
such as this

482
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:35,601
to capture or store a life essence."

483
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:37,088
A life essence?

484
00:29:37,249 --> 00:29:39,763
"A life essence is comparable
to a human soul

485
00:29:39,969 --> 00:29:41,004
but made in a mixing lab.

486
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:44,047
A well-made life essence
can possess any living being,

487
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:45,324
but would prove toxic

488
00:29:45,489 --> 00:29:50,165
and eventually lethal
to the being's pre-existing soul."

489
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:52,126
- Oh, my God.
- What?

490
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:54,166
She's been acting really...

491
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:56,365
And she left without saying...
And... And...

492
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:59,242
The bottle, she wanted to destroy it.

493
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:01,679
Okay, I'm trying to jump on
your thought train here, Prue,

494
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:03,567
but you're moving
a little too fast for me.

495
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:07,603
He was looking at her when he said
that she would destroy us.

496
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:11,279
- She's possessed. Piper is possessed.
- What?

497
00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:14,481
All right. We have to write a spell,
a dispossessing spell.

498
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,247
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

499
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:55,082
I'm not saying that you're wrong,

500
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:57,763
I'm just saying that I hope
you're wrong, you know?

501
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,168
Hope dashed.

502
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:17,366
All right. Come on,
we need to get her alone.

503
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:19,759
Hey, you're Piper's sisters, right?

504
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:23,723
- Yeah, good memory.
- Okay, listen.

505
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:25,607
I think I know
what Piper's going through.

506
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:31,599
I have been sober
for about five years now myself.

507
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:35,688
And if Piper ever wants
to go to a meeting,

508
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:37,487
would you...

509
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:40,365
...tell her to call me, okay?
- Okay.

510
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:41,598
- Okay.
- Okay.

511
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,407
- Great.
- Great.

512
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:46,648
It's a good thing Leo is not here.

513
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:50,163
Dennis, what is the matter with you?

514
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:53,520
Oh, wow, honey, I'm sorry.

515
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:01,079
I am so sorry.

516
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:03,399
Hi, your wife went that way. Bye.

517
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:05,920
We need to show you something.

518
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:13,605
Host soul
Reject the poison essence

519
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:15,680
Let love's light
End this cruel possession

520
00:32:19,849 --> 00:32:22,522
Clever, girls. Piper said
you would figure it out.

521
00:32:22,689 --> 00:32:25,487
Although Piper won't be saying
anything in about half an hour.

522
00:32:25,689 --> 00:32:28,522
She's too strong.
We need the power of three.

523
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:30,321
You have ten seconds
to leave on your own.

524
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:34,557
Or what? What are you gonna do,
hit me with another rhyming couplet?

525
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:37,886
I'm made from Kierkan's blood,
which means I have his powers.

526
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:39,562
Add that to Piper's powers,

527
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:41,760
and I'm stronger
than your average essence.

528
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:45,846
Okay, we need help.
Leo. Leo!

529
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:48,967
Oh, is that the boyfriend?
I had to give him a little jolt.

530
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:50,608
He'll be unconscious for a while.

531
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:52,561
You might be able
to knock out a whitelighter,

532
00:32:52,729 --> 00:32:54,799
but don't even think you can
take on the Charmed Ones.

533
00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:58,327
The bottle won't work on me
unless I'm not in a body.

534
00:32:58,489 --> 00:32:59,558
And to get me out,

535
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,482
you'd have to kill your own sister.
Call me a gambler,

536
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,884
but I seriously doubt
you're willing to do that.

537
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:08,400
Get the hell out of my sister.

538
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,361
All right...

539
00:33:17,449 --> 00:33:19,280
...if you insist.
- No, don't!

540
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:25,367
That's what I thought.

541
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:43,608
- Are you gonna fill me in on the plan?
- I'll explain on the way.

542
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:45,447
- On the way where?
- Home.

543
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,207
All right, there she is.
We need Leo.

544
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:50,685
- Hi, you're coming with us, okay?
- Like hell I am.

545
00:33:50,889 --> 00:33:52,607
Piper, listen to me.

546
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:55,968
Catfight. Dude.

547
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:58,127
Look at that.

548
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:03,366
She's using karate.

549
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:05,204
Nice.

550
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:07,487
I knew they weren't that close.

551
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:10,245
Hey. Hi. She's probably possessed.

552
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:13,242
- A little help to the car?
- You okay?

553
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:16,278
- All right.
- Okay.

554
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:18,599
- All right.
- Show's over, people.

555
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:22,239
Just talk amongst yourselves. Cool.

556
00:34:29,209 --> 00:34:31,120
All right, if we can get back
the power of three,

557
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:32,438
we stand a chance.

558
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:34,486
I still don't understand
how this is gonna work.

559
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:37,123
She has the alchemist's powers,
which means she has the ability

560
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:40,486
- to bring the dead back to life.
- Yeah, but she's not dead, Prue.

561
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:42,681
Is there something
you're not telling me?

562
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:44,766
Phoebe, I just need you
to trust me, okay?

563
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:48,528
So go find Leo, wake him up,
and get him down here fast.

564
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:06,678
Piper?

565
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:10,487
I know that you're in there somewhere,
all right, so just try and listen.

566
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:15,599
Just remember
that no matter what happens,

567
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:18,124
I'm gonna bring you back.

568
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:21,799
I am so sorry, honey.

569
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:26,120
I know that you tried
to tell me in the attic, and l...

570
00:35:30,009 --> 00:35:31,761
I'm gonna fix it, okay?

571
00:35:32,249 --> 00:35:34,763
I promise, I'll bring you back.

572
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:43,044
Please forgive me
for what I'm about to do.

573
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:49,244
- No!
- Prue!

574
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:54,843
Prue, I can't heal the dead.

575
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:05,763
Now you can.

576
00:36:10,009 --> 00:36:11,601
That I didn't expect.

577
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:15,642
Little sibling rivalry
I failed to take into account?

578
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:17,248
Shut up.

579
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:21,677
Bring Piper back to life,
and I'll let you keep Leo's body.

580
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:24,323
Refuse, and I'll put that knife
through his heart

581
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:26,684
and suck you back
in the bottle forever.

582
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:29,119
But then your sister
and her boyfriend would be dead.

583
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:31,041
Not the world's smartest plan.

584
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:34,524
She's already dead,
I have nothing left to lose.

585
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:38,444
Give me the bottle,
and I'll bring her back.

586
00:36:38,649 --> 00:36:40,924
Bring our sister back,
and we'll give you the bottle.

587
00:36:54,569 --> 00:36:57,606
Caducas ex animas

588
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:02,519
Vita aetas anima

589
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,038
- Host soul, reject the poison essence
- No!

590
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:17,321
Let love's light
End this cruel possession

591
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:33,325
Leo, she's still bleeding.

592
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,164
Oh, I'm so sorry that
you missed your reunion.

593
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:05,242
Put on a good show, though.
Table dancing, catfight...

594
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:08,398
- Table dancing?
- Never mind.

595
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:11,322
It's all right. I don't care
what these people think anyway.

596
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,683
Really? That's new.

597
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:15,522
Yeah, well, my priorities
were a little skewed.

598
00:38:15,689 --> 00:38:18,442
And thank you
for knowing the difference

599
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:20,964
between my kisses and hers.

600
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:28,044
- And you, for being brave enough to...
- Oh, what? Kill you?

601
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:31,360
Yeah. Couldn't come up
with a better plan, huh?

602
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:32,928
No.

603
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:36,684
Okay, I guess I'm gonna call Morris
and tell him about the body in the alley.

604
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:43,439
So you said you were gonna explain
about the bar brawl.

605
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:46,760
And you waited all this time
just for an explanation?

606
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:52,199
Why, Mr. Harper, I do believe
that you're blushing.

607
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:55,078
Well, that's nothing
you haven't seen before.

608
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:59,162
- So am I gonna get that explanation?
- Absolutely.

609
00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:00,718
When?

610
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:02,598
When you call me.

611
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,568
I thought younger guys
were not on your list.

612
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:12,128
What list?

613
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:18,368
You okay?

614
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:21,481
I don't know.

615
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:24,322
Phoebe, you've gotta give it
some time.

616
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:26,207
- Cole...
- Seduced me.

617
00:39:26,689 --> 00:39:27,804
And I let him.

618
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:32,402
On the other hand, Piper was
completely taken over by evil,

619
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:34,127
and she fought it
every step of the way.

620
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:37,685
A seduction
is subtler than possession.

621
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:40,607
It's harder to fight.

622
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:43,640
You didn't know Cole was evil.

623
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:46,807
Nobody did.

624
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,000
When you found out,
you vanquished him.

625
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:54,519
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

626
00:39:57,409 --> 00:39:58,967
He's still alive.

627
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:03,243
For me.

628
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:08,644
He's still alive for me.
