1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:05,339
Yeah, no, I realise we haven't had
a band in a couple of months,

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,299
but, you know,
haven't you read the papers?

3
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,885
I've been helping Homeland...

4
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:11,803
...Security.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,223
That even sounds ridiculous to me.

6
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,475
I don't get it.
It's, you know, two lousy months

7
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,769
and suddenly I'm ice-cold.

8
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,313
Well, bands will be back.
P3's still the hottest club in town.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,442
Oh, yeah? When? Hey, watch it.

10
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,737
Sorry. You want me to talk to Smitty?
I'm playing golf with him this afternoon.

11
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,906
No, I don't like that guy. He's slimy.

12
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,575
Yeah, but he's got connections.
He got you the Donnas.

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,453
Fine. Let him win.

14
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,043
- Morning.
- Hi.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,670
I didn't know Leo golfed.

16
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,172
Yeah, he does, but not very well.
Don't tell him.

17
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,007
Why are you so dressed up?

18
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:53,428
Well, the Elders have assigned me
a charge, a future whitelighter.

19
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,805
But is that a good thing?

20
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,140
Yeah, it is if he's cute.

21
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,769
- Don't you ever answer call waiting?
- Why?

22
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:03,063
Well, Agent Murphy's been trying
to get through.

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,440
- He's got a case for us.
- A case?

24
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,609
What are we, Charlie's Witches?
We don't work for him.

25
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,070
Well, apparently he seems to think
that we do.

26
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,030
Especially after reminding me
over and over

27
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,199
that he bailed us out of our little jam.

28
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,868
- That's blackmail.
- No.

29
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,537
- That's your taxpayer dollars at work.
- Yeah, well, I can't.

30
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,706
- I have to go deal with a charge.
- No, no, no.

31
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,375
You are not dumping this
in my lap, missy.

32
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:28,046
I am very busy too.
I have dates, lots and lots of dates.

33
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,132
Are you trying to get pregnant
again?

34
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,718
No, I'm trying to find love.

35
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,720
So I don't have any more time
than you guys do

36
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,180
to go through cold cases.

37
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,515
What do you mean cold cases?

38
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,475
Well, there are cases
that Murphy seems to think

39
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,811
have some supernatural angle
to them.

40
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,732
So he wants us to go through boxes
to see if we can find anything.

41
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,859
How many boxes?

42
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,909
You have got to be kidding me.

43
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,132
Agent Murphy says he wants you
to start with these.

44
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,802
They're rated Para-7 Suspicion
and higher.

45
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,555
- Para-7?
- Paranormal.

46
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:04,268
Don't forget to wear protective gloves.
We don't want the evidence tainted.

47
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,103
Wait a minute,
where are you going?

48
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,064
Hey, you can't just leave us here.

49
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,608
- This can't be legal.
- Well, apparently it is.

50
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,152
Let's just get this over with
so we can find something.

51
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,905
You know, Agent Murphy can't
make us do this on a weekly basis.

52
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,198
It's boring.

53
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,618
Well, if he does, we'll just turn him
into a frog or something.

54
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,954
Don't you answer that.

55
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,002
Hello? Hey, how's it going?

56
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:34,256
- Of course I can make it.
- Piper, no, you cannot.

57
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,008
Okay, see you later.

58
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,136
I gotta go. It's Leo's music buddy.
He's trying to get me a band.

59
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,346
- It's very, very important.
- All right.

60
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,015
You should probably leave those off

61
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,684
because you'll get a premonition
easier without them.

62
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,020
Okay?

63
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:52,983
So I'll be back in a jiffy. Okay?
See you later.

64
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:01,992
I need more power.
You said you'd find it for me by now.

65
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,704
I'm doing everything I can, Zira.
I've got feelers out everywhere.

66
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,875
I don't know how much longer
I can take answering to that brute,

67
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,543
let alone all the others.

68
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,882
- I'm getting restless.
- And I said I'm working on it.

69
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,388
Where's the potion?
Why isn't it ready yet?

70
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,891
It will be, Tai, I assure you.

71
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,561
It better be,
or I'll find a new sorceress.

72
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,988
I'll show him and his kind
who's replaceable,

73
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,742
even if I have to kill
every last male demon to do it.

74
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,371
It's time for females to rule.

75
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,915
Especially this female.

76
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,919
The battle of the sexes is universal,
going back to Adam and Eve.

77
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:57,005
In fact, men and women
are so different

78
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,299
that you have to wonder
how we get along at all.

79
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,385
What stops us
from killing each other?

80
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,346
The yin-yang theory explains it best.

81
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:09,768
Yang, male is cold, hard
and unbending.

82
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,521
Yin, female,

83
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:16,650
warm, soft and yielding.

84
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,485
But notice the dots.

85
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,780
A little bit of each in the other
for balance.

86
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,450
Billie, have something to add?

87
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,912
No. Nothing he'd wanna hear
anyways.

88
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,747
- Try me.
- Okay.

89
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,041
I think this whole thing
is just a little outdated.

90
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,960
It might used to have been
more clear-cut,

91
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,380
but now men are just wimps or thugs.
It's women that are balanced.

92
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,800
I rest my case.

93
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,261
I see your point, but like it or not,

94
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:47,306
behind every good man
is a good woman, and vice versa.

95
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,308
- We need each other.
- Hardly.

96
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,685
I'm around amazing women
all the time that don't need guys.

97
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,313
I mean, history proves
that women are the stronger sex.

98
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,567
Let's think back to goddesses,
queens, Muses, witches...

99
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,485
Witches, women, same difference.

100
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,988
- You don't mean witches, you mean...
- Shut up, sicko.

101
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,240
The only way
there will ever be any balance

102
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,992
is if women get the chance to rule.

103
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,495
Except history doesn't support
your theory.

104
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:14,291
When either sex becomes dominant,
it's a fiasco.

105
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,335
- Yeah, for you guys.
- No, for everyone.

106
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,754
We're different for a reason.

107
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,510
Buy it or not, the yin-yang theory
will be on the midterm today.

108
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,805
Oh, sorry, gotta take this.

109
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,849
Phoebe? Hi.

110
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:35,437
Demons? Okay, I'll just get a cab.
All right, bye.

111
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,106
Sorry, I gotta go.
It's a family emergency.

112
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,363
Well, the problem is it's a Catch-22.

113
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,657
No band wants to play a club
that hasn't had a band,

114
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,535
and while on the other hand,
I need a band.

115
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,786
That is a problem.

116
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,539
Yes, but not an insurmountable one,
right?

117
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,707
Yeah, that's true.
You guys have a great track record.

118
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:59,044
I mean, you used to book
a lot of talent.

119
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,880
And we still can, it just takes one.

120
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,468
- You're not gonna get a headliner.
- Okay.

121
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,222
Well, what if we do a benefit
for the hurricane victims?

122
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,516
Maybe I can get you a chick band,
but that's about it.

123
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,393
A chick band?

124
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,229
But it won't help much because
there aren't very many hip ones.

125
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,734
I'm sorry, but there's a lot of hugely
successful female bands around.

126
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,695
Yeah, but you're not gonna
get any of them.

127
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,405
Well, why not? We used to.

128
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:30,200
- Don't get all emotional on me, baby.
- Oh, no, this is not emotional.

129
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,744
Would you like to see emotional?
Because I can get emotional.

130
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,331
Okay, look, Smitty, bottom line is
we really could use your help.

131
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,709
So maybe there's somebody
who owes you a favour?

132
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,378
Oh, no, I don't need no favours
from him.

133
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:42,713
Okay.

134
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,009
Well, Liz Phair
is passing through town.

135
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,802
She likes a good charity.

136
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:53,015
But we'll talk later when
the old ball and chain isn't around.

137
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,686
Why were you so nice to him?

138
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,772
Why did you not throw him out
on his macho-pig ass?

139
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,942
Because I am trying to get you a band.
Okay, Smitty has a point.

140
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,278
The music business is all about
what's current.

141
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,906
Well, currently I am very irritated.

142
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,534
Okay, well, then you need
to take a deep breath and relax.

143
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:16,288
Oh, I see, now you think
I'm being overly emotional.

144
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,291
Not at all. It's all good.

145
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,962
All I'm saying is I have coffee at 6,

146
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,298
a dinner date at 8,
so if Billie's not here...

147
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,342
<i>Believe it or not,
I'd rather be helping you</i>

148
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,885
than being where I'm at right now.

149
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,637
<i>Why? Where are you?</i>

150
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,430
I'm...

151
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:35,974
...on skid row.

152
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,477
Trying to figure out how to introduce
myself to my new charge.

153
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:39,978
<i>Well, what's stopping you?</i>

154
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,980
I have to wait for the other felon
to leave first.

155
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,149
<i>- Why?
- Apparently this kid's at a crossroads.</i>

156
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,652
I'm supposed to help him figure
how to make the right choice.

157
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,070
Like that's gonna be real easy.

158
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,239
Okay, well, back
to our little problem here...

159
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,909
- I already told you...
- Don't tell me no, punk. You owe me.

160
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,787
- Gotta go, he's getting beat up. Okay.
- Wait... But...

161
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,164
I'm trying to stay out of trouble,
Donnie, that's all.

162
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,874
Yeah? Well, you don't drive

163
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,668
and you gonna be in a world of trouble
with me.

164
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:06,338
- You got that, Speed?
- Hey!

165
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,759
You better show up, punk.

166
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,803
Are you okay?

167
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,014
Who are you?

168
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,559
I'm someone who saved you
from getting your ass kicked.

169
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,186
- That's who I am.
- Lady, I don't think so.

170
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,815
Speed, I know who you are.
I'm just trying to help you.

171
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,651
What are you,
my guardian angel or something?

172
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:29,987
Yeah, or something.

173
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,410
Wait.

174
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,298
You dented my hood.
That's gonna cost you.

175
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,842
It wasn't what you think, all right?
The dude tracked me down.

176
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,719
Leave him alone
or I'm gonna call the cops.

177
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,053
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,724
Don't bother,
that's where he's headed already.

179
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:00,225
You're a parole officer?

180
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,730
Look at that,
your girlfriend can read, huh?

181
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:05,981
What'd he do?

182
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,774
Broke parole,
consorting with a known felon.

183
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,235
Man, that's not what happened.
Come on, you gotta believe me.

184
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,196
Actually, no, I don't.

185
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,909
I wouldn't hang around out here, lady,
if I were you.

186
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,827
Not dressed like that.

187
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,012
Wow, these are so Greta Garbo.

188
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:41,099
Hey, now, there's a woman that didn't
need a man to make her feel complete.

189
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,019
Hey, Billie, those are evidence,
okay?

190
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,271
And not to mention
somebody probably died in them.

191
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,981
Hello?

192
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:52,069
No, I said, "I'm dying to see you. "
It just must be a really bad connection.

193
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:55,447
Now, this is the kind of bondage
men want us in?

194
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,616
I don't know
why you bother hooking up.

195
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:01,286
After seeing this guy in my class,
I am so sure women should be on top.

196
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,373
- Do you mind?
- I'm sorry, I meant that metaphorically.

197
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,083
Yeah, well,
I'm speaking to a guy, okay?

198
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,128
- And he means metaphysically.
- Yeah, see, that's the thing.

199
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:15,175
Men just keep using their little heads
to do all the thinking for them.

200
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,303
You know, this whole yin-yang thing,
it's a complete hoax.

201
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,765
I mean, look at this lame gig.
Once again the male establishment

202
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,268
is using women's awesome skills
for their busywork.

203
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,103
You know what, I gotta go, okay?

204
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,648
Yeah, I can't wait to see you too.
Sunday. All right, thanks, bye.

205
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:34,403
Hey, can we lay off
the male-bashing, please?

206
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,990
Sorry, I've just had one too many
lame dates lately.

207
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,326
I don't understand, everyone I go out
with is so immature and childish.

208
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,537
Does that ever change?
Do they ever grow up?

209
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,290
Well, if I ever get out of here,
I'll let you know.

210
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,418
Hey, check this thing out.

211
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,379
No, no. No.

212
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,968
What just happened?

213
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,512
We're screwed,
that's what happened.

214
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,270
Look at that.

215
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:13,358
This is unbelievable.
Piper takes the car, Paige orbs.

216
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,611
Does anyone stop and think
that Phoebe can't orb?

217
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,530
No, of course not. Why?
Because it's all about them.

218
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,532
Okay, hi, yeah,
I can't get this thing off.

219
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,742
Yeah, don't even bother.

220
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:25,913
It's gonna take a spell or a potion
or some kind of emotional epiphany.

221
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,583
- That blows. Are you sure?
- Hello? Voice of experience.

222
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,378
I've been turned into a mermaid,
a mummy, a genie, okay?

223
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,297
Trust me, I know these things.

224
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:39,051
I can't believe this. I feel so stupid.
I had to put the belt on.

225
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:43,222
It's okay. Just think of it as initiation.
It happens to the best of us.

226
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,516
So it's not that bad?

227
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,727
Oh, no, it's bad. It's very, very bad.

228
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,938
Hey, superhero babe, over here.

229
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,566
- Please, someone vanquish me now.
- Okay, we gotta get you out of here.

230
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,277
Hey, taxi!

231
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,113
Hey, where's she going?

232
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,411
- What the hell did you do to my cab?
- Put it back. Put it back.

233
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,957
Put it back. Good. Let's go.

234
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,255
A dormant power
has just been activated.

235
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,673
What do you mean dormant?

236
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,259
Well, judging by its intensity
and frequency of the emissions,

237
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,052
I thought it was
the Crystal of Kasimar.

238
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:25,097
But, oh, it's even more powerful
than that.

239
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:26,932
The Golden Belt of Gaea.

240
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:28,976
"The goddesses' gift to Hippolyta

241
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,938
endows the woman wearing it
with transcendent powers. "

242
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:36,733
- I'm sold. How do I get it?
- Trust me, you don't want it.

243
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,861
It would destroy you
the moment you put it on.

244
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:43,198
- You're evil.
- Then what good is it to me?

245
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,618
Well, you could still appropriate
its powers

246
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:50,455
by getting the woman who's wearing it
to do your bidding for you.

247
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,875
How, if she's good?

248
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:57,254
The belt's power will compel her
to use its force

249
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:59,214
whether she wants to or not.

250
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:03,468
In time, it'll drive her to madness,
consume her.

251
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:08,140
Of course, if you were to befriend her
before that...

252
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:12,936
Then I can get her to use the powers
for me, to get rid of Tai.

253
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,396
How do we find her?

254
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:15,731
<i>There you are.</i>

255
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:17,733
What about Jake,
did he check in yet?

256
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,319
Hey, excuse me, you almost hit me.

257
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,989
Hey, I'm gonna call you back.
Yeah, yeah. Excuse me?

258
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:27,034
Before you peeled out of there,
you nearly hit me.

259
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,162
Sorry about that.

260
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,334
Is that what you came
all the way down here for?

261
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,378
Yeah, that and just to, you know,
check and see how Speed's doing.

262
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,341
Let me guess, missionary?
Social worker? Do-gooder?

263
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,343
Homeland Security, actually.

264
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,929
- Really?
- Check it out if you want.

265
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,180
All right, I think I will.

266
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:51,683
So, what does Homeland Security
want with a street thug like Speed?

267
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,686
- He's not a thug, he's a kid.
- Oh, no, no, no, he's 18.

268
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,022
- Barely.
- Barely counts. He's gonna learn that.

269
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,524
Where's he supposed to learn, jail?

270
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,777
No, we try to scare him
so that maybe he won't go back to jail.

271
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,489
Here you go, Henry. He's all yours.

272
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,033
- Thanks, Frank.
- What's she doing here?

273
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,244
She's looking out for you,
so don't let her down.

274
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,038
Hey, from now on it's for real,
you got that?

275
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,374
No more juvie passes.
Next time it counts.

276
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,708
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

277
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,418
You feds keep your books open
on this one.

278
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,087
Something tells me
you'll see him again.

279
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:23,757
No, we won't.
He's destined for greatness.

280
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,387
You hear that?
I'm destined for greatness.

281
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:30,556
Yeah, yeah, you don't make
your 4:00 check-in with me,

282
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,475
you're gonna be destined for prison.
Go, I'm gonna take you home.

283
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,573
How many times
do I have to say it?

284
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,243
I'd rather lose the club than have
somebody like Smitty help me out.

285
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,079
You're letting your feelings about him
get in the way of good business.

286
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:55,789
Oh, so basically,
you agree with him.

287
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,585
Now not only am I emotional,
but I am also, in fact, stupid.

288
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,629
- That's not what I meant.
- At least I hold on to my principles.

289
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:06,133
Okay, let's stop with the mudslinging
and think about this rationally.

290
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,467
Oh, so now I'm irrational?

291
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,096
No... Yes, you're being irrational.
Smitty has amazing connections.

292
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,764
It doesn't make sense
to alienate him.

293
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,433
Okay, fine, you know what?

294
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,146
You deal with him, man-to-man,
all right? More power to you.

295
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:29,114
Sorry.

296
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,992
Yes, she's a superhero,
but, no, you can't get mad at her

297
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,827
- because it's your fault.
- My fault?

298
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,121
Yeah. She tried on a belt
in one of the boxes

299
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,998
that you were supposed
to be going through.

300
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,501
- I couldn't help myself.
- Oh, no, really?

301
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,128
Enough with the chatter.
We have to figure out how to get it off.

302
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,506
It's not gonna be easy.
That looks like Hippolyta's belt.

303
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,757
"Hippa" who?

304
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,051
Wait, wait, wait, I know her
from my Mythology class.

305
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,094
Greek queen, super powerful,

306
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,138
wanted to create
men and women equal.

307
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,975
Wait a second,
didn't Hercules butcher her?

308
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:00,646
- That's the one.
- Oh, that's just great.

309
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:07,236
Oh, no, why'd you go and do that?
Who's gonna pick up the kids?

310
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,196
- What do you mean?
- Leo, look at yourself.

311
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,574
All right, turn him back right now.

312
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,994
I don't know how. I didn't do it.
This did it.

313
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,997
All right, fine.

314
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,001
Did you just try and kill me?

315
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,587
- Whoa, easy.
- Billie, relax. Of course not.

316
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:26,839
What's the matter with you?

317
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,341
I don't know. That was really weird.
Please get this off me.

318
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,051
To the "Book. "

319
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,849
All right. What aren't you telling us?

320
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,685
And don't think just because
you're invisible that I won't...

321
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:42,479
Okay, I know the goddesses
who made the belt

322
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:43,939
came up with a way to take it off,

323
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:48,026
but if we can't figure out
what that was, Billie's gonna die.

324
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:52,114
Oh, like the woman who wore it before
who ended up in Murphy's cold case.

325
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,950
Probably. I mean, the belt holds
enormous power, Piper.

326
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,369
It seduces the wearer
before it drives her insane.

327
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:00,372
We gotta fix this
before it goes horribly wrong.

328
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,166
Like it's not already.

329
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:05,836
All right, that's not funny.
Move it. Move.

330
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,052
Where's this belt?

331
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,805
It won't just come to you
on its own, Tai.

332
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:20,559
- It must be lured. She must be lured.
- How?

333
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,978
By attacking an innocent, a female.

334
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,273
But it must be more
than just an attack.

335
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,566
You'll need to torment her

336
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:31,153
if you wish to compel the mistress
of the belt to come to her aid.

337
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,489
I brought my demons here
to torment one innocent?

338
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:40,287
No. You brought them here to help you
get power beyond your imagination.

339
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:44,833
Imagine your status in the underworld
when you bring such a trophy back.

340
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:52,424
All will bow to you if, of course,
you can take the belt away from her.

341
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,593
It won't be easy.

342
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,763
I think I can handle
one lousy woman.

343
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,806
So strong.

344
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,143
Still, better safe than sorry.

345
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,688
I'll prepare for the belt's arrival.

346
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,735
Okay, you just sit down right here
and relax

347
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:14,196
until we can figure out a way
to get that thing off you.

348
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,198
If we can.

349
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:18,951
If we can,

350
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:22,329
we should soon before she turns
any more men invisible.

351
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:25,040
You and I both know something
horrible is gonna have to happen

352
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,667
before we can get her
out of that getup.

353
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:33,799
- I scratched my pretty belt.
- Oh, dear.

354
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,217
Now it's her pretty belt.

355
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:37,761
What does that mean?

356
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:41,139
It just means that maybe the belt
is starting to affect you.

357
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,851
I don't think the belt
is starting to affect me, okay?

358
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,811
I would know if...

359
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,647
Hold on. I think I'm getting a call.

360
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:52,985
- A call?
- Yeah. I'll be right back.

361
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:05,080
Help. Anybody, help!

362
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:15,757
Over here. We're coming for you.

363
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,676
Dear God, help!

364
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,766
That's no way to treat a woman.

365
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,896
- Get the belt.
- I don't think so.

366
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,245
Men.

367
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,377
Sweetie, honey, are you all right?

368
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,963
Yeah, except for the fact
nobody can see me.

369
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,049
And the fact
that the girl that did it to you

370
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:58,634
is out doing God knows what.

371
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,885
We have to find her.

372
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,680
Whoa, watch the door.

373
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,311
Sorry, I'm still getting used
to this blurring thing,

374
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:10,896
but, oh, is it fun.

375
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,315
Fun? You're having fun?

376
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,234
We were worried about you.
Where have you been?

377
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:18,946
Well, let's see.
I rescued a woman in distress,

378
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:23,450
I killed off a bunch of male demons,
and I scratched my pretty belt again.

379
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:28,247
Okay, Billie, I think you're getting
a little too attached to that thing.

380
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:32,584
Yeah, until we get it off,
maybe you should kind of stay put.

381
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:36,672
No, I don't wanna take it off.
It makes me feel powerful.

382
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,966
See, that's a problem.

383
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,138
Actually, here's a problem:

384
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,683
Why are men so threatened
by powerful women?

385
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,978
Hey, look, I'm busy.
I'll call you when I have time.

386
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,980
There is nothing worse
than a needy guy.

387
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,275
Ladies, I think the belt's
affecting you too.

388
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,609
Oh, shush it, will you?

389
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,611
Is there any way you can make
his voice disappear?

390
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,446
Which means it's growing stronger.

391
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:05,450
Oh, you are such a downer.
No wonder I made you invisible.

392
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,161
My midterm. Almost forgot.

393
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,122
Oh, hey, could you make Leo
visible again before you go?

394
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,331
Really? Why?

395
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,835
Well, he's gotta play golf apparently
to get me a band.

396
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,087
So, what can I tell you?
It's a man's world.

397
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:20,632
I guess I can try.

398
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,637
Oh, it worked. Right on.

399
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:30,475
What the hell just happened?

400
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,311
I think her powers
are getting stronger.

401
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:35,439
- And taking her over.
- Well, then we have to stop her.

402
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:42,237
He wants to go after her again.
I can't hold him off much longer.

403
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:45,157
Why didn't it work?
Why didn't she kill him?

404
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:48,327
- I'm telling you, we're almost there.
- How do you figure?

405
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:51,079
Tai's alive,
male demons are still in control,

406
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,540
but I don't see any Wonder Witch
to help me change things.

407
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,792
She killed his gang, didn't she?

408
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,420
That means the belt's hold on her
is strengthening.

409
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:01,089
Now, soon she'll be
so intoxicated by it,

410
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,300
you'll be able to make your move,
turn her.

411
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,219
Not if Tai kills me first.

412
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:09,473
Then use your wiles to hold him at bay
until I can find her.

413
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:12,851
She will be yours for the taking
in no time.

414
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:18,649
You'd better be right,

415
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:24,029
or else there'll be one more
male demon to become extinct.

416
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:44,550
Speed. Finally.
Where have you been?

417
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:48,345
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

418
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:50,764
I'm supposed to be here.
I'm the parole officer, remember?

419
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:53,308
How did you get in?
That door was locked.

420
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,229
- I have my ways.
- Really? I'm listening.

421
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,356
- Look...
- No, you look.

422
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:01,608
- I don't know what your name is...
- My name is Paige.

423
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,777
Okay, Paige. I have a job to do
and a parolee to bust.

424
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:06,029
- What do you know about that?
- I don't know anything.

425
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,740
- I just came here to talk to him, okay?
- Talk about what?

426
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:11,243
Talk about his future.
You know, how not to blow it.

427
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:15,289
You think that's all it's gonna take
to keep him out of trouble?

428
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,457
- Just some talk?
- Well, it's a start, isn't it?

429
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,088
Why do you believe in him
so much?

430
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:26,925
- Why don't you?
- No, I used to, for the last ten years.

431
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,303
I'm getting pretty tired
of trying to save his useless ass.

432
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,054
Great. Don't. I'll do it.

433
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,391
You'll do it?

434
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,811
- You're a little late.
- What do you mean?

435
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:41,398
I mean he's not here, is he? No.
Which means he's with Donnie,

436
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:44,151
which means Donnie talked him
into the job.

437
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,778
- Jobs are good things.
- Not that kind of a job.

438
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,280
Robbing a liquor store.

439
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,200
Yeah, that's right.
And the cops know all about it,

440
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,910
and they're gonna bust him
in the act.

441
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,038
No. No, Speed's not gonna be there.

442
00:24:58,123 --> 00:24:59,750
I got 20 bucks says he will.

443
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:02,294
I have 20 that says he won't.
You're on.

444
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:03,670
- Let's go.
- Where?

445
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:04,922
And prove you wrong.

446
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,591
After you.

447
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,645
Twenty minutes, guys.
Twenty minutes.

448
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:24,274
- Talk about tacky.
- Hey, super babe.

449
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,652
I could use some action.

450
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:30,656
Test's half over. Time you have left,
you'll be lucky to get a C.

451
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:34,326
Wouldn't expect anything more
from a sexist pig like you.

452
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,663
- Excuse me?
- Well, you have to admit

453
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,624
your theories are slanted
to more of a male perspective.

454
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:44,837
So is the superhero costume
a comment on the male hierarchy?

455
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:47,965
- I assume you're making a statement.
- Yeah, that she's hot.

456
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:50,509
Shut up, pig.

457
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:54,346
- What are you laughing at?
- Hey, chill out.

458
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:57,683
Wait, stop, this isn't necessary.

459
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,357
This isn't right.

460
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:11,029
This isn't what you wanted, is it?

461
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:15,033
- I can help you.
- Who are you?

462
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,202
Someone who understands.

463
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:20,455
Come with me

464
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,041
and all your questions
will be answered.

465
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,892
Can't believe we missed her.

466
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,728
Well, at least she left before
the entire class killed each other.

467
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:45,480
You mean before the girls
killed the boys.

468
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,567
Sounds like history's repeating itself.

469
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:51,403
Hippolyta tried to use the belt
to create harmony between the sexes.

470
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,448
- Blew up in her face too.
- Dare I ask what happened next?

471
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:57,242
Well, she retreated
to an island of women,

472
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:58,827
killing any man who dared enter.

473
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,623
Well, one must've gotten through

474
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:05,167
because Billie said
Hercules killed her.

475
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:07,085
Which is why
everyone who's worn the belt since

476
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,879
has tried to rid the entire world
of men.

477
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:11,215
Oh, great.
Just when I start dating again.

478
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:13,842
You know,
that means Wyatt and Chris too.

479
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:16,929
Oh, come on, what are the possibilities
of this really happening?

480
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:18,847
I mean, other people
have worn the belt before

481
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,432
and men are still walking around.

482
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,602
But Billie was a powerful witch
before she put the belt on,

483
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,354
which pretty much makes her
invincible.

484
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:28,273
She could do it,
or at least kill a lot of men trying.

485
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,111
So, what, our only hope is that the belt
drives her insane and kills her first?

486
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:35,614
No, we have to figure out a way
to get the belt off of her

487
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:38,659
and contain her, obviously,
so she doesn't do any more harm.

488
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:40,285
If we can find her.

489
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:44,206
- Guess I won't be golfing after all.
- No, actually, I think you should.

490
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:46,708
You're the target.
I want you as far away as possible.

491
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,794
You're vulnerable to the belt's powers,
I'm not.

492
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:51,296
Yeah, I know,
but now that we know what to expect,

493
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:54,758
we'll keep our distance, I promise.
Now, really, you should go.

494
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,969
And, you know, if you find me a band
in the process,

495
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:58,804
that wouldn't be such a bad thing.

496
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:06,603
Don't you see?

497
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,524
Women have evolved
while men have grown more barbaric.

498
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:12,693
Your destiny is to unite women,

499
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,487
bring peace into the world.
And I can help.

500
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:17,990
- But you're a demon.
- But I don't want to be.

501
00:28:18,157 --> 00:28:21,034
Nor, with your powers,
will I have to be any longer.

502
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,704
This whole
good-versus-evil paradigm,

503
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:26,123
it's all been fostered by men
to divide us

504
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:30,502
because they can't create life,
so they try to destroy it.

505
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:32,379
- I don't know.
- Oh, think about it.

506
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:34,673
We're at Magic School.
It's filled with demons,

507
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,217
which means if I wanted you dead,
you would be.

508
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,846
What do you want?

509
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:44,683
Peace, harmony...

510
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,352
...just like you.

511
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:51,773
With women ruling,
good and evil goes away.

512
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,194
All walks of life live as one.

513
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,658
Of course, we may have to kill
a few demon in the process.

514
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:05,078
- But that's where you come in.
- I should talk to the sisters first.

515
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:08,415
They don't believe in a women's utopia
like we do.

516
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:11,376
They're stuck in the old ways,
battles.

517
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,378
No, no, they're very strong women...

518
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,339
Who have been corrupted
by the male hierarchy.

519
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:18,383
They're scared of change.
They'd do anything to stop you.

520
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,720
Which is why it's so important
we take over Magic School.

521
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:26,767
Make it our base. Peace, unity.

522
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:28,894
Think about it.

523
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:34,858
She's not well. She'll be dead soon.

524
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:38,737
She just needs to live long enough
to kill Tai.

525
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:42,491
Then no one will dare challenge me.

526
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:00,342
You all right?

527
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:03,929
Yeah. I just have to go
to the bathroom, that's all.

528
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:06,306
Oh, why didn't you say so?

529
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:09,685
There you go. I won't look.

530
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,104
That's disgusting.

531
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:18,318
- First stakeout, huh?
- No, I've been on lots of stakeouts.

532
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:21,280
- What?
- I don't know.

533
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,115
I'm still trying to figure you out.

534
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:26,618
- Why?
- Because I can't, that's why.

535
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,954
I do like a challenge though.

536
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:32,708
<i>Suspect vehicle approaching
south on Larson. Over.</i>

537
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,211
<i>Suspect vehicle is in position.</i>

538
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:38,255
<i>Two black males,
considered armed and dangerous.</i>

539
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:39,673
<i>Stand by. Over.</i>

540
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,844
- Damn. Looks like you lost our bet.
- He hasn't done anything yet.

541
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:46,638
- Boy, you are an optimist, huh?
- No, I just have faith.

542
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:50,559
Yeah. So do I.

543
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:56,523
Yo, chill, dog.

544
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,652
- Look, I don't wanna be doing this.
- Yeah? Well, it's too late.

545
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,667
- We all set up?
- What are you waiting for?

546
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,252
- Drive to the front.
- Look, I can't.

547
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:20,214
- I don't wanna be doing this. I can't.
- The hell you can't.

548
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:24,927
Drive, damn it.

549
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:28,680
<i>- All units engage. Engage.
- Stay here.</i>

550
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:31,850
You son of a bitch.

551
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,692
Police! Freeze! Don't move!

552
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:49,868
Don't move. Freeze.

553
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:56,375
You owe me 20 bucks.

554
00:31:56,542 --> 00:32:00,546
Give me your hands.
Give me your hands. Now, cuff him.

555
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,259
This isn't working.

556
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,386
Either Super Billie's
completely taken over

557
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:09,555
or she just doesn't wanna be found.

558
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:12,516
Well, we could try
the to-call-a-lost-witch spell.

559
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:14,393
If there's any witch left in her,

560
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,728
it should bring her back here
whether she likes it or not.

561
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:18,605
Well, what if that doesn't work?

562
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:21,733
Well, then mankind
has got a serious problem.

563
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,652
I should've stopped her.

564
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:25,404
Don't worry about it,
it's a job hazard.

565
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:27,072
It would've happened
sooner or later.

566
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,866
She's gonna be upset
when she comes back.

567
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,242
Think we should call for Paige?

568
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:32,244
No, she's got her own innocent
to save.

569
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:34,371
Besides, if Billie gets here
and we can't handle it,

570
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:35,914
we'll call for her.

571
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:39,668
<i>Power of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies</i>

572
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:44,256
<i>Come to us who call you near
Come to us and settle here</i>

573
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:48,677
What'd you do that for?

574
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:51,305
Oh, we were just worried about you,
that's all.

575
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:54,600
That's bull. You just don't want me
to create my utopia.

576
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:57,728
- Your what?
- Are you kidding? We love utopias.

577
00:32:57,895 --> 00:33:02,149
I mean, we're witches, you know?
We're into the girl power.

578
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:04,109
Fine. What do you want?

579
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:07,279
We just wanna talk, you know,
see how you're doing. Now.

580
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:16,455
- You lied to me. Zira was right.
- Zira?

581
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:31,637
There's no wrath
like a woman scorned.

582
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:38,977
We have got to find her
and bring her back here

583
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,939
because I am not cleaning up
this mess.

584
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,610
Zira...

585
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,654
...I'm all yours.

586
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,246
So maybe we could try the spell again
and bring her back?

587
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:58,455
And do what with her?

588
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:00,207
Watch her
destroy the rest of the house?

589
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:04,127
- I mean, we can't contain her.
- There's gotta be a way.

590
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,714
Hey, I guess Billie's still
wearing the belt, huh?

591
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,424
- You think?
- Oh, nice.

592
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,094
You're out playing golf
while we're trying to save your gender.

593
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:13,846
No, I told him to,

594
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:17,224
and it's a good thing I did
because Billie might've killed you.

595
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:18,892
She's getting worse, isn't she?

596
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,727
Yeah, and she teamed up
with a demon.

597
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:23,188
If I were a guy,
I'd definitely be a little nervous.

598
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:25,983
Any chance they went back
to Magic School?

599
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:27,568
Maybe. Why?

600
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:30,737
Because if they did, we might be able
to get the belt off her there.

601
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:33,282
The goddesses' spell's gotta be
in one of the history books.

602
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:36,076
It's gonna be pretty tough
to get by her unseen.

603
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:39,454
Well, I think unseen is the answer.

604
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:47,754
You wouldn't listen to me, huh?

605
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:49,923
- You just had to do something stupid?
- Hey, easy.

606
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,217
- Oh, man, you don't understand.
- No, I understand.

607
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:54,052
You screwed up,
that's what I understand.

608
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,846
Why don't you listen
to what he has to say?

609
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:58,223
I don't like this better than you.
I don't have any choice.

610
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,350
He's an accessory to robbery.
I'm gonna take him in.

611
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,352
I'm telling you,
that's not the way it went down.

612
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,271
Okay, why don't you tell that
to the judge?

613
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:07,149
Wait. What happened?

614
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:12,738
- What happened to you?
- That's what I was trying to tell you.

615
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:14,781
Donnie stuck me
because I wouldn't drive.

616
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:17,201
Then what the hell
were you doing there?

617
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,661
Just forget it, man.

618
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:23,999
No. No. If what he's saying is the truth,
then that makes him innocent.

619
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,459
- That's not my call.
- Yeah.

620
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:27,628
It is your call
whether you take him in or not.

621
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:30,297
Why don't you check the other guy's
knife? If his blood is on it,

622
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:31,798
then he's exonerated.

623
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:37,596
Let's go. Excuse us.

624
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:40,224
What?

625
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:45,896
- You set me up.
- It's called evolution, Tai.

626
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:49,816
- Your kind's irrelevant.
- You fool, she's just using you.

627
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,527
There's no battle of the sexes.

628
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:54,196
The eternal fight
is between good and ev...

629
00:35:57,491 --> 00:36:01,954
I can't believe he's finally dead.
It's almost anticlimactic.

630
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:06,124
- Is he really gone?
- You missed one.

631
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:20,305
Are you all right?
You don't look well.

632
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:25,310
- I don't feel very good.
- It's all right. You just rest.

633
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:28,730
It'll be all over soon, I promise.

634
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:31,149
Sooner than you think.

635
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:34,403
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, we've come to save you.

636
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,907
- Again.
- You can't save her. It's too late.

637
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:44,621
- Wanna bet?
- Book.

638
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:48,500
They're after your belt. Kill them.

639
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:49,918
- Leo.
- No!

640
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:54,339
Say the damn spell.

641
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:58,010
<i>For all the world to work as one
In harmony it must be undone</i>

642
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:02,848
Belt.

643
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:15,777
All right, come out, come out,
wherever you are.

644
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:21,575
- It's nice to see you.
- It's good to be seen.

645
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:26,663
- What happened?
- Leo just saved your life.

646
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,125
Yin-yang working together
just like it should be.

647
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:36,924
- Good job, yang.
- Thanks, yin.

648
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,319
Now, come on.

649
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,828
What are we doing?

650
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,876
Yeah, inspector, it's Henry.

651
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:15,254
Hey, by any chance did that kid Donnie
have a knife on him

652
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,591
when he was arrested?
Have blood on it?

653
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:24,096
No, no, no, it's nothing.
I was just curious. Thanks.

654
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:29,017
- Turn around.
- What's up?

655
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:32,938
I'm letting you go, that's what's up.

656
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:36,108
Wait, so you mean you believe me?

657
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,236
This time.

658
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:42,447
Go.

659
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:04,803
Hello?

660
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,640
<i>So do you want cash
or can I send you a check?</i>

661
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,561
- Henry?
- You were right about the kid.

662
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:15,355
<i>- He was clean.
- How did you get my number?</i>

663
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,191
Oh, you're not the only one
with connections.

664
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:19,735
I see.

665
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,155
Hey, Speed owes you.

666
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,619
- I owe you too.
- Just doing my job.

667
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:30,329
Well...

668
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:35,167
...good night.

669
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:37,169
Good night.

670
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:56,855
That better be a virgin colada.

671
00:39:57,022 --> 00:40:00,317
I don't wanna lose my license
the same night I land Liz Phair.

672
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:03,237
Don't worry, I think I've caused enough
trouble for you guys for one day.

673
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,614
You were bound to turn into something
eventually.

674
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:07,032
Yeah, but Wonder Witch?

675
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,535
Not to mention
I almost terminated an entire gender.

676
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:12,287
- Yeah, but the point is you didn't.
- Thankfully.

677
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:14,915
Yeah, I just wish I still wasn't
so confused about men.

678
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:17,501
Don't worry,
they're just as confused about us.

679
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:22,172
- I know, but I'm still a little gun-shy.
- It's okay. You have time.

680
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:24,466
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together,</i>

681
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:28,220
<i>welcome to P3 Liz Phair.</i>

682
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:31,723
- I'm so excited.
- I still can't believe Leo got her.

683
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,476
Yeah. Well, you know,
guys, golf, go figure.

684
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:37,396
To the mystery of men.
