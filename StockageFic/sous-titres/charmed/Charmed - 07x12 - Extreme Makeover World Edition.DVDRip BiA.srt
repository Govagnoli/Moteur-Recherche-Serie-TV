1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,426
Hey. I let myself in, if that's okay?

2
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,678
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Sure.

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,597
- Of course. Hey.
- Hey.

4
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:14,848
How are you?

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,728
- So, what's going on here?
- Just scrambling.

6
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,439
We've been on a roll
knocking off these demons,

7
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,858
- thanks to the Avatars.
- The Avatars.

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,654
They've been helping us find demons.
Can't pick 'em off fast enough.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,740
I guess that's why you
haven't returned my phone calls?

10
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,535
I'm sorry,
I just assumed that you knew.

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,412
- Knew what?
- Well, that I was helping them.

12
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,582
- Creating Utopia. Right.
- Is that a bad thing?

13
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,379
I thought when we figured
they didn't kill your parents...

14
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,382
- It doesn't mean they're not a threat.
- Come on.

15
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,885
It doesn't change the years
I spent learning who they are.

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,096
Or why people fought them for years.

17
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,015
- Haven't we been over this?
- Obviously not enough.

18
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,727
Actually, you know what, Kyle?
I think we have.

19
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,147
I'm sorry that you don't,
or won't, understand.

20
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,942
But my sisters and I, we actually do.

21
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:08,986
Everything...

22
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:13,991
Everything the Avatars have
said or done has been totally legit.

23
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,077
They didn't force this on us.

24
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,789
It's something we
really want for everybody.

25
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:24,209
All right. All right.
So how's this gonna happen?

26
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,419
The change, I mean.

27
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,796
Well, they...

28
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,049
- They're gonna help us write a spell.
- What kind of spell?

29
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,759
I don't know yet.

30
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,139
You don't know? They're getting you
to remake the world and you don't know?

31
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:40,726
- I've been a little busy.
- It's a fundamental question.

32
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,688
I think it's important to get rid of
as many demons as possible.

33
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,815
Did you check with the Elders?

34
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:52,696
No. I don't think they would understand.

35
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:01,747
If you'll excuse me,
I have one more demon to go after.

36
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,373
Okay?

37
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,347
Come on...

38
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,307
Elders, Elders, Elders.

39
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,646
I beg you, if you can hear me,

40
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,898
I can help you stop the Avatars.

41
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,776
I still have a vanquishing potion.

42
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,245
Are you an Elder?

43
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,332
Hardly.

44
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,730
You said something
about a vanquishing potion.

45
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:35,651
- How'd you know about that?
- That's why I needed to bring you here.

46
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,070
We intercepted your little cry for help.

47
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,074
Sorry, Zankou.

48
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:45,410
- About the potion...
- Yeah. Look, it won't...

49
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,622
It won't kill you.
Not unless you're an Avatar.

50
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,166
Which is exactly why I want it.

51
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,462
You and I have a lot in common. We
wish to stop what they're trying to do.

52
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,006
We desire to keep things
as they are, yes?

53
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,176
In order to do that,
we're going to have to work together.

54
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,056
With the Avatars' help, the Charmed Ones
are decimating our ranks.

55
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,851
We must stop them
before they find us too.

56
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,354
- I'm not helping you hurt the sisters.
- Don't wanna harm them.

57
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,647
At least not yet.

58
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:15,524
I mean...

59
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,235
We need them
to help stop the Avatars, right?

60
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,574
Remind me why I tolerate you again?

61
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,784
Because you're running low on demons?

62
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,454
I don't know what you guys are
getting at, but you got the wrong idea.

63
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,039
I'm not gonna help you.

64
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,333
I can't. I won't. I mean, you're demons.

65
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,002
Yes...

66
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,462
Yes we are.

67
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:42,259
Which makes us, for better or worse,
fundamental to the Grand Design.

68
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,969
It keeps things in balance.

69
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:47,014
It gives the necessary contrast
to all that you covet,

70
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,266
to all that is good.

71
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,436
And therein lies our mutual problem.

72
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:55,230
You see, without the one,

73
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,400
there can't be the other.

74
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,069
Without evil,

75
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,614
there can be no good.

76
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,452
That is why I think you want to stop
the Avatars just as much as I do.

77
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,997
Okay.

78
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:13,999
How?

79
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,835
Your potion can kill one of them,

80
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,339
which might just weaken
the rest enough for us to kill them.

81
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,257
The problem is

82
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,843
the Avatars have
insulated themselves now.

83
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:30,724
Only the sisters can get to them,
and only you can reach the sisters.

84
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,518
I'm not going after Leo again.

85
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,103
- Paige'll kill me.
- He's not the only Avatar.

86
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,481
They're never gonna
let me use the potion.

87
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:42,236
- Well, we can help that.
- If we work together.

88
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,989
I can't.

89
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:56,583
You will.

90
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,800
The problem is his powers
go beyond the physical.

91
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,594
Zankou has the gift
of prescience as well.

92
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,556
He anticipates where
we'll be looking for him next.

93
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:14,184
But, on the other hand, we've
got most of the high-level demons.

94
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,477
Isn't that enough?

95
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:19,398
No. We shouldn't go through
with this until we can find him.

96
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,024
We might not have a choice.

97
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,944
The planetary alignment
is correct for the change.

98
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,321
- The longer we wait...
- We still have time.

99
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,115
- We must keep looking.
- Why?

100
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,702
You said we're not gonna be able
to knock off all of the demons.

101
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:36,456
- There will be others.
- But Zankou poses a unique threat.

102
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,961
One that could bring enough conflict
into Utopia to undermine it.

103
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,548
And he's determined to do
everything in his power to stop us.

104
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,427
He's not the only one.

105
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,806
Just out of curiosity,

106
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,976
the spell that we're gonna cast,
what exactly does it do?

107
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,729
Unless, they don't want us to know.

108
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,858
- We have nothing to hide, Paige.
- Then I'm all ears.

109
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,362
The spell will...
will put everyone to sleep.

110
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,907
But only for a few hours.

111
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:14,328
Just long enough to erase
the mindset of duality.

112
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,664
- Of good and evil.
- To allow the original design,

113
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:22,169
that which every human being has
imprinted in their hearts, to take hold.

114
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,129
Utopia.

115
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,715
So we go to sleep too?

116
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,094
Hello? Anybody home?

117
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,475
Yeah, it's about time.

118
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,519
We weren't gone that long.

119
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,481
Besides, we must have vanquished
six or seven upper-level demons.

120
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,900
And a bunch of other disgusting things.

121
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,735
- Grimlock eggs.
- Disgusting!

122
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:50,948
Doesn't matter, 'cause after tomorrow,
we won't have to do this. We're done.

123
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,785
- We still have to find Zankou first.
- What if we can't?

124
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:59,373
Then we, unlike the rest of the world,
will not be taking a catnap.

125
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,083
Catnap? What do you mean?

126
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,669
A little something
they neglected to tell us.

127
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,463
It's just the mechanics
of how the spell works.

128
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,259
To put people to sleep
so that the transformation can occur.

129
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,555
Well, I, for one, am damn well
not going to be taking a nap.

130
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,098
Paige, what's going on?

131
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,600
I wanna make sure
we've thought this out.

132
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,270
We've had this conversation
a dozen times.

133
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,857
I mean, there's only so much we
can know, the rest is a leap of faith.

134
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,651
One I thought we were all ready for.

135
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,820
If it helps, Paige,

136
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:33,240
we never intended that you
or your sisters would join the others

137
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,242
- until much later.
- Why?

138
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,494
There'll still be straggler demons.

139
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:41,373
- The ones that live and walk among us.
- Ones you'll need to vanquish

140
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,752
- so that conflict doesn't seep back in.
- So we still have to fight demons?

141
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,422
They'll be easy to spot
while others are asleep,

142
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,008
- because they won't be.
- Shouldn't take long.

143
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:56,054
And it will be up to you to decide
when you're ready to make the change.

144
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,265
You okay with that?

145
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,647
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

146
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:11,653
- What about Zankou?
- I think I know how to find him.

147
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,074
Gimme a lift? I wanna
make sure I get my last column in.

148
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,202
- Last column?
- How much advice

149
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,163
can a world with no conflict need?
I may be out a job.

150
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,539
You okay with that?

151
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,917
I've got better things
to look forward to.

152
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,053
What are we doing here?

153
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,932
Murderers!

154
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,560
- Let go of me! Let go!
- What is this?

155
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,730
This is his revenge.

156
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,070
Zankou!

157
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,290
They were the ones who
killed your parents, weren't they?

158
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,875
The ones who really did it?

159
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:11,004
You owe me for doing something
you couldn't have done without me.

160
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:15,092
And you will repay me by
doing something I can't do without you.

161
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,526
- Are you leaving us?
- I'm sorry?

162
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,236
"The grass is greener"?

163
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:38,156
- Kind of a goodbye column, isn't it?
- No, not necessarily.

164
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:42,494
I've been doing this a long time.
I know how to read between the lines.

165
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,246
Come on, talk to me!

166
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:49,084
Okay, it's just that... things change.

167
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,044
Know what I mean? Life changes.

168
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,839
- Don't you like your job any more?
- Of course I do.

169
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,633
- I love my job. You know that.
- But?

170
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,344
But, like I said, things change.

171
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,806
- For the better though, you'll see.
- No, I don't understand.

172
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,600
Okay...

173
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,269
Have you ever gone
through a period in your life

174
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,354
where all you can think about,

175
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,649
all you wanna do,
is just get away from it?

176
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:18,322
When I was married to my ex,
James L. Connors. What a schmuck.

177
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,616
You were able
to move on from him, right?

178
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,870
Rebuild life. Even though, at the time,
you probably thought you couldn't.

179
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,914
- Yeah.
- Well, it's the same thing.

180
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,501
That's what I'm talking about.
One door closes, another opens.

181
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,128
Sometimes you have
to take that leap of faith.

182
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,048
- Phoebe, I don't...
- I promise you, Elise,

183
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,092
this is gonna be great for everyone.

184
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,929
- Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing it.
- Do what?

185
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:46,141
- I gotta go.
- No. Wait! But you...

186
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,643
Thank you, Elise.

187
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,354
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

188
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,358
Goodbye, all of my dear,
beautiful friends.

189
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:58,070
I will see you tomorrow when
a bright new sunshiny day begins.

190
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,781
Michelle, you are the best.

191
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:05,536
Donald! Donald, I gotta tell you,
you... you are the man!

192
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,288
Gregg. I've...

193
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,666
We never really
liked each other, did we?

194
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,710
Well, that'll all change.

195
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,462
Until tomorrow, everyone!

196
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,381
- What's going on?
- Bye!

197
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,258
Ta-ta!

198
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:23,220
I was thinking if we adjust the tracking
spell we used to find The Source,

199
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:26,974
it might work on Zankou, considering
they were working so closely.

200
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:31,603
- Paige? Are you listening?
- Yeah, that sounds great.

201
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,439
Well, it would
if you were listening to me.

202
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,360
Sorry, it's just a... big change.

203
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:42,447
I know. It's okay to be scared.
I'm antsy, Phoebe's nostalgic

204
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,950
and you're scared.
That's how we do things.

205
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:48,579
No, I'm not scared.
Fine, maybe a little.

206
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,164
Okay, why?

207
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,544
Well, because Kyle
still thinks the Avatars are a threat.

208
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,506
And he's asking some
pretty damn good questions.

209
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,927
And you trust him,
so you trust those questions.

210
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,888
Exactly.

211
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:10,225
Okay, I admit I've asked myself those
same questions about a hundred times.

212
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,020
We have the answers now.
We're not going in blind.

213
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,438
What are we going into?

214
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:17,316
What we've always wanted.
For the past seven years

215
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:21,320
we've been saving the world,
being told that it's our destiny.

216
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:25,365
- Maybe this is part of our destiny.
- Bringing in Utopia?

217
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,118
Putting an end
to all this good versus evil crap.

218
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,913
I, for one, am tired
of sleeping with one eye open,

219
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,957
wondering which demon
is gonna finally get me.

220
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,668
Or one of my sons.

221
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,254
I've wondered the same thing.

222
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,841
Well, you shouldn't have to.
And neither should Phoebe.

223
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,677
It's just Kyle, he has good evidence.

224
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,014
And his hunches have been right so far.

225
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:52,309
All of these hunches
are based on a myopic point of view.

226
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:55,896
He's been trying to get even
with these people his entire life.

227
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,690
That they're innocent
is besides the point,

228
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:01,777
- as far as he's concerned.
- I know.

229
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,864
We deserve this opportunity, Paige.
We've earned it.

230
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,493
Now let's go find Zankou.

231
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,957
You must be very careful with this.

232
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,377
Use it only exactly as I say.

233
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:19,878
What is it?

234
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,632
Put simply, paranoia.

235
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,970
A sorcerer once brought down
an entire empire with this...

236
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,931
...just by touching a little witch.

237
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:34,101
It spread, of course,
as paranoia is wont to do.

238
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:38,146
I'm betting it will do
the same to the sisters.

239
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,316
- No, I told you, I won't harm them.
- I'm not asking you to.

240
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:45,821
I just want you to make them
a little... scared, uncertain.

241
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,406
Delusional.

242
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:54,663
Only long enough for the Avatars to be
concerned that something is not right.

243
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,415
Draw them out into the open.

244
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,376
- So I can use the potion.
- Precisely.

245
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:05,883
Don't worry, you'll be immune
to its effects since you're not a witch.

246
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,635
How do I know you're not
gonna try and harm them?

247
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,061
Fireball!

248
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,193
Go!

249
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,112
Take it. It's our last hope.

250
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,324
- Hurry!
- How do I reverse its effects?

251
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,700
I'll be in touch.

252
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,544
You're gonna need an alibi.

253
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,092
Damn!

254
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:52,930
Kyle?

255
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,853
I'm all right. I'm all right.

256
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:04,441
Great. Then maybe you can start
explaining what you're doing down here.

257
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:23,836
- What's taking so long?
- He's resisting.

258
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,254
Can you blame me?

259
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,549
He's not the one
we found in a demon cave.

260
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,760
- Think I wanted to be there?
- You wanna stop the Avatars,

261
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:34,721
and Zankou wants to stop the Avatars.

262
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,850
- You see the connection there?
- You can't be serious.

263
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,143
I'm just saying, I'd like to know.

264
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,440
- He kidnapped me.
- Why?

265
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,609
Because he thinks I can help kill you.

266
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:50,571
- Don't you mean kill an Avatar?
- Same difference.

267
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,949
Okay, what I don't understand

268
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:57,286
is why he would think
that you still had a potion?

269
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,707
- I don't know, ask him.
- All right, I will.

270
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,043
Zankou's not gonna be there,
he's on the run.

271
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,462
We found him once before.
I can do it again.

272
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,215
I'm not gonna sit
and wait for him to attack Kyle.

273
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:11,466
Wanna protect him?

274
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,678
Help the Avatars bring in Utopia
so Zankou can't stop it.

275
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,096
He's right, you know.

276
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,893
You don't have to do that.
Use me as bait. Wait till he attacks.

277
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,396
- No, what if we're too late next time?
- Well, so you are, I mean...

278
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,983
You don't have to change
the whole world just to save me.

279
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,568
Don't we?

280
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,988
Look, every demon that tries to stop us

281
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,699
makes me just want
to get through it faster.

282
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,243
- Let's just... do this.
- Paige, look, I don't...

283
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,206
No, my mind is made up.
Besides, I think it's for the best.

284
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,793
Tell them we're ready.

285
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,969
I'll go see where Phoebe is.

286
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,058
I can't let you do this.

287
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,393
You don't have a choice, honey.

288
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,940
Besides, how bad
can a place called Utopia be?

289
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,484
Wait.

290
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,405
I'm sorry.

291
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:20,786
- What was that?
- What?

292
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,454
You didn't feel that?

293
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,957
No, it must have
been static electricity.

294
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,667
Don't be so paranoid.

295
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,796
Okay.

296
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:58,323
- Oh, God!
- So... How did it go?

297
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,702
This better work.

298
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,580
I agree, for both our sakes.

299
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,333
I see the Avatar's healed your wound.

300
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:13,338
Too bad you didn't use the potion
on him right there and then.

301
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,674
None of this would have been necessary.

302
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:19,469
- How do I reverse the paranoia?
- Patience.

303
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,097
- All in good time.
- I held up my end of the deal.

304
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,682
As have I.

305
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:27,394
You know, the problem
with you humans is your conscience.

306
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,980
You're all always so conflicted.

307
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:33,275
Demons, on the other hand,
don't have such weakness.

308
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:36,653
It's not weakness.
It's how we stay honest.

309
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,489
It's what helps us choose
between good and you.

310
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:44,745
It also messes with your head.
As it is clearly doing right now.

311
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:48,832
Working with evil... to preserve good.

312
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,002
It would give me a headache.

313
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:54,838
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

314
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,925
- I want the potion.
- Well, I'm not giving it to you.

315
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,303
I'm not gonna use it.
Not until I know the sisters are safe.

316
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,556
Won't be for a while, I'm afraid.

317
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:08,185
Not until the full effects
of the paranoia take hold.

318
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:10,729
To that end, I suggest you come with me.

319
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,564
Why?

320
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:17,152
We wouldn't want you falling asleep
with everyone else, now would we?

321
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,904
No...

322
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:23,450
You are going to be the proverbial straw
that breaks the camel's back.

323
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,293
Hello? What are you doing?

324
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,463
You know, just trying to
organise some books. Just in case.

325
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,132
Now? Everybody's waiting for you.

326
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,844
I might not have
a chance to do this afterwards.

327
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,972
- To do what?
- These are books on demons.

328
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,016
We might not need them
if there are no demons.

329
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,478
What if they come back?

330
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:55,399
Then we'll have to have them again.
I better put them all back.

331
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:59,361
Sweetie, you don't
really seem like yourself.

332
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:06,118
- I don't? Who am I?
- No, I mean... You're stalling.

333
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:09,788
You know what, it's okay.
We know what we're doing. We're ready.

334
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:12,457
You sure? What if something goes wrong?

335
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:16,712
Well, then we'll fix it
like we always do. Come on.

336
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:19,840
- What was that? That!
- What was what?

337
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,176
I don't know, why don't you tell me?

338
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:27,431
- Come on, everybody's waiting.
- Everybody.

339
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,310
Hey, I was just looking for you guys.

340
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,686
Why, what's wrong?

341
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,564
Nothing's wrong.
I just wanna know what happened.

342
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:38,358
Nothing happened.
I think that's the problem.

343
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,069
What? Are you feeling okay?

344
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,574
- What was that?
- See?

345
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:49,286
- See what?
- Guys... You mind?

346
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:52,664
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I think so.

347
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:56,001
Is there something we should know
that we don't know.

348
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:57,461
You know?

349
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:03,091
No, Paige.

350
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:05,594
We forgot about Zankou,
what if he attacks?

351
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:08,931
- True, what if he does attack?
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.

352
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,183
Okay, what's wrong? We discussed this.

353
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,644
You'll still have
your powers afterwards.

354
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,773
- If Zankou attacks, you'll be prepared.
- He'll be more exposed than ever.

355
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,568
Especially as you continue
to thin out the demonic ranks.

356
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,695
How do we know you're not lying to us?

357
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,532
Okay, let's... Let's do this.

358
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:28,659
Very well.

359
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:33,956
- Where'd you come from?
- They're a little nervous.

360
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,958
I understand.

361
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,168
Place your hands on the cartouche.

362
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,047
It's okay.

363
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,254
It has begun.

364
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:12,679
I mean, is everyone okay?
You sure nobody's hurt?

365
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,806
The effect was gradual.

366
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,100
They all fell asleep gently and safely.

367
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,810
How do you know that for sure?

368
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:21,396
Do you see anybody
who's been harmed in any way?

369
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,815
That doesn't rule out internal injuries.

370
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:25,692
- Piper.
- What?

371
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,904
Everybody's like this around the world?

372
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:31,907
- All around the world.
- What about aeroplanes?

373
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:35,828
- How do we know they landed safely?
- The Avatars took care of that.

374
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:39,832
- Relax. What's gotten into you guys?
- I think we have a right to be jumpy

375
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,377
- with everything that's going on.
- Perhaps it'd help to focus

376
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:46,713
on the straggler demons.
They hide amongst your kind.

377
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,342
If there are any nearby,
they're only pretending to be asleep.

378
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:53,262
- I shoulda known.
- Why don't they just leave?

379
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,722
They've got no place else left to go.

380
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,226
- Over there, he moved.
- What?

381
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:02,187
- What? Where? Which one?
- That one in the bad suit.

382
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:07,818
- You must be certain.
- Okay. Go be certain.

383
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,123
Paige, look out!

384
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,633
Well, at least I know I'm not paranoid.

385
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,386
How long until
the transformation is complete?

386
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:37,723
Two hours. Which means
we should get back until it's safe.

387
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,643
I'm not leaving them here alone.
Don't worry Beta, I'll be fine.

388
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:46,982
Let's split up.
We'll find more demons that way.

389
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:49,776
Piper, Paige, Phoebe and me.
Any sign of trouble,

390
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,612
- orb back to the manor.
- Got it.

391
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:58,076
Why do you think
he didn't wanna go with me?

392
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,746
- You think he's seeing someone else?
- Come on!

393
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:02,539
What?

394
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,085
I don't understand,
what are we waiting for?

395
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:14,218
That... is what we're waiting for.

396
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:18,096
Your death will not
have been in vain, my friend.

397
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:21,183
I promise you.

398
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,610
- What the hell was that all about?
- He saw what I needed to see.

399
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:35,489
Now I know which Avatar we'll be
flushing out, and you'll be killing.

400
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:36,949
What? How?

401
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:40,994
- I'm gonna need a volunteer.
- Does it have to be me?

402
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,624
- No.
- Oh, good. I'll get right on it.

403
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,293
I don't like this.
I don't like being in the dark

404
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,963
- about what's going on.
- What are you gonna do?

405
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:53,632
- Not kill an Avatar, for one.
- Then you'll die.

406
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,467
Better me than the sisters.

407
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:58,136
How many times do I tell you,
I'm not after them.

408
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:01,849
- Why won't you tell me what I'm doing?
- That's what you get when you

409
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:03,642
make a deal with the devil.

410
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:08,480
I'm not doing anything
until I know the sisters are all right.

411
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:13,694
They're still alive, if that's
what you mean, their paranoia growing.

412
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:16,154
What are we waiting for?

413
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:19,199
The opportune time to show yourself...

414
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:24,830
...which nears.
- When?

415
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,416
When I send one of the sisters to you.

416
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:31,420
- The one you care so much about.
- How does that flush out the Avatars?

417
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:33,881
Just say they wanted you to stay awake.

418
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,383
Tell her it was
the female Avatar, Beta.

419
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,429
Your girlfriend will get so paranoid
she'll demand an explanation.

420
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:44,975
When the Avatar shows up to give one,
that's when you strike with the potion.

421
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,562
Don't miss.
You won't get a second chance.

422
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:52,232
First, how do I reverse the paranoia?

423
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,904
You are persistent, aren't you?

424
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:01,575
Very well.

425
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:06,622
You break the crystal.
The sisters will revert immediately.

426
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:09,500
- That's it?
- That's it.

427
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,919
Why didn't you tell me this before?

428
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:15,047
The same reason you didn't
tell me where the potion was.

429
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:16,423
Leverage.

430
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:22,137
Remember... Don't miss.

431
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:48,705
- Sure you're all right?
- I'm fine. I just...

432
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,666
I have a bad feeling about this.

433
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:53,126
You've had a
bad feeling about everything.

434
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:57,005
I have a really bad feeling about this.
You sure we're not being set up?

435
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,883
- Not this again.
- I'm serious. What if the Avatars

436
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,594
are like the Trojan horse?
Remember the horse?

437
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,346
- Phoebe...
- Come into your life

438
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:06,098
pretending to be the gift,

439
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:10,394
- but what they want to do is kill you.
- This really isn't like you.

440
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,563
Leo. Listen to me, okay?

441
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:15,566
It's the ultimate conspiracy.
Think about it for...

442
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,067
What was that?

443
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:19,570
It was nothing.

444
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:22,114
- You need to calm down.
- I am very calm, okay?

445
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:25,492
I can't help what I'm feeling,
and what I'm feeling now is...

446
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:27,035
Demons!

447
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:36,170
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, again.
- Why did you run?

448
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:37,546
I don't know.

449
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:40,299
Something's wrong,
I'm getting you out of here.

450
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:49,266
I haven't seen any demons for a while.

451
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,351
Do you think that means something?

452
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,395
- I don't know. You?
- I don't know.

453
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,440
Why are you stopping?
What do you see?

454
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,609
Nothing. Relax.

455
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:01,820
- What if they get us?
- Who is "they"?

456
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:04,823
They! They as in them,
the ones who're always trying.

457
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,701
- You're making me crazy.
- You're making me crazy!

458
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:09,036
What's wrong with us?

459
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,836
- Oh, sorry.
- You okay?

460
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:19,379
Yes.

461
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:22,090
But I'm afraid that
your friend may not be.

462
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:25,177
- Kyle?
- What's wrong with him?

463
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:26,720
We don't know.

464
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:29,765
All we know is he
didn't fall asleep like everyone.

465
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:31,183
What does that mean?

466
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:35,479
That means that Zankou
must have gotten to him again.

467
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:38,315
- Shielded him from us.
- But why?

468
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:42,736
Because he thinks he has the potion.
I should never have left him alone.

469
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:48,242
Hey! You can't leave me here alone!

470
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:50,410
- Demon!
- What? Where?

471
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,162
Go, get him!

472
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:03,549
Kyle? Are you here?

473
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:06,093
Yeah. I'm right here.

474
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:12,057
You okay? Did he hurt you?

475
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:14,768
- Did who hurt me?
- Zankou.

476
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:17,646
- We have to get you out of here.
- Wait. Why?

477
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:20,274
He thinks you have the potion.
He'll kill you.

478
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,026
Don't you think
he would have killed me by now?

479
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,283
That's why he's keeping you awake.
Because he thinks you still have it.

480
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:32,119
He's not the one
keeping me awake, Paige.

481
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:33,412
It's the Avatars.

482
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:36,290
It's Beta.

483
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:41,879
- Okay, but she said Zankou did it.
- Maybe you ought to call her here.

484
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:46,091
Beta!

485
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:52,472
What's the matter? Why isn't he asleep?

486
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,975
- You told me Zankou did it.
- I did not.

487
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:58,187
Yes, you did. What the hell is going on?

488
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:06,111
- What was that?
- I wanted to make sure

489
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:08,989
- you were back to normal before I...
- Before what?

490
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:43,398
Please don't hate me.

491
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:47,986
I don't hate you.
Of course I don't hate you.

492
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:51,490
- I didn't want it to end like this.
- It's not gonna end this way,

493
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:55,494
- I promise. I'm gonna call for help...
- No. You can't call for Leo.

494
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:56,703
Why?

495
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:01,792
Because he's vulnerable.
They all are. Zankou will kill 'em.

496
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:06,171
Why did you do this?

497
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:09,883
To stop them.

498
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:17,224
- Leo!
- He can't hear you, Paige.

499
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:21,895
He's been affected by what's happened.

500
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,524
We all have.

501
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:28,277
Can't you just rewind time?

502
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:31,238
Just go back and fix it?

503
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,490
I'm sorry, Paige.

504
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,326
But we've come too far to go back now.

505
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,079
But he's dying.

506
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:44,501
Yes, and he's weakened the collective.

507
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:47,296
Risked losing
all we've worked to create.

508
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:49,673
The demon will take advantage
of this to stop us.

509
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,593
He won't be able to
if we consolidate power.

510
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,428
Complete the transformation.

511
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:59,057
What the hell are you talking about?
What about him?

512
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:01,643
The needs of the one...

513
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:05,314
...must be sacrificed
for the good of the many.

514
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,524
You'll understand soon.

515
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:12,321
I did not sign up for this experiment
so you could play God!

516
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:15,324
So, you fix this right now!

517
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:16,909
He's dead.

518
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:27,794
Please don't go.

519
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,172
We must move quickly.

520
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:32,382
We can't fight
both them and the demon.

521
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:33,634
What about Leo?

522
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,429
He's one of us now. He'll understand.

523
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:46,605
Please... Please.

524
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,987
I don't get it.
I don't know what happened.

525
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:56,490
One minute I feel like
everyone's after me,

526
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:58,575
and then the next minute I feel fine.

527
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:00,786
- Yeah, I don't.
- What's the matter?

528
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:04,164
- What are you feeling?
- All of a sudden I feel weaker.

529
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:08,126
Well, maybe you should sit... down...

530
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:13,298
Phoebe?

531
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:15,551
Phoebe!

532
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:18,846
Phoebe, can you hear me? Wake up!

533
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:22,724
Piper!

534
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:26,061
Piper.

535
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:27,771
Piper!

536
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:30,399
Piper.

537
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:35,320
She's just sleeping, Leo.

538
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:39,908
- She'll be fine. They'll all be fine.
- What have you done to her?

539
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:44,037
- The thing that's done to everyone.
- They weren't supposed to turn yet.

540
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,582
- Not till they were ready.
- We had no choice.

541
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:49,084
What do you mean
you didn't have a choice?

542
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:53,046
- You can't do this!
- Beta's dead, Leo.

543
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:54,381
What?

544
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:58,510
It's why you feel less powerful.
Why we all do.

545
00:36:58,677 --> 00:36:59,720
But how did...?

546
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:03,849
It seems that Agent Brody
had another potion, after all.

547
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:09,146
One that both he and Zankou
hoped to bring down Utopia with,

548
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:10,522
before it even began.

549
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:14,359
We can't let that happen. The sooner
we complete the transformation,

550
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:16,445
the less chance he has of succeeding.

551
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:19,823
Which is why we need the power
of the Charmed Ones with us.

552
00:37:20,616 --> 00:37:24,369
Now more than ever.
I'm sure you understand.

553
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:26,830
But we were supposed
to talk to them first.

554
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:32,836
Ideally, yes.
But Paige was inconsolable.

555
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:38,675
Agent Brody is dead as well.

556
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:42,137
We must press on, Leo.

557
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:45,057
Now, or Zankou will win.

558
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:48,727
All that we've done
will have been for naught.

559
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:53,065
We can still give them
the world they've always wanted.

560
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:57,069
The happiness they've never known.
The happiness you've never known.

561
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:00,614
But we must move quickly.

562
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:02,866
And as one.

563
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:06,829
I just... I don't see how Paige
is gonna be happy after what happened.

564
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:10,999
- She'll understand.
- Everyone will understand

565
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:17,297
that those who bring conflict
into the world cannot be tolerated.

566
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:43,824
Hey, I'm sorry. This is my fault.

567
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:46,869
Forget it. No big deal.

568
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:49,121
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

569
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:51,123
I'm so embarrassed.

570
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:05,888
I am so sorry.
I don't know what happened.

571
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:08,265
- Have you got insurance?
- Yeah.

572
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:11,894
- Then don't worry about it.
- Thanks.

573
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:27,951
Well?

574
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:30,245
Utopia has begun.

575
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:32,915
What's that mean? We're screwed?

576
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:37,169
The Avatars have turned on
the witches sooner than I anticipated.

577
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:40,422
We can't change things back
without their help.

578
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:43,967
Then we've gotta get out of here.
They'll be coming for us too.

579
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,889
- No, we have time.
- How do you figure?

580
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:51,934
It's over, Zankou.

581
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,144
We don't stand a chance in this world.

582
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:58,065
Still, we planted a seed.
Let's see if it sprouts.

583
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:07,157
I don't know what
you're so worried about.

584
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:09,493
It's all good, as far as I'm concerned.

585
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,412
But they were supposed
to wait until you were ready.

586
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:16,333
Well, as you know, I've been more
than ready for this for a long time.

587
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,671
Hey! I feel great!
Don't you guys feel great?

588
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:22,214
Yeah, pretty amazing.

589
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:25,843
It's weird, I remember the old way.
You know, the demon battling

590
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,637
and everything,
but I'm not stressed about it.

591
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:31,598
That's because we don't
have to worry about demons,

592
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:35,727
which leaves us
a little time to live a little.

593
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:37,145
Where are the boys?

594
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:40,691
Magic School.
Are you sure you're okay with this?

595
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:44,653
Leo, of course, are you kidding?
How could we not be?

596
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:48,448
Hi.

597
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:52,077
- Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.
- Me too.

598
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:56,623
How you doing? Are you hanging in there?

599
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,877
Yeah. Yeah, I'm holding up.

600
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:04,006
It's... pretty damn sad.

601
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:08,051
But he's going on
to a better place, right?

602
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:11,638
I'm gonna go upstairs and rest.
