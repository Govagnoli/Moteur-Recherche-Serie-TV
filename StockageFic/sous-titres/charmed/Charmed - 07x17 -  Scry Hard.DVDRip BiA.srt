1
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,256
Ready?

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,258
Surprise!

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,179
- Wow!
- Isn't it great?

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:16,350
It's... It's something.

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:21,605
- You hate it.
- No, no. I don't hate anything.

6
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:22,898
It's just...

7
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,527
The dining room and then
the living room and, you know,

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,696
when you rearranged the kitchen...
I did kinda hate that.

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,865
You complain about what a mess it is.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:36,578
Yeah, I know, but it's an attic,
and it's supposed to be messy.

11
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:41,458
It's not that I don't appreciate you
helping around the house, because I do.

12
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,837
It's just... It's just a little much.

13
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,923
Well, you know,
I just... shuffled some things around.

14
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,968
"Shuffled"? You call this shuffling?

15
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,637
Honey, you built things.

16
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,349
You hung things. You bagged things.

17
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,018
I mean, what is this?

18
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,814
Those are corks.
You know, for the potion bottles.

19
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:07,860
- Leave 'em out and they get brittle.
- That doesn't seem like overkill?

20
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:15,284
- I'm just trying to help.
- I know, honey, and that's very sweet.

21
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,828
But, you know,
I kinda liked the attic messy.

22
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,621
I knew where everything was.

23
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:25,335
- Where did you find that?
- Under some blankets. Why?

24
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,298
I just... I haven't seen it in years.

25
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:34,261
- Is it wet?
- Well, it needed some touch-ups.

26
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:39,516
- Have you gone crazy again?
- Look, this isn't easy for me.

27
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,435
I know, sweetie. I know.

28
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,313
You've been a Whitelighter,
an Elder, an Avatar...

29
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,647
Don't remind me.

30
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,442
The point is,
if it's magical, you've done it.

31
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,571
So it's not gonna be easy to
adjust to life without powers overnight.

32
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:57,534
And tackling all these projects is...
a little obsessive.

33
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,411
Well, what am I supposed to do?

34
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,706
I can't orb. I can't go
to the Elders for information.

35
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,958
I just want to fit in.

36
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,629
I know. But brittle corks?

37
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,174
Okay, I guess maybe
that was a little much.

38
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:16,845
There is no how-to book on this, okay?
We're gonna get through it. Together.

39
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,097
Besides, this is what we wanted.

40
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,891
Normal.

41
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,852
I guess I didn't
expect normal to be so hard.

42
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,437
Well, you can't force it.

43
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:28,357
And you don't need to.
We've got plenty of time.

44
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,700
Demon!

45
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,327
Oh, no, you don't!

46
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,583
Still think we've got time?

47
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,969
Did you wound him?

48
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,847
Just as you've instructed.

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,186
Good.

50
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,955
- What are you doing?
- Trying to ID the demon.

51
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,917
That's not what I mean. Why
aren't you sitting down? You got hit.

52
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:55,921
Yeah, but it's just a scratch.
I think this crescent might be tribal.

53
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:59,132
You're not listening.
You're not vanquishing anybody.

54
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,384
Why not?

55
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:05,097
Well, for one thing, because
you can't self-heal any more.

56
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,516
Hunting demons is too dangerous.

57
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,519
You can't self-heal either
and it doesn't stop you.

58
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,939
- Yeah, but I can blow things up.
- Yeah, I noticed.

59
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,148
Leo...

60
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,359
I don't know why
you're making a big deal.

61
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,319
A demon tried to kill you.

62
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,573
Demons try to kill us every week.
What do you want me to do,

63
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,033
- hide in Magic School?
- It's a thought.

64
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,369
- I was kidding.
- Well, I'm not.

65
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:31,123
It's great that you gave up your powers
to be with us and everything,

66
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,208
but things are gonna have to change.

67
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,254
You've only got one life to live and
I'd like you to start taking care of it.

68
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:41,842
Okay. Well, I didn't become mortal
to go run and hide. I'm staying put.

69
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,927
- Leo, please...
- I've made up my mind.

70
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,975
Well, I have to clean it, don't I?

71
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,687
Hey, little guy.

72
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:00,444
Hey, hey, look. Everything's okay.

73
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,322
Look, see? It's just a scratch, okay?

74
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,073
It's nothing.

75
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,498
Come on, come on!

76
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:17,127
Advanced magical orbing.
Tuesdays or Thursdays?

77
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,964
Busy?

78
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,257
Exactly what I need.

79
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,553
- Would you throw that at the calendar?
- What? No! Look, a demon...

80
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,974
You don't understand. I've been doing
schedules all week and I'm going insane.

81
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,602
That's exactly what I need
to make decisions!

82
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,146
- Would you please throw it. Throw it?
- Fine.

83
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,238
Fridays! Brilliant.

84
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,116
I'm glad to see the future of magic
is in such capable hands.

85
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,828
Just trying to keep things lively.
What's up?

86
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,624
- A demon attacked Leo.
- What? Is he okay?

87
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,837
He's fine, but I need you to scry with
that thing and then vanquish the demon.

88
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,965
I'd do it myself, but I have
to get home and protect Leo.

89
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,968
- Why didn't you bring him here?
- He's being stubborn.

90
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,554
So I had to set
some crystals to keep him safe.

91
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,974
- He let you do this?
- He doesn't know.

92
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,894
I think there's something
you're not telling me.

93
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:21,191
Leo and I are having a little trouble
adjusting to him being human again.

94
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,151
That would be a big adjustment.

95
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,905
We're gonna have to adjust to the fact
that he can't heal us any more.

96
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,075
Or himself.
And I don't wanna keep forcing Wyatt

97
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,452
to tap into his powers
before he's ready.

98
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,497
- Why not? He healed you before.
- Yeah, with some help.

99
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:39,168
We can't keep traumatising him.
We've got to find another way.

100
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,505
- So, you can handle all this?
- Absolutely.

101
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,966
You might wanna call Phoebe.

102
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,760
That thing is probably
from some sort of tribe.

103
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,471
- Got it! All over it!
- Thanks for the help.

104
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,940
I have assembled my fiercest warriors.

105
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,027
They better be as capable as you claim.

106
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,362
The Charmed Ones will be here soon.

107
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,908
The Charmed Ones... are coming here?

108
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,827
As soon as they scry with your crescent.

109
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,289
Why do you think I told you
to leave it behind?

110
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,669
So, you're luring them into a trap...

111
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,422
...to destroy them.

112
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,217
Think you can destroy them
with one small tribe?

113
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,014
No wonder demons always perish
at the hands of those witches.

114
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,976
Well, then what exactly is your plan?

115
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,523
Your troops and I
are gonna keep them busy

116
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,901
while you return to the manor
to locate the spiritual Nexus,

117
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,320
and with it... the Shadow.

118
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,951
No demon has been able to harness
the power of the Shadow before.

119
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:58,038
Don't get ahead of yourself, Craven.
You're only gonna find the Nexus.

120
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,582
You won't have time for anything else.

121
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,878
And you're sure no one will be home?

122
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,340
That's why you wounded
their former Whitelighter.

123
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,676
If I know theses witches, and I do,

124
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,512
they're gonna strike
with the full Power of Three.

125
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,473
But they won't do that
unless Leo is somewhere safe.

126
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,685
So, yes, the manor will be empty.

127
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:25,065
Well, I only ask because it seems
that those that help you don't always...

128
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,652
...survive.

129
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,323
But you attacked
at their home and lived.

130
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,577
Few can boast that.

131
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,874
Take your positions.
We're about to have company.

132
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,883
Split infinitive, I don't think so...

133
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,762
You should really call
before you do that.

134
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,807
A demon attacked Leo
and Piper wants us to take him out.

135
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,977
- Think you have enough potion?
- Better safe than sorry.

136
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,938
- Come on, we should go.
- Why do you seem excited?

137
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,649
Because we need to protect
our brother-in-law,

138
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,902
and because we
should make a statement.

139
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:15,532
- Because I'm cooped up in Magic School.
- All right, let me just go tell Elise.

140
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,120
Hey, column's done.
I'll see you tomorrow.

141
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,123
No, you don't! This time
I've got a family emergency.

142
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,375
I need you to
get the evening edition out.

143
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:30,214
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? What
about Dillard? Isn't he your number two?

144
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,134
- Richard's out sick.
- But I'm just an advice columnist.

145
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,471
Surely you're skipping
some rungs on the ladder here.

146
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,557
Don't sell yourself short, Phoebe.
I have faith in you.

147
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,976
You owe me.
Think of the times I've covered

148
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,896
- for your family emergencies.
- That's different.

149
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,524
- How so?
- Because they were my emergencies.

150
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,360
So, your life
is more important than mine?

151
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:54,154
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Good.

152
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,700
- I'm sure you'll do a fantastic job.
- Phoebe. Just who I was looking for.

153
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,994
- Who're you?
- Tom Taylor, copy editor.

154
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,998
I gotta cut Bauer's column to 1,500
words and he's threatened to kill me.

155
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,543
- Gimme a sec.
- Excuse me, Phoebe.

156
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,962
- Elise said I should talk to you.
- Really?

157
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,715
- It seems we've oversold ad space.
- Well, okay. Elise...

158
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,676
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

159
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,845
Yeah, hi...

160
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,847
- Phoebe, I need...
- Okay.

161
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,558
- Phoebe...
- Yeah, just...

162
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,602
That's the attic. Good.
That's where we are right now.

163
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,523
What's this right here?
That's Mommy and Daddy's room, right.

164
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,776
Yeah. Right there. Very good.

165
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,904
- Hey.
- Hey.

166
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,783
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

167
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,704
Well, you know, seeing as how
a demon tried to K-l-L-L you.

168
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:48,584
- Right. Well, I'm fine.
- Why are you so defensive?

169
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,130
I don't know. I guess maybe
I feel like I have something to prove.

170
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,466
Leo, I was just trying to protect you.

171
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:01,763
- I know, but you don't need to.
- Yeah, obviously I do.

172
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,850
Piper, wait!

173
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:11,148
Okay, me and Mommy have to
have a grown-up conversation, okay?

174
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:13,108
I'll be right back.

175
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,576
Okay, we have ten minutes.
What? I told 'em I'd be right back.

176
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:25,871
- It's gonna take what it's gonna take.
- I have a deadline.

177
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,624
Do you know how much work
goes into one edition?

178
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,502
- I can't believe Elise just dropped...
- Focus!

179
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,463
Okay. So now what do we do?

180
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,715
I don't know.

181
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:41,094
- Greetings.
- Zankou!

182
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,097
What are you doing here?
Paige, what is he doing here?

183
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,726
- How am I supposed to know?
- Where's your other sister, Piper?

184
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,437
- Why do you want to know?
- I have my reasons.

185
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:54,441
We'd love to stay and chat, but we have
business that we need to attend to.

186
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,485
I know.

187
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,197
It's gonna take longer than ten minutes.

188
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,326
Why are you so mad at me?

189
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,496
Because you're gonna
get yourself killed, that's why.

190
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,499
Okay, well, I can...
I can handle myself.

191
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,877
Really? The way you
handled yourself this morning?

192
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,463
You know, I could have handled that.

193
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,008
- How?
- I would have thought of something.

194
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,678
I'm so glad you would've
thought of something.

195
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:26,807
- Now I don't have to worry.
- Okay, it was good that you were there.

196
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,644
That doesn't give you the right
to hide crystals behind my back.

197
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,980
I was just trying to protect you.

198
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,773
I'm supposed to protect you.

199
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,526
- Is that what all this is about?
- It's part of it.

200
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,945
It's my instinct to protect you, Piper.

201
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:43,448
The reason I don't hide from demons
is 'cause I've never had to.

202
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,243
- I realise that.
- Okay. Well, Wyatt doesn't.

203
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,329
He's seen me get hurt,
and I don't want that to hurt him.

204
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,916
Okay, look, we are
going to get through this.

205
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,712
I know we are. But you, yourself,
said it was gonna take time.

206
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,214
Which means I'm gonna make mistakes.

207
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,384
Okay, and when I do,
I need you to be supportive.

208
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,845
You know, not drown the plants.

209
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:10,184
Well, I guess we all have
our own ways of dealing with things.

210
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,685
Guess so.

211
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,108
What are you doing here?

212
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,530
- Dining room.
- I see where he went. Stay here.

213
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,711
Wyatt.

214
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,180
Wyatt, get upstairs!

215
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,143
Leo!

216
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,905
Leo...

217
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:06,865
Are you okay?

218
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,327
Yeah. No. Don't let Wyatt see.

219
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,580
Honey, why don't you go upstairs?

220
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:17,960
- Mommy and Daddy are fine.
- Sweetie, what's the matter?

221
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,962
What is he doing?

222
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,722
What just happened?

223
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:45,320
Why's he doing this?
I have a paper to put out!

224
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,198
I'm sure that factored
into his decision-making.

225
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,408
I don't understand.

226
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:52,828
How'd we go from a demon
attacking Leo to Zankou attacking us?

227
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,581
Maybe 'cause Leo's mortal,
he's making his move.

228
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:03,505
Don't be shy, ladies.
You knew this day would come.

229
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,008
Take one of these.

230
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:09,178
We have to get back to Piper,
and I have to get back to work!

231
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,430
I wanna let him know we're in the game.

232
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,683
One sister is still at the manor.

233
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,437
I know. I have
the other two pinned down.

234
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,107
Would you turn that thing off!

235
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:26,403
Sorry, but you gotta admire the range.
We're in the Underworld. That's good.

236
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,072
You're making this too easy.

237
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,000
Looking for us?

238
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:46,131
- You missed!
- Okay, that's our cue.

239
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,597
So much for your plan.

240
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,769
Gather the remaining tribe.
This may still work.

241
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,195
Wyatt.

242
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:11,198
You need to make
Mommy and Daddy big again.

243
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,034
Maybe he can't hear us.

244
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,454
What happened?

245
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't know. I think Wyatt put some
kind of force field on the dollhouse.

246
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:27,756
- Wyatt! Let us out of here!
- We know you were trying to help.

247
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:31,218
- Daddy needs to get to the hospital.
- You're gonna scare him.

248
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:35,472
That's probably why he put us in here
in the first place, to protect us.

249
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:38,016
Great. We're supposed
to be protecting him.

250
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:42,980
Okay. Let me handle Wyatt.
This requires a mother's touch.

251
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:46,650
Wyatt Matthew Halliwell!
You will stop this nonsense right now!

252
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:50,863
- First time you used his full name.
- Sounds better when I'm scolding him.

253
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,365
I don't think he
understands what's going on.

254
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,659
All he knows
is a demon tried to kill Dad.

255
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,954
I don't understand
why anyone would attack you.

256
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,331
It's not like you're a threat to anyone.

257
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,793
I don't understand how a demon
thinks the house'd be empty.

258
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,921
We're not gonna
figure out anything from inside here.

259
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:11,258
At least the furniture is comfortable.

260
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,135
You know, for toy furniture.

261
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,470
Where'd you get
this dollhouse anyway?

262
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,890
- Grams made it.
- She made it?

263
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,225
I didn't know she was a witch back then.

264
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,895
So, obviously,
she used some sort of magic.

265
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,773
It's pretty perfect.

266
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,359
Almost perfect.

267
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,778
What's that?

268
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,281
Wyatt and Chris,
what are you doing up here?

269
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,116
Paige!

270
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:39,495
- Paige, down here!
- Where's your mommy and daddy?

271
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:42,080
I saw what happened downstairs. Okay.

272
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,129
All right, babies,

273
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:52,883
we're gonna go to Magic School
till we can figure out what happened.

274
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,058
I see he's just as stubborn
as someone else I know.

275
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,402
- Well?
- The house is clear.

276
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,783
That's what you said the last time.

277
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,868
A slight miscalculation.

278
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:23,038
But the plan was to get 'em
out of the manor, and they are.

279
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:26,625
Probably circling
their broomsticks in Magic School.

280
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:31,255
- So I'm going back for the Nexus?
- Except this time I'm coming with you.

281
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,965
Follow me.

282
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,644
The Charmed Ones' ancestral home.

283
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:48,564
How do we know this isn't a trap?

284
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,526
We don't. That's why
I asked for reinforcement.

285
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:54,653
Give the command.

286
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,447
Spread out. Find the Nexus.

287
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:04,204
- How are we gonna get out of here?
- We can't. It's useless.

288
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,124
That's all you've got for me?

289
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:11,211
We're supposed to sit and do nothing
while you bleed to death on the couch?

290
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,880
What do you want me to say?

291
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,299
I can't self-heal any more.

292
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,758
Without a doctor...

293
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:21,013
- You used to be a doctor.
- Yeah, like 60 years ago.

294
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,265
Well, start acting like one!

295
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:26,476
Come on, you have to
stop focusing on what you can't do,

296
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,520
and think about what you can do.

297
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:32,566
- Come on! Lmprovise!
- All right.

298
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:37,196
- Grams used to like to sew, right?
- Yeah...

299
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:38,864
Where?

300
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:44,286
Wyatt's bedroom used
to be her sewing room. Why?

301
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:51,126
Okay... Now what?

302
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:54,630
- Needle and thread.
- Excuse me?

303
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:58,217
- Don't worry, I'll walk you through it.
- Walk me through what?

304
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:03,430
- Oh, no! No, no, no...
- You're the one who said "improvise".

305
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:07,142
Well, since when does
anybody listen to me?

306
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:11,480
You can do this. Let's prove to Wyatt
we can handle whatever's thrown at us.

307
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,651
All right, just...

308
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:18,445
...pull the skin together
and stitch it through.

309
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:21,823
- Sure. Easy for you to say.
- I'm ready. Do it.

310
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,201
- Are you sure?
- Hurry.

311
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:32,417
Where have you been?
I've been trying to reach you all day!

312
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,962
Funny, I've been
trying to avoid you all day.

313
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,006
That's a good one.
Listen, I need to get out of here

314
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,133
because there's a crisis at home.

315
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,928
It's always life and death
with you Halliwells.

316
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,347
- Can I freshen up those drinks?
- Drinks?

317
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,891
- What drinks?
- Yes, thank you.

318
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,561
Wait. What did you say
your emergency was?

319
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,604
I didn't.

320
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:55,691
I'm so sorry about that, Richard.

321
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:59,570
This moron's trying
to take a knife to my column!

322
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:03,907
Well, what seems to be the problem?
Obviously, besides the knife.

323
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,910
Phoebe, it's a great story.
Really, it is.

324
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:10,706
- It's just a bit bloated.
- Bloated? I'll show you bloated!

325
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:12,958
You know what? Please don't.

326
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,961
Lady, I've been working
the beat for 22 years.

327
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:19,631
No lvy League trust funder is
gonna tell me how to write the news!

328
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:22,551
- You know...
- Fashion editor. Sorry to interrupt,

329
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:27,681
but our so-called film critic has been
drinking coffee out of my teacup.

330
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:30,184
I don't know what
Jordan's worked up about,

331
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,477
it's a two-and-a-half star mug... at best.

332
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:37,024
- Phoebe, we gotta go.
- Yeah. I know, I know.

333
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:39,818
I wanna get Zankou as much as you.
Where's Piper?

334
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,613
That's the problem.
Piper and Leo have vanished.

335
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,282
- What do you mean? The boys?
- The boys are fine.

336
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:48,494
- We have to find their parents.
- Let me ask you a question.

337
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,205
Ever push the deadline
for the evening edition?

338
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,833
No. Then it'd be the "sometime
in the middle of the night" edition.

339
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,878
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna go into my office

340
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:02,216
for a very important conference call.
No interruptions!

341
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,442
Oh, goodness!

342
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:22,945
Hope you got a discount
on all that leather.

343
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,489
That's something
I admire about you ladies.

344
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:28,826
Always a clever remark
at the face of danger.

345
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:31,411
Though... I'm insulted.

346
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:34,581
Don't you think I warrant
the Power of Three?

347
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:36,792
Does he know where Piper is?

348
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:41,004
No. How would he know
about her nail appointment?

349
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:44,383
You'd think she'd be at
Magic School attending to her husband.

350
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,470
She didn't wanna pay the cancellation
fee for the nail appointment.

351
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:50,389
You're lying.

352
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:53,475
Somehow the Power of Two
doesn't have the ring to it.

353
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,195
Now what?

354
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,030
Tie it off and cut it.

355
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:09,032
Scissors.

356
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,956
Aren't you happy you became a mortal?

357
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,167
At least now we can grow old together

358
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,295
- like every other couple.
- That is, if we survive this.

359
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:25,215
Wyatt's so worried, he practically
locked us up and threw away the key.

360
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:29,219
I'll just have to prove to him that
I can take care of myself and my family.

361
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:32,598
Yeah, it would help if we were
reinstated to our former size.

362
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,191
What's he doing here?

363
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:47,571
Post guards throughout the manor.
Soon as they find her, they'll be back.

364
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:51,408
- We need to fend them off.
- If we're to find the Nexus?

365
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,994
- The Nexus?
- Where are Phoebe and Paige?

366
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:56,288
I want more than to find the Nexus.

367
00:24:56,455 --> 00:25:00,584
I want to release the Shadow.
Harness its ultimate power.

368
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,294
Can you do that?

369
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:05,881
Well, now that evil has taken
over control of the manor, I can.

370
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:11,011
And I will.

371
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,901
I can't believe we've
been miniature for two hours

372
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:29,655
and demons take over the house!
If Zankou taps into the Nexus...

373
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:33,283
- We're not gonna let that happen.
- How? We're three inches tall!

374
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,954
We're gonna get to the Book
and contact Phoebe and Paige.

375
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:41,750
That Book? 'Cause A, we're trapped.

376
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:45,712
And B, even if we weren't, those
demons could squash us with one foot.

377
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,798
- Stay calm.
- Now you're telling me.

378
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:51,677
Wyatt didn't put us in here to get hurt.
He put us in here to protect us.

379
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:54,304
There has to be
something we're overlooking.

380
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:57,683
- Blasting doesn't work.
- Yeah, I noticed.

381
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,060
All the doors, the windows are sealed.

382
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:03,689
Listen, how did you play with the
dollhouse when you were little?

383
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:06,733
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it's a toy, right?

384
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:11,363
- I think you've lost too much blood.
- No, listen to me.

385
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,784
If it's a toy, it must open.
The roof opens or doors swing open.

386
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,911
I don't know. That's a lot of years ago.

387
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:22,583
- It might be our only shot. Think.
- I think it swung open.

388
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:23,876
Where?

389
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:30,799
Here.

390
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:49,568
Damn it!

391
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:50,777
Blast it.

392
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:54,364
- Blasting doesn't work.
- Maybe the force field only covers

393
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:57,367
the windows and the doors.
So, you know, do it.

394
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,585
- Now what?
- Follow me.

395
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:28,732
- I believe we've loc...
- Do you have any idea how upset

396
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:33,153
- Piper was when her sister died?
- Sorry?

397
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,116
Listen to this. "Prue was always
the strong one. Now that she's gone,

398
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:41,745
I don't know if we'll have the strength
to keep fighting for good.

399
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:44,790
- Or if it's even worth it."
- Yes, well, if only...

400
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:47,167
Humans are slaves
to their own emotions.

401
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,962
And the strongest emotion is love.

402
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:53,257
That's why Piper didn't leave
her husband's side to fight.

403
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:55,968
That was my miscalculation.

404
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:59,388
They would go
through hell to stay together.

405
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,226
What is it?

406
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:06,645
I believe we have found the Nexus.

407
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:24,830
You gotta give me one sec.
Any luck with Piper?

408
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,541
I've scried the universe
and there's no sign.

409
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,877
Please come back
to Magic School with me.

410
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,462
- Give me two minutes.
- Our sister is missing!

411
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,632
There's 50 jobs on the line
if the paper doesn't come out.

412
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:39,595
You can cancel the subscription to
our house if the demons don't get out.

413
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:41,221
Just give me one minute.

414
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:49,354
Okay... Check this out.

415
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:52,107
Do you think I'm gonna
let Ask Phoebe rewrite me?

416
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:54,401
Read now, bitch later! Okay?

417
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:56,945
So you oversold the space.
Let me see the ads.

418
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:00,741
- Shrink 'em and print 'em both.
- We can't do that.

419
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:03,243
Advertisers were
promised a certain size.

420
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,578
Make the font bigger.

421
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,748
If they complain, send them
a bottle of Cristal on my tab.

422
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:09,791
Actually, on Elise's tab.

423
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,794
- What do you think?
- It works.

424
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:15,214
That's what I like to hear. Who's next?

425
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:21,512
First, my teacup.
Now he's on my computer.

426
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,931
You know what?
Isn't this kind of obvious?

427
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,558
- What?
- He likes you.

428
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,067
Any other questions?

429
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:39,488
No. Okay. I will be
in my office, in a meeting.

430
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:45,202
- Can you believe those guys?
- At least they're not pre-pubescent.

431
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:46,787
Paige, Piper, demons.

432
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,126
Are you sure this is a good idea?

433
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:56,171
- The Nexus...
- The Nexus is neutral.

434
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:00,092
Controlled by
whomever controls the manor.

435
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:04,263
The Shadow is the ultimate power.

436
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,515
It could destroy us all.

437
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:12,437
Well, then if I'm wrong,
it's been a pleasure.

438
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:45,220
Good must still
be present in the manor.

439
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:48,891
No, no. That's not possible.
You expelled the witches yourself.

440
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,767
Only two.

441
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,395
That means the third one
must still be here.

442
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,148
That's probably what they came here for.

443
00:30:57,524 --> 00:30:59,610
So, what do we do?

444
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:03,113
We find her.

445
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,244
Are you okay?

446
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:12,498
My arms are sore, but I'm not
the one with a hole in my back.

447
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:15,375
All right.
Let's tweak the scrying spell so

448
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:19,296
- Phoebe and Paige know where we are.
- Don't think they've scried?

449
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:23,008
It wouldn't have worked.
Wyatt's shield would have protected us.

450
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:25,844
Must be the reason Zankou
didn't know where we are.

451
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:28,472
- And now that we're out?
- We have to hurry.

452
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:32,017
All right, help me flip these pages.

453
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:33,977
- Wait. I got a better idea.
- What?

454
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,187
Look out.

455
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:51,119
- You think they noticed?
- I don't know.

456
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:53,622
- Hope this works.
- It has to.

457
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:58,210
This whole calling a lost witch stuff
is harder without the Book.

458
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:01,255
Maybe we didn't scry hard enough.
Should we try again?

459
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,048
I told you it didn't work.

460
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:07,177
Okay! Okay, you know what? It says
a pinch of rosemary, Paige. A "pinch".

461
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:09,221
Sorry. I wasn't paying attention.

462
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:12,391
I'm glad to know the
future of magic is in such good hands.

463
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:15,185
People have been
telling me that a lot lately.

464
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:19,481
Oh, my God.
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

465
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:21,733
Yeah, and I don't believe it.

466
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:24,653
What?

467
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,198
That's our house. Piper must be there.

468
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:29,575
Or it's a trap.

469
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:32,953
But scrying is witch-to-witch stuff.
It has to be her.

470
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,874
But the house is crawling with demons.
How are we gonna find her?

471
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,168
- One way to find out.
- Oh, God.

472
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:55,225
We gotta get past the guard.

473
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:58,395
We can't use magic,
otherwise Zankou'll sense us.

474
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:00,731
Can't use magic?
What do you call orbing?

475
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:03,692
Okay, fine.
Then we won't use any more magic.

476
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:05,694
I have an idea.

477
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:08,989
She's here. She's here.

478
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:12,618
I know she's not alone.

479
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,538
Speed the search. We've got company.

480
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:22,002
Yes, sir, but...
We may have already found Piper.

481
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:30,719
Okay, that was a really great plan.

482
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:33,972
Well, I didn't use magic, did I?
Where do we begin?

483
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,641
The Book.

484
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:43,065
Piper? Where are you?

485
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:46,276
Looking for these?

486
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:00,874
The mighty Charmed Ones.

487
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:04,294
The most famous witches of all time.

488
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:06,713
So many demons have tried to kill you.

489
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,757
- What do you see?
- Demons.

490
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:13,554
And now that the moment is here,
it's almost... anticlimactic.

491
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,055
Maybe for you it is.

492
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:17,724
- Perhaps you'd like to go first.
- Hold on.

493
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,644
You need us... to open the Nexus.

494
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:25,148
Nice try.
Shall I start with you instead?

495
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:27,943
No because you need us
to get the Shadow.

496
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:31,321
I'm listening.

497
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:33,740
- What are they doing?
- They're stalling!

498
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:37,077
Kill them and evil
will control the Nexus this time.

499
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:41,915
- This time? Do you mean you've tried?
- I bet they lost some demons too.

500
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:44,960
Yeah, we've had
some experience with the Nexus.

501
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:46,795
They're lying!

502
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:50,299
No... I read Piper's diary.

503
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:54,261
I guess I'll need to make her
big again for you to do this.

504
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:58,265
Zankou. They just want you
to restore the Power of Three.

505
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,685
But what's that compared
to the power of the Shadow?

506
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:06,023
- So, what is in it for you?
- We live to fight another day.

507
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,067
And if we do die,
we go down kicking and screaming.

508
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:11,445
- I'm not leaving you.
- You have to.

509
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:14,490
If Zankou gets the Shadow,
then we'll never stop him.

510
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:17,701
The Shadow won't know where to go.
I might've lost powers,

511
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:20,329
but I didn't lose
what I know about magic.

512
00:35:20,496 --> 00:35:22,706
Trust me. Do what he wants.

513
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:33,592
Hey, put me down!

514
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:36,386
- You try anything...
- Damn it, I said put me down!

515
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:39,223
...and you will lose
the love of your life.

516
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:49,358
Any idea how we're
gonna get out of this one?

517
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:52,194
No, but I'm hoping Leo does.

518
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:55,072
Proceed.

519
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:15,342
What's happening?

520
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:18,762
Leo?

521
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:23,934
What have you done?

522
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,710
So close.

523
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:52,588
I told you we should have killed them.

524
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:58,135
Never tell me, "I told you so".

525
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,061
Leo.

526
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:11,148
Leo, you don't want this.

527
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:12,649
Say the spell.

528
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:16,612
I am light
I am one too strong to fight

529
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:21,825
So go away and leave my sight
and take with you this endless night

530
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:37,841
Honey, are you okay?

531
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:43,096
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- What happened?

532
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:47,100
The Shadow couldn't choose between
Zankou's evil or the Power of Three.

533
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:49,561
So it went
to the only neutral territory...

534
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:51,355
...me.

535
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:54,566
See, I told you it was a good thing
you gave up your powers.

536
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:48,704
So, all that power surging through your
veins didn't make you miss the old days?

537
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:51,039
No, I chose the girl. Remember?

538
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:54,960
It would be a shame not to put all
that magical knowledge to good use.

539
00:38:57,171 --> 00:39:00,924
Oh, my God!
Isn't that your boss, Elise?

540
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:05,012
Oh, my God, it is!

541
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,222
So much for her family emergency.

542
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,725
- She's with Richard Dillard.
- Who's that?

543
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:12,394
The guy that should've been
running the paper.

544
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:15,063
If she's here, maybe she
wants you to know that

545
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,902
- she does have a life outside work.
- I guess. You know what? Good for her.

546
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:22,029
You're not gonna call her on it?

547
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:24,281
I'm not gonna buy her
a new BlackBerry,

548
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:27,075
but all the times I've bailed,
who can blame her?

549
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:29,244
Wow. Enlightened.

550
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:32,247
You learn a lot from
walking in someone else's shoes.

551
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:36,001
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of,
what Zankou has found out about us.

552
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:38,295
I don't think we've
seen the last of him.

553
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:41,590
Well, on that unhappy note,
I gotta get back to the manor

554
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:43,800
and clean up the mess
after the demons.

555
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:46,678
It's probably gonna
take a while to sort it all out.

556
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,473
- Here we go again, huh?
- Yeah.

557
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,897
As for me, as much as I would like
to find a little cutie to dance with,

558
00:39:57,064 --> 00:40:00,984
I should be getting back to Magic School
to finish those schedules.

559
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:04,404
Au revoir, adults.

560
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:36,395
Surprise.

561
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:38,689
What? You want me
to clean Magic School?

562
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:41,567
No, we want you to run it.

563
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:44,695
What's going on here?

564
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:48,073
We were thinking since you're
dying to try something new...

565
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,910
And Leo being perfect for the job.
Considering your magic know-how,

566
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:54,538
you're practically
a walking Book of Shadows.

567
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:58,625
Well, I have wanted
to get out and spread my wings.

568
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:03,172
And with Leo,
the school is still in good hands.

569
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:08,677
Well, I...
I don't know what to say. Paige?

570
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,470
I'm good.

571
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:14,892
Well, that was easy. Leo?

572
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:17,644
I'd be honoured.

573
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:20,063
Good choice.

574
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:26,195
Hi. Guess what?

575
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:28,822
You don't have to worry
about Daddy any more.

576
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:31,783
'Cause I am gonna be okay.

577
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:33,952
Okay?
