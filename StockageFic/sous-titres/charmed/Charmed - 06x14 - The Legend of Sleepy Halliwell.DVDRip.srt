1
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,143
All I'm saying is that you're
way behind with little Wyatt.

2
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,396
- You should have applied before this.
- Yeah, well, you know,

3
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,106
he's not even a year old yet.

4
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,109
So? I had my Jake signed up
for Mommy and Me

5
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,404
- when I was still pregnant with him.
- Really, you can do that?

6
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,158
Oh, absolutely. In fact, I'm surprised
that they let you sign up this late.

7
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,661
Everybody wants to get in here
because it gets you

8
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,830
into Elderberry Preschool, which is
a feeder for Hoskins Elementary

9
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,208
and Bentley Middle School.

10
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,921
Doesn't have any siblings, does he?

11
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
No. How did you know?

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,802
Because he doesn't play well
with others.

13
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,222
Oh, don't worry about it. It's a common
problem among only children.

14
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,433
All the more reason to start developing
their social skills early.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,310
First things preschools look for,
you know.

16
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:04,231
Yeah, well, that's why we're here.

17
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,820
Excuse me.

18
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,156
- Hi, thanks for coming.
- Oh, of course, you know,

19
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:17,578
anything for our little nephew.
What exactly are we doing

20
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,580
- for our nephew?
- Showing family support.

21
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,332
They look for it. Especially
when the father's not around a lot.

22
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,584
What are you talking about?

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,420
- Leo's around all the time.
- Yeah, for Wyatt. But he won't be

24
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,547
for the school. He can't be.

25
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,550
What are you doing?
Put that thing down.

26
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,844
I'm trying to reach Richard.
I can't find him.

27
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,513
You've been trying to call Richard
for the last couple days.

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,434
- Maybe you should give it a rest.
- But I'm just afraid he's off on some

29
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,853
magical freak-out or something,
you know.

30
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,814
And I just want to be able
to help him.

31
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,608
Maybe he just needs
a little time alone.

32
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,444
It makes me question whether or not
I can even save an innocent

33
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,280
if I can't save my boyfriend.

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,701
- No offence.
- No, don't worry about it. I'm over it.

35
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,120
- Jason?
- Yeah, when you get to be my age,

36
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,373
you can't spend the time
crying over spilled milk, you know.

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,168
- Your age?
- Yeah, the whole biological clock thing,

38
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,295
it's very real and it's echoing:

39
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:13,467
Okay, neurotic people, can we get
back to my neurosis right now, please?

40
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,511
Sure, which one
were we talking about?

41
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:20,224
The one where I'm a rotten mother
who's raising an antisocial child.

42
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,060
Oh, that is ridiculous. And not true.

43
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:27,105
Is it? He doesn't have any friends,
Phoebe. You and I had each other

44
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,192
when we were growing up. But he
doesn't have anybody, he's all alone.

45
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,444
Hey, I was all alone.

46
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,490
But you didn't know you had power,
so it was safe for you to have friends.

47
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,368
Your mother didn't have to worry about
if you were gonna orb out

48
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,996
- during a play date or something.
- You think you're overreacting a little?

49
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,126
No.

50
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,598
You cannot keep doing this,
sweetie, really.

51
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,559
Oh, guys...

52
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,229
What the...?

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,235
Oh, this is not good.

54
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,696
Help!

55
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,156
Orb him out of here. Go.

56
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,913
Oh, thank God you're home.

57
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,507
What the hell was that?

58
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,509
That...

59
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,469
...was the Headless Horseman.

60
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,356
- Okay.
- You're very kind.

61
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:19,111
Yeah, can I ask you just one question?
How are you still talking?

62
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,737
Yes, well, fair question.

63
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,825
Fortunately, the rest of me is still
at Magic School, otherwise I'd be...

64
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,452
I'm sorry, Magic School?

65
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,956
Yes, that's right... Anyway,
as I was saying, as long as my body

66
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:35,252
remains on grounds, I can't...
Well, you know, die.

67
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,296
It's all part of the magic, thankfully.

68
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,965
Like the doorway
in the middle of my stairway.

69
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:43,385
Sorry, I didn't know where to put it.
It's the only way in or out of the school.

70
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,345
- I had to reach you.
- Do you have a name?

71
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,182
Sigmund. But I'm afraid we don't have
much time for pleasantries.

72
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
I need to get you back
before he strikes again.

73
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,810
- The Headless Horseman.
- Right.

74
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,604
Fabulous.

75
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,982
- Where's Wyatt?
- He's upstairs in his room.

76
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,235
I thought I should bring Leo...

77
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,488
Oh, my God,
and apparently I was right.

78
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,075
Leo! Oh, it's so good
to see you again!

79
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,368
Sigmund, what happened?

80
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,080
- Wait, you guys know each other?
- Gideon sent me for your help.

81
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,666
- All your help.
- Gideon? Who's Gideon?

82
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,961
- And who are you?
- All right, all you people with legs,

83
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,755
follow me.

84
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,924
You wait here.

85
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,759
Hurry.

86
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:27,471
Leo, just so you know,
this is what's keeping your son

87
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,682
- from developing social skills.
- And me from helping Richard.

88
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,477
And me from helping me.

89
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,312
- What?
- I'm talking about our lives.

90
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,148
We can't just drop what we're doing
every time somebody's head

91
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,691
comes rolling down the stairs.

92
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,277
I don't believe you're saying this.

93
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,781
You don't understand,
this isn't supposed to happen.

94
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,242
Magic School is supposed
to be protected from evil.

95
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,078
It's the only way Gideon can teach
magic to the next generation...

96
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,538
Wyatt's generation.

97
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,332
I think Wyatt is more concerned
with nursery school right now

98
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,376
- than Magic School.
- Are you sure?

99
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,337
Paige said he orbed back
in front of the door.

100
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,297
He was drawn to it.

101
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,843
Okay, you know what, I think we
should help the Magic School.

102
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,221
Because we can't just keep that head
on our foyer table, you know.

103
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,765
What is it, a centrepiece?

104
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,184
Okay, fine,
but we can't take Wyatt, sorry.

105
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,728
All right. I'll get Chris to watch him.

106
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:20,274
What? After everything he's done?
No, I don't think so.

107
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,651
- He was just trying to protect Wyatt.
- Oh, please.

108
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:26,238
I think his intentions are good.
He deserves another chance.

109
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,716
Are you sure
you can breathe in there all right?

110
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,801
Yes, l...

111
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,094
We must move quickly.

112
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,846
- All right.
- Just step around it.

113
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,724
Someone will be along for it shortly.

114
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,936
Wow, impressive.

115
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,563
How long is this hallway?

116
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,107
No one really knows.
It's endless.

117
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,985
- Great.
- So how are we gonna find

118
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,695
this dude Gideon anyway?

119
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:10,115
He's not a dude, he's an Elder...
My old mentor, actually.

120
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,075
Really?
You've never mentioned him before.

121
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,745
We met a long time ago
when I first became a whitelighter.

122
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,789
He helped me out, took me under
his wing. He actually fought for us

123
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,251
- to get married... To break the rules.
- Really?

124
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,634
I don't want to freak you out,
but there's a wolf following us.

125
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,885
What?

126
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,472
There was a wolf following us,
I swear.

127
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,641
Not everyone sees
the same things here, Phoebe.

128
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,142
Only what they're meant to see.

129
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,269
Who you got in there, Confucius?

130
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:47,903
Okay, you all saw that, right?

131
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,864
Eleventh-grade levitation. She's late.

132
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,116
We should keep moving,
the great hall is just ahead.

133
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:25,065
Leo, good. Thanks for coming.

134
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,026
Although I do wish it was under
better circumstances.

135
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,655
- Gideon...
- And the Charmed Ones.

136
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:36,201
Lovely to see you again. Although you
probably don't remember meeting me.

137
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,745
You were just little girls.

138
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,539
Leo.

139
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,709
Gideon, I believe
your invisibility shield is still up.

140
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,462
I'm sorry, I'm just a little distracted
with everything

141
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,465
- that's been going on around here.
- Yes, we heard.

142
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:57,389
- Sigmund, oh, I'm so sorry.
- It's all right, sir.

143
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,766
Didn't stop me from delivering
the message now, did it?

144
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,519
Okay, would somebody
please tell me what's going on here?

145
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:05,314
Always were the restless one.

146
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,191
Just like your Grams.

147
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:13,780
Well, it all started
innocently enough, actually.

148
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:18,660
Pranks, really. Setting the rats
loose from the Pied Piper.

149
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,414
Turning the north dorm
into a gingerbread house.

150
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,333
Kids.

151
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,586
- And then?
- And then someone cast a spell

152
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,755
that brought forth the darkness.

153
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:34,551
And days became nights,
nights became terror,

154
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,679
and the Headless Horseman
has roamed the campus ever since,

155
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,224
targeting teachers.

156
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,978
Forgive me, sir, perhaps you'd like
to orb me over to the other heads?

157
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,522
Right.

158
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,232
- Good thinking.
- Nice to meet you.

159
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,025
You too, dude.

160
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,615
So, what you're saying is somebody's
trying to shut down the school

161
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,576
by cutting off teachers' heads?

162
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:04,039
What else could it be? What better
way for evil to gain an upper hand,

163
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,749
than to thwart the next generation?

164
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,043
Isn't it as simple
as finding who conjured

165
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,837
the Horseman
and reversing the magic?

166
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:14,216
Yes, except no student possesses
that level of magic.

167
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,801
At least they're not supposed to.

168
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:19,012
That's why I believe that a demon from
the outside has somehow corrupted

169
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,848
one of them into doing his bidding.

170
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,351
So you find the student,
you find the evil, right?

171
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,727
True.

172
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,105
Except that you find much more
than that here, Paige.

173
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:34,987
The answers you each seek
can be found within these grounds.

174
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,155
You merely have to be open to them.

175
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:41,743
Teaching will help you find
the student in question.

176
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,789
But it will also remind you
of what you fear you have lost.

177
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:52,754
Investigating our nursery school will
help you with your worries over Wyatt.

178
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,343
And if you follow the wolf,
she will lead you where you want to go.

179
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,803
But be careful.

180
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,806
The deeper you look,
the more you will discover.

181
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:06,435
And the better chance
you will have of saving...

182
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:07,853
...all this.

183
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,159
Who does he think he is?
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

184
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,119
How can I be afraid
of losing something

185
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,163
if I don't know what I've lost?

186
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,749
Maybe that's why he wants you
to take over Sigmund's class.

187
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,083
So you can remember.

188
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,710
Remember what?

189
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,837
Your gift, perhaps.

190
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:37,299
Now, whatever you do, be strong.
Don't let them intimidate you.

191
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,928
This may be advanced magic,
but they're still just kids.

192
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,223
Help! Stop it!

193
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,851
Oh, my God.

194
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,523
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

195
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,817
Telepathy isn't the coolest
power now, is it, Zach?

196
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,861
- No.
- Did you do that?

197
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,990
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
Did you do that?

198
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,743
- Yeah, so what if I did?
- What's your name?

199
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,037
Quinton.

200
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,209
What's so funny?

201
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,966
What?

202
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:23,220
Thanks a lot, Slick.
Get me in trouble, why don't you?

203
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,935
What's the matter, teach?
You seem a little out of sorts.

204
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:33,355
Me? No, I'm perfectly fine.

205
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,153
Thank you. You're a conjurer.

206
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,489
Yeah.

207
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,242
And I'd watch your
pretty little neck if I was you.

208
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:55,252
Here, wolfie, wolfie, wolfie.

209
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,046
Come on.

210
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,632
I know you're here somewhere.

211
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:04,136
Here, wolfie, wolfie, wolfie...

212
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,727
Oh, hi. Hi, sweet wolfie.

213
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:15,439
Okay, you don't have to attack me,
because Gideon sent me...

214
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,402
Where are you going? Come on.

215
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:41,590
Neat trick.

216
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,175
Can you shape-shift

217
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:46,178
- into the Headless Horseman as well?
- I'm a shaman,

218
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,347
not a shape-shifter.

219
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:52,601
The wolf is merely a projection
of your quest. A symbol.

220
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:56,313
Fascinating.
You didn't answer my question.

221
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,650
Do you really think I lured you out here
just to kill you, Phoebe?

222
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,737
You have the power of premonition.

223
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,990
But it's unreliable. Especially lately.

224
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,577
I can help you
see your future more clearly.

225
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,039
If you're willing to take the risk.

226
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,627
I don't know what the hell
Gideon was talking about,

227
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,463
because this is certainly not
what I'm looking for.

228
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,924
Still, Wyatt doesn't have to
hide his powers. Plus he's

229
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,426
- not gonna be all alone.
- No, he'll be surrounded

230
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,971
- by all the other freaks.
- They're not freaks.

231
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,891
You know what I mean. I just want
Wyatt to have a normal upbringing.

232
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,978
At least as normal as possible.
Is that too much to ask for?

233
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,397
I don't know. Maybe.

234
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,275
Well, we're not shopping
for preschools,

235
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,695
we're shopping for headhunters.
So where is...?

236
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,615
Sorry, had a little emergency.
Go ahead.

237
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,618
- Now, where were we?
- You were telling us about

238
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,787
your near miss with the Headless...

239
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:57,207
I don't want to scare the little ones.
They may have powers

240
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,626
- but they're still innocent.
- How did you get away?

241
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,547
I astral projected. Confused him,
I guess, by creating two of me.

242
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,592
- Thank God.
- Are you suggesting that

243
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:11,221
- one of these kids might be in...?
- Involved? Oh, dear, no. No. Never.

244
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,932
- Why would you be a target?
- These children are the cradle

245
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,894
of good magic. Its entire future.

246
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,481
Without proper guidance, nurturing,
they could easily be turned...

247
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,150
Evil?

248
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,819
Yeah.

249
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,489
What's that?

250
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,286
- Anybody hurt?
- Not yet.

251
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,915
- You guys okay?
- You're a teacher now. Be careful.

252
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,834
- Come on, I'll take you back.
- Wait, don't leave...

253
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,336
Piper!

254
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,681
Great.

255
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,767
Just great.

256
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,528
Easy.

257
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,279
Easy.

258
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,407
- Easy, watch the hair.
- Sorry.

259
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,744
- You doing okay up there, honey?
- Actually, I feel a little woozy.

260
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,412
Maybe because
we have you up too high.

261
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,415
- Want me to move you down lower?
- No, I don't want Wyatt to see me

262
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,335
- like this. He will freak out.
- Well, you know, on the plus side,

263
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:26,171
this is a great way
for Wyatt to get out and socialise.

264
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,882
If I had legs, I would kick you.

265
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,970
Could you move this for me, please?

266
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,556
Yeah.

267
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,686
You know, maybe I should just go
upstairs and check the Book

268
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,938
and see of there's a spell
that can fix this.

269
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:47,693
Or we can find the child that conjured
the Horseman and vanquish it.

270
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,611
You think that would
reverse the spell?

271
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,947
- I'm hoping.
- You know, I keep getting this weird

272
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,783
feeling that it's one
of the students in my class.

273
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,327
- Why?
- Because who better to turn

274
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,913
than one of the most
powerful kids there?

275
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,499
- What do you suggest?
- I think we should bring them here.

276
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,501
- What?
- Yeah, if we get them away

277
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,712
from school, they can't conjure
the Horseman.

278
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:09,423
That way we keep them here
long enough to figure out who it is.

279
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,593
Actually, it's not a bad idea,
since you're targets now.

280
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:14,928
Phoebe.

281
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,431
- I'll go get her.
- No. I do not want Wyatt

282
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:20,767
to have two headless parents.
Send Chris.

283
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,822
- What the hell is going on?
- I can explain.

284
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,574
- You okay, buddy?
- What was he doing?

285
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:38,452
Nothing! I mean, nothing bad.

286
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,496
- I swear.
- Nothing bad? He's a demon.

287
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,790
But he wasn't hurting him. I promise.
Wyatt's shield wasn't even up.

288
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,793
I trusted you. I vouched for you.

289
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,421
Look, just let me explain.

290
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,590
Get out of here.

291
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,091
Paige, please?

292
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,637
Now!

293
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:03,143
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

294
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:06,063
Listen, I'm gonna take him up there
where it's safe. Do you mind...?

295
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,817
Getting Phoebe? No, not at all.
I just hope there's all of her to get.

296
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,286
So if you're so innocent,
why are you hiding out?

297
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,914
- I'm protecting myself.
- From what? You're a student.

298
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:26,250
The bad guy's only
after the teachers, right?

299
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,670
I'm not protecting my body.
I'm protecting my powers.

300
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:34,258
I sense someone trying to invade
mine. To use them for themselves.

301
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,385
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

302
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,680
You're an empath. You tell me.

303
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:42,140
I can't tell.

304
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:47,437
It's because you're conflicted.
Questioning your own magic.

305
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,691
Your very future.
It's affecting your powers.

306
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,776
I'm not questioning my future.

307
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,447
Okay, maybe just a little bit.
But how do you know that?

308
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,242
The wolf is a pack animal.

309
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,953
But constantly searching

310
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,706
for something she craves...

311
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:08,250
...but cannot find.

312
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:12,754
Seeing it means
you're searching too.

313
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,675
Drink this.
Take the vision quest.

314
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,178
There you will find
the answers we both seek.

315
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,848
- I'm not drinking that.
- No?

316
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,020
Tick, tick, tick...

317
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:19,530
You didn't tell me
I could get hurt on this vision quest.

318
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:23,033
You didn't ask.
The vision is of your future, Phoebe.

319
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,620
- It's no less real than anything else.
- And no less dangerous.

320
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:30,415
Great. More demons in my future.
It's exactly what I wanted.

321
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,835
But are there any more
beyond the light?

322
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:36,171
That's what you
really want to see, isn't it?

323
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:41,343
There you are, I've been looking
all over for you, Pheebs.

324
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,137
Are you okay?
What happened, the Horseman?

325
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,182
No...

326
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:50,727
My inner demons, apparently.

327
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:54,314
Well, it's good to see at least
you have your head, unlike Piper.

328
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:56,441
- What?
- Yeah, the Horseman got her.

329
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,444
But, you know, she's doing pretty
good, considering the circumstances.

330
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,488
A little grumpier
than normal, but hey...

331
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,074
Anyway, you really should
get out of here before, you know,

332
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,492
you get chopped.

333
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,789
- I think I should stay here.
- Why?

334
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,543
Because Gideon put me
on this path for a reason.

335
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,420
And I believe that
there are answers here.

336
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:22,301
I'll be okay. And you know where
to find me if you need me.

337
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:29,099
Okay, but remember
that she's a suspect too.

338
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,691
Ready to try again?

339
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:44,698
- What's that? Who is that?
- Don't worry, it's just me,

340
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,034
and some of the more
unusual suspects.

341
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:50,329
Wait, you think one of us
is responsible?

342
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:52,206
What, you didn't know
she thought that?

343
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,583
What kind of telepath
are you anyway?

344
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,920
- Stop picking on me!
- Yeah, or what?

345
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,923
All right, guys, knock it off.
You're in my house.

346
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:05,052
The Halliwell manor. I don't believe it.
It's just like in the text.

347
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:06,470
Yeah.

348
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:08,430
It looks like my grandma's house.

349
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,516
All right, all right,
move it along, people.

350
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:12,059
Let's go, other room.

351
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:23,695
- All right, is everybody here?
- Yes, ma'am.

352
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,907
- Kiss-ass!
- Hey, watch your mouth.

353
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:30,869
- Whoa, it's Piper Halliwell.
- Yeah, but only part of her.

354
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,872
- And not the good part either.
- Slick.

355
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:38,335
- Can it!
- Okay, here's the deal, people.

356
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:42,297
We know that one of you
is behind this.

357
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:48,387
So nobody is gonna leave here
until we figure out who it is.

358
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:55,060
- So far, nobody has gotten killed...
- Not yet anyway.

359
00:23:55,227 --> 00:24:00,065
And so far, this has just been
a really stupid prank.

360
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:04,111
So please, let's not let it go
any further than that.

361
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,071
Is Gideon gonna shut down
the school?

362
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,699
Not unless he's forced to.

363
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,784
Why don't you start
with the conjurer?

364
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,911
Me? What about you, Quinton?

365
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:15,956
- You're the Sleepy Hollow buff.
- But Slick's the shape-shifter.

366
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,667
- Hey, screw you, Zachary.
- Wait, just stop it...

367
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,587
- Why not just admit that you did it?
- I would never do anything

368
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:23,005
to harm a Charmed One.

369
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:26,300
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

370
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,719
- I wasn't talking to you!
- Paige!

371
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:36,018
- What are you doing here?
- I need your help.

372
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:37,895
My help?
That's rich, with what you pulled.

373
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:40,856
Listen, I have enough juvenile
delinquents to take care of. Thanks.

374
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:44,193
Please, just hear me out.
I'm running out of time.

375
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,445
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Exactly that.

376
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:49,239
Don't you see? That's the only reason
why I went to the demon.

377
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,243
He can scan for evil. And maybe
figure out who's gonna turn Wyatt,

378
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,580
- since we haven't been able to.
- Okay, you're not making any sense.

379
00:24:56,955 --> 00:25:00,167
Paige, listen to me.
I need you to trust me.

380
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,878
And I need you to get
Piper and Leo to trust me too.

381
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,381
Before it's too late.

382
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:08,884
- The Headless Horseman!
- Paige!

383
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:10,761
What happened?

384
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:17,184
Are you okay?

385
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,111
Everyone all right?

386
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,155
I think so.

387
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,157
Head count.

388
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:35,911
No jokes, just do it.
What are you doing here?

389
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:39,331
- Just trying to help.
- They're all here.

390
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:43,585
I heard the alarm.
What's this doing open?

391
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,921
A student must have
opened it without my seeing it.

392
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:49,049
- And the Horseman?
- Gone, out those doors.

393
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:54,137
- You have to stop him.
- Okay, well, we have to figure out...

394
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,889
No, you don't understand.

395
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:59,852
People on the outside aren't protected
like we are at school.

396
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,186
They'll die.

397
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,690
- Then we need Phoebe.
- I'll get her.

398
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,985
But you can't wait for her.

399
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,820
You have to go after
the Horseman now.

400
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:13,365
By myself?
No, I can't vanquish him.

401
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:15,033
You don't have to.

402
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,327
All you have to do is lead him
back to the school

403
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,538
so that at least nobody
will be killed.

404
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:26,420
Don't let your concerns about Richard
make you question yourself.

405
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:29,214
You can do this. I'll help you.

406
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:39,057
Where are you going?

407
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,143
Don't give me that look.

408
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,813
I still got a mouth,
I could turn you into a toad.

409
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:26,104
- Well, at least we got him back.
- Not soon enough, I'm afraid.

410
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:32,653
The death of an innocent
means the death of Magic School.

411
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:41,620
I just don't understand why
the Horseman targeted him.

412
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:44,790
I mean, and why did he pass up
so many others along the way?

413
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:48,210
Granted, it could have been a lot worse
but it doesn't change my mind.

414
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,712
The police said he was a killer,
Gideon.

415
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,631
- Doesn't make it right.
- No, it doesn't,

416
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:54,967
but you shouldn't close
the school because of it.

417
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,761
We have the Horseman contained.
We just need to find...

418
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:00,556
It's too late. The damage
has already been done.

419
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:04,226
When I started this school, I made
a promise, that the magic within

420
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:06,687
would never harm a soul.

421
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,647
Otherwise...

422
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:17,197
- Piper, you okay?
- Hunky-dory.

423
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:21,451
You, come with me.

424
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:27,291
Anybody else want to try me?

425
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:31,879
- Leo!
- What do you want him for?

426
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:35,549
- Reinforcements.
- What's going on?

427
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,551
Talk him out of closing
down the Magic School.

428
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:40,137
Someone let the Horseman out, Leo.
He killed a man.

429
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:41,430
But why?

430
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:43,932
Why else? To force my hand.

431
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:48,061
If you let whoever is behind this win,
all those kids are gonna lose.

432
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,772
- Is that what you want?
- Of course not.

433
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,191
- But...
- But what?

434
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:54,610
Big deal, you have one bad apple.

435
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:58,280
Just give us the time to flush him out,
to save the next generations of magic.

436
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:01,909
- I know, but the rules...
- Screw the rules! Listen,

437
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,412
you are the one who talked me into
doing this, you are the one who said

438
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:07,998
I could do it.
So don't give up on me now, please.

439
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:13,253
Just let us finish the job
that we started.

440
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:16,924
Tell him, Leo.

441
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:20,010
I think you just did.

442
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:30,687
Next time, I give you warts.

443
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:36,109
Hey, who did that?

444
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,988
Where did you come from?

445
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:43,075
Hey. Hey, wait... Hey!

446
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,416
Piper? Oh, my God, Piper!

447
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:54,586
- The door is still closed.
- The kids are frozen.

448
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:57,297
- Piper must have done that.
- Without hands? I don't think so.

449
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:00,759
- Someone from the outside?
- Impossible, we got here too fast.

450
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:03,512
- It has to be one of them.
- The students? No,

451
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,890
they don't possess that kind
of power. Besides, they're frozen.

452
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:08,767
Then one of them is faking it.

453
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:18,527
Okay, you know what?
Enough already.

454
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:20,362
Every journey requires a sacrifice.

455
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:23,574
My whole life is about sacrifice.
If that's all that my future holds,

456
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,285
- then I don't want to see it.
- You're fighting it.

457
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,162
Don't.

458
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:32,166
Don't use your powers
to get through.

459
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:35,002
They're not working
very well anyway.

460
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:39,339
Just let it come to you.
Want it more than anything.

461
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:45,113
Wyatt, let your little brother play
with the game too, please.

462
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,365
Little brother?

463
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:49,827
Hey, Piper, can you take Phoebe
to the doctor instead?

464
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:52,871
I have so many papers to grade.
Thank you.

465
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,290
- The doctor?
- Yeah, we need to make sure

466
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,626
our little niece is doing okay.

467
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:04,716
Aunt Phoebe, we need your help.

468
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,265
Phoebe, can you hear me?

469
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,518
We need your help.

470
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:20,107
You okay?

471
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:24,653
I don't know.

472
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,656
- Am I?
- You tell me.

473
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:29,533
What did you see?

474
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:35,664
I saw children and my child.

475
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:40,335
And a life without demons...
Is that even possible?

476
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:44,923
With your powers, you know
by now what is truth and what is not.

477
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,301
Embrace those powers again.

478
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:50,262
Embrace your path,
and it will lead you there.

479
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:55,517
You don't know how much
you've given me.

480
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:57,853
You should go.

481
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,397
So you can use your powers
to help us save our school.

482
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:09,948
Oh, Phoebe, so glad to see you.
I was worried.

483
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:11,575
What's the matter? Didn't trust me?

484
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:13,452
- Separate subject.
- How's Piper?

485
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:16,121
- You're not gonna like it.
- She's been kidnapped.

486
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,956
- What?
- That's the bad news.

487
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:20,459
The good news is that she's here...

488
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:22,002
Somewhere.

489
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:25,756
Well, if one of the students took her,
I can't sense which one it is.

490
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:28,800
Maybe I can.

491
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:30,844
Thanks to your wolf.

492
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:45,275
I can sense pain and anger...
A lot of anger.

493
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,654
Wants revenge...
Do any of them hate the high school?

494
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:52,157
Honey, they're teenagers,
they all hate the school.

495
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,701
But he's a conjurer.

496
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:04,127
No. It's not him.

497
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:07,130
- But who's this guy?
- A telepath.

498
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:12,010
Yeah, he's telepathing
a whole lot of rage right now.

499
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:14,555
Well, look who just solved the case.

500
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,473
- Zachary?
- Surprise.

501
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,894
- What happened? Where did he go?
- That wasn't Zachary,

502
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:24,231
- that was an astral projection.
- He doesn't have that power.

503
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:26,692
No, but a teacher here does.

504
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:29,111
And Herman's a conjurer,
and Piper can freeze.

505
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:31,947
He's using his telepathy
to tap into other people's powers.

506
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:33,949
Where's the real Zachary?

507
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:35,993
He's at school, with Piper.

508
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,370
But why?
What does he want with her?

509
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,333
You don't think he'll kill her, do you?

510
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,252
You know what, I have no idea.

511
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:50,090
He's a smart kid.
I just hope he's not luring us here.

512
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:09,860
You made me do this, you know.
I didn't have a choice.

513
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,408
So now what are you guys
gonna do?

514
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:25,709
So whose bright idea
was this anyway?

515
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:27,544
We were trying to save you.

516
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:30,047
Yeah. Good job on that one.

517
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:32,424
And who went
and got her head stolen?

518
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:36,386
While you were off contemplating
your navel. While you still had one.

519
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:38,764
Guys, we are not getting
anywhere arguing.

520
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:42,267
Actually, we're not "getting anywhere"
because we don't have any bodies.

521
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:44,102
Okay, look, we said we were sorry.

522
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:46,772
Can we try looking on the bright side?
I mean, you know,

523
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:48,941
- we're still alive.
- Only because Zachary...

524
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,777
...can't kill us in here.
- I don't think he would if he could.

525
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:53,654
I mean, he practically
apologised to us.

526
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:56,490
I think she's right, actually.
I didn't sense any anger from him,

527
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:59,785
- just a lot of sorrow.
- So, what,

528
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:03,080
he did this to us just to get us
out of the way? To do what?

529
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:06,792
- To get revenge on the school.
- And Gideon.

530
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,381
How could I not have seen this?

531
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:14,633
How could I not
have sensed his pain?

532
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,301
After all these years with him.

533
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:19,388
It's not your fault, Gideon.
Even you can't see everything.

534
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:21,515
I should have seen this.

535
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:26,770
I should have focused more
on the boy than on his magic.

536
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,983
- Get the kids out of here now.
- Why, what's the matter?

537
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:33,986
It's Zachary, he's lost it.

538
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:37,447
Orb them out, up there.
I'll try talking to him.

539
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,993
Just go.

540
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:47,916
You should leave too.

541
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:52,045
Why? After all, I came here for you.

542
00:36:57,176 --> 00:36:59,094
Do you think this spell's gonna work?

543
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:02,139
Well, now that we know
who conjured the Horseman, it should.

544
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:06,226
We won't know until we summon him,
so let's just put our heads together...

545
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,146
You know what I mean, right?

546
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:24,703
Okay, now, now, now!

547
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:28,290
Power of three, unite!
End this grizzly fright

548
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:31,001
Reverse the roles
And make us whole

549
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:45,516
Thank God, it worked.

550
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:51,605
You want me to get you a room?

551
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:53,482
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

552
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:02,825
Why take it out on others, Zachary?
Why not just come after me?

553
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,701
Because I want you to suffer,
Gideon.

554
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:06,745
Like you made me suffer
ever since I got here.

555
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:10,874
I want you to see your precious
school destroyed. Bit by bit.

556
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,752
But that doesn't give you the right
to kill an innocent.

557
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:16,338
You scolding me now?
You're gonna give me a demerit?

558
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:22,010
That wasn't supposed to happen.
I just wanted the sisters out of the way.

559
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:23,929
The Horseman's only
supposed to hurt evil.

560
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:25,681
Evil?

561
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:30,310
You think teachers are evil?

562
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,688
They are when they keep me here
against my wishes!

563
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:35,274
And they take me away
from my family, my home!

564
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,484
Without even thinking
about what I want!

565
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:40,571
- Why didn't you come to me?
- I did, damn it!

566
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:41,780
Every time I snuck out.

567
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:44,700
Every time I got in trouble.
But you didn't care.

568
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:46,952
- You wouldn't listen!
- We're listening.

569
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:49,955
It's okay, we're not gonna hurt you.

570
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:52,791
- We're here to help.
- How'd you get out?

571
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,209
Magic.

572
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:57,963
See, sometimes it takes us away
from our lives as well.

573
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,048
A lot more than we like it to.

574
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:02,092
But it's who we are
whether we like it or not.

575
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:05,470
We can't change that
and neither can you.

576
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:07,514
You have to accept it.

577
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:13,353
You have to realise this is not
worth throwing your life away for.

578
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:17,357
Just let it go.

579
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:22,946
That's it. Easy...

580
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:35,083
- You okay?
- Yes.

581
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:40,464
I just guess I've been more invisible
than I realised over the years.

582
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,210
Hey, guys.

583
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:01,461
Wasn't Ziggy Marley

584
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:05,007
- supposed to play here before?
- Yeah, he had to reschedule.

585
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:06,592
So how's Zachary?

586
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:09,303
He's good.
He's at home with his family now.

587
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:13,265
But I wouldn't be surprised to see him
back at Magic School someday.

588
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:17,728
I think he heard us, you know,
about accepting himself.

589
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:21,440
- So you're not gonna bind his powers?
- No, he didn't want me to.

590
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:26,445
But he gave me a good idea about
maybe doing that for somebody else.

591
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:28,739
- Richard?
- Yeah.

592
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:31,575
You know, if he can't handle it,
why should he have to?

593
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:35,537
Maybe I can finally help him
accept that.

594
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:38,916
You're gonna make a really good
teacher one day, Paige.

595
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,752
- Teacher?
- Yes, in Magic School.

596
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:45,464
I saw it with my very own...

597
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:46,715
...vision.

598
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:51,678
Yeah, well, I don't think she's gonna be
teaching Wyatt any time soon.

599
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:55,891
Suddenly I'm more concerned about
separating him from his family

600
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:57,643
than raising him as an only child.

601
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:02,689
Actually, there might be a day that you
don't have to be concerned about that.

602
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:04,399
What do you mean?

603
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:08,987
I'm just saying.

604
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,448
What are you just saying?

605
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:12,866
Excuse me!

606
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:19,081
Hey.

607
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:21,959
Hey.

608
00:42:23,252 --> 00:42:24,670
So did you come here
to kick me out?

609
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:27,631
No, actually, I came here
to ask you a question.

610
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:28,841
What?

611
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,010
I need you to be honest with me.

612
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:35,430
No games, no running away.

613
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:37,808
Just the truth.

614
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:40,644
Okay.

615
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:45,649
Are you Wyatt's little brother?

616
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:56,160
Only if I can get Piper and Leo
back together in time.
