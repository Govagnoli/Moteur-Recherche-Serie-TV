1
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:34,401
- Oh, I am so glad to see you.
- Is that because I can work tonight?

2
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:38,608
Or is it because I am now
Phoebe Halliwell, college student?

3
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:40,879
Okay, neat, thin slices, please.

4
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:43,927
Wait, you enrolled?
Phoebe, this is huge.

5
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:46,446
Hugest thing I've done
since I came back home.

6
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:48,440
I mean, aside
from vanquishing demons

7
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:50,645
and saving the world from evil,
of course.

8
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:55,528
Okay, so I signed up
for two general courses.

9
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:58,443
And seven electives.
Seven, Phoebe?

10
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,447
All right, so I'm a little confused.
I could use some advice.

11
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:03,725
What do you think I should take?

12
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:07,603
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just a little cough.

13
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:10,080
I bet Prue made you have soup
at lunch today

14
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:13,366
- after she heard that little cough.
- I had to cancel, actually.

15
00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:16,362
Last night's paperwork took
a lot longer than I expected.

16
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:18,685
So I guess you missed
your massage today also?

17
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:20,965
A reporter from
the San Francisco Weekly called

18
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,767
and had a ton of questions
about the club.

19
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:25,039
Piper, you have got
to take care of yourself.

20
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:26,841
You've been feeling funky
since yesterday.

21
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,204
- It's probably just a bug.
- Even more reason for you

22
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,202
- not to push it.
- I'm fine. Besides, it's all paying off.

23
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,724
The club is finally doing well,
and we're making money.

24
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:36,442
Now, would you slice?

25
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:38,886
What kind of fruit is this, anyway?

26
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:41,517
Kiwano. It's from South America.
It's great for Mai Tais.

27
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:44,200
Just got them in yesterday, actually.

28
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,883
The bartender has a connection
at the docks.

29
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:50,644
- Wait, you smuggled it in?
- Oh, it's fruit, Phoebe, not drugs.

30
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,960
You know, just because we're witches
does not mean that you're invincible.

31
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:58,129
Okay, you need to start
taking care of yourself.

32
00:01:58,449 --> 00:01:59,643
Thank you, doctor.

33
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:04,362
Hey, Dr. Phoebe Halliwell.
I like it.

34
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:10,486
It's late. Let's just get this done.

35
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:13,442
Well, it certainly appears
to be a Monet.

36
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:15,520
Has the same style
that he enjoyed in Paris

37
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:18,487
after the Exposition Universelle.

38
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:21,802
The same delicate,
powdery interpretations

39
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:24,199
combined with great vigour
and expressiveness.

40
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:26,564
"Great vigour"?

41
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,606
Randy little painter, was he?

42
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:30,407
The brushstrokes
around the smokestack

43
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,480
are somewhat unusual for Monet.

44
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:36,318
They seem almost individual,
although beautifully rendered.

45
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:39,039
Well, no complaints
about my view either.

46
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:42,683
Okay, you know what?
Is everything with you sexual?

47
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:44,842
No.

48
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,845
Okay, you've never
thought about me?

49
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:50,687
Jack, come on.
We don't have very much time

50
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:53,409
- to authenticate this painting.
- Not even just a little?

51
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,280
Okay, fine. Maybe just a little.

52
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:58,928
And I was good, wasn't I?

53
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:03,959
Come on, Prue, I'm not pushing this.
I just... I know where you stand.

54
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:06,848
I just wanna know where I stand.
With you.

55
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:11,078
- How are you two doing?
- Oh, we're fine.

56
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:13,439
Exactly where we should be
at the moment.

57
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:15,565
As long as it's authenticated
by the auction.

58
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,959
I've got eight buyers on the block
interested in that piece.

59
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,161
You don't have to worry
about us, Mr. Caldwell.

60
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:21,802
Good.

61
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:26,086
Do I have to worry about us?

62
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:35,119
Piper, you need to go home.
You're sick.

63
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:36,927
I think we're over
our occupancy limit.

64
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:38,886
I don't want the fire marshal
to shut us down.

65
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:40,482
Piper, you need to go home.

66
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:43,368
Phoebe, I'm fine! I'm just...

67
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:48,320
- Maybe you're right.
- Oh, my God!

68
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,724
Call 911! Piper. Piper!

69
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:27,526
Hey.

70
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:29,408
Prue?

71
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,166
You're awake.

72
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:37,800
- What happened?
- You don't remember?

73
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:42,762
I remember being in the club
and talking to Phoebe.

74
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:46,046
And then, I gotta admit,
it's a little fuzzy.

75
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:48,439
You collapsed,
someone called an ambulance.

76
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,759
Oh, that must have been great
for business.

77
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:54,798
So, what's wrong with me?

78
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:57,927
They don't really know. We're just
sort of waiting for blood-test results.

79
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:01,162
I'm sure it's nothing too exciting.

80
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:05,117
It's probably something trendy like
mono or Epstein-Barr.

81
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:08,722
Yeah, well, whatever it is, you're
gonna take the time to get better.

82
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:11,084
Now you sound like Phoebe.

83
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:12,807
Where is she, anyway?

84
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:15,968
Hi.

85
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:18,088
Nurse person?

86
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:20,638
Hi. Can you tell me
where Dr. Wallace is?

87
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:23,277
He said that my sister's test results
should be in by 8,

88
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,201
and it's 20 past 8 now.

89
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:28,322
- What's your sister's name?
- Piper, Piper Halliwell. Thank you.

90
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:29,644
Piper Halliwell.

91
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:33,123
Piper Halliwell's been transferred
to Dr. Williamson's care.

92
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,887
If you have a seat in the waiting area,

93
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:36,846
- I'll page him.
- What happened to Dr. Wallace?

94
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,601
I'm sure that Dr. Williamson will be
able to answer all of your questions.

95
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:43,279
Please, have a seat
in the waiting room.

96
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:44,848
Okay.

97
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,838
- Are you sick too?
- No, I'm not sick.

98
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:04,001
Then why do you look so sad?

99
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:09,122
My sister's here and they don't know
what's wrong with her.

100
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:13,042
The doctors don't know
what's wrong with me either.

101
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:16,167
Maybe your sister and I
have the same thing.

102
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:20,518
- What is your name?
- Nathan.

103
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:25,720
Well, hello, Nathan. I'm Phoebe.
And who is that?

104
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:29,120
Ninja doll. Found him
in the children's ward.

105
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:31,563
You know,

106
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:33,799
I don't think that's just any ninja doll.

107
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:36,525
If I know my ninja dolls,

108
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:39,084
I think that one's really
a magical wi...

109
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:42,678
- zard. Wizard.

110
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:47,121
- Really? How can you tell?
- Well, let me see him.

111
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,799
I've seen what his type can do.

112
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:55,201
He's got powers. He can move things
and freeze things.

113
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:58,008
And he could kick-box too.

114
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:03,241
And the really cool thing about him
is he could do all this to the demon...

115
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:08,888
To the bad guys inside your body
without anyone even knowing about it.

116
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:12,201
Really? He can freeze the bad guys
and move them?

117
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:16,521
And kick-box them too, don't
forget that. Right out of your body.

118
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:20,999
All you have to do is,
when you feel bad,

119
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:25,879
you close your eyes and just
picture him fighting them for you.

120
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:29,207
- Do you think you can do that?
- Yeah.

121
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,408
- Phoebe Halliwell?
- Yes.

122
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:33,082
- I'm Dr. Williamson.
- Hi.

123
00:08:33,249 --> 00:08:35,524
- Bye, it was nice to meet you, Nathan.
- See you.

124
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:36,883
And who are they?

125
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,438
Medical interns. They'll be
viewing my work with your sister.

126
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:40,724
Because...?

127
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,845
Because they're studying
the same field that I did.

128
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:45,318
I'm an infectious-disease specialist.

129
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:50,119
Specialist? Wait!

130
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:54,202
Miss Halliwell?
I'm Dr. Williamson.

131
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:56,121
He's a specialist.

132
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:58,723
- Where's Dr. Wallace?
- I'll be keeping him posted.

133
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,641
How are you feeling?

134
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:03,607
Okay. A little hot, tired.

135
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:06,919
Have you been out
of the country recently?

136
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,523
Africa, South America, Caribbean?

137
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:12,840
I wish. No, I haven't even been out
of the city. Why?

138
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:15,640
Well, apparently you've contracted
a blood disease

139
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:18,403
rarely seen in the United States.
Oroya fever.

140
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:22,004
- How is that possible?
- Well, Oroya fever is transmitted

141
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:24,729
through the bite of a sand fly
which dies right after the bite.

142
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:27,357
Have you had anything imported,
brought into your home recently?

143
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:30,043
- No.
- But you have in the club.

144
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:32,205
What was the name
of that weird fruit?

145
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:36,847
- Kiwano.
- That's a possible carrier.

146
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,079
Sometimes the fly has been known
to live in the crate

147
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:42,639
long enough to make the trip, but
rarely survives the quarantine period.

148
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,565
I think...

149
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:47,447
...I have a bite on my shoulder.

150
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:52,367
- When did you get this?
- Yesterday.

151
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,838
Just after I opened the fruit.

152
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:56,601
Tell a nurse I need 10 cc's
of Penilovin.

153
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:58,362
- Right away.
- It's an antibiotic

154
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:00,724
most effective when administered
through an IV.

155
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,245
It should bring your fever down.

156
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,924
I gotta run some more tests.
I'll be back shortly.

157
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:10,922
Excuse me.
She's gonna be okay, right?

158
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:14,398
I mean, it's not life-threatening?

159
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:18,440
Well, I'll know better after
I run more tests. Excuse me.

160
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,528
I'll be okay.

161
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:36,206
Yeah, I mean, he didn't seem too
worried. Just prescribed antibiotics.

162
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,961
The tests are just to confirm
his diagnosis, I'm sure.

163
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:41,926
Yeah. Don't you agree, Phoebe?

164
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:43,408
I think we should call Leo.

165
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:46,443
- Why?
- Why not? He can heal you.

166
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:50,046
No. He's out of our lives. He's
not even our whitelighter anymore.

167
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:53,121
Besides, with Dan in my life...

168
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:56,605
- But if Leo knew you were sick?
- No, and that's final.

169
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,800
No demon or warlock
did this to me.

170
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:01,923
Just let the doctors do their magic.

171
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:05,964
All right. Well, I just wanted you
to get well soon.

172
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:09,198
I know. And I will.

173
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,122
Now, you two guys get out of here.
Prue, go to Buckland's.

174
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:15,725
Phoebe, go to wherever it is
you go to.

175
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:18,961
And somebody please call
Dan so he doesn't worry.

176
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:22,441
Okay. Bye. Love you.

177
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:24,406
I'll call you as soon as I can.

178
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:28,403
- Okay, go. Go.
- I love you.

179
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:43,282
Hey, have you had
a chance to look

180
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:45,326
at the thread-density results
on the Monet?

181
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:47,445
Yeah, and you were right.

182
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:49,281
There are some
unexplained thread markings

183
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:52,088
in the area around the station,
as well as the signature area.

184
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:55,002
- Have you told Caldwell?
- Not yet.

185
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:58,206
I was hoping to talk you
into going home first.

186
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:00,803
Prue, you're exhausted.

187
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:03,529
Yeah, I know. But I just prefer
to stay here, you know, keep busy.

188
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,441
I mean, how long
can tests take, anyway?

189
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:08,800
Hey. Piper is going to be fine.

190
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:11,598
I know, it's just that...

191
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:15,522
...after everything
that I've seen in my life,

192
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:18,080
and believe me,
I've seen a lot of weird stuff,

193
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:20,845
it takes a lot to scare me.

194
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:24,368
But this time, I'm really scared.

195
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:27,924
Hey.

196
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:37,561
You know, I'm really not good
at this saying-the-right-thing stuff.

197
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:39,961
You know what?

198
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:42,120
Why don't you go back
to the hospital,

199
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:45,326
and I'll stay here
and handle everything, okay?

200
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:51,003
- Hello?
- This is Nurse Stone

201
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:52,363
calling for Prue Halliwell.

202
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,758
Is she gonna be okay?

203
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:56,521
You know,
that's what's so frustrating.

204
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:59,999
They won't tell us anything.
Damn doctors.

205
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:01,648
Can I see her?
I mean, where is she?

206
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:03,606
San Francisco Memorial.

207
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:06,482
Hey.

208
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:10,198
Nothing's gonna happen to her, okay?
Piper's strong and healthy.

209
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:12,087
And she's a fighter.

210
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,399
You noticed too, have you?

211
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,841
- Hello?
- Yeah, Pheebs,

212
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,567
the hospital just called.

213
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:25,640
They need for us to get
down there right away.

214
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,527
Why, what happened?

215
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:30,642
Seventy-six-year-old man suffering
from blunt-force trauma to the head.

216
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,243
We suspect a subdural haematoma.
Call for an MRI.

217
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:36,527
Prue? What's going on?

218
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:39,078
I don't know. All they said
is that her condition is worse.

219
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:41,285
What is that supposed to mean?

220
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:45,361
It means we're not gonna leave
the door until we find out.

221
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:47,961
Dr. Williamson?

222
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:50,081
Unfortunately, your sister's
immune system

223
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:52,126
isn't as strong
as we thought it would be.

224
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,359
And the antibiotic's having
no effect on the disease.

225
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:57,523
So, what do we...?
What do you do now?

226
00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:00,203
Well, there's nothing more
we can do.

227
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:02,929
Wait, what do you mean by that?
What are you saying?

228
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:06,161
Well, either Piper pulls out of
the coma on her own,

229
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:09,002
or I'm afraid your sister's
not going to survive.

230
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:36,478
- Okay, we can't let Piper die.
- No, we can't.

231
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,209
But, Prue, this isn't a demon
or a warlock that we're up against.

232
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:41,166
If there are spells in here
to vanquish demons,

233
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:43,445
there's gotta be a spell
to vanquish a lousy bug.

234
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:45,008
Okay. But even if there is a spell,

235
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:47,160
how do we get past
the personal-gain issue?

236
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:49,126
- The consequences.
- What consequences?

237
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,883
The power of three remains
unbroken, innocents are saved.

238
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:53,528
I don't really see
a downside to that.

239
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:54,963
- Do you?
- Prue, if good witches

240
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:56,562
could really vanquish diseases,

241
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,799
do you think there'd be
one sick person in the world?

242
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:01,325
- Look, we have to save Piper.
- I agree.

243
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:05,323
All I am saying is, before
we resort to the Book of Shadows...

244
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,879
...maybe we should call Leo.
- No. She told us not to.

245
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:12,405
So? Let her be pissed at us.
At least she'll be alive.

246
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:15,037
We don't even know
how to contact him.

247
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,643
I mean, he's always
just sort of been around.

248
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:20,724
- Leo! Leo!
- Leo! Leo!

249
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:23,648
- Leo! Leo!
- Leo! Leo!

250
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:27,400
- It worked.
- All right, Leo, look, Piper is very...

251
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:28,718
Very sick, I know.

252
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:31,364
That's why I could hear you.
I've been nearby watching.

253
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:33,480
Wait, you've been
watching her this whole time,

254
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,640
- and you haven't healed her?
- I can't.

255
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,084
They know about Piper too,
and they won't let me interfere.

256
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:39,887
I'm not even supposed
to be here right now.

257
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:41,846
Leo, you can't just let Piper die.

258
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:45,365
Don't you think I would do
something about it if I could?

259
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,997
- But you love her.
- I know.

260
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:50,603
But I'm not her whitelighter anymore.

261
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:53,806
Besides, even if I could help her, my
powers probably wouldn't even work,

262
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:56,278
because she wasn't hurt fighting evil.

263
00:15:57,969 --> 00:16:00,437
I have to go. They know I'm here.

264
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:02,886
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:05,368
Tell Piper I love her.

266
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:11,725
Screw the consequences.

267
00:16:17,849 --> 00:16:19,805
You really think the awakening spell
is gonna work?

268
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:21,960
It better. All right, look,
I'll get Piper's blood.

269
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:23,767
Are you sure that you
can get a poppet?

270
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:26,489
- Positive. I'll meet you in her room.
- All right.

271
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:37,800
- How is she?
- No change.

272
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:42,878
She just looks like she's sleeping.
But I can't wake her up.

273
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:48,122
She'll wake up, I promise.

274
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:54,967
Hey, Nathan. Remember me?

275
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:56,848
Phoebe. I was hoping
you'd come back.

276
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:59,807
- Really, why?
- You were right, the wizard did it.

277
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,324
I feel great, just like I used to.

278
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,401
- The power of positive thinking.
- The power of magic.

279
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,764
The doctors are letting me
go home in a couple of days.

280
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,239
Oh, that's great, Nathan,
I'm so happy for you.

281
00:17:12,889 --> 00:17:14,368
You know, I was wondering

282
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:17,487
if you would let me borrow
the wizard for a while.

283
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:21,608
My sister can use
a little magic right about now.

284
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,642
She can keep him.

285
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:32,161
- I don't need him anymore.
- Thank you.

286
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:36,042
Hey.

287
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,527
I was gonna bring us
back some sodas,

288
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:40,202
but the machine down the hall
is busted.

289
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:41,882
I didn't know where to find
another one.

290
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:43,960
- Oh, I'll find it.
- Really? You don't mind?

291
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,687
No, it's not any trouble.

292
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:48,238
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Thanks.

293
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:54,685
- I got him. Let's do this.
- All right.

294
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:14,401
Trouble blood with sleep's unease
Remove the cause of this disease

295
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:16,801
Prue!

296
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:20,805
- Hey!
- Sleep eternal nevermore

297
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:23,767
- And shift the source of illness borne
- Hey! Open the door!

298
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,199
To this poppet
Whom none shall mourn

299
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:28,241
What's going on in there?

300
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,839
- Prue, it's not working.
- Unlock this door!

301
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:35,681
Come on, open the door!

302
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:38,485
- Hi.
- Open the door!

303
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:42,405
Who was blocking the damn door?

304
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:44,287
What's up, doc?

305
00:18:45,969 --> 00:18:49,848
When did this happen?
Miss Halliwell, are you feeling all right?

306
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:55,404
Look at me. Vitals are normal.
Pupils are normal...

307
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:05,326
- Halliwell pulled out of the coma.
- She stabilized.

308
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:10,484
- Piper.
- Are those for me?

309
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:16,204
- You're okay?
- Yes, I am okay.

310
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:19,481
This doesn't make any sense.
Fever's gone, vitals are normal.

311
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:22,038
I've never seen anything like it.

312
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:25,326
- Point of infection's gone too.
- So can I go home now?

313
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:27,926
Draw some blood.
I wanna run comparatives.

314
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:30,967
Then can I go home? Because
no offence, but I hate hospitals.

315
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:37,048
Get off me.

316
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:56,844
Cleanup in room 420, please.
Cleanup in room 420.

317
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:11,000
Turn it up! Up!

318
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,397
All right, Malik, you can go home.
I'll clean up.

319
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,448
Dance with me, Dan.

320
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:24,169
- It's almost 2 in the morning.
- So what? Come on, you're young!

321
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:28,004
No, stop the music.
Stop that music.

322
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,248
- Somebody need a nap?
- You know what, that's not fair.

323
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:34,479
You've been asleep
for almost 24 hours.

324
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:37,368
And I know you've been up
for almost 24 hours by my side.

325
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:39,480
I can't tell you how much
that means to me.

326
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:42,641
Being there for me. Hanging tough.

327
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:43,924
I wasn't that tough.

328
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:50,368
You're welcome.

329
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:53,043
Now, go home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

330
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:01,124
Okay, spill.

331
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:02,768
What are you talking about?

332
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,397
- You guys cast a spell, didn't you?
- Who, us?

333
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:09,278
Yeah, you. Not that I'm not grateful
to be cured, because I am.

334
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:11,565
But what about that
little personal-gain problem?

335
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:14,558
Don't you think we would've seen any
consequences by now?

336
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:16,082
- It's been hours.
- Yeah, maybe

337
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:18,683
saving a protector of the innocent
isn't really personal gain.

338
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:20,886
Maybe. Like I said,
I'm not complaining.

339
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:22,482
I'm just glad you didn't call Leo.

340
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:25,484
Strange though, with all the demons
we've faced,

341
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:27,765
this bug, this thing,
was the scariest one of all.

342
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:30,397
Yeah, you don't have to convince us.

343
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:35,319
- I love you guys.
- We love you too.

344
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:37,878
Hey, just don't ever scare us
like that again.

345
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:39,848
Don't worry.

346
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:41,648
Oh, my God, I almost forgot.

347
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:43,925
I have to get that Monet
authenticated by tomorrow.

348
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:46,808
- At this hour?
- Why not? I'm wide awake.

349
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,486
I guess I should clean up.

350
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:14,958
- Piper. Piper!
- What?

351
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:17,527
I think I found a consequence.

352
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:31,001
Get me Dr. Williamson.

353
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:35,648
Yeah?

354
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:39,403
Okay, put them both on Penilovin.
Though I doubt it'll do any good.

355
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:41,685
Call me if there's any changes. Right.

356
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:44,363
And what can the Centers
for Disease Control do for you

357
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,089
this fine middle of the night,
Dr. Williamson?

358
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:49,319
I've really got something
for you this time, Seigler.

359
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:50,968
I wouldn't have called you
if I didn't.

360
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:53,802
It's not ethical to get the
government to validate your findings

361
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:56,767
- just so you can get published.
- This will get me more than published.

362
00:22:56,929 --> 00:22:59,159
I've got an outbreak
of Oroya fever at this hospital.

363
00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:02,197
That's impossible.
Oroya fever isn't contagious.

364
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:05,167
It is now. I've got three patients
with the disease in isolation.

365
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:07,287
- How'd they get it?
- I don't know.

366
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:09,883
But however they did has something
to do with the first patient

367
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:12,563
that came down with it,
Piper Halliwell.

368
00:23:18,209 --> 00:23:19,688
Morning.

369
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:22,682
Hey.

370
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:27,163
- So how's Piper doing?
- Fully recovered.

371
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:29,285
What? That's great!

372
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,964
Yeah. I just came in early
to confirm a few suspicions.

373
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:36,041
- Wait, back up, Piper's okay?
- Yes.

374
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:39,246
She's home, she's healthy,
everything's back to normal.

375
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:41,286
Jack, we've gotta talk seriously.

376
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:43,687
Okay, shoot.

377
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:48,603
We can't keep on fooling ourselves.
This thing isn't real.

378
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:52,360
I mean, I know that it looks perfect
from the outside,

379
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:54,520
and it makes sense
to just ignore the truth

380
00:23:54,689 --> 00:23:56,998
and pretend that there's
nothing wrong, but I can't do that.

381
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:01,759
Look, Prue, come on,
I know we've had our difficulties.

382
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:04,841
And maybe our relationship isn't
everything you hoped for, but...

383
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:06,124
Jack.

384
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:08,686
I'm talking about the painting.

385
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:10,123
It's not real.

386
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:12,957
I mean, yeah, it's from his school,
but Monet didn't paint it,

387
00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:16,007
- one of his students did.
- Are you sure?

388
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,320
Positive.

389
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:23,240
So what?

390
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:25,208
"So what"?

391
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:27,166
Prue, if someone wants
to believe in something

392
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:29,968
that may not be altogether true,
but it's true enough for them,

393
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:32,324
- then what's the harm in letting it be?
- Jack...

394
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:35,686
Prue, the world is made up
of almost perfect.

395
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,921
It's nothing but near misses
and necessary compromises.

396
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:43,285
Now, in this case,
I think we got a little bit of both.

397
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:47,438
But you know what, that's okay.
I know how you feel.

398
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:50,919
I'm just asking you
to not look so close.

399
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:53,478
Nothing bears up under
that kind of scrutiny.

400
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:57,123
Are you talking about the Monet?

401
00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:00,161
Yeah, that too.

402
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:05,646
Just trust me, all right? Go with it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

403
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,441
- Piper Halliwell?
- What's going on?

404
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:36,327
I'm Dr. Seigler from the CDC.

405
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:39,168
We have a court order to take you
and your sister into custody.

406
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,127
And to quarantine your club
until further notice.

407
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:54,889
How many people have been...?

408
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:59,079
No, I would not classify this
as an epidemic at this stage.

409
00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:02,366
Although that's for Dr. Seigler of
the CDC here to determine, not me.

410
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:05,402
All I can tell you is that an outbreak
has occurred in the hospital

411
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:08,288
and we've taken all the necessary
and responsible steps to contain it.

412
00:26:08,449 --> 00:26:11,998
Dr. Williamson, how do you know
it's contained? How can you be sure?

413
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:14,205
Because we've identified
the initial carrier.

414
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:16,280
Who is it? What's his name?
Is it a patient?

415
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,838
We've identified the initial carrier
and we've brought her

416
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:21,807
and anyone she may have infected
down into the isolation ward.

417
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:24,358
Is it true that they've closed
down a nightclub called P3

418
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:25,598
because of the outbreak?

419
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:27,999
That is a question
best answered by Dr. Seigler.

420
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:30,287
If you'll excuse me.

421
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:32,401
Yes, I can confirm
that an establishment

422
00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:35,037
by the name of P3
has been quarantined.

423
00:26:35,209 --> 00:26:37,882
But only as
a precautionary measure.

424
00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:42,278
Hello? Hello? Remember us?

425
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,680
I'm sorry, we can't hear you.
What is it you want?

426
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:49,084
We wanna get the hell out of here,
that's what we want.

427
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:52,127
Dr. Williamson will be right in
to discuss the situation with you.

428
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:54,564
Discuss what? I feel fine!

429
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:56,321
Dr. Williamson will be right in.

430
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,923
This is ridiculous!
Why won't they tell us anything?

431
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:02,445
They're lucky they're in the other room,
I'd freeze their butts.

432
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,807
Oh, Prue, thank God.

433
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:06,482
You're obviously not here
to get us out.

434
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:09,117
No, when I got home, someone
from CDC was waiting for me.

435
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:11,519
- And they took, like, a quart of blood.
- Ditto.

436
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:13,601
They might as well
have taken all of mine.

437
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:16,203
They shut down the club.
They'll ruin it. I'll lose everything.

438
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,724
No, you won't. Once this whole thing
gets straightened out...

439
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,641
I have a feeling
it's not gonna be that easy.

440
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,128
I overheard some doctors talking.

441
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:24,120
There's others here infected
with the disease.

442
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:27,281
- But I thought it wasn't contagious.
- Yeah, so did I.

443
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:33,085
- So can they hear us?
- No.

444
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:36,402
Did either of you sleep,
by any chance?

445
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:38,958
Sleep? Piper was bouncing off
the walls last night.

446
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:42,201
It's gotta be a consequence
of the awakening spell you guys cast.

447
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,361
I have a bad feeling
that's not the only consequence.

448
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:13,040
Sorry to keep you waiting.

449
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:15,518
- What, no mask?
- No, I don't need it. None of us do.

450
00:28:15,689 --> 00:28:17,964
However the disease
is being spread, it's not airborne.

451
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,484
- I've just ruled that out.
- Great. Then we're free to go.

452
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:22,685
- Afraid not.
- You can't keep us here.

453
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:25,158
Actually, I can, by law.
And not just because your sister

454
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,968
circumvented it by opening
the uninspected fruit,

455
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:29,721
but because she's carrying
a rare disease

456
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:32,244
that has a possibility of spreading
to epidemic proportions.

457
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:34,161
I thought that you said
it wasn't contagious.

458
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:36,240
Oroya fever isn't
supposed to be contagious.

459
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:38,877
- Well, maybe you misdiagnosed it.
- I didn't.

460
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:43,041
Aside from the fact that I have no idea
how this disease is being spread,

461
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:44,767
there's another mystery
concerning me.

462
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:47,568
Your recovery makes no clinical sense.
Your blood has no antibodies,

463
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:49,640
which means the immune system
never fought it off.

464
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:52,277
By all medical standards,
you should be dead right now.

465
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:55,083
What's the matter, doctor,
you don't believe in miracles?

466
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:57,683
Not the kind
that don't leave traces, no.

467
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:01,688
I've got six people infected.
There's nothing I can do to save them

468
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:03,123
unless I figure out
how you survived.

469
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:06,247
I'm gonna run a series of tests on
all three of you. Even DNA sampling.

470
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:08,127
Maybe it's a genetic marker,
I don't know.

471
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:11,486
But I'm gonna find out. And
you're not gonna leave until I do.

472
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:18,637
Wow, his bedside manner
sure could use some work.

473
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:21,369
Six people?
How is that possible?

474
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:22,918
When we did the spell,

475
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:25,967
we must have awakened everything
in the room, including the disease.

476
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:28,848
Is there anything different about
our blood because we're witches?

477
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:32,520
I don't know, but our first priority is to
figure out how to save these people.

478
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,759
Yeah, but even if we can find
a spell to save them,

479
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:36,999
how do we prevent it from spreading
to other people?

480
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,479
You have to reverse the spell.

481
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:42,879
No, Piper, we can't reverse
the spell, because...

482
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:46,121
You would go back into a coma,
you could die.

483
00:29:46,729 --> 00:29:49,084
I'm not gonna die.
Just reverse the spell

484
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:51,160
and call Leo so he can heal me.

485
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:54,682
Leo? I thought you didn't want us
to call Leo.

486
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:58,285
Well, yeah, that's when I thought
I was sick, not dying.

487
00:29:58,449 --> 00:29:59,882
Piper...

488
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:03,761
...we already talked to Leo.
He's not allowed to help.

489
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:09,085
They won't let him.

490
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,123
Great.

491
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:15,043
Well, thanks for doing something
I specifically asked you not to do.

492
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:18,360
- Piper, you just said...
- Phoebe, just give it a rest.

493
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:21,527
Look, Piper, we don't know
the reversal spell anyway.

494
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:24,442
Yeah, and they won't let us out
of here to go get it.

495
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:26,440
Prue can get it.

496
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:28,487
No, I can't.

497
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:31,959
Okay, I cannot just astrally project
on command. I can't control it like that.

498
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:35,565
You can learn to control it just like you
learned to control your other power.

499
00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:38,926
- Just concentrate.
- Piper, I can't and I won't.

500
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:41,638
Prue, you have to try.
We can't let anybody else die.

501
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:03,358
Take her blood pressure,
get her on FIO2. Let's go, let's go.

502
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:10,041
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing, she's fine.

503
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:13,722
Hurry, Prue.

504
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:19,359
What was awakened from its sleep
Must once again slumber deep

505
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:22,487
Return the disease to whence it came
So life can ease back to the same

506
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:42,806
Did you see it?

507
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:46,083
Yeah, Piper, I don't...

508
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:48,406
Prue, we've already discussed this.

509
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:50,844
For some reason,
there's no magical out for me.

510
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,682
But there is for the others. Please.

511
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:59,288
What was awakened from its sleep
Must once again slumber deep

512
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:08,606
What was awakened from its sleep
Must once again slumber deep

513
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:12,887
What was awakened from its sleep
Must once again slumber deep

514
00:32:25,449 --> 00:32:27,599
- Prue! Prue, get help!
- Help!

515
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:29,248
Piper! Piper!

516
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:32,481
- Help me get her on the bed.
- Let's go, pick her up.

517
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:35,288
You girls wanna tell me
what the hell is going on?

518
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:38,442
Get her on the monitor.
Miss Halliwell.

519
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:41,646
Miss Halliwell.
Miss Halliwell, can you hear me?

520
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:44,926
Assist in respiration.
Get me a crash cart.

521
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,444
- Starting CPR.
- Her heart rate's erratic.

522
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:50,639
Get a code team in here stat,
I'm losing her!

523
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:54,646
Where's the crash cart?

524
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:16,121
Piper Halliwell, what room is she in?

525
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:19,087
No, what room is she in, damn it!
I'm family!

526
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:22,241
Nothing. Draw blood gases,
I need an amp of epinephrine.

527
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:24,161
- Where's that crash cart?
- It's on its way.

528
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:26,638
She's not responding to the CPR.

529
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:31,362
Come on, Miss Halliwell.
Stay with us.

530
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:34,562
Fourteen gauge.

531
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,402
Leo?

532
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:25,561
Hurry, take my hands,
we don't have much time.

533
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:29,126
- Am I dead?
- No, not yet.

534
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:32,004
Not if you take my hand.

535
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:36,285
- I don't understand.
- It's the only way I can heal you.

536
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:40,528
The only chance I have
of them not finding out. Hurry.

537
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:44,282
- She's in V-fib. Give me the paddles.
- Charging.

538
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,007
- Two hundred joules.
- Two hundred.

539
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:49,844
On one. Clear. One.

540
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,806
No response.
I'm not getting anything.

541
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:55,037
- Again.
- Charging!

542
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:56,642
Clear!

543
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:01,359
I don't wanna lose you.

544
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:18,283
Call it.

545
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:23,358
Time of death, 9:40 a.m.

546
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:40,199
- Wait.
- EKG's responding.

547
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:42,400
There's a heartbeat.

548
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,767
Piper?

549
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:50,523
What the hell? This is incredible.

550
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:52,561
Leo.

551
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:57,600
You're all right.

552
00:35:57,769 --> 00:35:59,202
Are you okay?

553
00:36:01,089 --> 00:36:03,398
BP, 105/60, pulse is strong.

554
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:07,646
- I don't understand. What happened?
- I don't know.

555
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,246
But I'm gonna find out.

556
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:23,759
Hey, I just heard.
Are you out of your mind?

557
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:25,123
I don't know, maybe.

558
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:28,520
Come on, Prue, you can't be serious.
You can't just quit.

559
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:32,807
I already did. I turned in my
resignation and Caldwell accepted it.

560
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:36,245
Why? Just because he doesn't agree
with you about selling the Monet?

561
00:36:36,409 --> 00:36:38,718
It's not authentic, Jack.

562
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:41,483
You know what?
Buyers think it is.

563
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:44,083
And they've been thinking that way
for over a hundred years.

564
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:46,717
So it's worth whatever someone's
willing to pay for it, right?

565
00:36:47,529 --> 00:36:49,804
- Yeah, right.
- No, it's wrong.

566
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:53,200
At least, in my book it is. That's the way
it used to be here before the takeover.

567
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:57,078
Before everyone cared more about
the sell than what they're selling.

568
00:36:57,249 --> 00:37:00,241
- Including me, right?
- Jack.

569
00:37:01,129 --> 00:37:05,281
It's not just about the painting
or Buckland's new philosophy.

570
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:08,601
I've been thinking about this
for a while.

571
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:13,399
A lot has happened to me in the
past year and a half. I've seen...

572
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:17,845
I've seen things that
I never imagined existed.

573
00:37:18,129 --> 00:37:19,960
And it's changed me.

574
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:23,119
It's made me wanna make changes.

575
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:27,886
So, what are you going to do?

576
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:33,602
I don't know.
Just take some time, figure it out.

577
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,319
Look, I had a little wake-up call,

578
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:39,049
and I realized that life
is way too short

579
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:43,441
to be wasting my time doing something
I really don't wanna be doing.

580
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:46,487
Or being with someone
you really don't wanna be with.

581
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:50,921
Jack, you have been great.

582
00:37:51,529 --> 00:37:54,248
You've opened me up
to so many new things.

583
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:57,398
Made me feel wanted again.

584
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,203
But...

585
00:38:00,209 --> 00:38:03,758
But I need to be alone for a while.
No strings.

586
00:38:20,169 --> 00:38:21,682
These haven't been inspected yet.

587
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:24,522
Put them in the back,
we're returning them to the supplier.

588
00:38:24,689 --> 00:38:26,247
Looks like someone
learned their lesson.

589
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:28,240
Yeah, the hard way, unfortunately.

590
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:29,967
Well, still, the club's doing okay.

591
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:31,960
Doesn't look like quarantine
hurt business much.

592
00:38:32,129 --> 00:38:35,166
Yeah, thanks to no cover charge
and free drinks.

593
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:39,520
- Have you guys seen Dan around?
- No, why?

594
00:38:39,689 --> 00:38:42,681
No reason, I guess.
I thought he might stop by.

595
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:46,206
You know, Piper, Dan heard
you call Leo's name

596
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:48,485
when you were coming around
in the hospital.

597
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:50,207
He did?

598
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,599
That wasn't me thinking about Leo,
that was just...

599
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:53,997
Him saving you, I know.

600
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:56,485
Still, how are you gonna
explain that to Dan?

601
00:38:56,849 --> 00:38:59,727
Well, at least you're alive to try,
that's what's important.

602
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:03,040
Just because we're witches doesn't
mean we're above the laws of nature.

603
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:04,403
Or the Wiccan ones.

604
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:06,480
I know, you don't have
to tell me twice.

605
00:39:06,649 --> 00:39:08,879
I'm not taking anything
for granted anymore.

606
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:10,842
- Ditto.
- Yeah, Prue,

607
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:13,239
welcome to the ranks
of the unemployed.

608
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:16,646
I'm proud of you.
I think what you did was very brave.

609
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:18,447
Thank you.

610
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:27,408
Piper.

611
00:39:28,129 --> 00:39:29,323
Leo.

612
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:32,045
Tell him thanks for us too.

613
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:39,080
- Hey.
- Hey.

614
00:39:39,729 --> 00:39:42,004
- How you feeling?
- Okay.

615
00:39:42,169 --> 00:39:44,922
A little tired,
which is actually a good thing.

616
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:48,518
Leo, thank you for everything you...

617
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:52,566
- I couldn't let you die, Piper.
- I'm very glad you couldn't.

618
00:39:52,729 --> 00:39:56,961
- Did you get in trouble?
- Yeah, actually, a lot.

619
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:59,963
They found out what I did.

620
00:40:00,129 --> 00:40:02,484
- They clipped my wings.
- What?

621
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:06,927
It's not permanent,
it's more like a suspension. I hope.

622
00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:09,967
Leo, I don't know what to say.

623
00:40:10,129 --> 00:40:13,838
You don't have to say anything.
You didn't do anything, I did.

624
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:18,965
I guess in the back of my head I always
hoped, thought, that someday...

625
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:22,318
...somehow, you and I would get
a second chance.

626
00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:26,318
- I'm with Dan now, and...
- I know.

627
00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:29,487
And I also know
that now that I'm a mortal...

628
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:31,528
...l'm gonna fight for you.

629
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:36,003
May the best man win.
