1
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,117
It's Nina, right?

2
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,036
You'll never get it.

3
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:40,249
- I won't let you.
- I didn't ask for your permission.

4
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,711
It's only a matter of time,

5
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,881
you know, before I get the box.

6
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,424
Over my dead body.

7
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:55,389
That's the thing with you Guardians,
you're always dying for that damn box.

8
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,307
Not always.

9
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,403
Oh, come on!
You can do better than that!

10
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,684
- Phoebe?
- Coming!

11
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:44,563
Coming. I used castor root this time.
It should dull all the senses.

12
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,316
I don't care. Just give it to me.

13
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,489
Thank you. Do you mind?

14
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,116
Do I mind what?

15
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,244
Being so psychotically perky,

16
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,330
while I'm so miserable.

17
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,081
Maybe it's psychosomatic.

18
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,543
The inner ear has to do with balance.
Maybe you're imbalanced

19
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,296
because of the whole Magic School thing.

20
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,131
Phoebe, come here.

21
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,176
What was that for?

22
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,595
Does that seem psychosomatic to you?

23
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:24,061
Hey, big boy!
I thought it was bath time.

24
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,729
It is.

25
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,816
Hey, buddy, that was... pretty funny,

26
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,194
but I don't think
Mommy's gonna think so.

27
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,822
- What's going on?
- I think the terrible twos have begun.

28
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,116
Magical boys will be magical boys.

29
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,495
Yeah. Well, try explaining that
to his magical mom.

30
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,749
You better orb back upstairs
before Mommy turns you into a toad.

31
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:51,880
What's the matter?

32
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,715
She has a ringing in her ears.

33
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,176
No, it's more like a jackhammer.

34
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,096
Is it like a dentist's drill
that goes in and out?

35
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,181
- Yeah.
- Why? You know what it is?

36
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,768
Well, It could be your
Whitelighter powers coming on.

37
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:09,606
You could be hearing the call from
the Elders. It used to drive me nuts.

38
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,775
No, that's unacceptable.

39
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,820
Well, you're half Whitelighter.
You can't deny that.

40
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:18,657
Yes, I can. I want nothing
to do with the Elders, okay?

41
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,869
If it is what I think it is,
you're not gonna have a choice.

42
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,413
The only way to find out
is to talk to an Elder.

43
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,124
You can't bring one here.
Piper will freak out.

44
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,626
Maybe you should meet at Magic School.

45
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,505
Look, do you want it
to stop or don't you?

46
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:34,756
I'll go with you.

47
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,599
Who are you?

48
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,936
Please, you have to help me
find it, before it's too late!

49
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,315
- Find what?
- Pandora's box.

50
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,252
Well, I guess since Excalibur is real,

51
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,965
I don't know why I'd be surprised
that Pandora's box is as well.

52
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,468
- Thank you.
- How did you know to come to us?

53
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:48,307
You're the Charmed Ones. Everyone in
the magical community knows about you.

54
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,685
Yeah, that's becoming a problem.

55
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,688
Hey!

56
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,358
Mister? Excuse me!

57
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,153
Listen, what did I
tell you about the orbing?

58
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,988
Okay? Only when I say so!

59
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,573
Thank you very much.

60
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,450
Piper, you can't deny who he is,

61
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,952
through the good,
the bad and the annoying.

62
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,747
Oh, I see you've been talking
to Leo, haven't you?

63
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,626
Just because you guys
have different parenting styles

64
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,045
doesn't mean you can take it out on me.

65
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,838
Whose side are you on exactly?

66
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,966
- Back to the box?
- Right.

67
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,302
Okay, let me guess, a demon took it.

68
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:29,681
No, but we better find
the next Guardian before one does.

69
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,266
Guardian?

70
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,560
Like you, we're chosen beings.

71
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,771
Part of a magical lineage.

72
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:40,609
One in which every generation a girl
is born, meant to guard Pandora's box.

73
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,237
Right, hence the name, Guardian. Got it.

74
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,532
Only, each girl is trained
by the previous Guardian,

75
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:51,411
instructed carefully about
the dangers and powers of the box.

76
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,413
Except the next one hasn't been.

77
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,790
I'm not following.

78
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:57,000
When Katya the demon attacked me,

79
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,296
the box, perhaps sensing
the danger, disappeared on its own,

80
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,257
moving on to its next Guardian.

81
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,133
And you don't know who that is.

82
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,718
No.

83
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,763
I guess I wasn't expecting to survive.

84
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,307
So, what does Katya want with the box?

85
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:16,186
She wants to open it
and release the world's ills,

86
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:20,190
sorrow, famine, plagues.

87
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,942
All the evil inside.

88
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,696
What's to keep the new Guardian
from accidentally doing the same,

89
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,906
if she doesn't know what's in the box?

90
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,575
Nothing.

91
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,209
Darcy, it's all good.
Stop stressing about him.

92
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:43,130
I know, but how can I not?
We're supposed to have this... big talk.

93
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,383
What does that mean anyway?
I was stupid to fall for him.

94
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,427
Oh, come on, don't say that!

95
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,637
I mean it, he's so not worth it.

96
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,474
We got too much in life to be happy
about to let Adam Bice get you down.

97
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,061
You're right, as always.

98
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,190
Oh, not always. You should
check my French lit grades.

99
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:05,819
Oh, that reminds me.
I'm totally missing my chem lecture.

100
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,529
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

101
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,452
This is him. What do I do?

102
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,831
Just be strong. Don't let him
get to you, no matter what he says!

103
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,168
Call me later.

104
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,547
Hello?

105
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,175
What the heck?

106
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:27,734
This is the global alert, Paige,
one that only a Whitelighter can hear.

107
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,530
You should be looking at this as if
it was a gift, rather than a problem.

108
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,701
A problem for me
is when Leo rearranges my books.

109
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,745
I would classify this as a root canal.

110
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,457
Nevertheless, this is who
you are, who you have become.

111
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,543
I don't want to become it. Fix it!

112
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,336
Fix it?

113
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,089
I don't think she wants
to hear the call, ever.

114
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,800
That's impossible.
She doesn't have a choice.

115
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,636
It would be as if you wished
to no longer breathe.

116
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,931
If this ringing doesn't stop,
maybe I don't want to.

117
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:02,477
I just left Magic School. The last thing
I want to deal with is you Elders.

118
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,647
I know that in the past
we have had our differences.

119
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:10,277
But becoming a Whitelighter is as
natural a part of your unfolding destiny

120
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,321
as becoming a Charmed One.

121
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,490
Perhaps if you explained to her
why you called the alert.

122
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:19,286
We sensed a great threat, one which
we have not been able to isolate.

123
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,331
That is why we need
every Whitelighter to be vigilant.

124
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,166
Well, not this Whitelighter.

125
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,877
Okay, just make it stop already!

126
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:31,465
You know, maybe if Paige
helped a Whitelighter-to-be instead?

127
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,009
That's a possibility.

128
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,594
Why, what would that do?

129
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,972
Helping others helps yourself...

130
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,974
...to find some clarity.

131
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:47,272
Well, if clarity
makes this noise stop...

132
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,483
...whatever, I'll try it.

133
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:58,242
Come on, come on, what's taking so long?

134
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,285
Relax, or I'll give you a timeout.

135
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,996
Here, maybe this will help.

136
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,880
Wyatt, timeout means no magic!

137
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,674
Scry now, parent later.

138
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:17,177
It would help if I wasn't the only one
who had to discipline him.

139
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,805
- Let me do this.
- Please! We have to hurry.

140
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,808
If the box has been opened
or if a demon's found it...

141
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,810
We won't let that happen. I promise.

142
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:27,187
Look, we do this all the time.

143
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,190
Maybe we need a stronger connection.

144
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,526
I don't know what else to try.

145
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,322
UC Berkeley, it's on the campus.

146
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,034
Whoa! Where are you going?

147
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,955
You've done your jobs.
I have to go do mine.

148
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,083
You saw where that got you last time.
Let us go with you.

149
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,501
I can't let you risk it.

150
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:53,714
We can't let you risk it either, not as
long as there's a demon after that box.

151
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,594
All right. But I'll transport
us there. It'll be faster.

152
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,762
What about the Elders?

153
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,348
- What about them?
- It's Pandora's box.

154
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,225
We should tell them something.

155
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:09,188
All right, you tell 'em.
Mommy needs a timeout.

156
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,614
What's going on around here?
Something's not right.

157
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,699
She must have opened the box.

158
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,743
It's the first wave of sorrow.

159
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,621
...not gonna pass my test!

160
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,790
We have to hurry,
before you become affected too.

161
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,211
Please. Don't know what I'm gonna do...

162
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,883
No, Darcy, we talked about this!

163
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,093
In there.

164
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,096
He's not worth it! Just a minute!

165
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,850
Don't do anything stupid, okay?
Promise?

166
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,977
I'll be right there.

167
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,525
Can I help you?

168
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,445
Hi, my name is Piper,
and this is... This is Nina.

169
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,740
And we wanted to talk to you
about something you...

170
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:04,576
...received, I guess
would be a good word for it.

171
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,788
Whatever you're selling,
I'm not interested.

172
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,873
My friend's in trouble. If I don't...

173
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,586
You have something more powerful
than anything you have ever known.

174
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,924
Okay, see, I was gonna go with
the less intimidating tactic, but...

175
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:21,260
- What are you talking about?
- A box.

176
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,346
Where is it?

177
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:38,652
How did it come to you?

178
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,113
I don't know, it was just there.

179
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,407
What is going on? What is the?

180
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:47,369
You haven't by any chance been taking
some Greek mythology classes?

181
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:48,871
Pandora's box.

182
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,166
A gift the gods gave to Prometheus,

183
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:56,086
one that contained
all of the evils of the world,

184
00:13:56,253 --> 00:14:00,007
until Pandora unleashed it
on an unsuspecting people.

185
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,345
I hope to do the same.

186
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,472
Crap!

187
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:13,145
Oh, yeah, this is not good.
This is not good at all.

188
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,983
- This explains the global alert.
- What are you talking about?

189
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,153
The one that Paige heard
and every other Whitelighter.

190
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,115
Pandora's box exists solely to tempt.
It's part of the Grand Design.

191
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:28,327
If mankind chooses
to open it again, so be it.

192
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:32,289
But Guardians are supposed to
protect it from being opened by demons.

193
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,167
So then we should be fine.
Piper and Nina...

194
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,878
Nina never should
have let it out of her sight.

195
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,464
Well, apparently,
she didn't have a choice.

196
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,342
The box moved on
to its next Guardian by itself.

197
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:47,179
It can't move on unless
the prior Guardian was already dead.

198
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,391
Okay, you need to orb me
to Piper immediately.

199
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,064
Piper? Where are you?

200
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,778
Oh, thank God you're okay.

201
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,405
Who is she?

202
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,283
Meet Hope,
the real Guardian of the box.

203
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:12,204
Too bad she doesn't
have anything left to guard.

204
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,005
Who? Who are you people?

205
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:25,175
Okay, Hope, can you just try
to calm down a little bit?

206
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,219
We're the good guys, I swear.

207
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:30,764
Oh, the good guys.
Oh, then what was she?

208
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,101
- She was a...
- A demon pretending to be...

209
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,811
A Guardian, just like you.

210
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:38,105
Yeah. Nina's dead, by the way.

211
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,940
Yeah, I figured. Not now.

212
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,777
You... you blew up my dorm!
With your hands!

213
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:47,114
Yes, and I am very sorry about that.

214
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:52,077
Now you're both calm, like this
kind of stuff happens every day.

215
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:54,413
- Well, it kinda does.
- You see...

216
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,457
We're witches.

217
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,334
What?

218
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,005
We can explain all of this
in detail much later.

219
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:06,425
- Now we need to get you going.
- Fast, I'm feeling a little...

220
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,010
Bummed? Yeah, I know.

221
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,053
Nina, or Katya, I'm assuming,

222
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,182
said that it was the first wave
of sorrow from the box.

223
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:14,641
A little appetiser?

224
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,603
She's immune. She seems
more freaked than bummed.

225
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,146
Well, can you blame her?

226
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,607
What are you two talking about?

227
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:26,028
We just need to know
one thing that's kind of important.

228
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,446
Did you open the box?

229
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,490
Only for a second.

230
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,035
Some sort of dust came out,
and then I shut it.

231
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:37,748
From the sounds of the dorm out there,
I'd say it was long enough. Shall we go?

232
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,666
I am not going anywhere with you!

233
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,544
You burst in here
talking about Pandora's box

234
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,672
and Guardians and witches
and God knows what else!

235
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,133
Now you expect me to leave with you?

236
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,012
Okay, look,
I know exactly how you feel.

237
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:57,059
When we first found out we were
witches, it was really scary because...

238
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:00,270
Well, we didn't have anyone to guide us.

239
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,231
But we could help you.

240
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,027
You just have to come with us.

241
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,955
Are you sure you don't want me
to go down there with you?

242
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,331
I'm fine, Dad.

243
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:22,209
Go straight to Mommy.
She's waiting in the lobby.

244
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,253
Dad.

245
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,171
Hey, hold the doors!

246
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,968
Thanks a lot.

247
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,934
I saw you on my way up,
like an hour ago.

248
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,437
Yeah, I've been looking for someone.

249
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,572
What's happening?

250
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,160
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

251
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:02,249
What? You're gonna
blame me for this too?

252
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,961
How dare you imply that's part
of my agenda? I'm just standing here!

253
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:09,298
- I'm scared!
- It's okay.

254
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,926
Oh, my God,
the ringing stopped. That means...

255
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,056
...it's one of you.

256
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,394
You... We've stopped.

257
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,943
If my powers couldn't open the box,

258
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,321
what would make you think you could?

259
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,824
Hey, at least
I didn't let the Guardian go.

260
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:38,243
There must be a way.

261
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,788
At least she can't put
the sorrow she let out back in.

262
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,666
Yeah, but she didn't let out enough.

263
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:49,671
Within lies the power to destroy cities,

264
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,299
crumble empires,

265
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,636
devastate all that is good in the world.

266
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,347
All this just to impress Zankou?

267
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,516
Hey, just asking.

268
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:04,811
For too long I've had
to watch lesser demons rewarded,

269
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:08,649
been denied
my proper place in the forefront.

270
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,317
No.

271
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:14,530
Zankou will no longer
be able to deny me after this.

272
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,407
Why don't you just
shapeshift into the Guardian?

273
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,454
Taking the physical form
of a Guardian doesn't make me one.

274
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,957
No, it will know.

275
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,626
Then what are you going to do?

276
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:29,795
I'll make her open it for me.

277
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:37,010
There's nothing in the Book on Katya.
Scrying for the box did not work.

278
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,346
Well, maybe we should try Magic School.

279
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,975
What? Wait.
Magic School? What is that?

280
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,811
A place where you can
learn more about your gifts.

281
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,146
Are you a witch too?

282
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:49,690
No, he's a...

283
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:52,150
He's... he's a long story.

284
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,902
One that worked out well.

285
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,321
This is all so complicated.

286
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,740
I know this is really hard
to understand,

287
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:03,537
- but this is what you're meant to do.
- No, I'm meant to finish school,

288
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,539
party, to have fun.

289
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:09,042
I don't even know if I believe in magic.

290
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,089
Where did he come from?

291
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:17,259
Sorry, he's not supposed
to do that without permission.

292
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,261
Don't scare the pretty girl, okay?

293
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:21,013
Okay, pal, listen,

294
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,349
why don't you take Wuvey
upstairs for a little nap, okay?

295
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:28,270
- I'm getting out of here!
- Hope, wait.

296
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:31,273
Nothing that I can say
is gonna make this any better.

297
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,901
Can't you just make up
a spell or something?

298
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,737
Sometimes I wish I could.

299
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,281
But then I realised all of this,

300
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,783
you know, the good and the bad,

301
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,453
makes me who I am, you know?

302
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:50,751
It's my friend Darcy.
I have to help her.

303
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:54,129
You know, you could help
a lot of people by finding that box.

304
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:57,216
She's like my sister. I have to go.

305
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,550
- Hope, wait!
- No!

306
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:11,188
- Oh, my God!
- Phoebe, are you all right?

307
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,649
Phoebe? You okay?

308
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,901
Aren't you tired of asking me that?

309
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:19,154
It does get a little repetitive.
We gotta go get her.

310
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:23,158
We can't force her to stay. Besides,
she can obviously protect herself.

311
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,827
What are we gonna do now?

312
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,579
You gotta get the box back
before Katya opens it.

313
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,960
How are we supposed to stay calm?
We're stuck.

314
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,880
- Linda, please.
- Ma'am, we're doing everything we can.

315
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,716
- Well, it's not good enough!
- Ma'am...

316
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,343
No, I said I'm trapped.

317
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,470
There's people all around.

318
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,430
What did you say, I can't hear you.

319
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,850
I said I'm trapped in an elevator.

320
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:52,312
I can't just go. Besides, I don't want
this ringing in my ears to come back.

321
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,939
Wait, it stopped? When?

322
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,607
Right when we got stuck.

323
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,442
You need to stay there.

324
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,152
No, wait! What about?

325
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,989
Your sisters can handle it.
You're there to help.

326
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:05,325
Okay. Who am I supposed to help?

327
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,371
Leo! Leo?

328
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,875
- Damn these phones.
- Yeah, mine's dead too.

329
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,879
Looks like we're
gonna be here for a while.

330
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:19,673
Are you still there? Hello?

331
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,008
Answer me!

332
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:22,885
Just let them do their jobs.

333
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,220
If it weren't for you,
we wouldn't be here!

334
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:28,473
This is my fault?
You're the one who wanted counselling.

335
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,517
The natives are getting restless.

336
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,769
Yeah, looks like.

337
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,813
So, what's your name?

338
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:39,276
I'm Paige. Please don't let this
be the person I have to help.

339
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,320
Oh, fine!

340
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:45,657
Kinda nuts from being stuck
here like this, right?

341
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:47,075
I want my mommy.

342
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:49,745
Sweetheart, I know you do,
but you know what?

343
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:52,122
We're gonna be just fine. I promise.

344
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:53,624
How do you know?

345
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,918
Well, because I know things like that.

346
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:03,842
- You okay?
- I have asthma.

347
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,261
Fantastic.

348
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:08,889
I bet you have an inhaler
in that purse, right?

349
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,558
- My mommy has it.
- Of course she does.

350
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:17,105
- What are you doing?
- Trying to get us the hell out of here!

351
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:18,440
Brilliant idea.

352
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:21,401
- At least it's an idea.
- You could get hurt.

353
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,029
- He's doing something.
- What does that mean?

354
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:26,573
- You're acting like a little girl.
- I am not.

355
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,784
What are we supposed to do?

356
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:32,079
- You need your mother.
- You'll have better luck with her.

357
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,415
Okay. Darcy? I'm here.

358
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,421
Wonderful devices, these things.

359
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:44,925
It makes luring someone
into a trap so...

360
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:48,262
...21 st century.
- Where's Darcy?

361
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:52,432
You'll see.

362
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:08,824
You'd think there'd be
something about Pandora's box

363
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:10,951
in a place called Magic School.

364
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:13,078
Leo's been reorganising.

365
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:15,956
- Maybe we should get him to help us.
- No, he's busy.

366
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,584
What could be more important than this?

367
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,629
Globally, nothing. Personally,
I need him to wrangle Wyatt for a day

368
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:24,798
so he can see what I'm talking about.

369
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:28,677
Piper, you know what Wyatt
is going through is completely normal.

370
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:33,348
No, temper tantrums are normal,
uncontrollable crying is normal.

371
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,601
Orbing all over town is not normal.

372
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:38,812
- He's not orbing all over town.
- Not yet.

373
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,691
It's not that I have a problem
with him being magical.

374
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,360
If I did, I would have
bound his powers at birth.

375
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:48,906
He needs to learn that he can't
use his powers whenever he wants.

376
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:51,283
And Leo needs to understand that too.

377
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,286
I think he does.
I think he deals with it differently.

378
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,413
We'll see how Mr Mom deals with it

379
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,000
after he's been chasing around
the kid, now that Leo can't orb.

380
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:01,877
You guys will figure it out.

381
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:05,339
You have been
much more optimistic lately.

382
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,884
Yeah, I guess I have hope.

383
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:13,680
I mean, we lost Hope, the person,
but I have... you know...

384
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:16,141
I got it. I found something.

385
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:18,644
- About the box?
- No, the demon.

386
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,230
Nothing new. She's a shapeshifter.

387
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:24,149
We found out the hard way.
Won't happen again.

388
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:28,153
She used to work
for demonic dark lords,

389
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,405
then she went rogue.

390
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:32,366
How very enterprising of her.

391
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,202
She probably just wants
to make a name for herself.

392
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:38,872
Why is it that every demon who
is trying to make a name for themself

393
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,333
has to go and try to end the world?

394
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:44,795
Why don't we ponder that fact
while we scry for her?

395
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:49,675
Even if we find her, we have no way
of getting there. We're short an orber.

396
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:52,845
Well, we'll have
to come up with something.

397
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:57,182
I mean, this place is called
Magic School for a reason, right?

398
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,897
I won't hurt you, Hope.

399
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,024
I promise.

400
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:09,444
I know you're new to all this.

401
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,948
And I know all this can be very scary.

402
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:16,243
Where's Darcy? She's not a part of this.

403
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,370
Isn't she?

404
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:21,456
I mean, she's merely a pawn in all this.

405
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:24,126
A pawn like you are.

406
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:27,880
Whatever they told you,
I know it was a lot to handle.

407
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:31,717
You know, I've been told
that I'm part of something.

408
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:35,053
"A greater purpose",
I think they called it.

409
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,473
But you know what? It was all a lie.

410
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,978
I mean, who the hell do they think
they are, ruining your life like this,

411
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:46,982
telling you that you're meant
to watch after Pandora's box?

412
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:48,984
I don't even know what it really is.

413
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:52,738
You shouldn't have to know.
You didn't ask for this. It's unfair.

414
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:56,575
- I just want my life back.
- And I can help you get it back.

415
00:26:56,742 --> 00:27:00,621
All you have to do is help me.

416
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:05,083
Open the box,

417
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,004
and you'll be free from it... forever.

418
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:10,214
But won't that?

419
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,510
End all this craziness?
That's what you want, isn't it?

420
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,680
To go home... with your friend.

421
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,142
Go ahead.

422
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:24,895
Open the box.

423
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,948
No. I can't.

424
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,411
- I won't!
- Fine.

425
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:44,331
I tried asking you nicely.

426
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:47,334
Now I'll have
to make you to do it. Lucius!

427
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:50,337
Darcy?

428
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:53,131
I'm scared!

429
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:58,345
- Don't hurt her.
- You know what I want.

430
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:07,604
What are you doing? Are you out of
your mind? What if the elevator starts?

431
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:10,524
Relax, sweetheart.
I know what I'm doing.

432
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:12,901
Hello? Is anybody there?

433
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:16,071
What's going on?
What is taking so long?

434
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:22,536
Okay, honey, I need you to breathe.

435
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:25,164
- Just breathe.
- I'm scared!

436
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,207
Damn it!

437
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,210
- Big man.
- Can you two get along?

438
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:34,548
- It hasn't happened in three years.
- You have to air out all our problems?

439
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:38,093
Airing out our problems
is your biggest concern?

440
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:41,388
Oh, my God!

441
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,060
Okay...

442
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,189
He's not breathing.

443
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,357
Oh, God.

444
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:54,109
There's no pulse.

445
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,237
Oh, my God!

446
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,741
- Come on, sweetie...
- What are we gonna do?

447
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,743
- Do you know CPR?
- No.

448
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,828
Help me. You're gonna learn.

449
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:07,080
- All right.
- I need you to sing to her.

450
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,624
- Sing?
- Just sing.

451
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,627
Get her breathing in order.
Anything, just sing!

452
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,924
Put your hands in the xiphoid process.

453
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,800
- The what?
- Honey.

454
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,719
You can do this, honey.

455
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:22,221
All right.

456
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:23,680
Come on.

457
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,476
Push down, five times for every breath.

458
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:28,810
- All right.
- Go.

459
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,772
One, two, three, four...

460
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:33,690
Come on, sing with me.

461
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,446
Good job.

462
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:57,756
He's awake.

463
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,299
He's alive!

464
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:02,469
Good job.

465
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,146
- Wendy!
- Daddy!

466
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:18,986
You okay?

467
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:21,405
He was electrocuted. We gave him CPR.

468
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:24,366
Everybody looks okay,
except for one person.

469
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:27,494
Possible cardiac arrest.
We're gonna treat it...

470
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:28,871
Thanks.

471
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:42,885
Open it,

472
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,678
or your friend dies.

473
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,042
It's done.

474
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:18,045
- But you said...
- That I wasn't going to hurt you?

475
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,339
Yeah. I lied.

476
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:26,011
Since the next Guardian hasn't
been born yet, and with you dead,

477
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:30,098
there won't be anyone around
to put everything back.

478
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,237
We're too late.

479
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:49,201
Minions.

480
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,916
Hope, what are you doing here?

481
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,586
She forced me to open the box.
She took my friend, Darcy!

482
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,421
Where is she?

483
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,174
That way.

484
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,941
Darcy?

485
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:22,401
Where are you?

486
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,657
Darcy?

487
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:30,784
Darcy!

488
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:35,038
Darcy, where are you?

489
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:44,673
Get me out of here.

490
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,438
Okay, well, I guess
your day trumps my day.

491
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:02,608
Thanks for bringing me home
to clean up the mess though.

492
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:04,443
Is anybody else feeling blue?

493
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,820
It's the effects
of the box being opened.

494
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:08,572
There's a demon on the loose.

495
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:11,783
The longer he is,
the more we're all gonna be affected.

496
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,828
Yeah, exactly.
This is crazy. We need to leave.

497
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:16,163
You're safer here.

498
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,457
No.

499
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:20,959
It's okay, Darcy. They can protect us.

500
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:24,463
Hope, that thing was trying to kill us.

501
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,881
She wants to kill them.

502
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:29,885
- We're sitting ducks here.
- Not as much as out there.

503
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:33,388
As long as Katya knows that Hope
can put the evils back in the box,

504
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:34,848
she is a large target.

505
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:36,517
Which means you are too.

506
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,019
No, not if she doesn't go along with it.

507
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:43,023
No one says that you even have
to care about this stupid box any more.

508
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,360
Actually, she does, you see,
because it's her birthright.

509
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:47,694
Says you.

510
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:53,325
Hope, listen to me, okay?
We don't even know these people.

511
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,245
For all we know,
they could be the demon.

512
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:57,871
That's ridiculous.

513
00:33:58,747 --> 00:34:01,458
Is it? She's done it before.

514
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:05,128
That's what she does, right? Right?

515
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:10,551
Hope, we can only trust each other.

516
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:13,554
- You're right.
- Hope...

517
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,390
- No, actually, I think she is right.
- Phoebe!

518
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,392
We can't make her do something.

519
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,812
This is her path,
to either follow or not.

520
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:25,023
But before you leave,
let Paige show you

521
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,442
how to contact us,
God forbid anything...

522
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,779
See you downstairs.

523
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:41,665
Wyatt?

524
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:46,545
What's going on?

525
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:48,797
I'm not sure. Where's Wyatt?

526
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:52,593
He...

527
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,598
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

528
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:59,725
What's taking them so long up there?

529
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:01,643
I don't know. What's your hurry?

530
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:04,897
I just want to get out of here
as soon as possible.

531
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:12,321
Okay, let's go.

532
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:19,703
- I hope you know what you're doing.
- Trust me.

533
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:29,338
What? What's the matter?

534
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:35,385
This is getting to be way too easy.

535
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:48,273
Hope!

536
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,483
I'm okay.

537
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,735
Actually, not for long.

538
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:54,029
Okay, you heard me say it,
and I meant it.

539
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:57,616
I do not want anything to do
with that box! I swear!

540
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:00,786
Oh, but you will. In time.

541
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:04,581
You'll come to believe in yourself,

542
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:08,418
your powers. Just like Pandora did.

543
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:12,130
And then you'll want
to get the box back,

544
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:14,883
put the sorrows back.

545
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:19,012
But, see, I can't let that happen.

546
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:27,479
You won't have a choice.

547
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:33,068
What? You think you can stop me?

548
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:35,487
Dagger!

549
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,908
But... Guardians can't orb!

550
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:42,619
No, but Whitelighters can,

551
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:44,997
and into anything they want too...

552
00:36:45,164 --> 00:36:47,708
...or anybody.

553
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,922
Sorry we haven't met before.
I've been engaged!

554
00:36:57,843 --> 00:37:00,470
What?! What is going on here?

555
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,055
It's okay. It's okay.

556
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:04,892
I'm here to get you home,
all right? Pandora's box!

557
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:10,772
I need you to give this to Hope for me.

558
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,608
I'd give it to her myself, but...

559
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,902
...there's somebody I have to see.

560
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:18,280
Home!

561
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,872
Darcy?

562
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:29,291
Someone tell me
what the hell is going on.

563
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:32,085
That's her.

564
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,964
Just didn't want to make
the same mistake twice.

565
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:37,508
Okay, Hope,

566
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:41,261
we need your help.
You're the only person that can do this.

567
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:43,597
- I don't...
- Listen to me.

568
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:45,974
This is your destiny.

569
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,560
Just like becoming witches was ours.

570
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,356
I just... don't know if I can do this.

571
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:55,317
You're forgetting something
about Pandora's box.

572
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:59,404
According to myth,
when all the sorrows were released,

573
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:02,032
there was one thing left
at the bottom of the box.

574
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,576
Hope.

575
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:15,128
You can do it.

576
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,207
Told you you could do it.

577
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:53,917
Thank you.

578
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:15,439
How are the ears?

579
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:17,399
Better, thank you.

580
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:20,777
It was risky, sending me off
to help a future Whitelighter.

581
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:22,196
- Was it?
- Yes.

582
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:24,323
We almost didn't get Pandora's box.

583
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,241
- But you did get it back.
- Yes.

584
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:30,329
Which proves you can handle Charmed
and Whitelighter responsibilities.

585
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:34,249
- I don't see...
- Didn't it make you feel proud?

586
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:37,044
- Of course I did.
- And you did it all by yourself,

587
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,630
without your sisters.

588
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:42,424
Maybe this is what you have
been searching for,

589
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:44,384
your separate identity.

590
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:47,095
Being a Whitelighter
can give you that and more.

591
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:50,015
- Like what?
- Fulfilment.

592
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,725
You're a natural, Paige.

593
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:55,979
Everything you've been and done has
been preparing you to be a Whitelighter.

594
00:39:56,146 --> 00:40:00,108
Everything you needed to help those
people has been inside you all along.

595
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:03,570
Well, it did feel good to save them.

596
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:06,698
Then don't fight that. Embrace it.

597
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:10,160
Not for me, not for the Elders,
but for yourself.

598
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:14,039
Think about it?

599
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,544
Wait.

600
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:22,840
Just out of curiosity,

601
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:25,968
who was the future Whitelighter
I was supposed to save?

602
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:29,304
You were.

603
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:49,116
So, how was your day?

604
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:50,993
Very funny.

605
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:54,746
Actually, it was all right,
and it calmed down a bit

606
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:58,625
once Wyatt tried to orb a toy to himself
and hit himself in the head.

607
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:00,335
Oh, no.

608
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:02,504
It was just a little bump, but...

609
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:06,175
...it was enough to teach him
that he shouldn't do it again.

610
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:10,679
Is that your way of telling me that
magical boys will be magical boys again?

611
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:13,807
No.

612
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:18,145
We both need to teach him
when and were to use his powers.

613
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,731
Though it's not gonna be easy.

614
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:22,482
And on the other hand,

615
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:25,277
we do need to realise
that he is who he is,

616
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:27,988
and even though I want a normal family,

617
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:31,909
I don't want it at the expense
of them finding their own identities.

618
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,871
Chris here is gonna
be coming into his powers shortly.

619
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:38,165
Could get a little nuts around here.

620
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:39,791
As opposed to what?

621
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:46,298
We'll deal with it
as it comes, together.

622
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:48,800
And until then...

623
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:52,804
...why don't you show Mommy all those
cool tricks you've been learning?

624
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,641
Go ahead. It's okay.
