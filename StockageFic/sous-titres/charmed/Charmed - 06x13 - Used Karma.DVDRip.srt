1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:06,507
Okay, this has been
really fun, guys, but Phoebe

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,760
actually brought us here tonight
to say something, didn't you, Pheebs?

3
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:14,973
No, no, l... I just think that we don't get
to see enough of each other, that's all.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,310
Might be a little longer, too, seeing
as we're off to Paris in the morning.

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,064
Yeah, about that French merger?

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,484
Hong Kong, Rome, gay Paris.
It's enough to send

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,779
- a girl's head spinning, know?
- But wasn't there something you really

8
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,240
wanted to say about?

9
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,285
You must have
great business karma.

10
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,330
Oh, karma?
I don't believe in that stuff.

11
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,582
- No, not at all?
- Well, I mean, you know,

12
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,918
if somebody cuts me off on the road,

13
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,671
I'd like to think that they're
gonna get what's coming to them.

14
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:49,883
That's karma, the great cosmic justice
system. You reap what you sow.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,177
Great, fabulous. Anyway, Phoebe.

16
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,266
Okay. All right.

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,854
Jason, there is something
that I want to share

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,438
with you right now.

19
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,732
And that...

20
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,776
...would be...

21
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,654
...a toast.

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,699
A toast to your new merger.

23
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,203
Pheebs, could you help me?
With the cobbler?

24
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,294
Am I missing something?

25
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,630
Okay, that was a three-course meal,

26
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,593
not including the fruit and cheese
plate. I gave you a million openings.

27
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,344
What do you want, a drumroll?

28
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,638
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

29
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,974
You are going with him
to France tomorrow.

30
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:42,102
You've put this off for too long.
You have to tell him you're a witch.

31
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,937
I just think maybe
we should wait until

32
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,064
we get there to tell him, you know?

33
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,692
Then if there's an emergency,
you can orb us back, okay?

34
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,820
You've probably been caught
almost like a million times.

35
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,822
You can't keep taking that risk.

36
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,657
I know.

37
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,993
Maybe I should wait till tomorrow,

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,996
until after the big banquet
so I don't upset his big day.

39
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,166
I think that you have a big
problem with avoiding conflict,

40
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,294
and one day, missy, it is gonna
come back and bite you in the ass.

41
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,713
Hey, he's getting
a little antsy in there.

42
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,341
And you, what is it
with this whole karma thing?

43
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,718
You're supposed to be
making it easier for her.

44
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,430
Piper needs your help fast.

45
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,933
Saved by the orb, great.
Keep Jason occupied.

46
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,774
Leo?

47
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,776
What are you doing here?

48
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,153
Just bringing dessert,
you want some?

49
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,364
The girls are just tidying up.

50
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,536
Crap.

51
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,166
- Piper.
- About time.

52
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,963
It wasn't easy to find you
in these catacombs.

53
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,798
You were supposed to wait
so I could help.

54
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,550
Well, I thought I could handle it.

55
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,927
Except I must have
missed something in the Book.

56
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,721
- I guess so.
- Look, every time I hit one,

57
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,682
two more show up.

58
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,233
Okay, back up.

59
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,318
Hey, boys.

60
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,040
Okay, new plan. Blast and then bail.

61
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,834
Okay.

62
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,045
Hey, Phoebe,
what's taking you so long?

63
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,881
Where...? Where did they go?

64
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,508
Must be an emergency
or something.

65
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,678
It's always some emergency
or some phone call

66
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,931
or some marathon pee break.
What's going on?

67
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,507
I think I'd better go check on Wyatt.

68
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,052
I've never seen him like that.
He looked at me

69
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,470
like he had no idea who I was.

70
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,849
He doesn't know you.
Not the witch you anyway.

71
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,768
He's just gonna need some time.

72
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:55,439
Why didn't I just tell him?
And no "I told you so's."

73
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,733
We all make little mistakes, honey.

74
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,443
This was a very big mistake.

75
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,362
I can't imagine how he's feeling
right now, what he's going through.

76
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,115
The good news is,
it's out in the open now

77
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,701
and, you know, you guys
have no more secrets.

78
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,246
Food's away, table's cleared.
There anything else I can do?

79
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,373
No, thank you.

80
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,293
Hey, I feel awful.
Sorry about what happened.

81
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,920
It's not your fault.

82
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,714
Well... Well, actually it is.

83
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,550
Why? Did you shove Jason
into the kitchen?

84
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,761
No, but my karma did.

85
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,849
I'm serious. I'm convinced I'm carrying
the burden of my family's karma.

86
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,685
I mean, we did so much bad
with magic.

87
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,814
Now magic's doing bad to me.
And those I care about.

88
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,859
Now, that is completely ridiculous.

89
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,446
The feud has lasted
for decades in my family

90
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,657
and so many people
were hurt in the crossfire.

91
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,451
I mean, somebody's gotta
inherit that bad karma, right?

92
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,246
That's not really how karma works.

93
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,748
You live a double life
with your boyfriend,

94
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:59,002
and you pay the price. If anyone's
karma made this happen, it's mine.

95
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,548
That's true. You had the chance
to clean this up tonight, and you didn't.

96
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,299
See, there's that
"I told you so," huh?

97
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,468
Only to make a point.

98
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:10,848
No, you're right. I've been
avoiding conflict my whole life.

99
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,559
What, and it just happened
the night I was here? I mean,

100
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,352
- that's all I'm saying.
- You guys,

101
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,523
this mea culpa game is real fun and all,
but we're not gonna solve anything.

102
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,109
Those multiplying swarm demons
on the other hand?

103
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,777
Right, we riled them up, didn't we?

104
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,697
And if they attack right now,
we won't know how to deal with them.

105
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:31,034
So why don't you two hit the Book
and I'll catch up after I check on Wyatt.

106
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,537
Would you guys mind
if I sat this one out?

107
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,747
I kind of feel like
I need to go see Jason.

108
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:40,210
- Well, maybe after we've...
- No, we can handle it.

109
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,506
All right.

110
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,428
Leo. No, no, no.

111
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,180
What? What, what, what is it?

112
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,806
This, this.

113
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,224
What, my grandmother's quilt?

114
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:58,854
Her red quilt, the colour of anger
and violence and all things bad.

115
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,940
- Bad? I used that quilt.
- Well, you can have it back.

116
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:06,445
Wyatt is now using
the powder-blue baby blanket.

117
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:09,031
Did you turn off
the serenity Mozart CD?

118
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,204
Look, we need to bathe Wyatt
in goodness,

119
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,582
and nurture peace
and serenity, happy things.

120
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,169
Piper, don't you think you're
overreacting a little bit?

121
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,796
Leo, there is no such thing
as overreacting

122
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,965
when it comes
to the future of our child.

123
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,093
Okay, but aren't the swarm demons
the last on the list of threats?

124
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,721
- Yes, but...
- Okay, and when they're gone,

125
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,806
are you gonna stop
worrying a little bit?

126
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:39,353
No, because I sent Chris to suss out
if there's any new threats.

127
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,065
Okay, not to press a point,
but didn't you just have an epiphany

128
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,651
about not focusing all
of your energy on Wyatt?

129
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,111
Yes, well, that was before
Chris informed us

130
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,365
that our child was gonna grow up
to be the future of all evil.

131
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:58,747
Besides, it's not all I do.
I have the club, I have friends.

132
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,582
Well...

133
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:05,128
Look, it's just that
Wyatt still comes first.

134
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:09,174
Which is why you are gonna
take him up to the Elders

135
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,928
so he's safe while we figure out
how to deal with the swarm demons.

136
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,180
While you're there,
ask them if there's anything

137
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,391
they can do to ensure
goodness in Wyatt.

138
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,686
- You know, pull a few strings?
- Piper, we don't need strings pulled,

139
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,437
we can protect our son ourselves.

140
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,440
Well, in the future,
apparently, we don't.

141
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,944
Okay, so look, there are blue bootees
in the bag in case he gets cold.

142
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,738
So don't be afraid
to use them, okay?

143
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:39,371
Don't ask me, she's your mother.

144
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:45,878
Look, you and I both know,
in order to make this work,

145
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,339
- you can't repress yourself.
- I'm not. Look, practising magic.

146
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,508
Yeah, but you don't want me to.

147
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,386
Every relationship is gonna
have its challenges, right?

148
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,764
- Look at Phoebe and Jason.
- I'm telling you, that was me.

149
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,976
No, that was them not being
truthful with each other.

150
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,812
And as long as we are,
we're gonna be fine.

151
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,774
"Fine" would be if I could
start over with a clean slate.

152
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,319
You just be the wonderful person
that you are,

153
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,530
and it's gonna make up for all the
bad things that your family ever did.

154
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,283
Not in this lifetime.
I want to start over.

155
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,828
It's not possible.
If it were, everybody would do it.

156
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,247
Okay, everybody's
not a powerful witch.

157
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,542
Look, karma is the DNA
of the universe.

158
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,337
It's what balances everything out.
You start screwing with that,

159
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:31,507
you can mess up
the entire cosmic order of things.

160
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,968
Maybe you can help me cast a spell.

161
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,346
What part of "no shortcuts"
are you not getting?

162
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,600
There's an aura cleanse, a chakra
cleanse, but no karma cleanse.

163
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:45,229
If it were possible to be cleansed,
it'd be in there, but there's no spell.

164
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,272
It can't be done.

165
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,609
- Got anything?
- Yeah, let's see,

166
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:54,071
they are distant relatives
of Quossis and vampires,

167
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,864
which means
they come from a hive.

168
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,242
Did you even read this?

169
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,369
I skimmed it.

170
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,539
So they were drones
that we were killing.

171
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,750
Well, no wonder
they just kept coming back.

172
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,670
It says we have to kill the king
to kill the hive,

173
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,881
which requires the power-of-three
spell. I'll call Phoebe.

174
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,926
Hey, just slow down
there, okay? Take it easy.

175
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:21,682
Okay, you orb out and get Phoebe,
and I'll start on the potion.

176
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,935
Why don't we just track
the leader down? You and I.

177
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,938
That way, Phoebe and Jason can
have a little bit of time alone, yeah?

178
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,734
Well, what if the swarm
attacks before...? Okay, fine.

179
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,778
We'll locate the ruler first.

180
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:36,780
Brilliant idea.

181
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,284
Hey, can I orb you anywhere?

182
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,328
No, it's okay. I drove my car here.

183
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,289
Okay. I'll see you soon.

184
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,825
- You stay away.
- We need to talk.

185
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:24,161
No. No. I don't want to talk.

186
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,913
You're... This is your...

187
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,791
This... This is so beyond...

188
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,045
This is so far beyond my reality.

189
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:37,382
You know, l... I'm just still trying
to figure out how

190
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,761
you could...
Fifteen months, I didn't know!

191
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,971
I wanted to tell you.

192
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,307
I really did, but I couldn't.

193
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,851
And you know now,
so can we talk about this, please?

194
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,811
Okay, fine, let's talk.

195
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:54,525
All right, what...? What was this, huh?
The Godiva girls, was that magic?

196
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,527
- Yeah.
- Man, still...

197
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:00,572
Okay, what about that funny-looking
little cousin of yours, cousin Shamus,

198
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,116
what the hell was he?
One of the seven dwarves?

199
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,370
No, actually, he was a leprechaun.

200
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:07,996
Not really my cousin.

201
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,626
Look, Jason, I know how you feel.

202
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,920
How do I feel, Phoebe?

203
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,632
Tell me because...
Because I don't know.

204
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,843
But you, you always seem to know.

205
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,387
So tell me, how's it
gonna feel when I crash,

206
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,597
because I see one coming.

207
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,433
Is it gonna feel like
when you said, "I love you too"?

208
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:31,520
Because that,
that was magic, wasn't it?

209
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,982
But I do love you.

210
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:40,529
I don't...
I don't have time for this.

211
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,449
I didn't want you
to find out like this, believe me.

212
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,743
I...

213
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,706
I have to concentrate. I'm speaking
in front of 100 shareholders

214
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:55,836
celebrating the second-biggest
French media merger of the decade.

215
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,629
Okay?

216
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,090
So...

217
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,676
...I need to be in focus.

218
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,472
You're the one that wanted to look

219
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,100
for the swarm king
in the first place, remember?

220
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:14,688
Yeah, that's when we thought
it was a hive, not so much of a maze.

221
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:18,275
Oh, no. Is this starting to look familiar?

222
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,069
- Are we?
- Going around in circles?

223
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,906
- Great.
- Let's just orb home.

224
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,576
Why are you in such a rush
to go home all of a sudden?

225
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:32,706
It's Richard. Any time he's alone for
too long, bad things start to happen.

226
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,542
No!

227
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,630
That only attracts them more,
remember?

228
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,349
Should we follow them?

229
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,059
Good idea.

230
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,565
- Now?
- Yeah.

231
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:32,391
"I call to thee, pure witch's fire

232
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,435
Through vortex flow
The heavenly mire

233
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,063
Cleanse brackish karma of debris

234
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,275
From dark to light, sweep history"

235
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,336
Hello, anybody home?

236
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,165
How many did we get, 15 or 16?

237
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,959
I don't know,
I stopped counting at dawn.

238
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,377
I'm gonna go crash.

239
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,547
Actually, I'm gonna go check
on Richard, and then I'll go crash.

240
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,717
But wait, we know where the king
is now, so we're gonna get Phoebe

241
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,219
so we can go back and get him.

242
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:55,349
No. I am taking a hot bath
and crawling into a nice, warm bed.

243
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:58,435
You know, living at Richard's
mansion has made you soft.

244
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,063
- Oh, shush.
- I'm serious. What if this is

245
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,481
the demon that gets to Wyatt?

246
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:05,734
Well, then it's all the more reason
for us to be well-rested, right?

247
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,197
What happened here?

248
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,580
What the heck are you wearing?

249
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,208
Just a little something to
help me win my boyfriend back.

250
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,419
- Showing a little skin never hurt.
- Oh, well, I'll file that away.

251
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,464
I guess it didn't go so good
with Jason last night?

252
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,842
No, unfortunately.

253
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,346
Since when do you
speak freedom fry?

254
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:39,017
I don't know, actually. It's kind of weird,
considering I hate the French.

255
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:42,646
No, you don't.
You love everything about France.

256
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:43,981
I do?

257
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,358
Oh, then maybe
I just hate being dumped.

258
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,026
All the more reason to go get him.

259
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:52,447
Just there's one thing. See, we
kind of need the power of three

260
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:55,784
for a vanquish, you know,
to save your nephew's future and all.

261
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,495
Yeah, sorry. I can't.

262
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,546
Please tell me she didn't...

263
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:11,175
Cast a spell on herself?
I think she did.

264
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,017
I can feel their pain.

265
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:24,104
This is where they fought and died.

266
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,940
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but this was your division.

267
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,234
I'm afraid it was.

268
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,361
Remember.

269
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,823
This is going to hurt me
much more than it hurts you.

270
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,628
It is time to bring the fight to them!

271
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:52,758
Let the Charmed Ones feel our pain!

272
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:59,473
I'm confused. How does
cleansing her aura get Jason back?

273
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,934
No, Phoebe didn't cast
a spell, Richard did.

274
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,228
Richard wants Jason back?

275
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,938
No,

276
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:09,650
Richard wants
to cleanse his karma...

277
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,194
Oh, my God, that's what
he used the Book for.

278
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,280
Damn it, I shouldn't
have left him alone.

279
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,741
Wait a second, what does this
have to do with Phoebe?

280
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,785
Karma is not something
you mess with.

281
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:22,079
Especially not magically.
Whatever Richard did

282
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:25,249
could have gone wonky
and affected her somehow.

283
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:29,461
I mean, there's all this unfinished
karma just floating around out there,

284
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,505
waiting to complete its cycle.

285
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,215
What the hell are you talking about?

286
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:36,510
I'm talking about Richard screwing
with the karmic wheel

287
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,179
and Phoebe getting smacked
down by it. She said it herself.

288
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,598
She's been lying to Jason,
living a double life.

289
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,768
If that doesn't attract bad karma,
I don't know what does.

290
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,396
Someone's unfinished bad karma?

291
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,189
Exactly.

292
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:50,858
Except whose?

293
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:56,113
Well, I'd guess a French hooker,
by the way she's been acting.

294
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,573
Or worse.

295
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,993
Okay, you go get Phoebe,
I'll go get Richard.

296
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,203
But what if he's infected too?

297
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:06,498
Well, I'll save him
and then I'll kill him.

298
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,384
Cast any spells lately?

299
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,094
No.

300
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,180
All right yeah, one.
It didn't work, though.

301
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,807
- How do you know?
- Because.

302
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,101
All right, I was cleansing my soul...

303
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,853
Yeah, yeah.
Skip down to the bottom.

304
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,898
What happened when you
set the spell, exactly?

305
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:35,235
The energy and light came down
from the ceiling and it surrounded me...

306
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:38,947
- And hit Phoebe.
- No. I was there alone.

307
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,533
Oh, yeah, you were alone.
Then how do you explain my sister

308
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,620
suddenly walking around like she's
in the nudie version of Les Mis?

309
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,371
I don't know. L...

310
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,082
I don't know why
it affected her and not me.

311
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,586
Maybe because your family is
surrounded by so much bad karma

312
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,796
that there's no room
for anybody else's.

313
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,759
What were you thinking?

314
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,594
I was thinking about us.

315
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,263
- Us?
- Yeah.

316
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:05,432
I don't want my past to hurt you.

317
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,771
Richard, I know that you
mean well, I really do.

318
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:16,610
And I get that it must be so hard
to not practise magic when you can.

319
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,446
- But you can't...
- How can you be with a guy

320
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:22,658
that's got a problem
with the very thing you're all about?

321
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,287
I have an idea.

322
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,414
I have a potion that'll help Phoebe.

323
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,043
- Richard.
- What?

324
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:36,296
- Just stop.
- I can't. I did this.

325
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,382
I need to fix it.

326
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:41,009
No. Hey.

327
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,344
Please.

328
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,679
Just...

329
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,472
...no more magic.

330
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,609
- Hey, bro.
- Richard.

331
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,820
Man, how the hell have you been?

332
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,657
Good, good, you know.

333
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:06,368
Well, you look good
and you got your hair cut.

334
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:09,705
Yeah, for court.
I'm doing pro bono now.

335
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,665
A do-gooder. Wow, you.

336
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:14,001
Yeah, I needed a change in my life.

337
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,878
So Mom's been worried.

338
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:20,174
No one's heard from you.
Staying out of trouble, I hope?

339
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:24,011
- Yeah. More or less.
- So you still seeing Paige?

340
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,513
Absolutely.
I can't imagine life without her.

341
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:28,765
- Sounds serious.
- I hope so.

342
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,267
Well, here, man, take a seat.

343
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:32,227
Actually, I can't. I gotta go.

344
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:35,647
I've been going through some of the
old potion books just for the hell of it,

345
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:39,318
and I can't find that one
Dad used to use to banish spirits.

346
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:40,569
You know where it is?

347
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,030
I thought we both agreed
not to mess with that anymore.

348
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:46,450
I'm not. Not really.
It's hard to explain.

349
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,285
- Do you know where it is?
- Richard...

350
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:50,913
Look, save the speech.
Can you help me or not?

351
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,040
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

352
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:56,084
- Are people hurt? Do you need...?
- Damn it, Steve!

353
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:58,128
Can you help me or not?

354
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,050
Please.

355
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:11,099
What are you doing here?

356
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:15,562
And what are you wearing?

357
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,731
I'm looking for you.

358
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,402
Look, I don't have time
for this. This is crazy.

359
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,655
You have every right
to be very upset with me.

360
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,782
I know I've been a very, very bad girl.

361
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:29,034
Please let me make it up to you.

362
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:30,410
I don't think so.

363
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,871
- What do you mean, don't think so?
- Take it easy.

364
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,332
We'll talk about it later, okay?
Now I'm running late.

365
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,418
There's always time for I'amour.

366
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,132
Listen, this is... l...

367
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:47,678
This merger is
very important to me, okay?

368
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:50,430
I need to keep a clear head,
if that's at all possible.

369
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,350
Are you saying you don't want me?

370
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,310
Not right now, okay?

371
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,188
You pig.

372
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,317
You're crazy.

373
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,404
You think you could just
walk away from me?

374
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:07,990
You think I'm crazy?
You think this is crazy?

375
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:13,620
Just wait.

376
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:17,958
In the climate of this world economy,
diversity is essential.

377
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,669
And that is why
this merger is essential

378
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:23,338
if we want to grow as a company.

379
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,674
Combining resources

380
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:28,510
will allow us to tap into markets
that would have otherwise

381
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,138
remained beyond our reach.

382
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,600
And so today we celebrate

383
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:37,561
a new Franco-American
business community,

384
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:41,899
in which bilateral trade
is not only encouraged...

385
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,427
What the hell are you doing?

386
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:12,846
You turned on me.

387
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:15,474
You rejected me.

388
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:19,144
And I'd say that you'd live
to regret it, but you won't.

389
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,438
This isn't a game.

390
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:23,941
Jesus.

391
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:25,692
Phoebe, you can't do this.

392
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,695
Oh, no? Watch me.

393
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,365
Curses on this merger.

394
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,431
- Stop this.
- You let go of me.

395
00:25:58,267 --> 00:25:59,977
Are you trying to ruin me?

396
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,603
That's just the hors d'oeuvre.

397
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,690
Wait until you see the entrée.
It's to die for.

398
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:19,079
Leo!

399
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:26,128
Leo. Leo.

400
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,132
Yeah.

401
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,218
Wh...? Why is Phoebe frozen?

402
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:35,220
- That's not Phoebe.
- What do you mean?

403
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:37,264
Long story. Let's get out of here.

404
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:40,475
- What about all this?
- Later, later.

405
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:50,110
Phoebe?

406
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,173
- Sit down and put this on.
- I'm not finished with my revenge.

407
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:15,219
Sit or I will freeze. We need to
figure out whose karma you got.

408
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:16,929
I'll never tell.

409
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,974
Okay, she's French.

410
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:23,519
Bad karma. Napoleon?

411
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:25,270
Probably not.

412
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:26,647
Phoebe's not our only problem.

413
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,607
That entire auditorium
saw her use magic.

414
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,735
Well, we fix Phoebe first, and then we
take care of the swarm king

415
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:34,696
and if we're still alive
after that, we'll worry about it then.

416
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,326
Maybe you should go check
on Wyatt, make sure he's okay.

417
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,453
He's fine.

418
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:43,413
Okay, I'll go check.

419
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:52,005
Let's see if I can piece together
a spell to de-karma Phoebe.

420
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:54,842
Okay, what about Marie Antoinette,

421
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,719
Queen Isabella,
the she-wolf of France?

422
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:01,014
Oh, now you insult me.
I can't stand France.

423
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:02,641
Vital clue there?

424
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,269
Okay, let's see. Speaks French,

425
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,062
hates the country,

426
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:09,356
more than willing to strip in public...

427
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:12,234
Oh, my God,
I saw something in here.

428
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,611
Famous females spies:

429
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,905
Mata Hari.

430
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,324
Wasn't she one of the Bond girls?

431
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:23,120
No. Look, an exotic stripper in Paris,

432
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:27,374
Dutch-born, double agent
for Germany during World War I,

433
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:31,545
it says here Mata Hari was
convicted by French officials

434
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:34,339
and executed by a firing squad.

435
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:36,717
Well, no wonder
she hates the French.

436
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:39,803
Not half as much
as I hate you for keeping me here.

437
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,681
I need my freedom.
I need my revenge.

438
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,809
What does her karma
have to do with Phoebe?

439
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:50,439
Well, duplicitous, living a
double life? Ring any bells?

440
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:52,649
Enough!

441
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,776
Where are you going?

442
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:06,038
Hi. Look, it's two against one,
and you are not going any...

443
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:16,089
Why am I always the one getting hit?

444
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:18,967
Behind you.

445
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,353
Take her!

446
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:42,783
Am I crazy, or was she trying
to save them from us?

447
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:48,080
I didn't tell you to bring her here.
I ordered you to kill them.

448
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:50,123
The Charmed Ones
were all together.

449
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:52,125
We were lucky to grab one
and get away.

450
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:55,295
Oh, luck had nothing to do with it,
I saved your butts back there.

451
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:58,173
Excuse me.

452
00:29:58,382 --> 00:29:59,591
Are you in charge here?

453
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,760
I am.

454
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:08,600
Good. Because I'd like
to get into bed with you.

455
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:11,436
Not literally.

456
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,146
Although...

457
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:15,357
...there may be time for that later.

458
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,570
What I'm saying is,

459
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:23,615
if you help me, I'll help you.

460
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,416
You think I'm a fool?
Save my drones to gain my favour?

461
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,793
I'm not one to fall for tricks.

462
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,796
This isn't a trick. Hands off me.

463
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:42,050
The witches have
double-crossed me.

464
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:45,637
They want to keep me
against my will.

465
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:47,472
So do I.

466
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,808
Yeah, let me guess.

467
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:53,729
To lure them here
so you can kill all of us?

468
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:57,191
Yeah, see, you're not
the first demon to try that and fail.

469
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,278
They've got good karma.

470
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:05,365
Centuries of it.
It's what protects them.

471
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:08,744
- Us.
- And what is it that you suggest?

472
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,081
Well, I was hoping
that you could help me create

473
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:16,668
some bad karma for them by...

474
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:19,713
Oh, I don't know,
maybe killing an innocent?

475
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:21,882
Who did you have in mind?

476
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,385
Jason.

477
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:29,723
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for Phoebe. You seen her?

478
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:32,309
Not since she
destroyed my career, no.

479
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:34,311
Listen, I gotta give
a press conference,

480
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:36,230
try to salvage
what's left of my reputation.

481
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,440
Don't go. All right?

482
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:41,902
- I know how you feel.
- Oh, you know how I feel?

483
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:44,822
Do you know how it feels to have
the woman you love lie to you,

484
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,826
to turn your one shining
moment into chaos? And to...

485
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,578
...strip in front
of a packed auditorium?

486
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:53,705
No. Look,

487
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:56,542
it's not her fault. You want
to blame somebody, blame me.

488
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,752
- I cast a spell that...
- Hold on.

489
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:02,798
- You too?
- Yeah, look.

490
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:05,676
There's no time to explain,
just take this, please.

491
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:07,469
The moment you see
Phoebe, throw this,

492
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:09,429
she'll be back to normal. I promise.

493
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:12,307
Wait a second. What is that?

494
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:14,518
It's a potion.

495
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,896
- Get out of here.
- Look, I screwed up big time, all right?

496
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:21,817
The only way to fix this
is to use this on Phoebe.

497
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:23,735
If you love her...

498
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,530
...you'll do it.

499
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,707
Well, if you would just hold still...

500
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:41,044
Fine. There, you're done.

501
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:45,048
We wouldn't be in this mess
if it weren't for Phoebe

502
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:47,676
not being able to deal with conflict.

503
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:50,512
Actually, we wouldn't be in this mess

504
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:53,599
if your boyfriend
could handle his magic.

505
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:55,934
Ow, you did that on purpose.

506
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:57,269
Yes, I did.

507
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:01,481
Maybe we should just focus
on how to save Phoebe.

508
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,234
Well, we could storm the hive,
but then again,

509
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,320
she'd probably just
help them stop us.

510
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:08,030
That's just Mata Hari
coming through,

511
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:10,157
using whoever she can
to exact her revenge.

512
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:13,785
But against who? The men who
put her to death are long gone.

513
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,704
And besides, doesn't her real karma

514
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:18,665
eventually lead to her own
self-destruction anyway?

515
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:21,627
I think that's why we need to
figure out why she's using Phoebe

516
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:23,170
before it's too late, right?

517
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:25,839
Which brings us back
to Mata Hari's revenge.

518
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:28,800
Okay, she spent
her life pleasing men,

519
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:32,137
only to be betrayed
by them at the end.

520
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:35,474
- Oh, no.
- What?

521
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:38,727
What if she wants
to return the favour?

522
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:42,606
- Mr. Dean.
- Mr. Dean.

523
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:46,276
Just one quote. One quote, please.

524
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:49,780
- What happened?
- What can you tell us about that?

525
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:52,407
Listen up. I'll answer
at the press conference.

526
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:56,495
Please do me a favour
and hold your questions until then.

527
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,416
- Hello, Jason.
- Phoebe, I've had enough.

528
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:09,550
- I always get my man.
- Wait, hang on a sec...

529
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:22,271
I swear, this is where
we found the king last time.

530
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:24,314
Well, maybe your orbing was off.

531
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:27,901
My orbing was not off.
It just moved.

532
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:31,613
Well, we should be hearing
the swarm, so why don't we?

533
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,490
Because there's a jillion miles

534
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:36,577
of this stupid maze.
They could be anywhere.

535
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,037
We don't even know
if Phoebe is here.

536
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,540
Well, it's our best bet.

537
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:45,335
I swear, if she is hurt, I am
never going to forgive Richard.

538
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:49,047
I think Jason's the one
we need to worry about right now.

539
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:59,266
Such a sweet man.

540
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:02,102
And such a horrible way to die.

541
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:04,771
I almost want to cry.

542
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,231
- Almost.
- What are you doing?

543
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:07,900
Please stop this game.

544
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:10,986
Life is a game.
The last one standing wins.

545
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:12,779
- And that would be me.
- I get it.

546
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:14,490
You're trying to teach me a lesson.

547
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:15,908
No lesson.

548
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:17,618
I just don't like being betrayed.

549
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,787
Well, what about him,
won't he betray you?

550
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:26,502
- Goodbye, mi amor.
- Phoebe, please. I'm begging you.

551
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,713
Oh, don't beg.

552
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,965
I stared at my killer right in the eye.

553
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:34,760
It's a much more
dignified way to die.

554
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,471
Richard was right.

555
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,014
- Who?
- Enough!

556
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,309
Can we please get on with this?

557
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,895
Ready.

558
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:52,486
Aim.

559
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:01,995
No.

560
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,040
Fire!

561
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,301
Oh, thank God, I'm so happy
to see you guys.

562
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:18,262
- You're you.
- Yeah.

563
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:20,889
Okay, reunion later, slay now.

564
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:23,392
Fire at her!

565
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,686
"Demon swarm that serves as one

566
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:28,105
Vanquish him from which they come"

567
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:36,280
Jason.

568
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:41,326
I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

569
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:42,911
Me too.

570
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:45,873
I hate to break this up,
I really do, but we gotta go.

571
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,208
How did you get rid
of Mata Hari's karma?

572
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:50,419
- Who?
- Don't ask.

573
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:52,588
Where did you get the potion from?

574
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:56,758
I got it from Richard, he said it would
be the only thing that might save you.

575
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,094
Richard.

576
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,587
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah, you know,

577
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:37,382
considering I'm the mother
of the future leader of all evil.

578
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:39,551
No, you're not.

579
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:43,263
Okay, maybe he won't be, now that
you took care of the last threat on him.

580
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:47,809
You know as well as I do that was not
the last threat. There'll be others.

581
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:49,728
And you'll take care of them too.

582
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:52,898
Especially now that we
know what can happen.

583
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:55,734
After all, well aware is half there.

584
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:58,320
Did Phoebe give you
that psychobabble?

585
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:05,744
I just don't understand how someone
so sweet could possibly turn...

586
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,580
...so bad.

587
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:10,541
I don't believe he will.

588
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:12,251
Despite what Chris says.

589
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:15,671
Or, maybe because of it,
we won't let it.

590
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:19,299
You know, Piper, all parents
worry about their kids.

591
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,718
It's part of the job description.

592
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:23,929
We just have to have faith.

593
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,807
Yeah, but Wyatt isn't just any kid.

594
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:30,269
And we're not just any parents either.

595
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:36,525
Well, at least we know he'll
inherit all of our family's good karma.

596
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:37,943
And that should help.

597
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,570
I hope it helps Phoebe too.

598
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:42,906
She still has what happened
at Jason's banquet to worry about.

599
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:47,244
Mr. Dean.

600
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,372
Here you are, sir.

601
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,294
Jason!

602
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,837
Jason!

603
00:38:57,004 --> 00:38:58,714
Phoebe?

604
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:05,554
I want to talk to the press.
I want to tell them everything.

605
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:07,681
What are you gonna do?
Tell them you're a witch?

606
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,641
That'll make the headlines.

607
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,978
Actually, I didn't think about
what I was gonna say to them.

608
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:16,190
I just know that I can't let you
take the fall for this.

609
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:18,692
I am so sorry.

610
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:23,614
- About everything. The lies and...
- Hey.

611
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:25,532
Don't.

612
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:28,911
- Remember, you saved me.
- But that was after I tried to kill you.

613
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:30,621
Well, there was that.

614
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:37,753
If I could do it all again,

615
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,463
I would tell you the truth.

616
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:42,007
What are you gonna do,
what are you gonna tell me?

617
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:44,301
And besides, I was...

618
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:47,429
I was so wrapped up in my career
and dragging you around the world,

619
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:49,389
I never gave you a chance.

620
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:53,894
So...

621
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,689
...what do we do now?

622
00:39:58,232 --> 00:39:59,942
I don't know.

623
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:03,987
Maybe we should just...

624
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:07,866
...both take some time.

625
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:15,749
They're waiting for me.

626
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,920
I wish you'd let me talk to them.

627
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:23,048
No. No, what you
and your sisters do,

628
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:25,717
what I saw you do...

629
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:27,219
...it...

630
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:30,472
...put some perspective
on my work.

631
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:33,058
I want to protect that.

632
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:37,062
You might lose the merger.

633
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:38,981
I've lost worse.

634
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:12,181
Mr. Dean!
