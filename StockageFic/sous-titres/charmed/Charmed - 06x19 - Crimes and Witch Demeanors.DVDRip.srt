1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:08,091
- You sure this is the right place?
- It's just as I saw it in my premonition.

2
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,177
Yeah, but you kind of
forced that premonition.

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,721
Darryl, will you hurry up?
I got a date.

4
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,139
Where's he gonna be?

5
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:15,474
At a restaurant downtown.

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,476
No, I meant where is
the killer going to be?

7
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,229
Oh, he's gonna be robbing
a pawnshop in the alley.

8
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,856
So exactly how do
we know that he's possessed?

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,318
When the phantasm comes
out of him and tries to annihilate us.

10
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:30,531
Wait, so the perp is not responsible
for the other killings, it's this,

11
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,116
- whatever you call it?
- No, he is.

12
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,036
The phantasm only
possesses bad guys

13
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,496
to make them worse.

14
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,706
Okay, shall we?

15
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,334
She really wants this demon,
doesn't she?

16
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:46,004
No, she really wants her date.

17
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,722
Okay, go, go.

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,766
Okay, well, just make sure
you do your thing

19
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,768
before any annihilating occurs,
okay?

20
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,311
Have we ever let you down?

21
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,021
Go.

22
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,525
Freeze. Police.

23
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,112
Wait, not yet.

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,079
Throw the potion.

25
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,840
Mother of God.

26
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,050
Now, now.

27
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,730
- Do you want it?
- No.

28
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:45,981
You guys saved my life.

29
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,775
That's okay, we put you
at risk, again.

30
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,820
You caught a killer, you saved an
innocent, not bad for a night's work.

31
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,114
I gotta go. Tell Sheila
I said hi, okay?

32
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,742
Yeah. I'll call it in.

33
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,660
You guys better get on
out of here before...

34
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,456
...somebody sees you.

35
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,254
Hey, was that car there before?

36
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:13,342
Jeez, Paige, relax. You act like
we've never done this before.

37
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,942
Gotcha.

38
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,880
Morning, how was your date?

39
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,716
Good, other than the fact that
he's not the man of my dreams.

40
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,594
- You can tell after one date?
- No, I could tell that because

41
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,721
I see nothing in the future for us
besides sex.

42
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,556
- And I'm not interested in that.
- Sex?

43
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,350
No, wasting my time. Either you're
the father of the child

44
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,603
that I saw in my vision or not.
So I'm moving on.

45
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,771
Can you pass me
the asphodel root, please?

46
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,024
Yeah, what are you,
demon hunting?

47
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,235
No, lunch date. I wanna
make sure I get a hit off

48
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,862
of him before the entrÃ©es come.

49
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,156
No sense wasting
those calories, right?

50
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,576
Wait a second, so now you're trying to
force premonitions on your dates?

51
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,120
It's the quickest way
to find out who I'm looking for.

52
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,456
Does it even matter to you that you're
breaking every

53
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,208
Wiccan rule that exists?

54
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,835
I think after all these years,
I know what I'm doing.

55
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,712
Besides with Piper in Magic School,

56
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,131
we're down a power.
We could use the extra boost.

57
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,592
Maybe, I just hope we don't misuse it.

58
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:23,555
- There's the Book, do you mind?
- No, knock yourself out.

59
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,474
I've been working some
demonic connections.

60
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,976
I have a theory on who's
trying to turn Wyatt evil.

61
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,396
Oh, a new theory. What's
that, like, the third one this week?

62
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,608
- Are you keeping score now?
- She's grumpy. She hasn't had coffee.

63
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,943
I am not grumpy.

64
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,403
Okay, fine. Maybe a little bit,

65
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,823
but you have to admit you've had
a lot of different theories lately,

66
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,450
and none of them have panned out.

67
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,036
That's why they call them theories.

68
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,704
Do we even get along in the future?

69
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,791
How's Piper?
Have you seen her?

70
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,503
She's good, big. You know, I keep
thinking how weird it's gonna be

71
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,255
to actually see myself being born.

72
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,800
- And how's Leo?
- Leo? Don't know, haven't seen him.

73
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,177
That's because you're
avoiding him still, aren't you?

74
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,806
Chris, he's your father, you have to
talk to him. How are you gonna change

75
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,224
the future if you don't?

76
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,643
That's not the future I came
back to change. Thanks.

77
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,982
Hey, don't look at me, I'm grumpy.

78
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:24,741
Sheila, what's the matter? Come in,
come in, come in, come in.

79
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,286
What's going on?

80
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,080
- It's Darryl.
- What about Darryl? Is he okay?

81
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,415
They just arrested him...

82
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,501
...for murder.

83
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,050
I don't really know what happened.

84
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,679
- It's all kind of a blur.
- What are you talking about?

85
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,099
It was self-defence, he
shot first, several times.

86
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,935
- He did?
- You don't remember any of that?

87
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,812
Did you get hit on
the head or something?

88
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,107
- Maybe when you pushed him down.
- No, he was fine after that.

89
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,651
Something weird is going on here.

90
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:01,987
Lieutenant Morris,

91
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,949
I'm sorry, but we really have to
prepare for your arraignment.

92
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,327
It's okay, they're my friends.

93
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,913
Yeah, there's a problem here
because this man is innocent.

94
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,832
- Yeah? How do you know?
- Because I was there...

95
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,836
...driving around in the area.
- Perjuring yourself isn't gonna

96
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,338
help any, lady.

97
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,007
The prosecution's evidence
is overwhelming. Trust me.

98
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,218
Evidence, what evidence?

99
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,345
It's okay. Show them.

100
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,816
Please. Please,
don't kill me. No. Don't kill me.

101
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,532
That's not what happened.

102
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,082
Inspector Sheridan?

103
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,959
- Yes.
- We would like to talk to you.

104
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,295
- Easy.
- Do you have a personal grudge

105
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,548
- against Darryl Morris?
- Morris?

106
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,509
Yeah, we know you faked
the images on the tape.

107
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:09,346
And we're here to let you know that we
won't watch you frame our friend.

108
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,975
- She's a little upset.
- Yes, I can see that.

109
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,103
- And you are?
- Phoebe. Phoebe Halliwell.

110
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,438
Halliwell.

111
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,899
Your name certainly pops up
in his file plenty.

112
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,444
For the record, I didn't fake anything

113
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,530
because I was there undercover.

114
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,700
And I saw it go down with my own
eyes. I've been investigating Morris

115
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,911
for a few weeks now trying to figure
out why so many of his suspects

116
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,747
over the last five years just vanish

117
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,958
or mysteriously wind up dead.

118
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,585
Now I know.

119
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,670
He takes the law into his own hands.

120
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,755
Excuse me.

121
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,428
- Well?
- If she was lying, I couldn't sense it.

122
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,306
Then how do you
explain what happened?

123
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,942
- Sure hope this works.
- It will.

124
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,111
- Coffee cart.
- Cart away.

125
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,745
Flowers that bring desire
Make them turn into fire

126
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,510
- I see you got our message.
- What do you think you're doing now?

127
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,013
Well, we didn't know how else to
call for you. Figured you weren't listed

128
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,516
- in the Yellow Pages.
- What do you want?

129
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,602
We wanna know why
you framed Darryl Morris.

130
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,187
That was your doing, wasn't it?

131
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:44,149
Magic was exposed, we were
forced to clean it up.

132
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,944
- Change what was.
- To protect you.

133
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,739
I thought we resolved this the last
time you guys tried to intervene.

134
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,116
We clean up
our own magical messes.

135
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,327
But you didn't even know
about this one.

136
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,664
You didn't realize you
were being followed, taped.

137
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,458
Yeah, but we always manage
to fix these things somehow.

138
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,627
No, you wouldn't have.

139
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,714
That's why we were put on
the case to begin with, it was

140
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,634
- anticipated.
- You know what, I don't care.

141
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:14,555
If you don't free Darryl Morris, we're
just gonna keep exposing magic and...

142
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:19,643
This will not be like our
last encounter, Miss Halliwell.

143
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,730
We're under strict orders not to
negotiate with you this time.

144
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,734
Strict orders from whom?

145
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,281
The Tribunal. It's a council
made up of Elders and demons

146
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:36,410
to monitor magic, to make sure nobody
ever finds out about its use.

147
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,037
At whatever the cost.

148
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,081
Which is why they
created the Cleaners,

149
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,168
and gave them the power
to erase events, memories.

150
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,044
Or in this case, to change them.

151
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,881
Well, it's just part of the
grand design to allow magic to

152
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,841
influence but not take over

153
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,718
- free will.
- It's the thing both sides

154
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,094
could agree upon.

155
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,555
Okay,
so how do we find this Tribunal?

156
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,516
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

157
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,604
- What's wrong?
- It's Darryl.

158
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,023
Our friendly Cleaners
have struck again.

159
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,525
He's in jail for murder.

160
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,152
What, why, what happened?

161
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,945
Someone was in a hurry.

162
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,780
Oh, wait, are we blaming
me for this?

163
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,200
Did we or did we not
catch the demon?

164
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,119
Yeah, but you forced the premonition,
so maybe we could have been

165
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,705
more careful, and maybe we
could have seen that somebody

166
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,333
- was watching.
- We'd have never caught the killer.

167
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,293
All right, guys, this isn't helping.

168
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,921
I know, it isn't.

169
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,215
There's only one thing that will.

170
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,680
Where are we?

171
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,599
Nowhere.

172
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:41,892
Anywhere.

173
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,228
You don't want to know.

174
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,189
You should know that
the Tribunal is not

175
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,274
like anything
you've ever faced before.

176
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,110
They are not a power
to be trifled with.

177
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,446
- We understand.
- Do you?

178
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,949
You might not like what's been
happening to your friend.

179
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,202
But be aware before you embark
upon this journey that where it ends

180
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,496
might just be worse.

181
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,416
Call them.

182
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,075
What reason have you to
call the Tribunal?

183
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:44,872
To challenge the actions
of the Cleaners on behalf...

184
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,626
...of the Charmed Ones.
- The Charmed Ones?

185
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,837
But there are only two.

186
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,755
The other is with child.

187
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,884
I assume the sisters will speak
for her in absentia.

188
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,428
Yeah, in absentia,

189
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,638
Your Greatness?

190
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,642
There's four of them,
how do they break a tie?

191
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:06,977
You don't wanna know.

192
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,647
Your request has been granted.

193
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,534
Barbas.

194
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,496
- What the hell is he doing here?
- You missed me.

195
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:26,914
Didn't we vanquish you?

196
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,916
To the fires of hell.

197
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,044
I've been granted a temporary
leave of absence

198
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,796
in order to act as
your opposing counsel.

199
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,715
We liked his pitch.

200
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,217
Pitch?

201
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,843
What pitch?

202
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,345
How did he even know about it?

203
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,431
We have the right
to choose anybody we wish.

204
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,101
- Gideon.
- Your Honours, in the interests of fair...

205
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,771
On that fairness issue,
I submit that in order

206
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:54,441
to expedite matters and to keep
the Charmed Ones honest...

207
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,610
Us honest?

208
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,404
For their own good,

209
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,533
we graphically remind them
as to what

210
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,118
exactly is at stake here
so they do not

211
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,539
foolishly try some trickery

212
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,708
in order to slip away
like they did the last time

213
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,336
they faced the Cleaners.

214
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,964
It is done.

215
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,133
- What is done?
- I'm not sure.

216
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,183
Darryl.

217
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,147
The governor denied the stay.

218
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,149
What stay?
What's going on?

219
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,026
We have accelerated time,

220
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,404
but only for the execution.

221
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,947
Execution?

222
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,825
You have until midnight
to convince us

223
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:49,288
- or his sentence will be carried out.
- Magic will be protected,

224
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,415
one way or the other.

225
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:00,132
We didn't know that signing up
for this would put Darryl on death row.

226
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,467
I warned you about
invoking the Tribunal.

227
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,094
Yeah, well, you didn't warn us that

228
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,680
they would call upon
our worst enemy.

229
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,141
Gideon, your case.

230
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,685
Yes, Your Honour, just a few
more moments, if you please.

231
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,437
We don't.

232
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,064
You're the ones
who called for us, proceed.

233
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,109
We called for justice,
not the Demon of Fear.

234
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,862
I don't see the problem
with me being here.

235
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,532
There's a conflict of interest,
and we believe

236
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,576
that the Tribunal
should recognize this.

237
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,536
- I think this is a setup.
- Phoebe.

238
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,498
How dare you question our integrity.

239
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,959
Not yours, theirs.

240
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,879
Barbas has tried to kill us
three times in the past.

241
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,842
Mrs. Joffee?

242
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,428
It's SWA Properties.

243
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,515
Hello, dear.

244
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,892
Thanks so much for coming out.

245
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:02,069
I know how you kill, but there
are no elevators around here.

246
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:05,531
Elevators? That's what you think
your greatest fear is?

247
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:10,828
You mortals need to look deeper.
Down where the real truth lies.

248
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:15,958
Your greatest fear is losing a sister,
and I get two for one.

249
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,294
The good old days.

250
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,964
- What was that?
- The Circle of Truth. It's enchanted.

251
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,717
It reads thoughts and shows them.
You must be careful.

252
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,427
Maybe you'd better just sit down.

253
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,054
If I may?

254
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,391
It is not my past evils
that's in question here.

255
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:36,228
What is in question here
is these three witches'

256
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,940
so called right
to be continually cleaning up

257
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,610
- after their own magical asses.
- We have to get out of here.

258
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,737
- We have to figure this out.
- You can't.

259
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,447
If you leave, Lieutenant Morris dies.

260
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,575
Does it really matter
if we were set up?

261
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,034
The point is, we were exposed.

262
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,579
But if we can prove he orchestrated
the exposure, it might.

263
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,914
Go find out what you can, hurry.

264
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,751
Was I boring him?

265
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,505
With all due respect,
if it truly is our case

266
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,674
to present, may I?

267
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:11,805
To better put this particular situation
into its proper context,

268
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,392
it bears reminding Your Honours
of the long history,

269
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,604
the long successful history,
the Charmed Ones have of

270
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,481
shielding their magical tracks.

271
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,067
If I may show you some examples.

272
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,737
- I'm going.
- No, you can't.

273
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,906
Well, I can't just let
them hang either, Leo.

274
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,325
If it wasn't safe for you before,
it's even less so now

275
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,994
- with Barbas there. Please.
- Well, what about Darryl?

276
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,914
- Does he know what's happening?
- No, I'm not gonna tell him.

277
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,249
I need to concentrate
on proving Barbas' set up.

278
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,584
How are you gonna do that?

279
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:44,004
I was hoping that you would call
Chris to use his demonic connections.

280
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,714
Why don't you ask him?

281
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,883
Right.

282
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,968
Chris?

283
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:51,803
Yeah, Mom, what do you...

284
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,473
...need?

285
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,643
We need your help.

286
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,479
The point being,

287
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,314
the Charmed Ones

288
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,858
have never once failed

289
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,944
in their duty to keep

290
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,446
the big secret.

291
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,365
Witness.

292
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,911
I made an appointment with you
at Missing Persons today.

293
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,956
Wait, you want Phoebe
to report Cole as missing?

294
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,124
She has to,
otherwise somebody else will,

295
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,794
and she'll become the prime suspect
in his disappearance.

296
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,630
So you want me to pack up his stuff
so it looks like he left me.

297
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:27,840
That's right.

298
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:31,969
We cannot give the police
any reason to suspect foul play.

299
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,847
I mean, technically,
you three did kill him.

300
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,266
Let the object of objection
Become but a dream

301
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,685
As I cause the seen to be unseen

302
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,525
As you've just seen,

303
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:49,903
Lieutenant Morris whom
the Cleaners would have die

304
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,322
to cover magic is here

305
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,492
instrumental in keeping it protected.

306
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:59,830
Would you play that hologram
just a tiny bit longer?

307
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,499
Humour me.

308
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,377
Do it.

309
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:14,094
I just wish I could make the rest
of your pain go away that easily.

310
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,680
So do I.

311
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,516
You murdering witch!

312
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:23,353
That's not fair, I was
under the influence of evil.

313
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,897
Yes, you were.

314
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,858
But then it seems like
you girls are so often

315
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,736
under the influence of one thing

316
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:32,529
or another.

317
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:36,366
Your husband fits
the classic profile of a deadbeat dad.

318
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,536
- Make it go out.
- I can't make it go out!

319
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,711
Phoebe? I mean, fire!

320
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,424
Wait, you're gonna love this one.

321
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,345
So glad you're home.
We have some new floral sketches

322
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:59,223
- we'd like you to see.
- Now's not really a good time.

323
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,808
They're welcome to come in, Leo.

324
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,771
I've revisited the dinner menu, Piper,
and you are going to be thrilled.

325
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,898
I have some dynamic choices
that l...

326
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,192
I want pigs in blankets.

327
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,409
It's nice to see a bride
who still has a sense of humour

328
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,286
this close to the big day.

329
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:26,583
No, I want pigs in blankets.

330
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:38,679
I frankly don't see the relevance of
any of this. It's wholly beside the point.

331
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:39,888
No, no, no,

332
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:43,392
that is precisely the point.

333
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:46,937
The Charmed Ones
are so influenced

334
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,439
by outside forces,

335
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,943
how can we ever expect
to continue to trust them

336
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,321
- to clean up after themselves?
- We cleaned up after each

337
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,073
and every one of those situations.

338
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,118
But how close you came to not.

339
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,788
Continue, Gideon.

340
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,792
Where is Leo?

341
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:16,258
Barbas escaped the fires
of hell and so did you.

342
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:17,843
I know he helped you.

343
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,179
Please, I don't wanna go back
down there.

344
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,431
- Don't throw me back down there.
- Chris, I don't

345
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,142
- think this is the best way.
- Last chance, Phinks.

346
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:26,768
Okay, okay.

347
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,812
Phantasms, we used phantasms.

348
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:31,565
- How?
- Barbas buddied up to a couple

349
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,484
of them down there. He used them
to do stuff for him, you know,

350
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,904
- since they go back and forth.
- What kind of stuff?

351
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,490
I don't know. I swear I don't know.

352
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,702
But whatever it was, he said that it
could resurrect him somehow.

353
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:46,663
It could give him new life
permanently too.

354
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,249
He said if he won something.

355
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,501
The case.

356
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,211
He must've used a phantasm

357
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,088
to cut a deal with the demon members
of the Tribunal.

358
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,549
- We need proof.
- What do you think he is?

359
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,260
- A demon, they'll discredit him.
- It's better than nothing.

360
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,721
- It's a waste of time.
- It's the best we've got.

361
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,474
- Then we need to do better.
- Look...

362
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:09,978
Shoot.

363
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,356
Now look what
you made me do.

364
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,818
Piper, what did you do
with the house?

365
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:18,987
Oh, my God.

366
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,240
- What have I done?
- The spell, Piper,

367
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:24,034
- you need to reverse it, fast.
- I'm not sure I can.

368
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:27,663
Then make us disappear because
this one will be tough to explain.

369
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,665
You can do it, Piper, come on.

370
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:33,001
Let the object of objection return

371
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:37,172
So that its existence
May be reaffirmed

372
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,681
Nicely done.

373
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,767
So then despite what Barbas

374
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,310
would have you believe,

375
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:53,230
regardless of outside influences,

376
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,900
the sisters have always
managed to protect magic.

377
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,862
And therefore based upon
all the evidence,

378
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,906
we ask the Tribunal...
No, we demand

379
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,826
that the Cleaners be forced
to reverse what they have done,

380
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:08,036
that Lieutenant Morris be freed,

381
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,913
and that the
Charmed Ones be allowed

382
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,082
to do what they have
always done so well,

383
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:16,044
cover their own tracks, respectfully.

384
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:22,342
Bravo. Bravo. Really very

385
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,969
compelling stuff, counsel.

386
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:25,470
In fact I think

387
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:29,099
that you have just successfully
argued my case for me.

388
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:30,809
Now what's he up to?

389
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,353
Now, obviously,

390
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,480
this whole
thing has now become

391
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:39,610
much, much bigger than the simple
case of whether the good lieutenant

392
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,904
bites the dust because,

393
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,530
as we have just seen,

394
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:46,033
the recklessness displayed

395
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,827
by these three witches

396
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:52,080
has now become
of epidemic proportions.

397
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,833
Objection. May I remind my
counterpart that this is simply a

398
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,003
question of whether or not the situation
should be reversed. It is not

399
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,631
an indictment
on the Charmed Ones.

400
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,633
Maybe it should be.

401
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,468
This is what he's up to.

402
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,803
VoilÃ¡.

403
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,723
They don't have to move.
They can stay for a year.

404
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:11,517
Ten years.

405
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:15,020
What about the cockroaches? Are you
gonna do something about them?

406
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:18,482
First thing tomorrow.
Just please, don't drop me. Please!

407
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,775
Phoebe?

408
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:22,945
Cole? What are you doing here?

409
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,364
Well, I got a call
from one of the tenants

410
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:29,993
saying that Wonder Woman
was terrorizing the landlord.

411
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:31,995
What the hell are you doing?

412
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:36,041
Well, I'm teaching my buddy here how
important it is to be a better person.

413
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,919
I don't know what's going on here,
but this is not you, literally.

414
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:42,631
Are you kidding? This is better than
me. This is new-and-improved me.

415
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,301
Now not only can I help my readers,
but I can help the entire city.

416
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:49,972
- Careful, he's got ears.
- Oh, please, relax.

417
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:53,517
The only thing he can hear right now
is his blood rushing to his brain.

418
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:57,771
Okay, Cole, I gotta go.

419
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:00,607
Because I have a lot
of loyal readers that need my help.

420
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,068
- Okay?
- Okay.

421
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:10,367
And last but by no means least,

422
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,744
where were the Charmed Ones

423
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:16,039
to clean up this mess?

424
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:21,044
All your valuables, all your money!
Hurry up! Watches, wallets...

425
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,010
Come on, nothing's changed.
Give me the money! Hurry up!

426
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,633
That is absurd. That was Cole,
we weren't responsible for that.

427
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,469
- We weren't even there.
- But you were there, Phoebe.

428
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:13,388
It was your cold rejection of his love

429
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,474
that drove him
to that reckless despair.

430
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:17,392
So I say

431
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,144
that you are responsible.

432
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:21,897
Hexes, possession,

433
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:25,526
evil influences, affairs

434
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,319
of the heart.

435
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:31,281
I say we're lucky that all
the magic has not been exposed

436
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:35,202
beyond repair long before now.
If we want to protect

437
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:38,372
all that we are,

438
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,500
all that this Tribunal stands for,

439
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:45,295
then I say we should
not be just deciding

440
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,798
the fate
of some, poor pathetic mortal.

441
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:52,177
No, we should be deciding the fate
of these three

442
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,972
and whether they should
ever be permitted

443
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,183
to practice magic again.

444
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,193
So be it.

445
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:18,412
Okay, I get the fact that
Barbas used the phantasm

446
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,247
to cut a deal
so he could try the case,

447
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,624
but that still doesn't explain
how he set up the girls.

448
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:25,627
To get her to possess the killer
so the sisters would get on to him.

449
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:29,173
But that's only part of it. All right,
how did he even know Darryl was

450
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:32,301
- under investigation in the first place?
- There is nothing in here

451
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,970
- about phantasms that we don't know.
- Hey.

452
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:38,390
- Did you listen to a word I just said?
- What?

453
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,475
- Never mind.
- All right, you know what,

454
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,687
this is ridiculous. Okay, it's
obvious you hate my guts, Chris.

455
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:46,607
I understand. I'm a bad father
in the future, but there's nothing

456
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,693
I can do about that right now. So can
we concentrate on working together

457
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,154
to save Darryl,
to save the girls, please?

458
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:54,740
- Fine.
- Great. All right, let's start

459
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:56,658
with what we know, huh?
How about phantasms?

460
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:58,827
Wait,

461
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:00,370
that's it.

462
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:04,875
Phantasms, plural. Phinks said Barbas
buddied up to a couple of them, right?

463
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,878
That means there must be
another one out there for us to find.

464
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,589
Yeah, see? I knew we
could work together.

465
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:14,676
Yeah.

466
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:16,595
Are you sure about this?

467
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:18,597
Yeah, if they're gonna put
us on trial too,

468
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:20,599
it might be the only
way to save Darryl.

469
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,267
We have to stand on our record.

470
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:25,187
If all the good we've done in the last
six years isn't good enough,

471
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:26,438
then nothing is.

472
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,982
Very well.

473
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,110
Your witness.

474
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:34,780
Well, let's see,

475
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:37,115
so many holograms,

476
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:38,826
so little time.

477
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,245
- Barbas.
- Well, l...

478
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:44,832
I guess I should ask
one of the Cleaners

479
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,209
a few quick questions.

480
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,961
As you wish.

481
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:52,089
You have been assigned

482
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:55,425
to watch the Charmed Ones

483
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,178
since they first became witches.
Have you not?

484
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:00,597
That is correct.

485
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:04,393
Would Lieutenant Morris
be the first policeman

486
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,646
to die in order
to clean up one of their little

487
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:09,815
magical messes?

488
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:12,651
No.

489
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:17,072
- You okay?
- Yeah.

490
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,042
Oh, my God.

491
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,253
He's dead.

492
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:34,464
Truly tragic.
That was their sister Prue's

493
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,967
first true love.

494
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,136
Wonder

495
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:41,513
whatever happened to her.

496
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,432
Don't.

497
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,143
- It's not worth it.
- Anyone else?

498
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,728
Yes.

499
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,354
Inspector Reece.

500
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,356
We had to keep a close watch
on him.

501
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,616
Inspector.

502
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,201
How can I help you?

503
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,328
You can tell me
where to find Cole Turner.

504
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:07,456
I know he's alive,
and I know he's in town.

505
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,249
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

506
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,085
You wanna know how?
Because his former landlady

507
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:14,421
was found brutally murdered
at his address.

508
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:17,382
Oh, my God. That's awful.

509
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,510
Awful like you can't imagine.

510
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,845
I know what you're thinking.

511
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,431
And I know what this looks like.

512
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,059
And I am... I am so sorry

513
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:30,646
- for what happened to...
- Sorry? Her eyes were open in terror.

514
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:34,233
Her skull was punctured in two places,
and by the time the police got there,

515
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,777
most of her brain
had spilled out onto the floor.

516
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:39,071
Be sick, be horrified.

517
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:41,698
But don't stand there
lying to me and say you're sorry.

518
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:45,160
I'm gonna find him, Miss Halliwell,
and then I'm gonna bust his ass,

519
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:48,455
and then I'm gonna bust yours.

520
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:52,292
And did he find him?

521
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,044
No.

522
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:56,296
He did not.

523
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,972
Open the gate.

524
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:09,226
We're real lucky one of
those demons came along

525
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,270
and tied up that loose
end, aren't we?

526
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:15,899
It's a rhetorical question.

527
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:18,861
Never mind.

528
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,989
There was another.

529
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,825
An FBI agent.

530
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:28,245
That's right.

531
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:35,586
In case you're wondering,
that's just a copy.

532
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:40,716
Nice way to engender trust,
Agent Jackman.

533
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:43,802
If I wanted to expose you,
I could have done that six months ago

534
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:45,762
when that file first crossed my desk.

535
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,973
Expose us as what?

536
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,017
Witches.

537
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:53,228
It's the only logical explanation
for all the unsolved cases,

538
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:56,398
the missing persons,
the mysterious deaths.

539
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:59,818
That is out of context. He was
a witch hunter, he tried to kill us.

540
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:02,696
The only context I'm interested in is

541
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:05,240
what happened to yet another

542
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:07,993
officer of the law?

543
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:10,078
Witness.

544
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:27,429
Seems like that stream
of unsolved deaths

545
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:31,183
left in the Charmed Ones' wake
just keeps right on growing, doesn't it?

546
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:35,437
So I guess the obvious question is,
how many more inspectors

547
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:38,524
must die before it comes to an end?

548
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:42,486
- Another rhetorical question.
- Actually, no.

549
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,905
In fact...

550
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,574
...that is what I think

551
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:50,327
becomes the salient question

552
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:54,456
because the deaths could end with
Lieutenant Morris, that's what I think.

553
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:55,666
What do you think?

554
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:56,875
Objection.

555
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:59,127
- Why should we care what he thinks?
- Phoebe.

556
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,088
I care.

557
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:03,841
Yeah, well, of course, you
care, you're a demon.

558
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,884
I care too.

559
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:08,428
Well, then never mind.

560
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,848
I think there will always be another...

561
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:13,141
...lnspector Sheridan to pick
up on their trail.

562
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:15,853
- Wait a minute.
- Unless...

563
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:19,106
It ends with Morris.

564
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,817
- What?
- No further questions,

565
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:24,486
rhetorical or otherwise.

566
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:32,077
Oh, sorry, did you have
more questions of him?

567
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:35,038
Yes, as a matter of fact.

568
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:36,999
No, we're fine.

569
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:40,294
- Carry on.
- Paige, what are you doing?

570
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:44,006
Unfortunately for us, ending
the stream of deaths

571
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:47,467
with Morris only solves
our problem with the past

572
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:50,596
and does absolutely
nothing to protect us

573
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:54,224
against our future problems.
So how much longer

574
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:57,436
can we afford to tempt the gods
of fate

575
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,855
with the recklessness
of the Charmed Ones?

576
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:01,857
And at what point
does that day finally come

577
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:05,110
when it's just simply too
late to clean up

578
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:07,112
after one of their
little magical messes?

579
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,573
And then all of magic

580
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,493
is exposed to the world
forever because of them.

581
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:16,538
And that, that's the question
you're going to have to answer

582
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:19,666
because I rest my case.

583
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:22,794
Gideon?

584
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,588
Nothing further.

585
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,885
We will return with the verdict.

586
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:36,975
Okay, this better be good.

587
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:39,061
Leo?

588
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:42,564
Hey, you guys are speaking now.

589
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:45,526
Let's not make a big
deal about it, okay?

590
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:48,946
- Fine, what did you find out?
- That phantasm you vanquished,

591
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:51,490
- Barbas sent it so you'd follow it.
- Yeah, apparently

592
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:54,159
he gets a get-out-of-hell-free
card, too, if he wins the case.

593
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:56,995
- I knew this was a setup.
- But we can't prove it

594
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:59,081
so we've tried to find
another but we can't...

595
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,209
If it's anywhere, it has to be
inside Inspector Sheridan.

596
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:05,838
It's the only way Barbas knew she'd be
in the right place at the right time.

597
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:10,050
Okay, go get her.
Bring her back here, hurry.

598
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:22,020
Piper, what are you doing here?
How'd you do that?

599
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,731
It's why they call it Magic School.
Come on,

600
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,817
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- What?

601
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:30,154
- Right now, let's go.
- What do you mean, just leave?

602
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:31,530
That's the idea.

603
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:34,158
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

604
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:36,743
We'll figure it out,
we'll fix it later.

605
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:40,372
No, Piper.

606
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:41,999
I can't.

607
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:44,209
What if you can't fix this?

608
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:45,711
What am I supposed to do then?

609
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:47,838
Run? Hide?

610
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:49,673
That's not right.

611
00:34:49,882 --> 00:34:51,550
I'm no fugitive.

612
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:53,218
I'm a cop.

613
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:00,184
- How did I get here?
- Piper, what are you doing here?

614
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,685
- I don't know.
- Well,

615
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:03,103
why don't you go back? Go.

616
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:04,563
She can't.

617
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:08,567
We have brought
her to hear the judgment.

618
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:11,612
Since it impacts all of you.

619
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,197
This doesn't look good.

620
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:14,448
Where the hell is Leo?

621
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:17,159
As to whether or not
the Charmed Ones shall be allowed

622
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:19,453
to continue to practice magic,

623
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,288
the judgment is

624
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,791
in favour of the sisters.

625
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:27,544
But against the lieutenant.

626
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:31,048
The trail of exposure
must end with him.

627
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:36,553
I'm afraid it's time.

628
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,263
No, no, no.

629
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,349
- No, please, please, no.
- Baby, baby, baby.

630
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,768
No, no.

631
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:51,902
Let's go.

632
00:35:58,116 --> 00:36:00,160
You have got to be
kidding me, right?

633
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:01,954
I mean, you can't
really be doing this.

634
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,623
Phoebe, they have already.

635
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:08,460
Look, he doesn't care about
protecting magic. All he cares about

636
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:11,004
is himself and getting
out of purgatory.

637
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:13,882
So not only did he set us up,
but he set you up too.

638
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:17,302
Always trying to blame
somebody else, aren't you?

639
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,680
- You son of a...
- Listen, you have to stop this,

640
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:22,933
do you understand? They haven't
taken your powers. But they still can.

641
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:24,518
Then let them.

642
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:27,563
If this is the thanks that we
get for all of our good work,

643
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:30,816
if this is the way the system works,
then you can keep our stupid powers.

644
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:33,485
- Paige.
- No, she's right.

645
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:36,155
If Darryl dies, that's it,
we're done. We quit.

646
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:40,200
You know, that would solve any
of our future exposure issues,

647
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:41,660
now, wouldn't it?

648
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:44,163
You'd have us erase
your memories?

649
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:46,206
Change all that you know?

650
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:48,000
All that you are?

651
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,751
If necessary.

652
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:52,963
Very well.

653
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:12,941
Get off of me.

654
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:15,444
What is this?

655
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,196
Where, where am I?

656
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:20,324
- That's a nice act, it's very convincing.
- Objection.

657
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:23,911
You cannot bring a mortal
down here, it is outrageous.

658
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,829
Sit down and shut up.

659
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,333
What is the meaning of this?

660
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,626
Watch.

661
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,787
- What now?
- I'm surrounded by idiots.

662
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:26,890
Guess there's some
cleaning up to do there.

663
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:29,977
What do you have to say
for yourself, Barbas?

664
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:33,981
I'm a demon, what do you expect?

665
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:37,985
Based on the evidence, I beg you to
reverse the decision before it's too late.

666
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:49,997
Darryl?

667
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,171
Did you forget we were
gonna go out tonight?

668
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:19,401
It is done.

669
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:22,404
And as for you, Barbas...

670
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:24,990
No, wait, wait, wait.

671
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:27,910
Now, just because

672
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:31,163
I'm the one that set this whole thing
up does not necessarily mean

673
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,623
that I am not right.

674
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:36,460
The Charmed Ones
are reckless with magic.

675
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,504
- Oh, please.
- You've seen it, I've seen it,

676
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,840
we've all seen it time after time
and it doesn't even

677
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:46,011
include what got them into this
whole mess in the first place.

678
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,680
I think that would be you.

679
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:52,643
No, Phoebe, that would be you.

680
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:55,979
With your ongoing zeal
to force your premonitions

681
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:59,233
to short-circuit the process,

682
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:02,486
take the easy way and for what?

683
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:07,741
Each and every time it was
for personal gain.

684
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:13,288
I don't know,
but just seems to me like

685
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:16,375
it's for selfish behaviour like that,

686
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:20,587
there's got to be some
consequences or, well,

687
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:22,756
what's the point?

688
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:34,142
Phoebe will be stripped
of her powers.

689
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:37,145
- What?
- Just your active powers.

690
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:40,691
- Empathy, premonitions.
- Levitation.

691
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:43,777
You can earn them back.

692
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:48,198
But only if you're more careful
with your powers.

693
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:52,035
If you're all more careful.

694
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:55,998
You can't just say that and leave.

695
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:59,459
- Gideon, get them back here now.
- No. It's okay.

696
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:02,087
I mean,
it might be kind of refreshing

697
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:05,340
to not rely on my powers
so much anymore, you know.

698
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:08,969
Besides, they're not the only ones
that think I've been misusing them.

699
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:12,556
Are you sure?

700
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:16,435
Yeah. Let's get out of here.

701
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:27,613
Looks like I did just enough
to win the case.

702
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:29,323
You know what that means?

703
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:34,286
That means I'm back.

704
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,586
I know, counsellor.

705
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,589
I know.

706
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:50,219
You're afraid.

707
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:56,183
And your greatest fear is that
somehow they're going to find out

708
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,228
that you're the one
that's after Piper's son.

709
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:01,688
But don't be worried.

710
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,817
I won't tell anyone.
I promise.

711
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:08,487
Nary a soul.
