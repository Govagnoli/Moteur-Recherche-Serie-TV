1
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,812
Dennis, what are you doing here?

2
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,815
I work here, remember?

3
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,735
No, I know. I mean,
what are you doing here so early?

4
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,905
Piper called.
Wanted me to set up for the band.

5
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,199
Piper called?
From where, the doctor's?

6
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,243
I don't know. Maybe.

7
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,040
Is something wrong? Is she okay?

8
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,836
Yeah, it's just a regular check-up
for the baby. I'm sure everything's fine.

9
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,715
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- Sure.

10
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,052
You know Piper pretty well, don't you?
I mean, you guys seem close.

11
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,470
Yeah, real close.

12
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,806
What's the deal
with the ex of hers, Leo?

13
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,475
You know, I mean,
dude gets her pregnant, right?

14
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:02,729
Then, what, just skips town on her?
I mean, what's up with that?

15
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,147
It's a long story.

16
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,568
As far as I'm concerned,

17
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,486
she deserves a hell of a lot better.

18
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,864
Couldn't agree with you more.

19
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,499
Are you hormonal
or just plain crazy?

20
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,794
One woman can only take so much.

21
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:29,882
If these people walk out of their offices,
what do you think they're gonna see?

22
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,635
Well, I think they won't be touching my
stomach anymore, that's want I think.

23
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,763
Piper, that is not a good enough
reason to freeze people.

24
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,849
I think it is.

25
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,062
It's okay, it's okay. We all just get
a little vertigo sometimes.

26
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:50,444
No wonder Chris grows up
to be such a neurotic little freak.

27
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,448
- So you excited?
- About what?

28
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,201
About what the doctor said.
That it's gonna be a healthy baby.

29
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:02,080
Well, I know he's healthy.
I've seen him 22 and walking around.

30
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,957
You never know.
Something could happen.

31
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,793
Don't be such a worrywart.
Now you're starting to sound like...

32
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,047
- Hey.
...Chris.

33
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:13,258
If this is about demons, I don't wanna
hear, because I'm on my lunch break.

34
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,261
No, no, no. I was just wondering
how it went with the doctor.

35
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,389
Well, you'll be happy to know
that you're a boy.

36
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,143
- That's not what I meant.
- I don't see it.

37
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,980
- Oh, see. It's this little thing right here.
- Excuse me.

38
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,482
Do you mind?

39
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,408
Why are you so edgy anyway?
Relax.

40
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,954
Well, it's not me in there
I was thinking about, it's you.

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,539
I'm just making sure you're okay.

42
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,791
This is where he asks for money
to go to the movies.

43
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,086
Very funny. Actually, in the future
you're the one I go to for money.

44
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,839
- Oh, why? Am I rich?
- I can't tell you that.

45
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,967
What about me? I'm your mother.
Why don't you come to me for money?

46
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,553
I don't want to bother you.
You have too much to deal with.

47
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,179
What about your dad?

48
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,473
Leo's not much of a factor.

49
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,017
- What does that mean?
- I'd rather not talk about it.

50
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,646
- Future consequences?
- More like future issues.

51
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,606
Father-son problems.

52
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,733
I have an idea.
Let's change the subject.

53
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,944
To what?

54
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,946
Demons.

55
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,323
Extinguisher.

56
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,426
You guys okay?

57
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,636
I don't know, am I?

58
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,600
Am I?

59
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,352
I don't know.

60
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:33,792
So I'm okay, right?
I mean, mini-me in there?

61
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,922
Well, if he wasn't, I think you'd be
the first to know. Now, sit still.

62
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,757
Then why were you
so worried back there?

63
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,467
I wasn't worried.

64
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,972
All right, I was a little worried
about the force field.

65
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,433
- What force field?
- The one she had

66
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,685
when she was pregnant with Wyatt.

67
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,813
Wait. You had a force field with Wyatt
but not with me?

68
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:58,609
Well, I didn't have one, he had one.
It was all his doing.

69
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,612
From the womb?
He had powers from the womb?

70
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,282
Unbelievable. It's not like I don't have
an inferiority complex with him already.

71
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,327
- Thank you.
- Did you find that demon yet?

72
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,329
Yes, actually I did.

73
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,122
It's the Spider Demon.

74
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:17,377
"An evil creature that emerges from
its hidden lair every hundred years

75
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,714
to capture and feed off the most
powerful magical being it can detect."

76
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,841
- In this case, that would be you.
- And me.

77
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,304
- Sort of.
- You must be so proud.

78
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:29,723
It's kind of creepy how she knew
to lay a trap for you.

79
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,934
Obviously, she didn't
count on us being there.

80
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,394
Well, at least there's
a vanquishing potion here.

81
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,314
Let's make this eight-legged freak
wish she'd never been hatched.

82
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,734
Whoa, hold it. You are not going
anywhere, Mom. This is way too risky.

83
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,695
He's actually right.
Without the Wyatt force-field thing...

84
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,156
Okay, do you have to keep
rubbing that in?

85
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,825
Aren't there any therapists
in the future?

86
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,410
We need Phoebe.

87
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,955
No, I don't want to interrupt
her date with Mark.

88
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,665
Actually, it's Mike this week.

89
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,209
No, it's Mitch. But who cares?
We need her.

90
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,504
Ever since she had that vision thing
in Magic School, you know,

91
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:04,758
the one about a demon-free life
and her being with child,

92
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,760
she's been on
that whole future thing.

93
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,680
And she wishes to accomplish that
by speed dating?

94
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,223
I don't know.

95
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:15,060
So does the Book say anything
about that spider being poisonous?

96
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,916
Miss me?

97
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:42,087
I was hoping that you would
let me die in peace.

98
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:46,717
I'm sorry. I was raised to never
leave any food on my plate.

99
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,844
Please. Have mercy.

100
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,596
Oh, don't worry.

101
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,515
There's not much of you
left to dine on anyway.

102
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:59,771
My misery will soon be over,
but I suspect yours is just beginning.

103
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,318
- How so?
- You've come back empty-handed.

104
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,904
- You will starve.
- Hardly.

105
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,909
I've already found my next meal.
A powerful witch. A Charmed One.

106
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,579
A Charmed One?
I have heard of their coming.

107
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,333
Really? Must be more powerful
than I thought.

108
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,668
Hope my eyes aren't too big
for my stomach.

109
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,670
You will never trap one.

110
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,005
But I already have.

111
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,424
I have infected her whitelighter.

112
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,092
Soon he'll be my ally.

113
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:34,723
As for you, my little wizard,
it's been a pleasure.

114
00:08:58,831 --> 00:08:59,957
Gentle, please.

115
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,126
Oh, quit your complaining.
I'm almost done.

116
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,213
Paige, could you call the club
and tell them I'm gonna be a little late?

117
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,466
I thought we already discussed this.
You're not going without a force field.

118
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,344
Why, because it's so much
safer here? I have to go to work.

119
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,888
- I booked a band tonight.
- Let Paige cover for you.

120
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,058
No, I can't. I have to get back
to my temp job. I'm already late.

121
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,852
Blow it off. This is more important.

122
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:23,814
My temp jobs are important. That's how
people who need help find me.

123
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,693
Okay, I get that, I do. But right now
your sister needs your help, okay?

124
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,695
- Why don't we just call Leo?
- No. No.

125
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:32,739
Why not? He can help us.
Besides, Piper's in danger,

126
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,243
which means the baby's in danger,
which means you are in danger.

127
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,579
- Because we don't need him.
- Yeah, he's right.

128
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,414
I don't wanna open up
that can of worms.

129
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,416
He doesn't even know
you're pregnant.

130
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,501
This is my point exactly.

131
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,712
Look, I'm not suggesting
some sort of reunion...

132
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,881
He has been gone for six months.

133
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,634
If he's not there for us in the future,
why is he there for us now?

134
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,222
Hey, you okay?

135
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,766
Yeah, I just need
to sit down for a minute.

136
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,853
Okay, well, I'll go deal with the club.

137
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,274
You work on the vanquishing potion
and call Phoebe and I when it's done.

138
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,153
I'll clean up.

139
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,721
Hi, I'm supposed
to be meeting someone.

140
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,556
- Right over there.
- Thanks.

141
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,559
So sorry. Sorry.

142
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,895
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

143
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:50,067
Thanks. Last time I ride BART
for a while.

144
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,568
The train, not the guy.

145
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,696
Right. Right.

146
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,741
Well, you look...
You look amazing, Phoebe.

147
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,077
Oh, that's really sweet,
Mike, thanks.

148
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,413
- Mitch.
- Mitch.

149
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,624
Mitch, right. Of course.

150
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:10,003
I'm sorry. I knew that, you know,
it's just I think I'm a little nervous.

151
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,131
You nervous? That's hard to believe.

152
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,009
Yeah, well, we both have a lot
at stake here, don't you think?

153
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,595
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we do.

154
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,305
We don't wanna waste any time.

155
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:24,142
I think we're both over the serial-dating
thing, the loveless-sex thing.

156
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,229
- We are?
- Don't you just want a family?

157
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:29,940
Kids?

158
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,110
L... I don't know.

159
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,195
I hadn't really thought about it,
to be honest.

160
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,040
Yeah, nothing. All right, so it was
great seeing you. You take care.

161
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,625
But, Phoebe, l...

162
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,294
Chris, hey.

163
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,588
Oh, my God, you're sweating.
What happened to your neck?

164
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,631
Piper was attacked by a demon.

165
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,676
We need you back at the house
to help with the vanquishing potion.

166
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,344
Okay.

167
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,138
Take care, Mark.

168
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,515
Mitch.

169
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,525
Chris, you coming or what?

170
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,861
Yeah.

171
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,703
- Hello.
- You didn't show up today.

172
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,998
Hi, yeah. I meant to call,
I really did.

173
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,126
I just got a little hung up at...
At work.

174
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,504
What do you mean? Don't you care
about these temp jobs?

175
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,047
No... Yes, of course.

176
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:38,425
- The temp jobs are important to me.
- Excuse me, Miss Matthews?

177
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,385
Hate to bother you, love, but...

178
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,054
Now is not a good time, okay?

179
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,473
You're telling me.

180
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,350
I'm supposed to be a leprechaun.

181
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,229
The bar's not open yet.
Why don't you try down the street.

182
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,897
You don't understand.

183
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:55,526
The Wicked Witch of the Enchanted
Forest put a dastardly curse on me.

184
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,156
I know you helped Shamus.

185
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:07,079
Let me call you back.
You knew Shamus?

186
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,455
He was me brother.

187
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:13,252
Course, all leprechauns are,
but the point is we were close.

188
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,587
Give me a second.

189
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:19,049
Jeremy, could you
check on the beer in the back?

190
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,260
No worries. Okay.

191
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,222
Okay. How did you find me?

192
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:30,477
I didn't, for sure. I was told
to find you at your temp jobs,

193
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,271
but you don't seem
to be there anymore.

194
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,106
Tell me about it.

195
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:36,942
And I didn't want
to bother you at home.

196
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,945
Thank you, I appreciate that. Okay.

197
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,573
What did this wicked witch
do to you?

198
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,452
Isn't it obvious? She made me...

199
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:48,996
...tall!

200
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,623
Oh, that's a problem?

201
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,252
It's just not who I am, love.

202
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,923
And more importantly, it's taken away
my power to dole out luck too.

203
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:05,262
Is there any way you could
turn me back? Please.

204
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:07,764
Okay.

205
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,225
I'm sure I can improvise something.

206
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,770
You who found me in this bar

207
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,899
Turn back to who you really are

208
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,824
God bless you, Paige.

209
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:29,536
The name is Riley,
and I'm forever in your debt.

210
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,747
Great. You're welcome,
but if you don't mind,

211
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,832
you probably should get out of here.

212
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:37,961
Not before I leave you
with a token of my appreciation.

213
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,379
Thank you.

214
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,049
Hope you get that wicked witch.

215
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,550
I'll try.

216
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,984
Okay, let's do this.
I have a future to get back to.

217
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:05,531
- Who doesn't? Did you bless this?
- Yes, I blessed it, I sang to it.

218
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:08,408
What's the matter with you?
You okay?

219
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,369
I think I'm just coming down
with something.

220
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,204
What do you mean,
from the attack?

221
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,582
Now who's the worrywart?

222
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,210
We still need Paige to bless this.
Did you call her?

223
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:21,046
Yeah, she's on her way.
She was helping me out at the club.

224
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,506
Who's watching Wyatt?

225
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,634
Sheila. He should be safe there
till after this is over.

226
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,886
Okay, well, we gotta get
a move on here,

227
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,472
because I need to find
my husband, like, yesterday.

228
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,015
Seriously.

229
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:35,060
What? I did the math. It's gonna
take me like a year to fall in love,

230
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,688
and then there's the whole
engagement and the wedding.

231
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,566
Then a year of wedded bliss.
Then I have to wait a year to find out

232
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,276
if I really wanna have his kid.

233
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,736
And then the pregnancy's
like nine months.

234
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,114
Well, ten months.
They just tell you it's nine months.

235
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,950
So clearly, let's move on here.

236
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,870
- I'm sorry, what's so funny?
- This whole family needs a shrink.

237
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,539
What...?

238
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,710
- Hey, where'd you get that?
- Don't ask.

239
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,670
You need to bless
this vanquishing potion.

240
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,463
Oh, hello to you too.

241
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,883
Hey, the Book says
for all three of you to bless it.

242
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,927
Phoebe will help you.
Piper, can I talk to you, please?

243
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,555
"Piper"? What happened to "Mom"?

244
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,557
How exactly do I bless this thing?

245
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,059
With your blood. Come on.

246
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,981
This will just hurt a little.

247
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,734
What is it?

248
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,361
What's the matter?

249
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,907
- Chris, your eyes are dilated.
- Are they?

250
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,425
Okay, we got it,
and she didn't even faint.

251
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,094
What are you doing?

252
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,609
Get it!

253
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,819
Get it.

254
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,533
Piper.

255
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,247
Oh, no.

256
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,471
Well, there's a force field that works.

257
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,640
All right, I locked Chris
in the basement.

258
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,267
What are you doing on the floor?

259
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,396
Well, I'm not having a lot of luck,

260
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,524
that's why I'm on the floor.
I've tried orbs, knives, spells.

261
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:51,280
- God, I hope Piper's okay in there.
- Don't.

262
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,409
So do you think we should
ask Chris for help?

263
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:59,329
Yeah, let's get the mutant who put
her in there in the first place to help.

264
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,166
Missy, that is our nephew.
He needs help too.

265
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:06,170
Okay, fine. How should we help?
How about Leo?

266
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,130
Are you kidding? Piper would kill us.

267
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,883
Well, then she can kill us
after she's saved.

268
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:15,012
Paige, Piper doesn't want Leo
to know that Chris is his son, okay?

269
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,055
So I don't think I could
keep that secret.

270
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,682
Try. Leo!

271
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,936
Phoebe, Paige. How are you?

272
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,606
Well, not so good.
We have a problem.

273
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,232
Perhaps we should meditate.

274
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,526
No, I don't wanna meditate.

275
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:31,361
Piper, right there.

276
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,659
The Spider Demon.

277
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,953
She cocoons her victims
before feeding on them.

278
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,498
Great, well, can you get her
out of there?

279
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:46,210
Well, the only way to get her out of
there is to vanquish the Spider Demon.

280
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:51,048
But it's okay. The cocoon is meant
for preservation, so she's safe for now.

281
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,383
Good, that means Chris is too.

282
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,969
Chris. He's... He's in there too?

283
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,555
No, he's not in there, Leo.
He's in the basement.

284
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:01,517
Yeah, he was acting a little crazy
so I locked him in the basement.

285
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,477
Yeah, after the Spider Demon
infected him.

286
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,063
Kind of went a little crazy,
went after her.

287
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,315
I'll talk to him.

288
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,276
Be careful.

289
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,737
Good thinking, yeah.

290
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,697
I'm telling you,
he has a right to know.

291
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,366
No, he doesn't.

292
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,995
Chris?

293
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,419
Chris?

294
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,923
Chris, I'd like to talk to you.
It's Leo.

295
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,475
Chris?

296
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,978
Bastard!

297
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,944
- What happened?
- He attacked me.

298
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,238
- I tried to warn you.
- He's got issues.

299
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:59,199
- Issues?
- Yeah, from being infected.

300
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,743
No, I think his issues precede that,
don't you, Paige?

301
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,704
Something you're not telling me?

302
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,205
- Actually...
- No.

303
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,375
Look, he's gonna find out
sooner or later, and I'm gonna bust.

304
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,669
- Find out what?
- If he's gonna help us,

305
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,172
- we're gonna have to tell him.
- It's Piper's business.

306
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,965
Tell me what?

307
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,178
Chris is your son.

308
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,310
Don't we all feel better?
I know I feel so much better.

309
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,654
How?

310
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:41,533
Spirit realm, six months ago,
you and Piper...

311
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,327
Leo, she's pregnant.

312
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,079
Why didn't she tell me?

313
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:50,167
Honestly, I think she knows how hard
it was for you to leave one son behind.

314
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,836
She didn't want to make it
any harder.

315
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,465
Great. Excuse me.

316
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,259
Why is he so mad at me?

317
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,887
I don't know, sweetie.

318
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:04,806
He's real tight-lipped
about the future.

319
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,392
It's a lot for you, huh?

320
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:13,607
Well, you gotta try to pull it together
because we need you.

321
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,194
Your family needs you.

322
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,071
Right.

323
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:23,700
- You're right.
- That's the spirit.

324
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,746
Well, if I remember correctly,

325
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:31,875
the Spider Demon's last victim
was a wizard.

326
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:34,586
Maybe I should go to Magic School
and see if there's something

327
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:35,921
I could use to scry for him.

328
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,756
Okay, and what about Chris?

329
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,675
Check the Book.
I think there's an antidote.

330
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,134
Okay.

331
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:44,805
Welcome home.

332
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,936
Hey, will you watch Piper?
I have to go back to the club.

333
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,145
Right now?

334
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,940
Yeah, the wicked witch
has struck again.

335
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,612
Chris?

336
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,532
Chris.

337
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:07,119
Come to me, Chris.

338
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:11,957
That's right.

339
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:14,001
Over here.

340
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:16,461
Come closer.

341
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:28,599
You are learning quickly.

342
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,393
- What did you do to me?
- I think you know.

343
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:32,853
Now bring me the cocoon.

344
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:35,856
No.

345
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,028
You can't resist it,

346
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,821
what's happening to you.

347
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,158
Don't fight it.
Embrace your new powers.

348
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:50,496
- Use them.
- I don't understand.

349
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,956
You will, my sweet.

350
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,000
All in good time.

351
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,462
All in good time.

352
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:09,515
- Who did this, the wicked witch?
- No, actually, that was me.

353
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:11,975
You? Why?

354
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,645
I couldn't let him open the club,
let those people in here.

355
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,730
Not until you turn me back
into a wood nymph.

356
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:19,358
Okay, well, who's to say
there's not more coming after you?

357
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:22,528
I cannot keep the club closed all night.
Piper will kill me.

358
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:25,572
Cry me a river, sister.
We have lives too, you know.

359
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:28,492
Without me,
nature falls out of harmony.

360
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,787
Flowers wilt, trees wither,
streams dry up. It ain't pretty.

361
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:33,872
- And this guy.
- Hi.

362
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,415
He's an ogre.

363
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:40,546
A giant, terrifying ogre. Tell me, does
he look imposing to you in the least?

364
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,257
No, not... Not so much.

365
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:46,677
- And me, I'm supposed to be a fairy.
- You see the problem.

366
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,846
The witch's curse is spreading
like wildfire.

367
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,931
Pretty soon there won't be
any magic folk left.

368
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:54,434
No offence, but you don't sound like
any of the wood nymphs I've ever met.

369
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:57,229
Oh, it's the curse, I'm telling you.
The curse.

370
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,481
All right, all right.

371
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:04,278
Paper and pen? What, are you
gonna write the witch a letter?

372
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:07,865
Hey. I don't tell you how
to save the forest. No, I don't.

373
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,200
Tell me everything you know
about the wicked witch

374
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,120
so we can get rid of her
once and for all.

375
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:33,098
Thank you. Thank you.

376
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:34,766
Thank you.

377
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:36,810
We owe you, Paige.

378
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:40,772
Yeah. Great. Now, why don't
you guys get out of here

379
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:44,860
because I know a witch who's gonna
really put a curse on me unless...

380
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:49,489
What about this one, sir?
The wizard Rathmere.

381
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:53,118
He created over 500 spells
and potions

382
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:56,079
before mysteriously
disappearing in 1904.

383
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:59,166
Sounds like the right year.
Any chance you have this wand here?

384
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,460
It should be in the collection.

385
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,296
Would you excuse us, please,
Sigmund?

386
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:06,131
Of course.

387
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:08,091
Not now.

388
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,177
Leo, this is a serious matter...

389
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:12,554
...and one that we have been over
countless times.

390
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:15,224
You abandoned the other Elders
without so much as a warning.

391
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,267
Yeah, well, something came up.

392
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:20,354
You can't just pop on down
whenever you feel the need arise.

393
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:24,942
You're not just putting yourself at risk,
you're putting all Elders at risk too.

394
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,527
I'm trying to save my son.

395
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:30,447
Wyatt? Has something
happened to him?

396
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:34,368
No, not Wyatt. To Chris.

397
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:38,372
I know, I just found out myself.
I don't have time to explain.

398
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,124
If I don't find the demon who hurt him,
I may not figure out

399
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,836
- why he hates me so much.
- Hates you.

400
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:47,089
Got it. Listen, I dropped Wyatt off
in the nursery

401
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:49,466
just to be on the safe side.
I hope that's all right.

402
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:50,676
Of course.

403
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:57,724
- Chris is his son too?
- Apparently.

404
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,101
Actually, come to think of it,

405
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:04,147
that does explain why he came all
the way from the future to save Wyatt.

406
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,066
Save him from us, you mean.

407
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:09,403
If he knew,
he wouldn't still be searching.

408
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:15,159
When the time is right,
Wyatt will be sacrificed

409
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:18,537
and the greater good
will be served.

410
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,627
- Do you need anything else?
- No, sweetie.

411
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:28,213
I just hope we're not too late.

412
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:31,842
I stopped off in the attic
on the way back.

413
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,887
I gotta tell you, Leo, whatever Chris
has against you in the future,

414
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,598
it can't be your
lack of determination.

415
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:40,851
Still, he might not be in this mess
if I hadn't been gone so long.

416
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:42,895
Well, you have to do
what you have to do.

417
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,940
My God, Leo. Can't you think
of anything but yourself?

418
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:48,775
Phoebe.

419
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:52,070
- Yeah, that was kind of weird.
- Yeah.

420
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,239
You totally bailed on us!

421
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:57,409
- What the hell?
- Okay.

422
00:26:57,576 --> 00:27:01,830
I think maybe I'm channelling
Chris' anger?

423
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:05,250
But he's in the basement.
Can you empath from so far away?

424
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,211
I don't know. Maybe my powers
are expanding?

425
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:10,088
Or he's closer than we think.

426
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:17,763
No!

427
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,274
Chris, stop. This isn't you.

428
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:31,568
Wanna bet?

429
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,988
- Chris, don't.
- He's your father.

430
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,471
Bug spray. We should have used
bug spray.

431
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:07,980
Okay, I can't break free.
Can you orb?

432
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:10,440
- No, I tried.
- Damn it.

433
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:13,068
Are Elders even allowed to swear?

434
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:16,488
No, but fathers are. Especially ones
whose kid tries to kill him.

435
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:19,825
- Well, technically, you can't die.
- That's not the point.

436
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,703
Well, it wasn't Chris, Leo,
it was a demon.

437
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:25,330
No, some of it was Chris.
I saw it in his eyes.

438
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:28,333
I think he's right.
I think that's why he can still orb.

439
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:31,211
He can be saved.

440
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:33,255
Yeah, well, can we?

441
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:36,800
Maybe with a little luck.

442
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,846
Shillelagh.

443
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,856
- Somebody called?
- Hey.

444
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:52,691
Over here.

445
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:57,613
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

446
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,407
Yeah, thanks a lot. Can you just get us
down from here, please?

447
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,997
I can try, but, as you know,
luck can go either way. Good or bad.

448
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:10,000
- You take your chances.
- Yeah, well, we'll take our chances.

449
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:12,127
Very well.

450
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:24,264
I tried to warn you, love.

451
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,857
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

452
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,526
Thanks to you
for showing me how.

453
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:41,031
- Now what?
- You've been ever so helpful.

454
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:45,285
But if you don't mind,
I prefer to dine alone.

455
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:56,922
So divine.

456
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:02,803
What's happening?

457
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:05,264
I gather you weren't
counting on this.

458
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:08,600
It's not just her magic
I'm feeding on.

459
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,479
It's her baby's too.

460
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:15,399
Yours.

461
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:24,366
I don't understand why it's not working.
Maybe I have the wrong wizard.

462
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:28,078
Or maybe because
there's nothing to find.

463
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:33,750
Leo, you gotta stop beating yourself up
over this, okay? It's not your fault.

464
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,420
I just... I don't understand
why he hates me so much.

465
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,046
Yeah, but, Leo, it's in the future.

466
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:40,215
It hasn't happened yet,
so you can change it.

467
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:43,635
If Chris lives long enough
to tell me what to change.

468
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,639
Wait. Why am I scrying
for the wizard?

469
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,850
The demon has Piper.
I should be scrying for her.

470
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:53,020
Here, use her keys.

471
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,112
- Got her.
- Okay, I'll take the antidote,

472
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,156
you take the vanquishing potion.
Paige!

473
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,658
- Piper didn't bless it.
- It's all we've got.

474
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,161
We need the power of three.
How will we make up for Piper?

475
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:12,372
Well, how about with a little help
from our friends?

476
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:21,048
- Nice catch.
- Thank you.

477
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:23,717
- So, wait, we can't get in?
- No, it's impenetrable.

478
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,803
- Great plan.
- Well, maybe we can draw her out.

479
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,013
How's that?

480
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:29,306
I could just knock.

481
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,727
Good thinking.

482
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,609
Damn it.

483
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:43,862
Can't a demon eat in peace?

484
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,043
You're pissing me off, you know?

485
00:31:58,293 --> 00:31:59,670
Yeah, that's the idea.

486
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,422
You think you can take me?

487
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:06,009
- Without your sister?
- We're just gonna have to see.

488
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:09,555
Now!

489
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:21,984
Step on her.

490
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,532
That's gross.

491
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:30,325
Sorry.

492
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,418
Give me the antidote.

493
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:41,044
No.

494
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,422
This is my responsibility.

495
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,260
Piper, are you okay?

496
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:50,262
I think so.

497
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:53,056
What...? What are you doing here?

498
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,894
It's a long story.

499
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:59,479
What's that?

500
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:05,694
Our little boy.

501
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:10,324
You gotta get out of here.

502
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:19,082
Well, hey. Welcome back.

503
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:20,792
Where's Leo?

504
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:28,342
Chris, come on. Can we just
talk about this a minute?

505
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,511
A minute?

506
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:33,180
We have the next hundred years.

507
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:47,444
- I can't get through that thing.
- You want me to try knocking again?

508
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:51,281
- I don't think that'll work this time.
- It's okay, we'll take it from here.

509
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,534
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we're positive.

510
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,160
But thanks for everything.

511
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:05,504
- I told you guys not to bring Leo here.
- I think he just saved your life.

512
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:08,173
Yeah, at his expense
and maybe Chris' too.

513
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:16,139
Well, at least we'll have plenty of time
to get to know each other. Dad.

514
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:17,933
You see, that's what
I'm talking about.

515
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,727
That's not the demon talking,
that's you talking, Chris.

516
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:22,813
It's not too late,
you just have to fight it.

517
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:24,731
Why fight when I've already won?

518
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:30,821
Tell me why you hate me
so much, Chris.

519
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:34,074
What did I do to become
such a bad dad?

520
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:37,286
- It doesn't matter anymore.
- No?

521
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:39,288
The hell it doesn't.

522
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:41,582
Deep down, you hate my guts.

523
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,919
Admit it. Come on, admit it.

524
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:48,589
What? Are you afraid?

525
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,591
- I'm not afraid of you.
- No?

526
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,718
Then why don't you tell me
what I did to you?

527
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:55,470
What, did I miss a school play?

528
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:58,223
Did I take away your favourite toy?

529
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,435
Did I play favourites with Wyatt?

530
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:09,776
Chris, don't.

531
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:11,195
You don't know me.

532
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:19,203
- Paige, you should take the antidote.
- No, no. I'm fine.

533
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,121
It didn't even break my skin.
Just hurts.

534
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:24,166
- Yeah, but still...
- No, we need to save it for Chris.

535
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,667
Paige.

536
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,920
- What's the matter?
- Kidney shot.

537
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:30,589
Maybe he's trying
to tell you something.

538
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,133
Maybe he is.

539
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:34,676
- Give me that.
- What? Why?

540
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:36,678
- So I can take it.
- What?

541
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,306
Whatever happens to little Chris
happens to big Chris.

542
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:41,558
- That's what you've been worried about.
- So?

543
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:44,686
So if I take this, the baby's inoculated
and Chris is just fine, right?

544
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:46,522
- Do you follow that?
- Not a word.

545
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:48,315
Just give it to me.

546
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,195
You don't know me.
You don't know me.

547
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:54,738
You don't know me!

548
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,211
Chris! No!

549
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:13,257
Chris! Chris, look at me.

550
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:13,507
Chris! Chris, look at me.

551
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:16,051
It's okay. It's over.

552
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:52,379
You gotta eat all your vegetables
and brush your teeth every day.

553
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:55,340
And don't forget to play a lot.

554
00:36:57,384 --> 00:37:01,263
- Are these the last of them?
- Yeah, thank you.

555
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:07,603
You're suffocating the boy.

556
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:13,192
It's just, you know...

557
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,568
Overcompensating?

558
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:17,529
No, l... I just...

559
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,739
...miss him a lot.

560
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:21,366
I know.

561
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:23,535
So you think you're gonna be
all right here?

562
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:26,705
I mean, at least until after
the baby's born?

563
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:28,457
Yeah, I think so.

564
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,460
And Gideon's right.
This is the safest place for me,

565
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,921
and that's the most
important thing, right?

566
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:37,216
- I think so.
- Besides, I'm only an orb away

567
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:38,759
if the girls need me.

568
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:42,679
No, I told them to call me first.

569
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,391
You? You're not
going back up there?

570
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:49,311
No.

571
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:51,188
My family needs me here right now.

572
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:53,982
Yes, we do.

573
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:58,862
You know, Leo,
you can get through to him.

574
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:00,489
You just can't give up.

575
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:03,325
He's just as stubborn as you are.

576
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,664
Okay, can you wave goodbye?

577
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:12,084
Okay, let's go.

578
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,090
Come on. Let's go.

579
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:34,898
Take good care of them,
Gideon, will you?

580
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,359
Absolutely.

581
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:16,523
Hi. Place is hopping, huh?

582
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,943
Yeah. Not a bad guy over there.
Is that Nick?

583
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,778
No, actually, that's Ron.

584
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:24,156
What, we skipped some letters
in the alphabet?

585
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:26,366
- Q's are hard to find.
- I hear you.

586
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,203
- Well, at least he's handsome.
- He's cute, right?

587
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,872
Okay. Have fun. Bye.

588
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:34,625
Hi.

589
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:39,630
Okay. Drinks on the house.

590
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:40,839
All right.

591
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:44,051
God bless you, love.

592
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,429
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

593
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:21,213
Can we talk?

594
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,090
There is nothing to talk about.

595
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:25,759
I think there is.

596
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:28,345
Quite a bit, actually.

597
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:30,222
It doesn't matter.

598
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,932
It does to me, Chris.

599
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:34,309
You're my son.

600
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:38,438
I think I deserve to know what I did
that's so bad.

601
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:42,901
You were never there for me.

602
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,655
You were there for everybody else.

603
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:48,615
For Mom...

604
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:52,119
...Wyatt, half the world.

605
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:53,829
But you were never there for me.

606
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:57,958
You didn't have the time.

607
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:01,336
So...

608
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:04,506
...maybe you came back
from the future not just to save Wyatt.

609
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,427
Maybe you came back
to save us too.

610
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,472
I doubt it.
