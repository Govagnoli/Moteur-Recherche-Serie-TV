1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,032
- Honey.
- Piper.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,878
Piper, come on, it's time.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,190
Can you wake up? Can you do this?
You can do it, come on.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,920
- Maybe we should call Leo.
- No, we can still make this plan work.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,068
Seems almost anticlimactic
after all this time, doesn't it?

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,196
Say hello to Prue for me.

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,320
Piper, now! Now!

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,916
Crystals! Circle!

9
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,793
Well?

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,598
What did you see?

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,638
I saw...

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,508
...your demise.

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,513
My demise? That cannot be.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,230
You know how powerful
my visions are.

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,550
More so even
than the Oracle's were,

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,358
and more accurate.

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,839
You mean to tell me that
with all the powers at my disposal,

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,349
all I've learned about them,

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,715
in the end I still lose?

20
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,632
How is that possible?

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,475
The Charmed Ones' power
must simply be greater than yours.

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,190
I mean no disrespect.

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,749
I only speak of what I see.

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,595
Then the only way to change
what you see is to obtain more power.

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,756
The ultimate power.

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,714
But that's forbidden.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,468
The Hollow has been
banished for all eternity.

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,790
If you unleash it,

29
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,632
we all could die.

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,109
If I don't prevail,
what difference does it make?

31
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,749
- There must be another way.
- No!

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,673
With The Hollow,

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,671
I will render the witches powerless.

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,197
Then I will destroy them,

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,439
even if it means destroying us all.

36
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,588
Do I need to think about this now?

37
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,154
- Yes.
- Why?

38
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,390
Because The Source
has already killed one of us.

39
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,552
And if, God forbid, it happens again,
we want to be prepared.

40
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,392
You should be honoured
that if we don't make it,

41
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,438
- we're leaving you everything.
- Hey, guys! Guess what?

42
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,953
What makes you think
I'll outlive you?

43
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,111
Leo, you're an angel, literally.

44
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,238
Which means, short of a darklighter,
you win "Most Likely to Survive."

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,468
Speaking of surviving.
Source bulletin, this just in.

46
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,993
Honey, just sign the freaking thing.

47
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,914
What?

48
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,559
Phoebe has something
she'd like to say

49
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,119
that might affect
what you're doing.

50
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,352
Thank you, honey. We nailed
the Source-vanquishing spell.

51
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,150
Our ancestors,
that's what we were missing.

52
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,515
If we could draw the magic
from the entire Halliwell line...

53
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,195
We might have enough power
to vanquish The Source.

54
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,715
- Yes.
- This is good, this might work.

55
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,872
- I'll go tell the Elders.
- Hey! You did not sign this!

56
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,679
Oh, honey, are you still on that
last-will-and-testament kick?

57
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,478
I gotta tell you, it's very, very morbid.

58
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,315
No, it's very, very responsible.
Prue did it, and thank God she did,

59
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,755
because if she didn't,
we'd still be dealing with lawyers.

60
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,991
- No offence.
- Oh, none taken.

61
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,718
I've come to terms with my evil past.

62
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,190
I know what you're saying, but I have
a really good feeling about this.

63
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,069
Okay? No one is gonna die
any time soon.

64
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,670
- You all right?
- Yeah.

65
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,998
I just have the hiccups. See?

66
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,470
Piper, can I talk to you
for a minute in the kitchen?

67
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,999
Sure.

68
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,829
Phoebe, with or without
The Source, I still need a will,

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,831
especially if I'm ever
gonna start a family.

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,194
This isn't about a will.

71
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,591
This is about a premonition I just had
that I don't want Cole to know about.

72
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,315
What do you mean? Why not?

73
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,471
Because I just saw him
jump in front of a demon

74
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,676
to take a fireball for me,
that's why not.

75
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,398
A demon? What kind of demon?

76
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,034
One with a half a face.

77
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,189
- Yuck!
- Yeah.

78
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,793
So we have to figure out
who the demon is

79
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,349
- and vanquish him before Cole--
- What if we need Cole to lD him?

80
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,955
I mean, The Source
probably sent this demon.

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,839
That's exactly my point. He's gonna
wanna stay close to protect me.

82
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,629
Well, honey, that's what you do
for people you love.

83
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,917
I know, but Piper, he's human now.
It's not like he could fend off a fireball.

84
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,675
- Well, can't you talk to him?
- No, I've tried.

85
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,115
He's not gonna sit by the sidelines,
it's not who he is.

86
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,029
So you're not gonna tell him?

87
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,193
The attack happened in the attic.
So I'll just keep him out of the house,

88
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,717
until we could lD the demon.

89
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,796
All right, it's your relationship,
it's your call.

90
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,157
I'll let Paige know what's up
as long as you're sure.

91
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,878
Trust me, I'm sure.

92
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,669
The judge just wants
to hear the truth, that's all.

93
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,751
Everything is gonna be okay.

94
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,315
Yeah, but once he hears about
all the awful things I've done...

95
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,277
"Done," as in past tense.

96
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,271
My past is why I lost custody
of my son in the first place.

97
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,079
We're not gonna pretend that
you weren't in an abusive relationship,

98
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,673
or that you didn't go to rehab.

99
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,796
It's just that I've made
so many mistakes.

100
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,710
Oh, honey, look...

101
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,477
Your ex is out of your life, okay?

102
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,478
You've been clean and sober
for two years now,

103
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,200
and you've held down a steady job,
at a police station no less.

104
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,717
That you've changed.
That's all that matters.

105
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,750
The judge just cares
about who you are,

106
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,909
not about who you were.

107
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,993
And that's what's gonna help you
get your son back.

108
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,553
Excuse me.

109
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,229
Not a good time, I'm in the middle
of something important.

110
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,989
Does a half-face demon
qualify as important?

111
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,559
- He's there now?
- No.

112
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,552
Well, then, no, that doesn't qualify.

113
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,195
Phoebe had a premonition,
and not a good one.

114
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,669
I know why I'm whispering.
Why are you?

115
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,196
So it keeps making this, like...noise.

116
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,635
But it's not even your car.

117
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,156
No, but I don't want Piper
to be driving it and have it break down.

118
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,719
If you could take it to the mechanic

119
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,711
and have him look at it,
that would be great.

120
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,871
Phoebe, that thing
you were talking about?

121
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,519
A day thing or a night thing?

122
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,910
- Night.
- What thing?

123
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,750
It's nothing important.

124
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,312
There's nothing wrong
with the car, is there?

125
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,198
- No.
- But you want me to leave, don't you?

126
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,839
- Yes.
- And you don't wanna tell me why.

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,037
If you could just give us a couple
hours, and don't ask any questions.

128
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,634
Please? Please?

129
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,597
- You'll tell me later?
- I promise.

130
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,713
All right.

131
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,671
I love that man.

132
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,594
Paige, look, this could be
the attack we've been waiting for.

133
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,273
You need to come home now.

134
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,311
But Phoebe's premonition
happened at night, right?

135
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,399
- Right.
- Okay.

136
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,790
Well, you know how long
I've been working with Carolyn.

137
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,837
I promised her I'd be
at the hearing today.

138
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,238
Okay, fine, but you need
to come home as soon as you can.

139
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,799
Okay.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,195
We're gonna meet you outside
the courthouse at 3, right?

141
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,634
Yeah.

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,194
Paige, is everything all right?

143
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,514
Peachy. All you have to do
is relax and by tonight,

144
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,874
your son is gonna be with you.

145
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,916
God, I don't know
what I'd do without you.

146
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,479
You're my angel.

147
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,911
Make a damned move.

148
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,959
You're just mad
because good is winning.

149
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,273
No, just bored standing here,
watching you think.

150
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,512
Patience is a virtue.

151
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,910
Oh, I have been plenty patient.

152
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,440
Three thousand,
five hundred years patient.

153
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,398
There. Happy now?

154
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,231
Now who's winning?

155
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,033
You need to leave immediately.
This place is an ancient burial ground.

156
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,555
I know that, thank you.

157
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,632
With all due respect,

158
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,468
you're not allowed to be here.

159
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,438
Have you forgotten who I am?

160
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,312
Whose side you're on?

161
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,152
There are no sides.

162
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,993
We protect all magic,
that was the agreement.

163
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,510
The agreement's just been revoked.

164
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,599
Die!

165
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,314
Please,

166
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,232
The Hollow is a threat to us all.

167
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,111
Its power is too great.

168
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,872
That's exactly the kind of power

169
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,672
I need.

170
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,396
No! Please don't!

171
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,198
The Hollow consumes powers!

172
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,710
Now you will be able
to consume powers...

173
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,035
...and give them to me.

174
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,796
So we found
a demon with half a body,

175
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,349
but no demon with half a face.

176
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,398
Well, we do have a resident
demonologist living in the house.

177
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,710
Yeah, we've had that conversation.

178
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,555
All right, you keep looking,
I'll go get some coffee.

179
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,789
Piper!

180
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,039
Piper, blow him up.

181
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,475
Thank you.

182
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,074
Phoebe, did you see that?

183
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,028
Phoebe?

184
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,913
Phoebe!

185
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,595
What's taking so long?

186
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,990
She almost died,
that's what's taking so long.

187
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,232
Easy, easy.

188
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,637
What happened?

189
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,751
One very mean demon.

190
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,593
Did you get him?

191
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,150
Yes, but something else got away.

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,989
And that's not all.

193
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,829
Throw this. Just do it.

194
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,472
My powers are gone.

195
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,675
It stole your powers?

196
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,150
Stole, ate, absorbed, I don't know.

197
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,153
The only thing I do know
is that I gotta get them back.

198
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,833
I don't understand.

199
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,276
We vanquish a demon and then lose
our powers? How does that work?

200
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,317
That thing must have absorbed
her power somehow,

201
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,549
although I don't know how.

202
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,030
Well, with The Source
lurking around...

203
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,990
That's him. This is him.

204
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,152
"Guardians of The Hollow"?

205
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,590
- Ring any bells?
- That's not possible.

206
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,549
Why not? What is it?

207
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,075
The Hollow is something that
consumes all magic, good or evil.

208
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,879
And both sides agreed to guard it.
That thing must have been The Hollow.

209
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,359
It must have taken over the demon.

210
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,999
Then how do we get it
to regurgitate?

211
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,509
There is no mention
of a vanquish here.

212
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,079
You can't vanquish it.

213
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,798
The last time it was unleashed,

214
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,918
it nearly decimated all magic,
all things.

215
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,308
The last time it was unleashed?

216
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,754
Eons ago.

217
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,037
Good and evil had to join forces
and use their strongest magic,

218
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,952
and even then,
all they could do was contain it.

219
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,153
Okay, so if good and evil

220
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,356
are seeing eye to eye
on this one, who let it out?

221
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,949
The Source.

222
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,679
If he was desperate enough.

223
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,550
Which means he won't stop

224
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,918
at just my powers, he's gonna send
another demon for yours and Paige's.

225
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,515
The demon with a half a face,
see if he's in the Book.

226
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,070
Even if she could use your powers,
you wouldn't be able to

227
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,629
- because he'd just steal them.
- Then how do we stop him?

228
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,072
We'll use potions instead.

229
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,550
I'll make one to replicate
my exploding power.

230
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,428
Okay, you better get Paige.
You're gonna need the power of three.

231
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,795
I'll go check with the Elders.

232
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,191
On a scale from one to bad...

233
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,311
This is very bad.

234
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,797
Something must have
happened to her.

235
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,235
She seemed pretty shaky
this morning. You don't think she--

236
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,152
No. No way.

237
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,435
She wouldn't sabotage this,

238
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,511
not when she's come so close
to getting her son back.

239
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,552
Yeah, well, I believe you,
but will the judge?

240
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,591
God, I hope her ex didn't find her.

241
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,719
Carolyn?

242
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,878
Oh, hey, Phoebe.
Look, I'm gonna need more time--

243
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,116
Okay, I'm on my way.

244
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,395
- I gotta go.
- You can't just leave.

245
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,391
You're the reason
why she's getting a second chance.

246
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,993
Well, now it's up to you.

247
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,277
I have to go,
it's a demonic emergency.

248
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,271
A big one.

249
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,949
Okay. What do you need me to do?

250
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,350
I need you to postpone the hearing
for a couple hours.

251
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,035
You know better than that.

252
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,792
You can't just postpone
legal proceedings.

253
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,996
- There are forms to file, lawyers--
- Please, Darryl,

254
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,515
can you please pull some strings
and buy us some time?

255
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,477
If we don't help her,
there is no one who will.

256
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,395
Okay. I'll try.

257
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,553
Thanks. Just keep paging her,
trying her at home.

258
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,870
We have got to find her.

259
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,600
Here you go. One owl feather.

260
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,079
Do you think I jinxed us
with the will?

261
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,637
Maybe it wasn't such a great idea.

262
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,359
Actually, I'm beginning to think
it was a very smart idea.

263
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,797
- That's not so funny.
- Trust me, I know.

264
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,718
Hi.

265
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,230
Am I back too soon?

266
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,918
We need his help.
No time to be evasive.

267
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,311
Help for what?

268
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,791
It's obvious you're making a potion,
so, what is it you're not telling me?

269
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,477
I had a premonition.

270
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,315
A demon attacked, and you jumped
in front of a fireball to save me.

271
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,515
What?

272
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,198
You can't keep
these things from me.

273
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,112
I was just trying to protect you.

274
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,111
Well, that's not
a good enough reason.

275
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,834
I hate to interrupt, but maybe
we should talk about the demon.

276
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,555
What did he look like?

277
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,952
A creepy half-face,

278
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,756
and his good side
had tribal markings.

279
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,157
- A little bit like--
- Belthazor.

280
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,553
A little bit.

281
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,517
Do you know who he is?
Does he work for The Source?

282
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,994
He doesn't work for The Source,
Phoebe, he is The Source.

283
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,509
His face was disfigured in the battle
that brought him to power.

284
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,159
Only upper-level demons
have seen him.

285
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,152
You should have told me.

286
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,958
So he's the one
that released The Hollow.

287
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,551
The Hollow?
What do you mean, released?

288
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,109
It already attacked us.
It took Piper's power.

289
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,516
Then you'd better figure out
a way to beat The Source

290
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,193
without your powers, otherwise...

291
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,475
Already on it.

292
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,510
The witch's powers are impressive.

293
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,715
Nevertheless,

294
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,397
do you think it wise to have
extracted them from The Hollow?

295
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,557
There could be repercussions.

296
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,869
Damn the repercussions, Seer!

297
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,756
I won't stop until I have
all three of their powers

298
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,275
coursing through my veins.
You understand me?

299
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,113
I can't risk
going against them myself

300
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,151
until I do.

301
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,353
No one wins
while The Hollow roams free.

302
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,394
I control The Hollow.

303
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,479
For now.

304
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,150
But the more magic it absorbs,
the stronger it becomes.

305
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,031
And the more you extract from it,
the more it corrupts you,

306
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,192
until it consumes all things,
including you!

307
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,271
Unless you want to face eternity
as a pile of ash,

308
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,274
I suggest you stop questioning me
and do as I say!

309
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,834
How can I be of service?

310
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,751
I want the Charmed Ones,
darklighter.

311
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,552
But my arrows don't kill witches.

312
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,315
But they do kill whitelighters.

313
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,348
I want you to kill theirs...

314
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,679
...so he can't heal them anymore.

315
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,468
And when you've done that...

316
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,470
...then I want you
to bring me a little gift.

317
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,072
Five magic crystals,
oriented east to west.

318
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,999
Magic circle, check.

319
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,671
Oh, purple good.
Purple equals exploding power.

320
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,829
Exploding power, check.

321
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,669
One fabulously written
Source-vanquishing spell, check.

322
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,718
- Don't get cocky.
- Not cocky. Confident.

323
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,871
We are talking about
the source of all evil,

324
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,235
maybe measured optimism is best.

325
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,078
The Source unleashed The Hollow.

326
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,152
Already on that train, honey.
It took my powers. Anything else?

327
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,675
Good and evil magic
need to join forces

328
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,035
and read the inscription on the box
where The Hollow is kept.

329
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,119
That will put it back in its crypt
and return your powers.

330
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,512
Okay, so at least we know
how to banish it. This is good news.

331
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,318
Good news if The Source
brings the box

332
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,198
and we can find an evil
being willing to help.

333
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,759
Hey, Cole,
too bad you're not still evil.

334
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,228
Well, one step at a time.

335
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,515
First we vanquish The Source,

336
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,069
then we'll worry about putting
Pandora back in its box.

337
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,799
Hello? Hey, Darryl.

338
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,678
Oh, no.

339
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,718
Are you sure she's gonna be okay?

340
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,596
Yeah, the ER doctor said
there was no internal bleeding.

341
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,673
But she still got beat up pretty bad.

342
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,273
Damn it! How did he find her?

343
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,032
I have no idea.

344
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,634
I've got every available officer
out there looking for him.

345
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,515
What about the hearing?

346
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,591
I got it postponed
for an hour from now,

347
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,955
but I doubt we're gonna
find him by then.

348
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,117
Look, Paige, with her history,
this doesn't look good.

349
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,789
We need you in the kitchen.

350
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,876
You know, Leo,
I have my charges too.

351
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,912
Leo!

352
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,436
- Crossbow!
- No! Your powers!

353
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,989
- Leo?
- Paige, watch out!

354
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,519
Baby?

355
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,431
Paige, hold his hand.

356
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,113
Okay. It's through. Easy, easy, easy.

357
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,796
Paige, don't touch that,
you're a whitelighter too.

358
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,479
Just lay back. Easy. You're okay.
Just lay back. Easy.

359
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,198
Still bossing me around, huh?

360
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,439
You better believe it.

361
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,790
I don't understand.
How come you can heal us

362
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,234
but you can't heal yourself?

363
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,912
Just doesn't work that way.

364
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,798
Hey, I bet you could switch
powers with Phoebe

365
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,109
- like we did before...
- No!

366
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,839
If The Source comes and Phoebe
doesn't have her powers...

367
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,751
...you don't stand a chance.

368
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,272
I mean it. I'm still your whitelighter.

369
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,556
Well, who's bossing whom
around now?

370
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,909
Paige, go tell Phoebe
to find something else.

371
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,514
A potion, an amulet, a spell,

372
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,477
whatever. Go!

373
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,949
It'll never work.

374
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,035
Will anything?

375
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,114
I don't know.

376
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,717
So, what, we're all just gonna die?

377
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,633
You can't think that way.

378
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,271
Why not? Isn't that what
we're all thinking anyway?

379
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,671
We'll figure out a way out of this.

380
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,509
How?

381
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,877
The Source knew we'd be prepared,
that's why he came after our powers.

382
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,553
The Source knew
we had an in-house healer,

383
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,914
that's why he came after Leo.

384
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,630
He knows what we're gonna do
before we even do.

385
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,198
Well, it's not over yet.

386
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,318
I still have my power.

387
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,877
Great. Two down...

388
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,277
One to go.

389
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,313
What is it?

390
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,952
What do you see?

391
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,239
Tell me.

392
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,834
I see nothing.

393
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,199
What do you mean?

394
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,833
Do I or do I not have the power
to defeat the witches?

395
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,391
You misunderstand.

396
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,757
I see nothing.

397
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,352
No magic...

398
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,518
...no life...

399
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,239
...no world.

400
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,189
The Hollow will consume everything,
just as I warned.

401
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,270
Then if there's no future, I have
no further need for you, do l, Seer?

402
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,954
Please, I beg you,

403
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,712
find another way.

404
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,235
Put The Hollow back
where it belongs.

405
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,152
Not until I've finished.

406
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,231
Not until I've killed them all.

407
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,113
But that's madness.

408
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,191
The Hollow won't let you stop there.

409
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,679
Then so be it!

410
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,635
Forgive me.

411
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,475
I serve you as always.

412
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,711
Even until the end.

413
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,716
Guard The Hollow.

414
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,994
I have one more demon to recruit.

415
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,510
One more power to obtain.

416
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,915
Leo?

417
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,234
Hey.

418
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,189
Hey.

419
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,074
Drink this.

420
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,194
Guess you picked
the wrong beneficiary after all.

421
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,399
Don't talk like that.

422
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,269
Piper...

423
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,559
...you need to get out of here
before he comes back.

424
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,635
I'm not leaving you.

425
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,354
The Source...

426
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,715
Is not gonna scare me away.

427
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,279
And neither are you.

428
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,032
So just forget about it.

429
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,391
You're not gonna die.

430
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,271
Because I'm not gonna let you.

431
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,757
I'm just looking for my potion book.
Have you seen it anywhere?

432
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,757
I didn't think you could save Leo
with a potion.

433
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,150
Well, it's not just to save Leo.
It's to save us all.

434
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,392
Oh, yeah? How?

435
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,877
I don't know,
but I have to do something.

436
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,314
I can't just sit around and...

437
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,915
What's that?

438
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,551
- This?
- Yeah.

439
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,992
Just a little something I've been waiting
for the right moment to give you.

440
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,469
It's not your Grams',
but hopefully it's not cursed.

441
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,956
I don't think now is the time.

442
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,395
Actually, I think now
is the perfect time.

443
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,515
This way, no matter what happens,

444
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,156
you'll always know that I love you.

445
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,834
It's beautiful.

446
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,948
Now you have to go.

447
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,991
No, I'm staying here with you.

448
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,756
Do you want me
to watch you die too?

449
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,478
If that's what it takes
to save you, yeah.

450
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,438
No, but I'm supposed to save you.
That's why I got that premonition.

451
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,513
Not necessarily.

452
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,240
You know as well as I do you're not
meant to stop every premonition.

453
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,915
Some are just meant to prepare you
for what's to come.

454
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,873
I'll be right there.

455
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,917
Paige, this is no time for guests.

456
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,672
It's not social, I called Darryl.

457
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,432
Darryl? You're supposed
to be helping Phoebe.

458
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,194
She doesn't need my help,
but there is somebody who does.

459
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,918
Excuse me.

460
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,149
Oh, Carolyn.

461
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,398
I'm so sorry, Paige. After everything
you've done to help me...

462
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,276
It's not over. Not yet.

463
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,908
Paige.

464
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,117
Darryl, take Carolyn
into the sunroom.

465
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,312
- Is everything okay?
- No.

466
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,192
Yes.

467
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,274
Are you out of your mind?

468
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,908
We don't have time for
other people's problems right now.

469
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,358
It's something I've got to do.
Especially if it's the last thing I do.

470
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,310
- Hey, what's going on?
- I don't have time to explain.

471
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,750
I think I can still help you
get your son back.

472
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,916
But how? The judge will take
one look at me and--

473
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,069
No.

474
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,039
I think I can help.

475
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,393
I just need you
to turn away from me.

476
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,312
Please, just trust me.

477
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,318
Hey. Hey.

478
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,953
You're gonna use magic?

479
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,709
Yes, I am.

480
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,677
Let the object of objection
Become but a dream

481
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,718
As I cause the seen
To be unseen

482
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,990
Okay, Carolyn,
you can turn around now.

483
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,034
What?

484
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,474
What happened?

485
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,269
Just a second, Carolyn.

486
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,877
Look, I've known you guys
long enough to know

487
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,510
that you don't do something like this
unless something is seriously wrong.

488
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,348
What's going on?

489
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,633
Just get downtown,

490
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,234
and make the judge see
the real Carolyn.

491
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,198
And make sure that slimebag ex
of hers gets put away.

492
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,834
Please?

493
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,554
Just go.

494
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,238
Piper?

495
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,951
We may have a plan
to get your powers back.

496
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,678
Then maybe Paige
could help heal Leo.

497
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,914
A spell?

498
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,116
Remember the one to call
for a witch's powers?

499
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,953
Maybe it might be strong enough

500
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,838
to call the powers from The Hollow.

501
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,468
- Could that work?
- It has to.

502
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,594
- Could you watch Leo?
- Sure.

503
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,032
Don't be afraid.

504
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,838
Who are you? Where am l?

505
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,152
Back in your once and future life...

506
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,912
... Belthazor.

507
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,998
Belthazor?

508
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,273
Seer.

509
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,276
Even now I can see the void
where your demon half used to exist.

510
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,558
It craves to be complete again.

511
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,870
How did you know I was still alive?

512
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,678
I had a vision.

513
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,630
One where you and l
do great things together.

514
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,270
I don't work with evil anymore.

515
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,551
You might reconsider,

516
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,870
if you hope to save
your precious witch.

517
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,918
Only you and I can help her
defeat The Source.

518
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,432
I'm listening.

519
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,436
If you take in The Hollow,

520
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,879
you can absorb The Source's power
when he attacks.

521
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,633
Once powerless,
they can vanquish him.

522
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,318
And what happens to me after?

523
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,429
The witches and I will banish
The Hollow back to its crypt.

524
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,876
You will return to normal.

525
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,192
How do I know this isn't just one
of The Source's tricks?

526
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,952
Or one of yours, for that matter?

527
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,395
The Source has been corrupted
by The Hollow,

528
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,073
and he's going to destroy us all.

529
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,435
He cannot be allowed to continue
with this path of madness.

530
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,159
And if I do this...

531
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,119
...what do you see then?

532
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,559
A future...

533
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,111
...for both sides.

534
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,395
Is this the great thing
you saw us doing together?

535
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,995
Perhaps.

536
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,755
However, you won't ever know
unless The Source is stopped first.

537
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,989
It's your only chance
to save your love.

538
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,233
The power of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies

539
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,073
Come to us who call you near
Come to us and settle here

540
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,875
Oh, my God!

541
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,959
Not quite.

542
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,433
Run!

543
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,078
How do we call for our powers?

544
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,471
I have your powers now.

545
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,718
And a few of my own.

546
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,593
Piper!

547
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,953
Hurry, he's coming!

548
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,275
Come on, honey.
We need you, Piper, it's time.

549
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,839
Come on, you can do it.

550
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,115
Do what? We have no powers.

551
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,271
It doesn't matter,
we can still make the plan work.

552
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,475
Get the crystals.

553
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,639
Seems almost anticlimactic
after all this time, doesn't it?

554
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,715
Piper.

555
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,234
Say hello to Prue for me.

556
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,989
Phoebe!

557
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,675
Your power was always the weakest.
Hardly worth taking.

558
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,957
Your life, however, is!

559
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,679
Paige, now!

560
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,113
Got him!

561
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,272
Crystal.

562
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,755
Now the moment
we've all been waiting for.

563
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,198
Belthazor!

564
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,793
No.

565
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,159
The Hollow.

566
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,039
Hurry, the spell!

567
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,238
Prudence, Patricia
Penelope, Melinda

568
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,277
Ashley, Helena, Laura and Grace

569
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,237
Halliwell witches
Stand strong beside us

570
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,437
Vanquish this evil
From time and space

571
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,670
No! No!

572
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,949
No!

573
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,993
Who are you?

574
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,313
Someone who just helped
save your lives.

575
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,673
Quickly, take my hand!

576
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,348
Trust her if you want
your powers back.

577
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,755
Say the inscription with me.

578
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,039
I can't do it, nothing's happening.

579
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,193
Hold his hand.

580
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,399
Let his power to heal
flow through you.

581
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,478
Paige. Phoebe.

582
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,993
I did it. It worked.

583
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,599
Leo?

584
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,915
All is as it should be again.

585
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,832
Time to return to my side.

586
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,711
Too bad Belthazor's gone, he would
have made a great new Source.

587
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,108
Too bad.

588
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,232
I don't know who you are,

589
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,630
but whoever you are, we thank you.

590
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,833
Oh, I didn't do this for your future.

591
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,718
I did it for mine.

592
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,349
I don't understand.

593
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,988
If we got our powers back,
where did The Source's go?

594
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,991
Into the void.

595
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,836
Okay, who was that?

596
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,311
A very evil person.

597
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,835
Yeah, one that saved our lives

598
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,877
and helped us kill The Source.

599
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,755
All right, here you go. Enjoy.

600
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,270
Here you go, guys. On the house.

601
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,876
- Oh, easy for you to say.
- Yeah, well, we deserve to celebrate.

602
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,476
Yeah, I still can't believe it. You guys
actually vanquished The Source.

603
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,348
So, what does that mean?
Is our destiny fulfilled?

604
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,638
I don't know, but at least
that part of the nightmare is over.

605
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,599
For Prue.

606
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,159
For Prue.

607
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,717
What do you say we go home
and get started on our future?

608
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,950
What do you say
we go home and sleep,

609
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,634
and we work on that future
tomorrow night?

610
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,875
Hi, honey. Are you okay?

611
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,628
Yeah. Yeah, why?

612
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,438
Well, it just took you a while
to get back.

613
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,393
It did?

614
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,628
You know, facing death has
kind of made me wanna face life.

615
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,234
And I'll tell you what,
there's a piece of life over there

616
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,039
that I think I'm gonna go talk to.

617
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,192
You go get him, girl.

618
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,755
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm just a little tired.

619
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,078
Too tired to celebrate?

620
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,594
You are my soon-to-be husband.

621
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,752
And you're also my hero.

622
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,348
Oh, I'm nobody's hero.
