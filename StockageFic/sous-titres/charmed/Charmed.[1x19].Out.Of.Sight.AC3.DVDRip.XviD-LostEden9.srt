1
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,551
So, what are you so afraid of?

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,261
I'm not afraid.

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,306
I'm not. I'm just not sure.

4
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,266
- Not sure of what?
- Josh.

5
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,853
- He wants to have the talk with Piper.
- What talk?

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,608
Three dates, no sex. There could only
be one talk he's talking about. The talk.

7
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,693
Safe sex, prior partners.

8
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,280
- Standard dating protocol.
- And sex equals relationship.

9
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,240
And you're not sure
you wanna be a couple.

10
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,910
Well, it's not that I don't like him.

11
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,495
Then what's wrong with
being a couple?

12
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:41,875
Well, I thought Leo and I were a couple.
And then we coupled, and he took off.

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,378
Well, men seem to have a different
definition of coupling than women do.

14
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,465
I do not think that's why Leo left.

15
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,010
- Hey, Prue.
- Hey, Dee. How are you?

16
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,137
- Hey, how's the party going?
- Great.

17
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,098
We're playing Squish the Squash,
and nobody's been able to catch me.

18
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,727
- Is the cake ready?
- Yeah, give us about five minutes.

19
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,646
Awesome. Hey, guys,
five minutes until the cake.

20
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,482
Thanks for doing all this, Piper.

21
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,650
I never would've
been able to afford...

22
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,653
Oh, hey, what are friends for?
Besides, it's worth it

23
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,573
- just to see the look on David's face.
- He's such a great kid.

24
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:15,950
Yeah, I know.

25
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,996
So much for my Saturday off.
That was Claire.

26
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:24,334
Something at the auction house needs
to be appraised, so I gotta go. Sorry.

27
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,877
- Bye.
- Bye.

28
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,920
Bye.

29
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,674
- There's no cheating.
- Be quiet.

30
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,259
You cheated. That's not fair.

31
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,344
I'll get it.

32
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:52,111
Help!

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,197
Let go of me.

34
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,365
- Help!
- David, no.

35
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:12,006
No! Help!

36
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,050
Leave me alone.

37
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:15,760
Help.

38
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,971
Let go of me.

39
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,848
Help me.

40
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,018
Help. Let go.

41
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:25,728
Help!

42
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:30,024
Let go of me.

43
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:25,096
- What did you tell him?
- I saw a creature

44
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:28,266
- with whirling eyes take David.
- And what did he say?

45
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:30,518
What do you think he said?
He thought I was nuts.

46
00:04:30,685 --> 00:04:33,938
Yeah, well, it turns out David's
not the first one to be taken.

47
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:38,026
An inspector told me that
another boy disappeared yesterday

48
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:39,819
in the exact same spot.

49
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:42,572
A demon who steals kids.
Does it get any worse?

50
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:47,577
Yeah. Apparently it also happened
20 years ago. Same park, two kids.

51
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,581
- Did they ever find the kids?
- I don't know.

52
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:57,295
- You know, I could've saved him.
- Prue, don't go there.

53
00:04:57,712 --> 00:05:00,673
No, I was just so surprised,
and I looked down at my hand and...

54
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,342
It was the first time you channelled
it through your hands.

55
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:05,261
Give yourself a break.

56
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:08,597
- Your power's growing.
- Yeah, I just hope no one saw me.

57
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:10,141
Okay, look on the bright side.

58
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:13,227
You won't have to squint
your eyes anymore.

59
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:15,396
You were starting to get
those little lines.

60
00:05:18,232 --> 00:05:20,234
- So how's Dee doing?
- Not good.

61
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:24,405
It's frustrating not being able to tell her
who we are and how we can help.

62
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:26,824
<i>Yeah, well, the sooner we get
to the Book of Shadows,</i>

63
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:28,576
the sooner we can get
David back home.

64
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:32,663
An albino demon with whirling eyes.
Sounds like a whole chapter to me.

65
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:37,835
I forgot about the appraisal.

66
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:40,296
It's okay, just go. Phoebe
and I can look in the book,

67
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:42,464
- and we'll call if we find anything.
- You sure?

68
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:46,927
Don't you just hate cell phones?
Always out of range.

69
00:05:47,094 --> 00:05:49,138
Call me.

70
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,574
Let go of me.

71
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,534
Help!

72
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:14,204
Leave me alone.

73
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:17,541
Help!
Help me.

74
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:21,878
Let go of me!

75
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,780
I can't see.

76
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:51,533
Why can't I see?

77
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,285
Mom?

78
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,078
Mom!

79
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:00,333
Nothing.

80
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,546
- Did you look under "whirling eyes"?
- About an hour ago.

81
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:06,589
I found demons with no eyes,

82
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:09,467
demons with four eyes,
eyes that grow legs,

83
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:11,136
but no whirling eyes.

84
00:07:11,302 --> 00:07:12,762
Did you find anything?

85
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:17,142
I found some news clippings
about the kidnappings 20 years ago.

86
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:20,061
Both boys were taken
in the same place as David.

87
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:23,773
And one of them
was never seen again.

88
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:27,277
- Oh, great.
- But the other one was found.

89
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:31,406
It's right here.
His name was Brent Miller.

90
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:35,827
Look, honey, I know you're upset,
but that's not gonna help you.

91
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:40,540
It's not for me, it's for Dee.
I'm taking her a care package.

92
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:43,292
- Keep reading.
- "Brent Miller was discovered

93
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:46,087
two days after he was taken,
roaming the streets.

94
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:48,548
He was fine except...

95
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:50,633
...he'd gone blind."

96
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,218
- Blind?
- Yeah.

97
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:56,055
He claimed that some storm-drain
monsters stole his eyesight. Of course,

98
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:58,975
the authorities believed
he had just caught a parasite.

99
00:08:00,184 --> 00:08:02,520
We can't tell Dee
that her son might be blinded.

100
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:06,065
Well, maybe if I could find
this Brent Miller guy on the Web,

101
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:08,859
he might know something
that could help us.

102
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:14,240
- I hope you're right.
- Piper, we're gonna find David.

103
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:30,673
- Prue Halliwell?
- Yes?

104
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,926
<i>Hi, Eric Lohman,
Bay Weekly. Alternative press.</i>

105
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:36,637
- Maybe you heard of us?
- Sorry.

106
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:38,764
No? Well, you will.

107
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:41,475
I was hoping you could help me
with a story I'm working on.

108
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:45,437
- On the auction business?
- No, actually on magic.

109
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:48,524
- Magic? Why would you come to me?
- I don't know.

110
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:51,610
Maybe because I saw you
levitate two people in the park

111
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:53,904
with just a wave of your hand.

112
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,949
I take that as a "no comment."

113
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:02,246
So, what are you, anyway?
Some kind of a David Copperfield,

114
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:04,206
Lance Burton?

115
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:07,918
- A freak of nature?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

116
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:09,962
Look, Prue. Your friends
call you Prue, right?

117
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,588
I would like for you to leave.

118
00:09:11,755 --> 00:09:13,382
Well, tough. Get over it.

119
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:15,259
I had my police sources
check you out.

120
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:17,344
It's interesting how your name
keeps popping up

121
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:19,596
in all these unsolved
murder cases, don't you think?

122
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:22,307
- What's that have to do with anything?
- Maybe nothing.

123
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:25,602
But if I wrote an article on it,
it might look like something.

124
00:09:27,354 --> 00:09:30,107
- Your boss subscribe to my paper?
- Don't threaten me.

125
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:34,695
What are you gonna do? Are you
gonna make me fly into a wall?

126
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:36,822
Come on.

127
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:44,996
How clumsy of me.

128
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,919
Bet that took a lot of self-control, huh?
Not to use your powers.

129
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:53,088
You're a real credit
to your profession.

130
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:55,006
You know, that kid saw
what I saw too.

131
00:09:55,173 --> 00:09:57,592
Cops get him, he's all
the corroborating evidence I need.

132
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:00,845
- Security.
- Prue, be smart. Work with me.

133
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:04,015
I'm gonna break this story one way
or the other. And when I do,

134
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:06,142
I can either make you
sound like Wonder Woman

135
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:09,062
or the devil incarnate. Okay?

136
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:10,939
Think about it.

137
00:10:23,284 --> 00:10:24,702
Mr Miller will be in shortly.

138
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,456
Wow, what a great view.

139
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:33,044
- You can smell the ocean.
- And hear the traffic.

140
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,798
- Brent Miller?
- That's what they tell me.

141
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:40,343
- Hi, I'm Phoebe Halliwell.
- Phoebe,

142
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,679
allow me to introduce you
to Helmeth.

143
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:45,640
He's beautiful. So is this place.

144
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:48,059
Well, didn't think a blind guy
could live so well, huh?

145
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:50,687
Oh, no. No, that's not
what I meant at all.

146
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:54,649
I know you didn't. No, I design
software for the visually impaired.

147
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:58,653
Life has been good to me.
So how can I help you, Phoebe?

148
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:02,573
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you about...

149
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:06,786
...when you were kidnapped
as a child.

150
00:11:06,953 --> 00:11:08,788
I'm sorry. I'm not...

151
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:11,123
I'm not very comfortable
talking about that.

152
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,209
I understand.
But I read a lot about it...

153
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,378
I said, I'm not interested
in talking about it.

154
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:19,507
- Okay, but this just isn't for me...
- I said, no!

155
00:11:19,674 --> 00:11:22,385
Is everything all right, Mr Miller?

156
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:26,972
Yes. Lucy, please just show
this lady to the front door.

157
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:28,891
Miss.

158
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:33,104
No, you know what? I'm not leaving.
It's happening again.

159
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:36,190
In the last 24 hours,
two little boys were kidnapped

160
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:38,901
from the same park that you were.

161
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:41,529
Maybe by the same
monsters that took you.

162
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:48,911
It's all right, Lucy.

163
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:58,963
You believe my story
about the monsters?

164
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:00,881
- Yes, I do.
- Why,

165
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,425
- when everyone has always laughed?
- Maybe it's because

166
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:07,179
I've seen my share of monsters,
and I haven't told anybody about them

167
00:12:07,388 --> 00:12:10,349
because I didn't want them
to laugh at me either.

168
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:14,645
Mr Miller, I know that you wouldn't
want what happened to you

169
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:17,481
to happen to these two little boys.

170
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:19,733
Please.

171
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:29,326
There were two of them.
I mean, terrifying creatures, really.

172
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,119
They...

173
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:35,040
...dragged me into a storm drain,
to a junction of some kind.

174
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:39,711
They held me down. I remember
blue sparks hitting my face.

175
00:12:39,878 --> 00:12:41,588
My eyes felt like they were on fire.

176
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:45,342
And that was
the last thing I ever saw.

177
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:48,678
Why do you think
they took your eyesight?

178
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:51,181
I don't know.

179
00:12:51,348 --> 00:12:55,852
But I remember them saying
something about auras.

180
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:13,953
Thanks again for the tickets.

181
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:07,840
Auras, auras. I know
I saw something in here.

182
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:11,219
Here it is, auras. Grimlocks.

183
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:13,888
"Underground demons
who roam from city to city,

184
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:15,681
killing powerful forces of good

185
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,975
by seeing the unique auras
that surround them."

186
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:22,146
"Which they're able to do by stealing
the sight of innocent children."

187
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:24,941
So they're like hit men
for the dark side.

188
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:30,279
"The stolen eyesight will last 24 hours,
but only if the children are alive."

189
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:34,325
Which means we have less
than 14 hours. "To destroy a Grimlock,

190
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:38,621
- gather Schisandra root..."
- Piper? Phoebe?

191
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,503
- I know that look.
- What's wrong?

192
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:48,047
A reporter saw me
use my powers at the park

193
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:50,424
and is threatening to write
an article about it.

194
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,468
- What?
- Does he have any proof?

195
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:55,179
- Just what he saw.
- So it's your word against his.

196
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:59,475
The difference is, his word is delivered
to a half million homes each week.

197
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:02,895
Everything happens for a reason.
Maybe it's time to let the world know.

198
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:05,981
Piper, being outed would only
make our lives worse.

199
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,734
We don't know that. At least
I could tell Dee what we're doing

200
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,986
- and give her some hope.
- No, Prue's right.

201
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:14,364
If we're exposed, we're gonna have
every crazy hounding us day and night.

202
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:16,617
Not to mention the media circus
on our front lawn.

203
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:18,702
<i>- Remember E. T.?
- We can't worry about that.</i>

204
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:21,038
We have to find those boys.
I'm gonna go and see Josh

205
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:24,082
and see if he has a map
or something of the storm drains.

206
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:27,669
- Storm drains?
- It's where these demons live.

207
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:30,964
Well, there's gotta be at least
100 miles of storm drains in the city.

208
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:34,009
I'll talk to Brent and see if he can
remember where they took him.

209
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:35,802
Brent?

210
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:38,555
<i>Prue, the Book of Shadows said
the only way to kill a Grimlock</i>

211
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:41,350
is to blind it with a potion
made from Schisandra root.

212
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:43,060
- Can you find some?
- Yeah, I'll try,

213
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:45,437
as long as that reporter
isn't following me.

214
00:15:45,604 --> 00:15:47,731
Okay, be back soon.

215
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:52,944
Hey, what if Josh
wants to have the talk?

216
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:55,363
I'll tell him I have a headache.

217
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:57,866
All right.

218
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:05,707
Anything on the night sheet?

219
00:16:05,874 --> 00:16:08,376
Medical examiner.
Thank you. Sent this over.

220
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:10,253
It's Jerry Cartwright.

221
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,713
A saint.

222
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,215
Donated millions to the
city's anti-drug program.

223
00:16:14,382 --> 00:16:17,260
- M.E.'s saying he was murdered?
- Unless we tell him otherwise.

224
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:19,387
He's listing the c.o.d.
As a strangulation.

225
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:22,182
Problem is, the man died
in the middle of a crowd of people

226
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:25,060
and nobody saw anyone
lay a hand on him.

227
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:26,644
Inspector Trudeau?

228
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:30,774
<i>Eric Lohman, Bay Weekly.</i>

229
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,817
He's all yours.

230
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:35,862
I know who you are.
What do you want?

231
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:39,157
Cup of coffee would be great.

232
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:44,329
Okay. What do you say I pick
your brain about Prue Halliwell?

233
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:46,206
Name ring a bell?

234
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:47,916
It should.

235
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:50,710
Her name keeps popping up
in a lot of your murder cases.

236
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,588
A lot of the unsolved ones.

237
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,799
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah, I got my sources.

238
00:16:57,342 --> 00:17:00,345
Cops love to talk, especially
if you pay them enough.

239
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:02,889
Get the hell out of here.

240
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:07,518
So I assume you know all about
Prue's unusual powers, right?

241
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:10,146
Boy, that stopped you cold.

242
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:13,649
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah, right. That's what she said too.

243
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:16,110
You two rehearse
your stories or what?

244
00:17:16,277 --> 00:17:18,905
I saw her in action
in the park, Trudeau.

245
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:22,617
She waved her hands and magically
suspended the David Hatcher kid

246
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:24,994
and his kidnapper in midair.

247
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,537
It was...

248
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:30,333
It was very cool.
I just wish I had my camera.

249
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,335
Care to comment?

250
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,046
No.

251
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,883
Okay, I'll just change my story
to a police cover-up instead.

252
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,052
- I'm not covering up anything.
- Really?

253
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,430
Great, then I guess you've got
nothing to worry about.

254
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:48,434
Just remember, I gave you
a chance to work with me.

255
00:17:52,146 --> 00:17:53,898
That's right.

256
00:17:57,193 --> 00:18:00,446
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

257
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,240
You're gonna have to handle
the M.E. case on your own.

258
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:05,951
Why? Where are you going?

259
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,038
I'm assigning myself
to the kidnappings.

260
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:18,005
Why exactly do you need this?

261
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:23,427
A client at Quake is thinking
of throwing an underground rave

262
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,722
- and we might cater it.
- A party in a storm drain?

263
00:18:27,097 --> 00:18:30,601
Yeah, he runs a
Roto-Rooter-type company.

264
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:32,352
It's kind of a theme thing.

265
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:34,938
Yeah. Well, sounds dank.

266
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:40,527
Yeah. Look, anyway, as long
as you're here, can we talk?

267
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:45,282
- Maybe later. I have to go.
- No, Piper. It cannot wait.

268
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:47,117
Somebody's a little anxious, huh?

269
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:50,620
This is important. It could
affect the rest of my life.

270
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:54,541
Well, not if we take precautions.

271
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:58,044
- What?
- I'm not saying I'm ready for that.

272
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:00,714
Because, in fact,
I'm not ready for that.

273
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:02,799
But when I am ready for that,
I'm just saying

274
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:05,343
I will be taking precautions.

275
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,889
Piper, what are you talking about?

276
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:12,726
Having sex.

277
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:20,609
You're not talking
about that, are you?

278
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:22,652
What are you talking about?

279
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:25,405
- My leaving.
- Leaving?

280
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:27,615
Yeah, I got offered a job
down in Beverly Hills.

281
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:31,369
I mean, it's not exactly my dream job,
but it's a good opportunity.

282
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:35,248
Look, my point is,
if I thought we had a future...

283
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:38,752
Josh, this is all just happening
a little too fast.

284
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,338
Yeah. I know, I know,
and I'm sorry. But like it or not,

285
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:44,090
you are the swing vote.

286
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:47,468
Now, if you don't
want me to go, I won't.

287
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:57,562
Okay, we need to talk about this.

288
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,939
If I ask you to stay,
then we're a couple.

289
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:02,066
And I'm not sure
if I'm ready to be a couple.

290
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,901
But if I tell you to leave,

291
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:05,528
and we could've been
a good couple,

292
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:08,322
then I'll never know if we...

293
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,283
I need more time.

294
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:13,327
I need lots and lots of time.

295
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:20,084
Hold that thought. Okay?

296
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,754
Yeah, hello.

297
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:33,055
I remember their faces.

298
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:36,267
It's like a nightmare
that never ends.

299
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:42,023
They took me into this big area.

300
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:44,316
And there were a lot of pipes.

301
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:47,528
I'm sorry. I mean,
that's really all I remember.

302
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,573
- That's okay, Brent.
- You're disappointed.

303
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:52,324
No, no. Not at all.

304
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:55,828
No. Someone that could
see your face might believe you,

305
00:20:56,036 --> 00:20:58,539
but your voice tells another story.

306
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:01,083
Gave me away, huh?

307
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,628
You have a beautiful smile, Phoebe.

308
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:07,423
- How can you tell?
- I can hear it in your voice.

309
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:10,050
I can see it in my mind.

310
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:24,106
- What's the matter, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

311
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:27,317
Brent, when they took you,

312
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:32,072
were you wearing a sweatshirt
with jeans and black high-tops?

313
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:34,366
Yeah. Yeah,
I think I was. How did you...?

314
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:36,869
And when you escaped,
were you running through water?

315
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:38,704
Yes. I remember that,
in the tunnel.

316
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:41,164
Okay, Brent,
I need you to think really hard.

317
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,167
Do you remember anything?

318
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:46,128
Anything at all about that location?

319
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:50,382
Did you hear anything
or feel anything?

320
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:54,261
All I remember is this...

321
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:59,057
...sound of this enormous
generator and...

322
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:05,564
- Maybe some cable cars.
- Cable cars?

323
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:08,692
- Yeah.
- Hey, do you have a map?

324
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:13,947
- Oh. Oh! That... That was so stupid.
- No.

325
00:22:14,114 --> 00:22:18,451
I actually do have a map
of that area. It's over here.

326
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:23,665
What are we looking for exactly?

327
00:22:23,832 --> 00:22:26,334
I don't know, a cable car
turnaround, maybe.

328
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:29,921
Or the generator that you heard
could've been a power plant.

329
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,632
Right, okay.

330
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:36,553
Here. Now.

331
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,180
See, on this map...

332
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:43,059
Okay, there are two
turnarounds on this page.

333
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:46,479
And there's a...

334
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:47,814
Right, here it is.

335
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:51,401
There's a power plant
right here on Varick.

336
00:22:51,901 --> 00:22:54,237
How can you tell?

337
00:22:54,404 --> 00:22:55,822
Well, give me your hand.

338
00:22:57,282 --> 00:23:01,494
Okay, you feel these
three horizontal bumps

339
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:04,622
followed by the two vertical.

340
00:23:04,831 --> 00:23:09,752
On this... On this map,
that's the symbol for power plant.

341
00:23:11,796 --> 00:23:13,464
I better go.

342
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:17,343
Phoebe, how did you know what I was
wearing and where I was running?

343
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,930
I mean, are you like some
kind of psychic or something?

344
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:23,057
Like...

345
00:23:23,224 --> 00:23:25,852
...only different.
- Right.

346
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:31,399
That's how you've seen all these other
monsters that you mentioned, isn't it?

347
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:35,987
Phoebe, you're a good person.

348
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:40,074
And that probably means
you have a strong aura.

349
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:44,328
Please be careful
with these monsters.

350
00:23:45,913 --> 00:23:49,166
Don't worry, I will.

351
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:06,517
Don't worry, Billy.

352
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:10,354
My mom's got a friend
who's got supernatural powers.

353
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:12,940
She'll get us out of here.

354
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:17,528
Shut up.

355
00:24:28,414 --> 00:24:30,582
Did you hear on the radio
about that philanthropist

356
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:32,626
who got mysteriously strangled?

357
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:34,920
It's gotta be the Grimlocks,
that's how they kill.

358
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:38,632
<i>We're running out of time.
We've had, like, less than three hours.</i>

359
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:42,302
<i>- Did you get the Schisandra root?
- No, but I'm leaving now to pick it.</i>

360
00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:45,347
Look, did Phoebe get anything
out of Brent Miller that might help us?

361
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:47,766
<i>- Who's Brent Miller?
- I'm not sure.</i>

362
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:49,601
<i>Prue?</i>

363
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:51,311
I gotta go.

364
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:53,105
Andy, hi.
What are you doing here?

365
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:57,109
Working on the kidnappings.
I thought we should talk.

366
00:24:57,276 --> 00:25:03,073
Yeah, well, I already told the police
everything that I know about that.

367
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,244
Not according to Eric Lohman,
you didn't. He stopped by the station.

368
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:08,703
We had an interesting chat.

369
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,706
Yeah, well, he's a reporter trying
to make a name for himself.

370
00:25:11,873 --> 00:25:16,461
- You can't believe anything he says.
- Normally, I don't. This time, I do.

371
00:25:17,295 --> 00:25:19,673
We've been down this road
too many times, Prue.

372
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,552
I know you're hiding something.
I have my suspicions about what it is,

373
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,348
but I've had to accept the fact
that you can't tell me,

374
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:30,517
or you don't wanna tell me.

375
00:25:30,684 --> 00:25:32,227
Either way,
it's not just me anymore.

376
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:34,813
Lohman's onto you,
or at least he thinks he is.

377
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,399
And he's not gonna let go.

378
00:25:39,317 --> 00:25:42,946
Prue, if you don't level with me,
I can't help you control this.

379
00:25:43,113 --> 00:25:48,284
Andy, I'm just never sure if it's better
for you to know or not to know.

380
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:55,333
I remember a time when we could
tell each other anything.

381
00:25:58,336 --> 00:26:01,172
There's nothing Lohman
won't do to get this story.

382
00:26:01,714 --> 00:26:03,758
Watch your back.

383
00:26:05,593 --> 00:26:07,637
Andy.

384
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:11,391
Thanks.

385
00:26:27,824 --> 00:26:29,742
Bingo.

386
00:26:52,264 --> 00:26:55,267
- Did you get it?
- Yep, I got it.

387
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:56,936
What's wrong?

388
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:59,480
Andy stopped by my office
after Lohman stopped by his.

389
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:01,273
I think he told Andy
about my powers.

390
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:04,610
- What did you do?
- Same as I always do,

391
00:27:04,777 --> 00:27:08,572
I danced around the truth.
It just doesn't feel right anymore.

392
00:27:10,324 --> 00:27:11,784
Oh, my God.

393
00:27:16,121 --> 00:27:17,998
Where is the mother?

394
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:20,501
Oh, thank God.

395
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:23,587
Wait a second. Since when did
the Johnsons get a baby?

396
00:27:23,796 --> 00:27:27,675
That damn reporter. Look.

397
00:27:27,883 --> 00:27:31,720
- Okay, confused.
- That's Lohman. This is a setup.

398
00:27:31,887 --> 00:27:35,891
We need to get back to where we were
before everything unfreezes. Go.

399
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:41,605
Don't forget to put
your hands up. Okay.

400
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:49,947
Don't look, just go inside.
Inside. Go, go.

401
00:28:20,894 --> 00:28:23,772
Purse on right shoulder,
purse on left shoulder.

402
00:28:28,235 --> 00:28:30,111
Purse on right shoulder.

403
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:32,989
Purse on left shoulder.

404
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:35,742
What do you know.
She has another power.

405
00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:37,786
Gotcha.

406
00:28:40,497 --> 00:28:42,415
Gotcha.

407
00:29:00,725 --> 00:29:04,437
- Is he still out there?
- Unfortunately.

408
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:08,233
Hey, you guys, I think I found
the entrance to the storm drain.

409
00:29:08,858 --> 00:29:10,985
- What's going on?
- Didn't you see that guy

410
00:29:11,152 --> 00:29:12,779
- parked out front in his car?
- Yes.

411
00:29:12,946 --> 00:29:14,989
Yeah, well, that's the reporter
I told you about.

412
00:29:15,156 --> 00:29:17,033
- He's staking us out.
- What?

413
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,619
He tricked us into using our powers
and nearly caught us.

414
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:22,080
But fortunately, we figured out
what he was doing

415
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:24,999
- before he could get any proof.
- Oh, thank God.

416
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,460
The only problem is,
how are we gonna be out looking

417
00:29:27,627 --> 00:29:31,547
when he's camped outside?
We have less than two hours.

418
00:29:39,388 --> 00:29:41,182
Hey, how's it going?

419
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:44,268
Mind if I use your bathroom?
Don't bother using

420
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:47,355
your magical powers on me.
I already hid the videotape.

421
00:29:47,563 --> 00:29:49,565
- What videotape?
- Yeah.

422
00:29:49,732 --> 00:29:53,527
You know, best I can guess
is somehow one of you stopped time

423
00:29:53,945 --> 00:29:55,363
or rewound it, I don't know.

424
00:29:55,571 --> 00:29:58,324
But, what I do know
is I've got the whole thing on tape.

425
00:29:58,532 --> 00:29:59,992
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

426
00:30:00,201 --> 00:30:02,703
How do you explain your
sister's purse magically jumping

427
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,999
from her right shoulder
to her left shoulder instantaneously?

428
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:10,044
You screwed up, and I got the proof.

429
00:30:11,003 --> 00:30:12,546
Okay, now, here's the deal.

430
00:30:12,713 --> 00:30:14,548
I already got my story ready to print.

431
00:30:14,715 --> 00:30:18,427
But what I really want now from you
is a tell-all exclusive.

432
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:21,889
All right? I'll write the book,
we can share in the movie rights,

433
00:30:22,097 --> 00:30:24,183
- foreign sales, distribution...
- Get out.

434
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:26,227
It'd be a good thing.

435
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:30,189
All right. Okay. I'll just wait
out front until you're ready to talk.

436
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:32,191
- What are we gonna do?
- All right, look,

437
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,570
I will stay here and finish the potions.
You guys go try and find the boys.

438
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:39,698
Buy us some time.
Keep on freezing those Grimlocks

439
00:30:39,865 --> 00:30:41,658
- until I get there.
- What about Lohman?

440
00:30:41,825 --> 00:30:45,079
Don't worry about him.
I'll stop him from following you.

441
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:50,834
Lohman,

442
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:53,670
I've been thinking
about what you said

443
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:55,297
and maybe we can work
something out.

444
00:30:55,506 --> 00:30:58,133
Yeah? Why don't I believe you?

445
00:30:58,508 --> 00:31:02,429
Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's just
your reporter instincts.

446
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:09,561
- Busted.
- Nice try.

447
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:18,403
You did that, didn't you?
I know you did that.

448
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,655
Really? Prove it.

449
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:38,173
I'm not wearing
the right shoes for this.

450
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:44,179
Okay, talk about all roads
leading to hell.

451
00:31:44,346 --> 00:31:46,514
Which way?

452
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:50,060
- Light, light.
- All right.

453
00:31:52,062 --> 00:31:56,483
Brent said he remembered
a big area with pipes.

454
00:31:57,484 --> 00:31:59,778
Oh, wait. There's a pipe juncture...

455
00:32:01,905 --> 00:32:04,115
...that way. Okay.

456
00:32:06,951 --> 00:32:11,247
So I guess this isn't a good time to ask
how it went with Josh and the talk.

457
00:32:11,414 --> 00:32:15,335
- You're right, it's not.
- Okay.

458
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:21,549
Inspector Trudeau?

459
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:25,678
- Yes, Mr Miller.
- You wanted to talk to me.

460
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:28,056
- Is it about the kidnappings?
- Maybe.

461
00:32:28,222 --> 00:32:31,768
Has a Prue Halliwell come
to talk to you by any chance?

462
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:33,394
No.

463
00:32:33,561 --> 00:32:36,522
But I have spoken
to a Phoebe Halliwell.

464
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:38,816
Really?

465
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:42,528
I think I know where she went
if that will help you.

466
00:32:48,326 --> 00:32:50,411
Who knew anything
could smell so bad.

467
00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:53,664
- Now there's a good sign.
- Meaning?

468
00:32:53,831 --> 00:32:56,751
I saw it in a vision
that I had of Brent.

469
00:33:02,923 --> 00:33:05,551
Piper! Piper!

470
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,346
Piper, are you okay?

471
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:12,850
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

472
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:16,103
Piper, I'll get help.

473
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,279
I feel like I should be cackling.

474
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:34,747
- Hello.
- Prue.

475
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:36,874
Piper's hurt. And I can't get to her.

476
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,627
- Okay, where are you?
- At the end of Varick street.

477
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:41,712
Hurry, okay?
And don't forget the potion.

478
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:44,381
I'm on my way.

479
00:33:58,228 --> 00:34:00,606
Didn't want you to leave me behind
like your sisters did.

480
00:34:01,064 --> 00:34:02,983
- Fix it now.
- Or what?

481
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,944
You gonna hurt me? Go ahead.
Just let me get you in focus.

482
00:34:06,153 --> 00:34:08,405
- Okay.
- I don't have time for this, all right.

483
00:34:08,572 --> 00:34:10,949
Piper is hurt, and
two boys' lives are at stake.

484
00:34:11,325 --> 00:34:13,243
- Do you know where they are?
- Yes.

485
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:19,166
- All right, you win.
- I win? What's my prize?

486
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:25,005
I'm a witch with magical powers.

487
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:29,384
A witch? A witch? This is great.

488
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:31,178
Great. Terrific, let's go.

489
00:34:46,526 --> 00:34:48,695
- What is he doing here?
- Making my career.

490
00:34:48,862 --> 00:34:50,405
I didn't have a choice.
Where's Piper?

491
00:34:50,614 --> 00:34:53,616
- She's in through this way. Come on.
- Stay here. It's too dangerous.

492
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,618
- No, no, no, I'm coming with you.
- No.

493
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,288
There are too many lives at stake,
including my sister's.

494
00:34:58,455 --> 00:35:01,499
I will not have you risking them.
Stay. You'll get your story.

495
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:03,626
Okay, all right. I'll just wait out here.

496
00:35:11,551 --> 00:35:14,345
Phoebe, is that you?

497
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:21,060
Phoebe.

498
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,483
Prue!

499
00:35:34,324 --> 00:35:36,451
Nice.

500
00:36:01,976 --> 00:36:04,186
This is Eric Lohman, reporting live.

501
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:07,481
I'm in a storm drain underground,

502
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:10,609
following three sisters,
all of them witches,

503
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:14,780
as they look for children
who may have been abducted

504
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:18,075
by a strange kind of...

505
00:36:29,503 --> 00:36:31,380
Okay.

506
00:36:32,673 --> 00:36:35,509
- We've got to get you out of here.
- No, no.

507
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:38,095
Look, Piper,
just up to the street, okay?

508
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,848
Phoebe and I will
come right back for the boys.

509
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:43,684
Come on, lean on me, honey.

510
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:04,037
Don't move.

511
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,794
Andy!

512
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:21,972
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

513
00:37:25,851 --> 00:37:28,895
So, what Lohman
saw you do is true.

514
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:36,111
- Andy, what are you doing here?
- Confirming my suspicions.

515
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,196
He knows.

516
00:37:38,405 --> 00:37:39,865
A Grimlock tried to kill him.

517
00:37:40,073 --> 00:37:42,742
- What the hell is a Grimlock?
- It's a demon.

518
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,871
- A demon.
- Yeah.

519
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,456
Look, Andy, I need you to get
Piper up on the street, okay?

520
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:54,296
- No, I wanna stay. I need to help.
- You're too weak to use your powers.

521
00:37:54,462 --> 00:37:55,755
Her too?

522
00:37:55,922 --> 00:37:59,592
- Will you please get her out of here?
- Prue, I'm not leaving

523
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:02,470
- the two of you alone.
- Do I have to use my power on you?

524
00:38:03,221 --> 00:38:05,640
I'll meet you up on the street.

525
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:09,102
You'll be okay.

526
00:38:26,077 --> 00:38:29,872
Okay, we should be coming up
on a feeder drain right about now.

527
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:51,102
Great, just what we need,
more toxic waste in our sewers.

528
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:53,980
- That worked well.
- Yeah.

529
00:38:57,692 --> 00:38:59,861
David?

530
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,285
- David?
- Please help me.

531
00:39:08,452 --> 00:39:10,371
David.

532
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,708
Oh, God. Prue, I found them!

533
00:39:50,494 --> 00:39:52,579
- You okay?
- Are you okay?

534
00:39:52,746 --> 00:39:55,958
- Yeah, where's David?
- Over there.

535
00:40:05,884 --> 00:40:07,970
I can see!

536
00:40:08,762 --> 00:40:10,180
I can see you!

537
00:40:10,389 --> 00:40:13,308
I knew you had magic powers.

538
00:40:17,688 --> 00:40:19,898
Come on, get your friend.
Let's get out of here, okay?

539
00:40:28,156 --> 00:40:32,536
Exactly how did you know
the kids were down there again?

540
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:36,164
- Anonymous tip.
- What about the kidnappers?

541
00:40:36,873 --> 00:40:38,542
Kidnappers?
There weren't any kidnappers.

542
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,961
Kids followed a kitten
into the storm drain.

543
00:40:41,169 --> 00:40:42,671
- Got lost.
- Really?

544
00:40:43,171 --> 00:40:47,175
How do you explain finding Lohman
down there with a broken neck?

545
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:50,095
Must have slipped when he went
down there after them.

546
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:52,806
Anything for a story. It's too bad.

547
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:55,809
Yeah, it's a real shame.

548
00:40:58,061 --> 00:41:01,856
You don't really expect me
to believe all this, do you?

549
00:41:02,816 --> 00:41:04,484
For now.

550
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:16,079
Have they said anything?

551
00:41:16,246 --> 00:41:17,705
No, just got back
from the hospital.

552
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:20,375
But who knows what they'll say
once the police question them.

553
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:22,919
So much for our secret.

554
00:41:24,379 --> 00:41:26,214
Hey, you okay?

555
00:41:26,381 --> 00:41:29,300
Yeah, I was just thinking.

556
00:41:29,509 --> 00:41:32,387
When I was in the storm drain
I was kind of out of it

557
00:41:32,554 --> 00:41:35,598
and I kept thinking about Leo.
That's weird.

558
00:41:36,057 --> 00:41:38,893
- Maybe you miss him.
- Maybe.

559
00:41:39,102 --> 00:41:41,771
What are you gonna do
about Josh?

560
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:46,943
I'm gonna call him and tell him
I think he should take that job.

561
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:50,488
Sweetie, you can't hold out for Leo.
Who knows if he's gonna come back.

562
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:53,950
I know, he may not.
But if I'm thinking about Leo,

563
00:41:54,117 --> 00:41:56,494
then I'm definitely
not thinking about Josh.

564
00:42:00,456 --> 00:42:03,793
That's too bad,
he had really nice glutes.

565
00:42:07,296 --> 00:42:09,632
Hey, there's Brent. Hey, Brent!

566
00:42:11,926 --> 00:42:14,011
Over here.

567
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:16,806
Hi.

568
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:19,558
- Hi.
- Where's your dog?

569
00:42:20,142 --> 00:42:22,353
He's retired.

570
00:42:24,146 --> 00:42:27,441
You can see? But how did that...?

571
00:42:27,608 --> 00:42:29,860
I don't know. I mean, you tell me.

572
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:31,612
Someone must've
slayed those monsters.

573
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:36,242
- Do you know anything about it?
- Oh, I...

574
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:38,911
It's all right. I mean,

575
00:42:39,078 --> 00:42:43,207
if anyone understands the danger
of telling amazing stories, I sure do.

576
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:47,253
I was right. You do have
a beautiful smile.

577
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:51,090
- Are those the boys?
- Yeah.

578
00:42:51,257 --> 00:42:55,844
- Maybe I should have a talk with them.
- That would be so great. Thank you.

579
00:42:56,053 --> 00:42:58,097
No, thank you.

580
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,403
So now you know.

581
00:43:13,612 --> 00:43:16,657
Yeah, although it's still sinking in.

582
00:43:16,865 --> 00:43:19,243
Where do we go from here?

583
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:20,452
That's a good question.

584
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:23,539
Inspector Trudeau, is this related
to the one 20 years ago?

585
00:43:23,705 --> 00:43:26,166
Inspector,
what's your official position?

586
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:29,878
Inspector. Inspector, please.
We need to know...
