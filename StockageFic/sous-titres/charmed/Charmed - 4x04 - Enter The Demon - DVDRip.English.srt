1
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:13,967
Don't be tense. Be ready.

2
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:16,085
When you see me expand,
you contract.

3
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,757
If I contract, you expand.

4
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:38,163
If you wanted to be on top,
all you had to do was ask.

5
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:42,437
Paige.

6
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,721
What are you doing down here?

7
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:48,926
Shouldn't you be upstairs
studying for Piper's quiz?

8
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:52,201
Well, I was kind of hoping to go a
couple of rounds with the demon first.

9
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:56,368
I should tell you, Piper takes her
witchcraft quizzes very seriously.

10
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:57,723
You'd better be prepared.

11
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:00,084
- What's the subject?
- Potion basics.

12
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:04,407
- Well, you gotta start somewhere.
- I know. It's just all book learning.

13
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:07,126
Phoebe?

14
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,760
Paige, Piper and I had to learn
how to be witches the hard way.

15
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:12,766
And it took...

16
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:16,678
Well, it took too long.
We need you to get there faster.

17
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:18,965
Our lives might depend on it.

18
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:21,637
Appealing to my conscience.
Such a low blow.

19
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:26,321
I just wanna know
when the fun stuff starts.

20
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:32,277
So where were we?

21
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,202
Training.

22
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,321
Come on, Cole.
You were gone for a whole week.

23
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:41,004
That is seven long, lonely nights.

24
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,525
I was on a fact-finding mission.
We can't ignore what I learned.

25
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,005
Yeah, I know.
The Source wants us dead.

26
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:50,478
No, you don't know.
He needs you dead.

27
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:54,328
Ever since we escaped, factions
have been forming to challenge him.

28
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,049
He must finish what he started
if he expects to survive.

29
00:01:58,129 --> 00:01:59,767
Which means that you need
to be prepared.

30
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:06,997
You think The Source is gonna
challenge me to a sword fight?

31
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,758
Hand-to-hand is too safe. Sword
fighting teaches confidence, intensity.

32
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:19,718
You need to learn
how to fight like a demon.

33
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:23,120
Training must come
before everything...

34
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:25,678
...including us.

35
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:28,607
- Are you ready?
- Do I have a choice?

36
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:37,047
Yenlo.

37
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:40,919
This is how you repay my father?
After all he taught you?

38
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:43,728
- Everything he gave you?
- What did he give me, Anling?

39
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:48,002
I was supposed to replace him.
But he passed me over for you.

40
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,519
Yenlo, you took everything
you've learned from here

41
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,884
and used it for your own gain.

42
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,564
You've brought disgrace upon
yourself and our monastery.

43
00:03:58,249 --> 00:04:00,809
Now leave us and never return.

44
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:03,885
You heard my father.

45
00:04:04,649 --> 00:04:06,446
I'm gonna kill him, Anling.

46
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:07,928
And then I'm gonna kill you.

47
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:11,397
You can't stop me.
You're half the student I was.

48
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:21,441
You think this is the end?

49
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,519
We're just getting started.

50
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:27,239
Okay, after mixing your potion,

51
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:32,039
what's the best method to preserve
unused sea slugs for future use?

52
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:37,158
A, pickle them, B, sugar them,
C, smoke them, D, freeze-dry them.

53
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:39,923
Well, now you see,
if I had extra sea slugs,

54
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,081
I'd let those little suckers
go right on back into the ocean.

55
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,608
D, freeze-dry them,
is the correct answer.

56
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:49,198
- I was gonna guess that.
- Why are you guessing at all?

57
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:54,485
- To pass?
- Paige, this isn't like trig, you know.

58
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,884
It's not like you're
never gonna use it again.

59
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:59,603
If you blow a potion,
innocent people could die.

60
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:01,168
Did you study at all for this test?

61
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:03,041
Well, I started to last night.

62
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,847
It's just, a friend from work
came over

63
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:08,126
and she knew this bouncer
at this club and...

64
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:10,041
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:14,768
It's okay. I was single once.

66
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:17,079
- Why don't you study tonight--
- I can't.

67
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:20,999
I have a guy coming over here,
and we're going out.

68
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:23,239
Here? What's wrong
with your place?

69
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:26,119
This place is slightly more
impressive than mine.

70
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:31,600
Look, Paige, I really, really
wanna be the cool big sister,

71
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:34,602
but this is ridiculous.
You have no priorities.

72
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:37,642
That is not true.
I've left work to fight demons.

73
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:40,041
That's why I have to go out tonight.

74
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,006
The boss' son
is in town this weekend.

75
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,887
You think showing him a good time

76
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:45,960
is gonna improve
your career standing?

77
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,160
Well, yeah.

78
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:50,246
Okay, listen to me very carefully.

79
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:53,964
There is nothing more important
than learning your craft right now.

80
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:56,359
We could be attacked
at any moment.

81
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:57,843
Then why am I stuck here reading?

82
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,285
I should be learning how to body-slam
sweaty demons, like Phoebe.

83
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:04,005
Phoebe's been at this a lot longer
than you have.

84
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:06,564
But trust me.
Be patient and study hard,

85
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:11,245
and one day you will get
a big, sweaty demon of your own.

86
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:13,287
- Where are you going?
- Chinatown.

87
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:15,724
I need to stock up
on some of these herbs.

88
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:18,124
Can I go? I can get my nails done.

89
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:21,122
- You need to work on your potions.
- Come on.

90
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:23,763
Paige, don't make me
the wicked witch of the northwest.

91
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:27,325
I didn't ask for this big sister gig.
And, frankly, it sucks.

92
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,447
But since I'm on a roll, you should
get rid of that lollipop habit,

93
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:32,640
because it's gonna rot your teeth.

94
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,965
I think it's twisted.

95
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,443
Stand up.

96
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:51,798
I just need a time-out.

97
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,000
The Source won't give you a time-out.
Now get up.

98
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,767
I said that I can't.

99
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:57,762
Cole, what's the matter with you?

100
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:01,128
Demons worship strength,
power, nothing else.

101
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:04,082
To beat The Source, you have to
channel all your energy into strength,

102
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:05,841
including pain.

103
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:11,487
Let go of me. I can do it.

104
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:14,163
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

105
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,959
Let's go. I'm ready.

106
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:33,763
I need to stay here,
protect you from Yenlo.

107
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,568
You cannot protect me from him,
not where he's gone.

108
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,402
Only the Dragonblade
can stop him now.

109
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:43,323
Take this to Master Kwan.
He's an old friend. He'll understand.

110
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,320
But what if Yenlo finds you first?

111
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:48,680
Then you will become master,
and you'll know what to do.

112
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:52,279
Anling, I did not pass over Yenlo
because you were my daughter.

113
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:55,720
I did so because you are
the superior student.

114
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:59,401
Now hurry, before he comes back.

115
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:01,241
I'll follow you in the shadows.

116
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:02,842
Go.

117
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:17,240
Next up, some powdered toadstool.

118
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:23,008
Let's kick it up one more notch.

119
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:25,639
What are you doing?

120
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:28,158
You know.
Just preparing for The Source.

121
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:30,439
- Oh, is he coming over for dinner?
- No.

122
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:33,959
Piper's got me mixing potions.
Why, I don't know.

123
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:35,926
Phoebe gets to fight.
Phoebe gets to levitate.

124
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,602
I get to cook.

125
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:41,838
Well, you know, your sisters' active
powers took a long time to develop.

126
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,084
And...

127
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:45,962
... Phoebe's been studying
martial arts for years.

128
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:49,280
Yeah, but we're magic. We should
be able to skip over all that crap.

129
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,639
Well, there are no shortcuts.
Even with magic.

130
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:55,206
Anyway, you're half whitelighter,
which means you're half pacifist.

131
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:57,519
You may never develop
the power to fight like Phoebe.

132
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:03,119
And you might wanna check
your potion. It's bubbling over.

133
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:08,643
Just once, I'd like to know
what it's like to be Phoebe

134
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:12,245
and be able to kick
some serious ass.

135
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:40,642
- How did I get down here?
- Never drop your guard.

136
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,287
What is wrong with you, Phoebe?

137
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:55,248
What did you just call me?

138
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,644
You really took a shot
if you can't remember your name.

139
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:05,680
Oh, no. I am so screwed.

140
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:08,362
And so frosted.

141
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:10,082
- Are you okay?
- No.

142
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:12,046
I mean...

143
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:14,207
Yes.

144
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:15,968
Just wait here.

145
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:18,359
I told you, no unscheduled breaks
during training.

146
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,366
I am training. I'm doing stairs.

147
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:27,918
Oh, I don't look so good.

148
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:29,886
What's going on?

149
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:34,528
Don't worry, Phoebe. It's me, Paige.
We switched bodies.

150
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:37,483
What? What did you do?

151
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:40,437
Why do you automatically assume
it was something that I did?

152
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:43,887
- Paige!
- All right, all right, I did it.

153
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:45,801
But it was an accident, I swear.

154
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:47,925
I just wanted to know
what it was like to be you

155
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:52,645
and somehow the potion
I was working on just sort of blew up.

156
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,565
You wanted to be me?
Are you crazy?

157
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:59,446
Okay, okay.

158
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:01,167
We gotta fix this.

159
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:04,162
- What ingredients did you use?
- I'm not sure.

160
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:06,203
Just please don't tell Piper.

161
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,280
She already thinks
I'm a screwup as it is.

162
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:09,717
Hello! Paige!

163
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:12,164
We are in each other's bodies.

164
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:14,126
I think Piper is the least
of our problems.

165
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:18,323
Okay, fine, I won't tell her.

166
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,445
Now wipe that look off my face.

167
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,888
Thanks.

168
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:26,922
- God, this top is tight.
- Yeah, but it sure looks great.

169
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:30,203
So. Ready to get back at it?

170
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:32,200
- Yeah, just a minute--
- Not you. Phoebe.

171
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:37,838
Sure, sugar. Whatever you say.
Let's go work up a sweat.

172
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:41,807
Just a minute. Actually,
Phoebe has to stay with me.

173
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:45,319
She has to help me with the potion.
It blew up in my face.

174
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:47,042
Is that true?

175
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,558
Well, so let me ask you
something, Phoebe.

176
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,118
Why did you ask me to train you?
I mean,

177
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:55,557
why are we wasting our time?

178
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:57,122
You're not wasting your time, Cole.

179
00:12:57,289 --> 00:12:59,359
- Phoebe told me how much she's--
- I'm sorry, Paige.

180
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,281
This is between me and Phoebe.

181
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:04,279
If it's more important for you
to help in the kitchen

182
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:05,643
than to train for The Source,

183
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:08,039
then you don't have
what it takes to vanquish him.

184
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:11,246
Please, let me know
when that changes.

185
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:19,408
If we don't fix this soon,
I am going to perm your hair.

186
00:13:20,849 --> 00:13:22,885
Please, just listen to me.

187
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:25,961
You have no idea
how important this is to me.

188
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:28,404
- Come back later.
- If I could come back later, I would.

189
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:31,720
- But I can't. I need it now.
- That dagger is a family heirloom.

190
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:33,766
- It's not for sale.
- Excuse me?

191
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:35,044
Do you have any wormwood?

192
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,367
You don't understand.
I don't wanna buy it.

193
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:39,281
It's all right here in the note.

194
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:40,638
I don't read Chinese.

195
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,168
Wormwood?

196
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:45,797
You have to help me.
My father needs the Dragonblade.

197
00:13:45,969 --> 00:13:48,563
- He said your father--
- My father's out of town till Tuesday.

198
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:52,039
You'll have to come back then.
Excuse me, I have customers.

199
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:55,042
Yes. Hi. Thank you. Hi.

200
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:59,525
I need a sprig of wormwood,
preferably small-stemmed.

201
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,437
Hey!

202
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:14,878
Hey!

203
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:21,160
Who are you?

204
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:25,762
Anling.

205
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,087
I have it, Father.

206
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:33,008
No!

207
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,999
Like I said, we're just getting started.

208
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:39,241
Father!

209
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:46,047
Yenlo was a powerful disciple,

210
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,359
but he used my father's teachings
for evil.

211
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,599
That's why my father
passed him over for master.

212
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:53,522
And because he did,
Yenlo swore vengeance on him.

213
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:55,919
Didn't you say you stabbed Yenlo
when he first attacked?

214
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:58,319
Yes, but he used his knowledge
of the teachings to escape

215
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:00,047
before he died.

216
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:01,198
Escape where?

217
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:04,361
To a place where souls pass
on their way to reincarnation.

218
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,918
It's a mystical region
between life and death.

219
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,959
- Limbo.
- Yenlo somehow figured out

220
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:11,397
a way to hide out there.

221
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:13,167
But if you stabbed him...

222
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:15,724
Metaphysical and magical laws
are amplified in limbo.

223
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:18,159
As long as he stays there,
his wound will never advance.

224
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:20,445
He can literally cheat death forever.

225
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:25,245
That's why I took the Dragonblade.
It has the power to trap human souls.

226
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:28,162
Now it's the only way
to save my father.

227
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:29,444
You think he's still alive?

228
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:33,278
Yenlo doesn't just want to kill
my father. He wants to punish him.

229
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:37,164
Holding him in limbo does that,
it keeps his soul from being reborn.

230
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:42,087
Do you know how to get
to this limbo?

231
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:45,367
No, I never mastered that skill.

232
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:48,925
Well, then, we'll have to figure out
our own way.

233
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:50,442
Phoebe! Paige!

234
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:51,877
I can't let you do that.

235
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:54,768
I know you're powerful witches,
but I can't put you in danger.

236
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:56,681
Yenlo will be coming for me next.

237
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,039
All the more reason you should
be here, where it's safe.

238
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,918
No place is safe from Yenlo. He can
use any surface of water as a portal.

239
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,404
Maybe, but he can only stay
in our world for short periods.

240
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:08,083
Otherwise, his wound
will ultimately kill him.

241
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:09,443
You called?

242
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:12,201
This is Anling.

243
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:14,485
Hi, I'm Paige.

244
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:17,886
I mean, Paige's older sister,
Phoebe.

245
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:20,121
This is Paige.

246
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:22,879
Howdy. Hi. Paige here.

247
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:28,686
Okay, we've got
a water-loving demon.

248
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:30,646
Phoebe, take Paige
to the water main.

249
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:32,919
It takes two
to turn off that rusty valve.

250
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:34,886
Water main.

251
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:36,687
Right.

252
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:44,048
Okay, Book of Shadows.

253
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:46,439
There's gotta be
another way to get into limbo.

254
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:00,842
It's amazing how our wounds
stop bleeding down here, isn't it?

255
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:03,127
See?

256
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,200
Doesn't even hurt.

257
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,008
This place was not meant
for us to stay, Yenlo.

258
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:09,437
Tell me about it.

259
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:13,005
I always expected the entrance
to reincarnation to be a nice river,

260
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:15,000
or even pearly gates.

261
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:18,764
Last thing I expected to see
was a big sucking hole.

262
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:20,681
It's never too late for redemption.

263
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:25,848
If you enter that vortex,
you'll cleanse your soul,

264
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:27,488
start life fresh.

265
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:29,680
Yeah, as a tapeworm.

266
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,248
Or maybe even a dung beetle.

267
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,680
I know how karma works.

268
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:37,882
Besides, I've worked too hard
in this life to give it all up now.

269
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:39,158
You're evil, Yenlo.

270
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,918
- You have nothing in this life.
- I have you!

271
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:46,047
Which means now
your student-reject has a purpose.

272
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:48,040
I figure why stop
at just one Zen master,

273
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:51,360
when I can rid the world of two,
or 20 or 1 00?

274
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:55,842
All their wisdom and magic
lost forever in limbo.

275
00:17:56,329 --> 00:17:58,638
Now, that's evil.

276
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:03,803
And have I not taught you that
you can never escape your karma?

277
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:05,998
No one can.

278
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:07,483
But then again,

279
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,958
nobody's ever escaped
from limbo before, have they?

280
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,040
How did you do it?

281
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:17,360
I see no water as a portal
to return to Earth.

282
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:19,764
I was worried about that at first.

283
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:25,879
But then I remembered that every
cloud has a nice, wet, watery lining.

284
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:29,723
Well, I'm off to find your daughter
and kill her.

285
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:32,367
Wish me luck.

286
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:41,042
- Careful. Don't break my nails.
- Forget your nails.

287
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:44,360
You almost got us busted. Next time,
smile and nod when we're together.

288
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,008
Well, that might work for Piper,

289
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:48,922
but what about this demon
that's on the loose?

290
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,438
You're right. We may have to fight.

291
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:54,248
- Can you levitate?
- I haven't tried.

292
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:57,327
There, levitate and kick.

293
00:18:57,489 --> 00:19:00,879
But first, could you lose the lollipop?
My teeth have enough cavities.

294
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:05,167
Sorry. Nervous habit.

295
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:15,564
Oh, my God, you are so bad
for my image.

296
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,242
Piper is never gonna trust me
with magic again.

297
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:23,407
Piper won't find out anything
as long as we reverse the potion.

298
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:27,921
Well, I think I figured out
how to mix a new batch,

299
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:29,807
but we're all out
of powdered toadstool.

300
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:31,237
I know where to get some.

301
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:34,287
You stay here.
Avoid Piper at all costs.

302
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:36,201
And practice my power.
You may need it.

303
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:45,128
Can I help you?

304
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,647
Sense of humour.
I really like that in a girl.

305
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,768
So are you ready to go, Paige?

306
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:53,483
Paige.

307
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:57,485
- Mason, hi. How are you?
- I'm fine.

308
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:00,880
- Do I know you?
- No, no, but I know you.

309
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:05,048
I feel like I know you, seeing as how
Paige can't stop talking about you

310
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:06,801
Mason, the boss' son.

311
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:09,127
He's as cute as you said he was.

312
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:11,598
Well, nice to see you. Bye.

313
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:12,798
No, wait.

314
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:15,881
- Aren't you guys going for dinner?
- Yeah, is ltalian okay?

315
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,364
Chinese. You must have Chinese.

316
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:21,327
Chinatown Chinese, even better.

317
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:23,003
That's cool.

318
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:25,567
Okay.

319
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:33,324
Okay. So you two kids have fun.
And keep my face out of the sun.

320
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:41,039
- Who was at the door?
- Oh, just Paige's date.

321
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:42,477
She's still going on her date?

322
00:20:44,689 --> 00:20:46,441
What's with the lollipop?

323
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:49,169
Paige sort of got me into them.

324
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:52,247
Phoebe, I gotta be honest.
I'm really starting to worry about her.

325
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:54,884
Why? What's wrong with Paige?

326
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:58,286
Well, first of all, she made me
realize I hate being the big sister.

327
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:01,640
And it's suddenly my responsibility
to teach her how to be a witch,

328
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:03,640
and she doesn't listen to me.

329
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:05,640
She listens, sometimes.

330
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:07,765
Really?
Because she's got me fooled.

331
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:11,564
And it's a shame because she might
actually have a lot of potential.

332
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:13,598
Really?

333
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:17,079
But the problem is, I don't think
she cares about anything.

334
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:20,042
Oh, no, she cares. I know she does.

335
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:21,801
You just have to give her a chance.

336
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,168
I think Paige is the kind of person...

337
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:27,440
...that needs to learn
from her mistakes.

338
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:31,086
And believe me, she's learning fast.

339
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:45,479
What is this place?

340
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:52,639
I just gotta find some
powdered toadstool. Here it is.

341
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:55,841
Okay, I gotta warn you.
I'm not into the whole herbal scene.

342
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,005
Well, neither is Paige, I don't think.

343
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:00,922
You always talk about yourself
in the third person like that?

344
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,920
It's kind of a character flaw of mine.

345
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,963
So, what's the toadstool for?

346
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:08,008
It's an aphrodisiac.

347
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,887
Really.

348
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:12,880
My dad was right.
He said you were...

349
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:17,600
-... "unique," I believe, is the word.
- What else did he say about me?

350
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,999
If he doesn't hurry up
and make you a social worker,

351
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:21,648
you'll probably start
your own agency.

352
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:25,724
That or end up in jail,
he wasn't sure which.

353
00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:27,368
Sounds like me at that age.

354
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:30,087
You lost me again.

355
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:33,878
I'm not showing you
a very good time, am l?

356
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:37,638
I don't know. We're in Chinatown,
shopping for a sexual stimulant.

357
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:40,243
I'm surrounded by chicken claws
and goat brains.

358
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:42,127
I haven't had this much fun
in a long time.

359
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:44,684
Come to think of it, neither have l.

360
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:46,999
My boyfriend's not really big
on the fun factor lately.

361
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:50,639
- Your boyfriend?
- Ex-boyfriend.

362
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:56,689
- Yenlo.
- What's that, another aphrodisiac?

363
00:22:57,889 --> 00:22:59,607
I gotta go.

364
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:20,686
What are you doing?

365
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:23,927
Just...

366
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:25,363
...some exercises.

367
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:28,079
Levitating exercises.

368
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:30,598
So you've decided
to make training your priority?

369
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,367
Yes. Absolutely.

370
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:34,560
Good. We'll pick up
where we left off.

371
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:36,843
Great.

372
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:38,522
Cool.

373
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:40,805
I'll throw a couple of low voltage
energy balls at you,

374
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:42,004
you just try to avoid them.

375
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:43,198
Energy balls?

376
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:49,805
Okay, now that's just rude.
I am not having fun!

377
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:51,488
Fighting The Source isn't fun.

378
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:52,877
That's it, pal!

379
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:56,200
You are not The Source and you
do not treat your girlfriend this way.

380
00:23:56,409 --> 00:24:01,005
Murderers, demons, phone solicitors,
maybe. But not your girlfriend.

381
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,369
- What's gotten into you?
- Paige.

382
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:07,520
I mean...

383
00:24:07,689 --> 00:24:11,159
I told Paige how
you've been treating me,

384
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:15,117
and she just thinks
you're way out of line, buddy.

385
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:18,640
Phoebe, you're the most important
thing in my life.

386
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:21,881
If I don't push you hard,
I will lose you.

387
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:25,442
You keep pushing her that way...

388
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:27,565
...and you'll push her
right out the door.

389
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,044
What do you mean, "her"?

390
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,163
I meant me.

391
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,087
- You said "her."
- Did l?

392
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:39,040
Well, I'm just very angry,
you know, because...

393
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:41,325
Well, you tore my jog bra.

394
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:44,363
And now I just--

395
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:46,247
I have to go change.

396
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:04,041
There is actually nothing in here
on how to reach limbo.

397
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:09,204
Should you have that water up here?
What if Yenlo uses that as a portal?

398
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:12,606
It's okay. The surface
is too small for him to enter.

399
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:15,160
So, what are you doing?

400
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:19,242
My father could use water as
a looking glass into other worlds.

401
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:22,606
Once when I was young,
he reached into a bowl of water

402
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:26,444
and picked me a plum
from the Garden of Eden.

403
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:27,883
Can you see your father now?

404
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:32,041
No. I only see water.

405
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:35,882
I wish he were here.
He'd know what to do.

406
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:39,525
I better go check with the Elders.
Maybe they can help us reach limbo.

407
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:44,363
Sometimes I think Yenlo was right.

408
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:48,647
My father made the wrong choice.
Yenlo was always the better student.

409
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:51,561
Oh, I doubt that.

410
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:53,959
You beat him in battle.

411
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:56,364
But I didn't kill him.
I made him stronger.

412
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:58,919
Strong enough to remove
my father's magic

413
00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:01,199
and wisdom from the world.

414
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:04,008
I don't feel worthy
of following in his footsteps.

415
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:07,840
I understand.

416
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:11,763
I recently lost my big sister,
who was...

417
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:14,924
...pretty good at just about
everything she did.

418
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:18,562
Very tough shoes to fill.

419
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:20,846
Where did you find the strength?

420
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:24,205
I haven't yet.

421
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:26,246
But I'll let you know when I do.

422
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:33,606
Come on, with all this rain, we have
to protect the house from Yenlo.

423
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:06,397
Cole.

424
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:09,481
- You scared me.
- Sorry. I didn't mean to.

425
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:11,924
With the rain outside
and everyone on Yenlo alert...

426
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:14,962
Yeah, Yenlo.
That's why I rushed home.

427
00:27:15,449 --> 00:27:16,928
You're chilled. Here, put this on.

428
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:19,401
You keep it.

429
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:21,964
I'm sorry. Am I making you feel...

430
00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:24,165
-...uncomfortable?
- No, of course not.

431
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:27,002
I was just wondering what Phoebe
would think about this.

432
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:28,838
Phoebe?

433
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:31,358
Yeah, your girlfriend, Phoebe.
Remember?

434
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:34,367
Yes, the problem with Phoebe
is she's so obsessed with training,

435
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:38,317
she's not interested
in romance anymore.

436
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:40,281
That's not true. I mean, she--

437
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:45,398
You, on the other hand, strike me
as being full of passion, desire.

438
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,161
I miss that.

439
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:49,441
I gotta go.

440
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:53,602
Hey!

441
00:27:58,249 --> 00:27:59,568
How could you do this to me?

442
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:02,329
Oh, come on, I'm just trying
to have a little fun, Phoebe.

443
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:04,684
Isn't that what you were complaining
about me not doing?

444
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:06,959
Yeah, but I never meant for...

445
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:09,920
Did you just call me Phoebe?

446
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:11,881
Would you rather I kissed her?

447
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:14,840
- No.
- You know?

448
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:18,958
- How do you know?
- For one thing, you suck at levitating.

449
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:21,729
For another, you set me straight
about the way I've been treating

450
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:24,847
the real Phoebe,
as only a sister could.

451
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:27,045
- You did?
- Someone had to.

452
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:30,281
Okay. I'm gonna go.

453
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:32,644
Let you guys work this out.

454
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:35,482
When you're yourself again,

455
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:37,480
give me a call.

456
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:41,006
We'll have some fun.

457
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:46,124
Okay, we've got to get back
into our own bodies.

458
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:47,961
I am even getting confused.

459
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:49,644
Piper, look out!

460
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:59,840
The Dragonblade.

461
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:04,044
Phoebe, stop him!

462
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:24,967
Leo!

463
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:28,927
Anling's hurt.

464
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:32,523
You two, follow me!

465
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:40,325
All right, what the hell is going on?

466
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:44,607
I was soaking some potion pots
in the sink and I forgot to drain them.

467
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:47,164
That is not what I mean.
I smell something witchy.

468
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:49,206
Phoebe, what is wrong
with your powers?

469
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,447
Phoebe?

470
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:54,637
I'm over here.

471
00:29:57,009 --> 00:29:59,887
Don't get mad at her.
This is all my fault.

472
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,080
But, Paige, I agreed
to keep it secret.

473
00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:04,280
But I was the one
that messed up the potion.

474
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:06,320
I wasn't concentrating.
I just guessed.

475
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:09,806
Oh, my God.

476
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:12,039
You guys switched bodies?

477
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:14,206
Are you out of your minds?

478
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:17,560
With everything we have going on,
you pull a stunt like this?

479
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:21,648
- It was an accident.
- Accidents like that get people killed.

480
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:24,528
We could have lost an innocent
in there. What if it wasn't Yenlo?

481
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:26,287
What if it was The Source
that broke in?

482
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,802
You could've gotten us all killed.

483
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:34,286
Now we've lost our shot at Yenlo.
We have no idea how to get to limbo.

484
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:38,087
Wait a minute.

485
00:30:38,249 --> 00:30:41,924
Do you remember what you put
in that potion to switch bodies?

486
00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:44,518
Phoebe just picked up the ingredient
we were missing.

487
00:30:44,729 --> 00:30:46,924
Good, let's go.

488
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:49,120
All right, what else did you...?

489
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:51,723
I mean, you put in this?

490
00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:54,449
Just the powdered toadstool.

491
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:57,961
All right, soul sisters,
back in your own bodies.

492
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:02,318
- I wanna be me again
- I wanna be me again

493
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:11,002
It's nice to see you, Paige.

494
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:14,325
It's nice to be seen, Phoebe.

495
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:16,841
My God, what did you have
for dinner?

496
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:19,398
Kung Pao chicken. Sorry.

497
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:23,403
Okay, not to cut this reunion short,
but we don't have a lot of time.

498
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:26,606
So the only person who knows
how to enter limbo is in limbo himself.

499
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:29,602
And since we can't get to Anling's
father down there,

500
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:34,678
my plan is to bring him up here,
or at least his soul.

501
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:38,246
Wait, you wanna swap souls
with Anling's father?

502
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:40,560
He's the only one who knows
how to get in.

503
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:43,084
Besides, it's the best way
to surprise Yenlo.

504
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:45,359
It's too risky.
There's gotta be another way.

505
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:47,958
Did the Elders
have any other ideas?

506
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:49,488
No.

507
00:31:49,969 --> 00:31:51,448
Then there's not.

508
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:53,962
Okay.

509
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:57,968
I wanna be the Zen Master.

510
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:18,446
You have a very brave sister.

511
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:23,680
- Father?
- Yes, Anling, I'm here.

512
00:32:26,369 --> 00:32:28,246
We don't have much time.

513
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:31,168
Where is the Dragonblade?

514
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:36,488
I used it to fight Yenlo,
but he knocked it out of my hands.

515
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:38,002
Phoebe, did you pick it up?

516
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:39,722
No. Paige?

517
00:32:40,569 --> 00:32:42,127
I haven't seen it.

518
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:45,922
Then who has the Dragonblade?

519
00:32:49,249 --> 00:32:51,126
What happened, old man?

520
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:53,803
I don't know. What happened?

521
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:55,840
I was telling you how I stole
the Dragonblade

522
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:57,840
from your useless daughter
when you blacked out.

523
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,124
I did?

524
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:01,359
I mean, I did.

525
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:03,360
- If you say so.
- Who are you?

526
00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:07,445
I am one with the universe.

527
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:13,164
You think you can fool me?
I was his disciple for 20 years.

528
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:16,801
Anling doesn't have the power
to switch souls.

529
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:18,561
So you must be one of the witches.

530
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:22,125
Which means Anling and her father
will come to rescue you.

531
00:33:22,329 --> 00:33:23,842
The question is:

532
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:26,364
How are they gonna
get your soul back,

533
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:28,167
when I've got it?

534
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:48,128
This is all we could find.

535
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:50,285
Then Yenlo must have
the Dragonblade.

536
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:56,884
And used it to capture
your sister's soul.

537
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:59,080
What does that mean?
How do we get Piper back?

538
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:01,479
We need to get the Dragonblade
away from Yenlo.

539
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:04,447
Okay, so, what are we waiting for?
Show us the way.

540
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:08,119
I should go alone. Piper did this
for me, to save my father's life.

541
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:09,967
No, she's our sister.

542
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:11,877
We'll all go.

543
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:14,364
Is that what you were
fighting to save?

544
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:15,598
My life?

545
00:34:16,209 --> 00:34:17,358
Of course, Father.

546
00:34:17,529 --> 00:34:20,282
When we bring you back, their
whitelighter can heal your wound.

547
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,963
He's a miracle worker.
I've seen him.

548
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:28,567
You are right, we should all go.
But it is a different realm down there,

549
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:29,963
with new rules.

550
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,808
Yenlo has had time
to learn and adjust.

551
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:35,085
- Fine, then let's go.
- If you go,

552
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:37,007
you risk being pulled
into the vortex.

553
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:38,648
Who would heal our injuries?

554
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:41,079
He's right, Leo.
You should stay here.

555
00:34:49,009 --> 00:34:50,647
Okay, here goes nothing.

556
00:35:10,009 --> 00:35:11,727
Piper.

557
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:16,768
The Dragonblade, where is it?

558
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:18,004
Quiet.

559
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:22,088
Look out!

560
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:30,798
Father!

561
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,243
Welcome to my turf.

562
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:40,038
Look, Yenlo's belt.

563
00:35:43,129 --> 00:35:45,165
I didn't even call for it.
It just happened.

564
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:46,802
Our powers must be expanded here.

565
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:50,684
You get Piper's soul
out of the Dragonblade.

566
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,840
I'm gonna keep Yenlo busy.

567
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:57,843
Oh, it's you. Black Belt Barbie.

568
00:35:58,049 --> 00:35:59,880
You're gonna be sorry you said that.

569
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:07,919
- Phoebe, what do I do?
- I don't know.

570
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:09,841
Use your powers. Orb her soul.

571
00:36:24,169 --> 00:36:26,478
- Now what?
- Put it back in the body!

572
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:32,525
Thanks for the lift. Untie me.

573
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:44,481
- We gotta do something.
- What?

574
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:46,287
I don't have the power in this body.

575
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:52,838
Oh, my ankle. I think it's twisted.

576
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:54,044
I need a time-out.

577
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,243
A time-out?

578
00:36:57,409 --> 00:37:00,207
- This will be easier than I thought.
- For me too.

579
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:01,922
Paige!

580
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:38,485
Oh, my God, it's so beautiful.
What happened?

581
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:41,680
Beats the hell out of me.

582
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:44,198
- Piper?
- Hello.

583
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:50,688
The natural order of things
has been restored,

584
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:52,248
including our souls.

585
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:54,883
But how?

586
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:57,768
This was all a reflection
on Yenlo's fears,

587
00:37:57,929 --> 00:38:00,124
of a man afraid of crossing over.

588
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:01,808
In truth,

589
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:04,563
this is a peaceful place,

590
00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:05,798
welcoming.

591
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:09,247
We need to get you home
and heal your wound.

592
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:10,848
No.

593
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:13,318
I was mortally wounded.

594
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:16,242
It is my time to die. To be reborn.

595
00:38:16,689 --> 00:38:18,361
Their whitelighter can heal.

596
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:20,727
Anling...

597
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:24,199
...you know better than to cling
to the physical world,

598
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:26,644
the way you clung to my hand
at the bridge.

599
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:28,887
But you're my father.

600
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:32,684
I'm no greater or less
than anyone facing death.

601
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:37,167
That's the only lesson that keeps
you from being a true Zen master.

602
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:43,566
Death is a part of life.

603
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:46,038
A transition, a rebirth.

604
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:49,679
Something that your young friends
here have learned recently.

605
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:56,042
Yes.

606
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:58,883
Yenlo must be reborn too.

607
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:02,283
It is the natural order of things.

608
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:08,042
I love you.

609
00:39:08,609 --> 00:39:10,645
And I'll always love you, Anling.

610
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,725
Does anyone know
how to leave here?

611
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,922
I think I know how to do it now.

612
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:57,646
Aloe plant, medicinal uses.

613
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:00,164
Taro root, magical herb.

614
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:04,561
Saint-John's-Wort, medicinal herb.
Ragged robin, magical herb.

615
00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:07,084
Cupid's dart, strictly aromatic.

616
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:10,127
- And that one?
- That is angelica.

617
00:40:10,329 --> 00:40:11,603
And its use?

618
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:14,841
I think it's used mostly
to flavour fish.

619
00:40:15,769 --> 00:40:17,885
She got every answer right.

620
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:21,207
So, what inspired the turnaround?

621
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:25,009
Well, I kind of liked the power boost
I had in limbo.

622
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:27,319
So it kind of made me wanna work
harder faster.

623
00:40:27,529 --> 00:40:29,121
Don't be in too big a hurry.

624
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:32,361
Trust me, you wanna fight like hell
to keep a life separate from magic.

625
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:34,282
Hear, hear.

626
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:38,124
And having a guy around like Mason
is not such a bad thing.

627
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:40,445
- Oh, you liked him?
- Yeah.

628
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:41,968
Yeah? That's too bad.

629
00:40:42,129 --> 00:40:43,721
He cancelled on me for tonight.

630
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:45,408
He said I was trying too hard

631
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,639
and that I was not comfortable
in my own skin.

632
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:50,287
So much for impressing the boss.

633
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:54,277
I can take comfort in the fact that
he cancelled on Phoebe, and not me.

634
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:55,842
Hey.

635
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:00,965
Well, here comes
your personal trainer from hell.

636
00:41:01,129 --> 00:41:04,041
- Literally.
- Gotta go.

637
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:06,123
Hi.

638
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:07,404
Wait a minute.

639
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:09,681
Who are you?

640
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:16,086
I know. Paige.

641
00:41:18,649 --> 00:41:21,368
So, what's on our training schedule
for today? Light sabres?

642
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:24,288
Actually, I was thinking we could
have a private picnic of our own.

643
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:26,241
But what about training?

644
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:29,367
- I have to be ready for The Source.
- I know, but not right now.

645
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:31,719
Right now, I was thinking
I could take you

646
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:36,047
to this great little picnic spot
in the south of France.

647
00:41:36,209 --> 00:41:38,928
- Really?
- Really.
