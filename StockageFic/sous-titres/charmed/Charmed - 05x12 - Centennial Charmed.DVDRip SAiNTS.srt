1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,039
Paige?

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,191
Come on, Paige, I know you're here.
You summoned me.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,079
Paige?

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,353
Paige.

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,709
That is a vanquish.

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,909
Damn it, Paige.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,710
I would appreciate it
if you didn't practice on me.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,309
- I may be dead but it still hurts.
- I am sorry, Leo,

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,517
but I think I came up with a perfect
way to vanquish Cole.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,070
I kept thinking, "What is it
that makes him so indestructible?"

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,231
And then I thought,
"It's his protection shield."

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,710
So I came up with a potion
that makes me invisible long enough

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,230
so I can get past it, say a spell,
and blow him up from the inside.

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,556
Firstly, congratulations.
Cool potion.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,115
- Thank you.
- Secondly, it will never work.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,118
Okay, even if it does, it's not something
you should be going at alone.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,198
Whatever the ultimate solution is,
it lies within the power of three.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,158
Yeah, well, we have tried that.
Besides, I'm a witch too

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,710
and I don't see why I can't try to operate
on my own every once in a while.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,791
You can and you have.

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,552
But Cole is different and you know it.

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,154
No, I don't know that, Leo.

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,437
I have worked really hard
on this, by myself, for days.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,638
I know I can do this.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,713
And I wanna do it.
For Phoebe.

26
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,431
Happy birthday.

27
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,951
I did it.

28
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:44,153
And breathe, two, three, four.
And relax, two, three, four.

29
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,788
And breathe, two, three...

30
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,310
- Are you all right?
- No, I am not all right.

31
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,040
- Come on, back on the ball.
- You get back on the ball. I quit.

32
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,158
It's hard at first, I know, Piper.
But the birthing ball really can

33
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,754
make the delivery much easier,
especially for home births.

34
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,551
Hospital, people. How many times
do I have to tell you crazy people?

35
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,392
Hospital.
I'm going to the hospital.

36
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,391
What about water birth?
Can we do that at home?

37
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,754
Sure, we can rent a tub.

38
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,679
What am I, a dolphin?
I'm not giving birth to fish.

39
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,637
Actually, dolphins aren't fish,
they're mammals.

40
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,588
- Shut up.
- Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late. I overslept.

41
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,479
- Hi, Eve.
- That's okay, we're just getting started.

42
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,239
Late night?

43
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,913
As a matter of fact, yes.

44
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,708
- What the hell is that?
- A nipple enhancer.

45
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,199
For breast-feeding.

46
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,395
Gesundheit.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,070
Thanks, I've been
sneezing my head off all morning.

48
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,719
Not to mention the rest of you.

49
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,949
A little ginger root and raspberry leaf
will take care of that.

50
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,475
- Old Gypsy remedy.
- I think we got some of it in the kitchen.

51
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,279
Why don't you go see
if we got some of that in the kitchen?

52
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,915
Sure. Be right back.

53
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,836
- What?
- Hi.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,274
- What?
- Do you not realize

55
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,000
that you just sneezed and orbed
at the same time?

56
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,639
It's a good thing Eve didn't see that.

57
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,314
Well, we saved her Gypsy clan.
I think she'd be fine with it.

58
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,278
Well, it's one thing to know and
it's another thing to actually see it.

59
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,790
I'm more interested in why it happened.
What caused it?

60
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,911
I think you should tell them.

61
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,039
Fine.

62
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,156
I tried to vanquish Cole last night.

63
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,714
- What?
- I know.

64
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,632
Don't do the big-sister
guilt thing, okay?

65
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,351
I knew what I was doing
and it almost worked. Until I got all wet.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,675
- I tried to talk her out of it.
- Paige, you could have been killed.

67
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,237
So, what else is new? I just wanted
to give you a little peace.

68
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,917
That's very sweet but I don't need Cole
to be vanquished to find peace.

69
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,514
I'm okay, really.
I am free of him emotionally.

70
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,114
And besides, I thought we agreed
to take a vanquishing hiatus

71
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,429
during my last trimester?

72
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,875
- That's why I didn't wanna bother you.
- You should have.

73
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,076
Because this is not something
you can do by yourself.

74
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,033
Obviously, I disagreed.

75
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,952
My problems
are none of your concern.

76
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,075
All that should matter to you
is that I'm willing to join your kind,

77
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,554
become an Avatar.

78
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,873
I understand.
And we're pleased to hear it.

79
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,397
Still, I can't help but wonder,
why now,

80
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,788
after all this time?

81
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,918
You have unlimited powers,
don't you?

82
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,071
We have the power
to elevate powers such as yours.

83
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,676
To raise them above the restraints
of good and evil.

84
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,711
Which makes them unlimited,
yes?

85
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,149
- Yes.
- Then that's why for now.

86
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,078
Which means, I assume, that I can use
these powers to manipulate say, time?

87
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,874
Reality, even?

88
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,510
Understand, Cole, these powers

89
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,229
are not meant to be used
for personal vendettas.

90
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,676
They're meant to be used
with others like us

91
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,599
to shape a future we control.

92
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,275
Oh, I understand very well indeed.

93
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,672
And believe me, I'm all for it. But
I need to take care of something first.

94
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,274
And to do that,
I need unlimited powers.

95
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,069
I'm afraid that can't be allowed.

96
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,794
Then I'm afraid I can't join you.

97
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,999
Who are you kidding?

98
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,953
You need me.

99
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,635
Otherwise you never would have
come to me in the first place.

100
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,439
Just one favour, that's all I ask.

101
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,039
Then I'm yours.

102
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,196
<i>Michelle Branch, everyone.</i>

103
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,952
She's so cute.

104
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,869
- Hi.
- Glasses.

105
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,393
Okay.

106
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,318
Okay, here you go.

107
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,835
A toast. To Lieutenant Morris.

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,319
Congratulations.

109
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,198
Wait, shouldn't we wait for Paige?

110
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,432
I don't think she's gonna make it,
because she has a really bad cold.

111
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,708
Cheers.

112
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,359
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

113
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,199
- Long overdue.
- Cheers.

114
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,355
- We'll be right back.
- We will?

115
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,999
We will.

116
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,438
Leo, keep pouring.

117
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,438
Don't mind.
They... They do that a lot.

118
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,674
Hi, guys.

119
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,434
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing here?

120
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,670
I'm going to Darryl's party?

121
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,115
The sneezing, Paige,
the sneezing.

122
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,794
Oh, that, no. Eve's little miracle-cure
worked great.

123
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,234
I haven't sneezed all day.

124
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,870
- Is that Darryl's wife? She's cute.
- Wait, wait, wait.

125
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,508
- First, we chat.
- Come on.

126
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,513
I told you.
Everything's fine.

127
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,952
No, it's not about that.

128
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,878
It's about this morning
when you left.

129
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,314
You seemed really upset.

130
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,075
Oh, that? No, I was just having
a girly mood. You know.

131
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,515
No, I think we all know
it's a little bit more than that.

132
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,148
Something's been bugging you.
So why don't you just talk to us?

133
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,954
Okay. You really wanna know?

134
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,996
I've just been kind of feeling
a little suppressed lately.

135
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,795
It's not your problem,
it's my problem.

136
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,350
And I know you guys are the best thing
that's ever happened to me, I do.

137
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,353
But there's a "but."

138
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,511
I just feel like, you know,
having been an only child for 25 years,

139
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,676
I'm used to doing everything
on my own.

140
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,073
And it seems like, lately, I have to do
everything by committee and it's just...

141
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,273
You feel like you've
lost yourself along the way?

142
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,309
Yeah.

143
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,870
Okay. So, what can we do?

144
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,511
It's not you. It's me.

145
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,518
I just think, maybe...

146
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,711
...I need to start looking
for my own place to live.

147
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,793
Well?

148
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,469
How do you feel?

149
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,351
I feel alive.

150
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,991
Powerful.

151
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,035
You are one of us now.
Come.

152
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,635
Not so fast.

153
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,634
First, I get my wife back
once and for all.

154
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,798
That's what you wanted?

155
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,155
Your new powers can't affect love.

156
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,874
Maybe not.

157
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,955
But I'm hoping they'll change
the one event that led to our downfall.

158
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,588
The day that Phoebe
met her new sister.

159
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,718
The day the Charmed Ones
were reconstituted.

160
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,836
Go back in time?

161
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,353
No.

162
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,112
Better.

163
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,353
Undo what was, to change what is.

164
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,038
We were at our best, Phoebe and I,
before Paige.

165
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,077
If they hadn't have found each other,

166
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,470
we'd be married instead...

167
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,632
You have no idea
what you're getting into.

168
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,354
Changing the past to create
an alternate reality

169
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,590
has unforeseen consequences,
Cole.

170
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,318
Even for you.

171
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,040
The ripple effect
of even one small change could...

172
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,952
I don't care.

173
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,878
I am not spending another
hundred birthdays without her.

174
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,870
Oh, no, you don't.
No sneezing.

175
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,274
No sneezing.

176
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,472
Look out, people.
Pregnant lady coming through.

177
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,396
Major sneeze.

178
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,269
Hey, who turned out the lights?

179
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,396
And the heat?

180
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,993
Piper.

181
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,278
Piper?

182
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,557
Leo.

183
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,635
Leo.

184
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,438
- Oh, God, you scared me.
- Who are you?

185
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,828
What are you doing here?

186
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,036
- I could ask you the same thing.
- Oh, yeah?

187
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,920
Hey, it's o... It's okay.

188
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,149
This is my crib.

189
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,274
Your crib?
This is my sister's club.

190
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,476
Knife. Knife.

191
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,635
What the hell
is wrong with my powers?

192
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,991
Leo.

193
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,797
Damn it, where the hell
have you been?

194
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,070
- Who are you?
- Are you kidding?

195
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,913
You're not kidding. It's me, Paige.
Your sister-in-law?

196
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,719
Look, I don't know who you are, lady,
and I don't have time for games.

197
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,195
All hell is breaking loose out there.
So if you don't mind...

198
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,318
Have you lost your mind?
Do you notice anything different?

199
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,674
No, not really.

200
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,552
So if you'll excuse me...

201
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,273
Wait.

202
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,793
I'm your charge too.
How else could you have heard my call?

203
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,798
Thank you.

204
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,349
I just don't understand how all this
could have happened.

205
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,953
How what could've happened?

206
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,076
This. Piper's club. It's totalled.

207
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,231
Doesn't that strike you
as the least bit odd?

208
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,469
You know Piper?

209
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,235
Of course. Leo, the club.

210
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,795
What about it?
It's been like this for over a year.

211
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,474
Ever since Piper walked away from it,
right after Prue died.

212
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,039
That is not true.

213
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,719
The club is kicking ass.

214
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,395
Michelle Branch was just playing here
when I sneezed and then I or...

215
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,590
Orbed out.

216
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,076
Maybe if I sneeze again.

217
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,039
Did I orb?

218
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,874
How do you know about orbing?
And Piper?

219
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,596
Just take me to her. She'll figure
all this out. She always does.

220
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,195
Please. What have you
got to lose?

221
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,031
What are we doing here?

222
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,789
Piper's hunting.

223
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,479
Hey.

224
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,149
Feeding time, huh?

225
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,475
Knew you'd take the bait.

226
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,511
What you do to me?
Unfreeze me, witch.

227
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,674
Sure. No problem. Just as soon as you
tell me where I can find Shax.

228
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,599
Shax? What's she talking about?
We vanquished him already.

229
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,359
Nobody's vanquished Shax.

230
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,988
Ever since he killed Prue,

231
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,151
Piper's been obsessed
with getting revenge on him.

232
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,752
I asked you a question.

233
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,951
I don't know where Shax is.

234
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,953
Wrong answer.

235
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,315
Okay.

236
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,517
We can do this all night long because,
God knows, I got nothing but time.

237
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,150
But I'd rather be killing Shax, so why
don't you tell me where I can find him.

238
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,794
Go to hell.

239
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,156
I'm already there.

240
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,431
- Wait.
- Piper, don't.

241
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,196
Oh, my God,
you're not pregnant anymore.

242
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,517
Who are you?
Leo, what are you doing here?

243
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,636
It's me, your sister. Paige?

244
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,711
Look, if this is some lame attempt
from the Elders to try and lure me back,

245
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,316
you can forget it. Tell them to shove it.
I have no loyalties to them anymore.

246
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,595
And I don't have any to you.

247
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,588
Hey. That's no way
to speak to your husband.

248
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,274
We're divorced.
Have been for a while.

249
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,634
Okay, what bizarre world

250
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,519
have I sneezed my way into?
You two are married.

251
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,148
And you're expecting.
A magical child, no less.

252
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,677
<i>And you, you're not La Femme Nikita,
you're a Charmed One.</i>

253
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,149
You don't mind kicking ass
when you have to, but otherwise

254
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,114
you'd rather be hanging out
with your sisters, baking cookies

255
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,554
or knitting bootees.

256
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,712
Knitting bootees?
Clearly you don't know me at all.

257
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,989
Oh, yeah?

258
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,628
How come I know you didn't really
vanquish the Lazarus demon?

259
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,594
What are you talking about?

260
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,832
As a breed, they resurrect. The only
way you can keep their remains down

261
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,718
is to bury them in a cemetery.

262
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,395
Please, stay.

263
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,114
Piper.

264
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,793
How did you know that would happen?

265
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,996
We fought him before,
in the real world.

266
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,709
What do you mean, "we"?

267
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,519
We. You, me, Phoebe.
Your sisters.

268
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,277
Oh, God, this is getting me nowhere.
Just orb me to Phoebe.

269
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,635
I can't go to the manor anymore.
It's forbidden.

270
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,876
What? Fine.

271
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,237
I'll do it myself. But when I fix this,
you owe me.

272
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,833
What are you waiting for?

273
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,275
What are you doing here?

274
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,230
I thought I was the only one
to cross over.

275
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,355
That won't be your last miscalculation,
I'm afraid.

276
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,271
Avatars exist
outside of time and space.

277
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,000
That's why I'm immune to your spell.

278
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,430
A spell which I beg you to reverse
before it's too late.

279
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,353
Too late for what?

280
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,594
For you to die.

281
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,872
You're not invincible
in this reality, Cole.

282
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,355
By changing that one critical event,

283
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,114
you've changed even more
than you see before you.

284
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,072
You've changed you.

285
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,837
What are you talking about?
I don't feel any different.

286
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,479
But you are different.

287
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,476
You've assumed the identity
of the Cole in this reality.

288
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,469
The one who used to be known as
Belthazor, the Source's right-hand man.

289
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,520
A powerful demon, to be sure.

290
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,757
But hardly indestructible.

291
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,676
Belthazor, huh?

292
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,357
I told you, that's when
Phoebe and I were at our best.

293
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,912
Cole, please. Believe me.

294
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,832
You have no future here.

295
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,513
But I promise you'll have
a future with us

296
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,188
if you'll only
undo what you've done.

297
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,358
I can't.

298
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,274
I have to play this out first.

299
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,473
Surprise! Happy birthday!

300
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,956
Surprise!

301
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,151
Thank you. Thanks.

302
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,472
Speech, speech, speech, speech.
Speech, speech, speech, speech.

303
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,349
I really don't know what to say.

304
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,991
I'm surprised.
I'm very surprised.

305
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,194
My compliments.
This is a great cake.

306
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,475
Thank you, my liege.

307
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,231
Although I must admit,
I thought you were actually 117.

308
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,235
Oh, my.

309
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,198
He shouldn't have said that.

310
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,750
I know how sensitive you are
about your age.

311
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,473
Happy birthday.

312
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,635
Seer, you're alive.

313
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,829
So... So where's Phoebe?

314
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,678
Answer me.

315
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,473
Phoebe.

316
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,157
What's the matter?
Not what you expected?

317
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,196
No. No.

318
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,470
You look... You look great. Really.

319
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,032
Did you just give me a compliment?

320
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,599
You have no idea
how happy I am to see you.

321
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,117
What the hell is the matter with you?

322
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,910
Don't worry about her.
My visions have not changed.

323
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,992
Once she conceives
your magical heir,

324
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,794
you won't need
to keep up pretences anymore.

325
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,073
I'll take it from there.

326
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,035
Leave me.

327
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,392
Phoebe.

328
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,273
You don't recognize me.
That's okay.

329
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,192
- Piper didn't either.
- Piper?

330
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,595
You know Piper? How is she?

331
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,875
She's... different.

332
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,718
Look, I don't have a lot of time
so I'm just gonna drop this on you.

333
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,233
I am your long-Iost sister Paige.

334
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,278
I know it sounds crazy.
But it's true.

335
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,989
We're all sisters in the real world.

336
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,193
Guards.

337
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,079
Look, I don't know how he did it,
but Cole somehow switched realities

338
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,798
in his twisted attempt to get you back.

339
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,439
I somehow slipped through the cracks

340
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,953
and landed here, I don't know how.

341
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,838
I need your help
in order to turn things back

342
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,399
to the way they're supposed to be.

343
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,998
You called?

344
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,793
Darryl, hi.

345
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,268
Get rid of her.

346
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,789
No. What are you doing?

347
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,154
What bodyguards do.

348
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,869
Phoebe.

349
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,110
I know you better
than you know yourself right now.

350
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,669
In your heart, you know
you are not meant to be with Cole.

351
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,794
In this other life, you are free of him
and you're happy.

352
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,589
Leo!

353
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,595
Leo.

354
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,153
Leo.

355
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,755
Thanks. That was cutting it
a little close, don't you think?

356
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,478
You're lucky I came at all.

357
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,908
I'm lucky?

358
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,111
You're lucky. Without me,
we're all screwed.

359
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,316
I'm the only one
who can fix this thing.

360
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,993
Oh, yeah?

361
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,310
Oh, God, this is so weird.

362
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,429
Cole living at the manor, those demons
we vanquished wandering around alive.

363
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,795
Wait a second.
If the demons are alive,

364
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,157
then that means
all the innocents we saved are dead.

365
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,439
Not just the innocents, Paige.

366
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,475
What are you talking about?

367
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,359
What are we doing here?

368
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,916
After you left, I went
and checked with the Elders.

369
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,117
They confirmed your story
that there was, in fact, another sister.

370
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,797
Only they didn't know
until it was too late,

371
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,316
until after the Source
had already had you killed.

372
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,316
This reality sucks.

373
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,911
Yeah, that explains
why none of us knew you.

374
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,674
- Never got a chance to meet you.
- So, what, you believe me now?

375
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,115
I'm not sure what I believe,
but the fact is you're here

376
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,236
and you're not supposed to be.

377
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,516
Okay, so we have established
the fact that I am here.

378
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,712
- How come I don't have my powers?
- You're not living your life anymore.

379
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,359
You're living hers.

380
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,149
You must have taken over our Paige's
life in this reality or, at least,

381
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,232
the life she would've lived
had she not been killed.

382
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,078
And since she never
met her sisters...

383
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,915
Power of three never got back together
and I never got my powers.

384
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,072
- Lucky me.
- Luckier than you think, maybe.

385
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,432
If you hadn't sneezed when you did
and orbed into the neutral plane,

386
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,959
nobody would've ever known.

387
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,509
Cole would've.
He's the one behind this.

388
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,399
He altered reality to eliminate me
and get Phoebe back.

389
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,075
But it's not working.

390
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,630
She hates him as much in this reality
as she does in ours.

391
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,156
Problem is, she's trapped here.

392
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,438
Well, your reality
sounds a lot better than this one.

393
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,073
And not just for Phoebe.

394
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,232
So how can I help you get it back?

395
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,997
I need my sisters.

396
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,474
Well, maybe we can start with two
and go from there.

397
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,034
What are you doing here?

398
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,631
Burying the Lazarus demon.

399
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,192
I figured if you were
right about that,

400
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,635
you were probably right
about everything else as well.

401
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,030
Whoever she was,
she had to be a witch.

402
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,038
Otherwise, she couldn't have called
for a whitelighter in the first place.

403
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,317
Your wife consorting
with other witches again?

404
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,919
I don't like it.

405
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,836
And it wasn't just
any whitelighter either.

406
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,471
- It was Leo.
- Leo?

407
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,596
Did he make contact with Phoebe?

408
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,117
No. Just the other one.

409
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,594
Although, I don't know why the witch
was here to begin with.

410
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,789
I think you need to have
a conversation with your wife.

411
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,631
Let me get this straight.

412
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,640
You work for me now.
Is that right?

413
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,433
Excuse us.

414
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,872
What's the matter?

415
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,759
Not feeling well?

416
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,228
- Why?
- You seem a little off today.

417
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,072
That's all.

418
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,194
You wanted to kill the cop
but your wife cast a spell.

419
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,472
She wanted to make him useful,

420
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,471
save him.

421
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,439
Remember?

422
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,558
I do now.

423
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,276
Forgive me, my liege.

424
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,228
But your enemies are many
and they are everywhere.

425
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,309
Any perceived weakness on your part
could leave you vulnerable.

426
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,149
What are you doing?

427
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,197
- I'm gonna kill that bastard.
- No.

428
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,160
What's the matter with you?
You both have your affairs.

429
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,952
That's no secret.

430
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,434
What?

431
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,158
Darla?

432
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,479
Who's this?

433
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,756
Who I always am, baby.

434
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,954
Whoever you want me to be.

435
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,672
I want Phoebe.
You understand me?

436
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,749
It's the only damn reason
I went through all of this.

437
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,152
Went through all what?

438
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,669
I think we should report this.

439
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,274
So you say the club
is still pretty successful

440
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,353
in this alleged
other reality of yours.

441
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,117
It's not alleged, it's real.
And it's really good.

442
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,793
Oh, yeah?
Am I a millionaire?

443
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,158
No, not that good.

444
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,828
Listen, if we wanna get this place back
to how it used to be, we...

445
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,752
How is it that we don't
know about you?

446
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,759
That we had another sister?

447
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,157
Half sister, apparently.

448
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,279
Right. The CliffsNotes version?

449
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,034
Our mom had an affair
with her whitelighter, Sam.

450
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,391
But because of the
witch-whitelighter rule thing,

451
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,630
they had to give me up at birth.

452
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,315
When the Elders realized they needed
me to remake the Charmed Ones,

453
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,956
they tossed out that stupid rule.

454
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,634
Which, as far as I'm concerned,
paved the way for you and Leo

455
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,472
to be able to keep your baby.

456
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,910
Well, how pregnant am I exactly?

457
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,876
Phoebe and I are practicing
to be your midwives as we speak.

458
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,076
We're preparing
for the big home birth.

459
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,992
Home birth? You're nuts.
I'd never agree to that.

460
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,037
I wouldn't give birth
unless it was in a...

461
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,193
Hospital. Yeah, yeah. You keep
saying the same thing in any reality.

462
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,794
Hey, who else but a sister
would know that?

463
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,036
We must be pretty close then,
the three of us.

464
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,230
Like Phoebe and I were with Prue.

465
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,831
Yeah, close enough
to have avenged Prue's death together.

466
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,070
This Cole of yours must have cast
a pretty powerful spell to do all of this.

467
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,028
But if we vanquish him, the spell
should automatically reverse itself.

468
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,749
Great. Except for we already
tried to vanquish him.

469
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,036
He's become invincible in our world.

470
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,558
Yes, but we're not in your world,
you're in ours.

471
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,875
So is he.

472
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,600
So if you've assumed
our Paige's life,

473
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,478
he must have assumed
Belthazor's.

474
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,348
Yeah, he would have.

475
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,671
Did you guys try
to vanquish Belthazor ever?

476
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,393
No, but you and Prue almost tried.

477
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,471
You guys had
a vanquishing potion, right?

478
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,669
How do you know that?

479
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,718
<i>Book oF Shadows.</i>

480
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,917
Also says that it needs
a piece of his flesh to make it work.

481
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,957
That's right, it did.

482
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,318
All right, then.

483
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,356
Let's go hunting.

484
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,235
Sorry, my liege.

485
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,794
But I thought...

486
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,757
I didn't think...

487
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,590
Are you kidding me?
What did you do that for?

488
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,319
What'd I do what for?

489
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,789
You're in here screwing some guy.
I'm supposed to ignore it?

490
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,194
You're my wife, damn it.

491
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,153
You have got to be kidding me.

492
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,676
After all this time, now you're playing
the aggrieved husband?

493
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,193
You don't understand!

494
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,192
It's all wrong.

495
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,595
This is not the way
it's meant to be here.

496
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,558
Okay, it's okay. Relax.

497
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,997
This is all messed up.
How'd it get messed up?

498
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,878
You have no idea
what I've given up for you.

499
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,110
What about what I've given up, Cole?

500
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,470
I've given up my family,
my heritage, my life.

501
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,392
Oh, yeah?
Where I'm standing,

502
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,391
it looks like you have
a damn good life to me.

503
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,075
Look.

504
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,471
The only one getting anything
out of this is you.

505
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,595
And I have no idea what that is.

506
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,878
The only reason I'm still here

507
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,118
is to make sure that what happened
to Prue does not happen to Piper,

508
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,315
and you know it.

509
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,110
What happened to us, Phoebe?

510
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,437
How'd we get here?

511
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,516
We used to be so in love.

512
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,875
Even without your sisters,
it's not working.

513
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,313
Why?

514
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,553
I don't know.

515
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,515
Maybe it just wasn't meant to be.

516
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,997
Phoebe, wait.

517
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,554
- What are you doing here?
- Saving my sister.

518
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,473
Now.

519
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,950
- You.
- Surprise.

520
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,028
Piper.

521
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,949
No.

522
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,792
Get us out of here.

523
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,438
Go. Go get her sisters.
They just attacked me.

524
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,556
Sisters?
You mean there's another?

525
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,995
Yes, damn it.

526
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,118
Get them and kill them on sight.

527
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,552
Paige was telling the truth?

528
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,909
I didn't go through all this
to lose you, Phoebe.

529
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,310
If I'm going down,
you're going down with me.

530
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,148
Toad flax, toad flax.
Did Leo get the toad flax?

531
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,238
Thank you.

532
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,436
I need a dash of cardamom,

533
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,598
a pinch of carrot seeds.

534
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,638
Hey, where's
the mandrake root already?

535
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,593
I'm impressed.
You really know this stuff.

536
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,558
Of course I do.
I learned from the best.

537
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,112
I learned from you.

538
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,749
Mandrake root.

539
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,036
All right, toss it in.

540
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,470
All right, now all we need...

541
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,631
Stand back.

542
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,595
Good memory.

543
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,359
Is that it? Is it ready?

544
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,870
Ready as it'll ever be.
Can't guarantee it'll work, though.

545
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,598
We're only gonna get
one chance at it.

546
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,557
Cole has to know why
we needed his flesh.

547
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,796
- He'll be waiting.
- What about Phoebe?

548
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,150
We get her out first
so that he can't hurt her.

549
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,432
Ready, sis?

550
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,388
Anything?

551
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,959
No.

552
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,031
Okay, come on.

553
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,355
What are you guys doing here?
You have to leave. Now.

554
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,073
- Where's Cole?
- Right here.

555
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,279
No.

556
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,474
What did you do to them?

557
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,477
Exactly what they were
gonna do to me.

558
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,640
- She's still alive, grab her hand.
- What?

559
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,872
I don't know
how you got here, Paige.

560
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,152
But if it's any consolation, I know
exactly where I'm gonna bury you.

561
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,912
Right next to yourself.

562
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,919
Grab her hand.

563
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,149
- The power of three.
- That's us.

564
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,833
Potion.

565
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,078
- I do hate long goodbyes.
- No.

566
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,149
Phoebe, are you crazy?
Throw it before he shimmers out.

567
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,433
She's not gonna throw it.

568
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,438
Are you?

569
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,754
Throw the potion.

570
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,432
We've been through
so much together.

571
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,438
Haven't we?

572
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,596
Our love's so strong,
nothing can destroy it. Not even this.

573
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,513
We're meant to be together.

574
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,079
I don't think so.

575
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,553
No!

576
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,232
Oh, please, God.
Tell me I'm back.

577
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,875
Oh, there you are.
Where'd you orb to?

578
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,595
Piper. Are you pregnant?

579
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,431
Yeah, where you been?

580
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,190
Where have you been?
What happened to your clothes?

581
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,039
Time must have continued
moving on in this reality too.

582
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,358
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm back.

583
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,911
Hey. What's going on?

584
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,229
She's very happy.

585
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,799
Phoebe.

586
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,558
Hi. Oh... Oh, okay.

587
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,079
What's the celebration?

588
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,195
I'm just so happy to be home,
that's all.

589
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,194
You wanted to move out.

590
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,197
I did? God, no.

591
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,992
Never. Well, I mean, you know,

592
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,159
maybe when I'm married, or pregnant,
or hopefully both at the same time.

593
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,958
We're sisters.
We shouldn't split up

594
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,429
until we absolutely have to.
You know that, right?

595
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,557
- She's rambling.
- I hear that.

596
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,352
I'm still here, right?

597
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,198
- I didn't go anywhere.
- Nope.

598
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,438
Paige.

599
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,789
What did you do?

600
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,988
Cole?

601
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,914
I'm telling you, he's gone.
For good.

602
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,390
Yeah, that's what
we thought last time.

603
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,511
And the time before that.

604
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,272
This time is different.

605
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,036
He straddled two worlds just like I did,
but he wasn't invincible there.

606
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,554
Cole is not coming back. Ever.

607
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,949
Just seems far too easy.
I don't know how I feel about that.

608
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,396
I think you should feel good about it.

609
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,149
You know, we don't have to look
over our shoulders anymore.

610
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,872
It's over.

611
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,754
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

612
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,513
Let's go.

613
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,835
Happy birthday, Cole.
