1
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:11,803
There, that's gotta be it.

2
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:20,446
I don't know. Looks kind of small
to be a mineshaft, doesn't it?

3
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,407
Maybe it was bigger in the 1800s.

4
00:00:23,569 --> 00:00:26,163
X marks the spot. Let's check it out.

5
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,038
- Definitely not a good sign.
- You're such a wimp.

6
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:03,400
You were saying?

7
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:11,484
Ten bucks says this is
where the gold is hidden. Hold this.

8
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,161
Ryan, I think these are all
warning signs.

9
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:23,240
Stop worrying about it.

10
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:02,766
I'm free.

11
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,005
- What year is this? Speak!
- 1999.

12
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,764
Two hundred years?

13
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:19,408
- My wand. Where's my wand?
- Your what?

14
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,082
My wand! Where is it?

15
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:23,319
Don't know
what you're talking about.

16
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:36,558
Too bad.

17
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,484
- What the hell just happened?
- I don't know.

18
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:45,241
She shrunk us.

19
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:48,003
- What do you think she wants?
- How should I know?

20
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:51,365
- Here she comes.
- I told you this was too dangerous!

21
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:53,804
Fine, but what are we
gonna do now?

22
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:57,120
- Oh, no.
- Run!

23
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,922
You're welcome.

24
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:23,247
Now...

25
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:25,998
...find my wand.

26
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,000
Phoebe, we are televising this live.
Can't it wait?

27
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,921
Prue, Dan's truck
just pulled up outside.

28
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:50,722
Dan's truck? So?

29
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:54,199
So Piper is with him, and they're
kissing. And I'm not just talking about

30
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:56,519
your thanks-for-lunch
peck-on-the-cheek kind of kiss.

31
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:58,759
They mean business.

32
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,238
Okay. What is the problem? They
like each other. This is a good thing.

33
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,604
No, I know. I'm just worried
that she's moving too fast.

34
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,329
Like she's too in a hurry to get
involved with someone else.

35
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,528
Look, Piper's a big girl. And really, I
mean, it's none of our business, right?

36
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:15,522
- Right?
- Isn't it sort of our business?

37
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,801
Okay, Phoebe,

38
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,007
Piper cannot just sit around
for the rest of her life waiting for Leo.

39
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:22,488
She's trying to move on.

40
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:27,882
- Besides, Dan's a great guy.
- Okay, we're on in five, Miss Halliwell.

41
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:30,199
Okay, gotta go. Bye.

42
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:37,844
It's about freaking time.

43
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:41,960
Leo, whatever happened
to knocking?

44
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:45,405
I'm sorry, but there's no time. Where's
Prue and Piper? We have to talk.

45
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:48,402
You know, now's not really
a good time, okay? I know.

46
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:50,804
How about you orb back in
in, say, an hour?

47
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:52,800
- Okay? That would be great, bye-bye.
- I can't.

48
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:55,119
The worst thing imaginable
just happened.

49
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:59,201
No kidding.

50
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:42,237
It's not that it isn't great to see you,
Leo, because it is.

51
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,684
But you can't just orb in
whenever it's convenient.

52
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:46,965
It hasn't been a problem before.

53
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:48,926
Yeah. Well, things have changed.

54
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:50,728
- I can see that.
- Leo.

55
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:52,880
Sorry. Wasn't fair.

56
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:55,726
- Where's Prue?
- At work.

57
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,527
Fine, then we'll have to start
without her.

58
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:01,125
- Your friend Dan has to leave now.
- Oh, really? Why?

59
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:03,484
Because you and your sisters
have a very big problem.

60
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:05,401
A magical problem.

61
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:07,480
Look, this isn't personal.
It's business.

62
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:09,685
What else is new?

63
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:14,164
You know, that handyman guy sure
does seem to hang around here a lot.

64
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:17,366
Well, it's an old house.
Lots of things need fixing.

65
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:19,281
Then why is Piper so upset?

66
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,441
Because there are some things
that he can't fix

67
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,759
the way she wants it.

68
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:29,366
You know what, I'm late for a job.
If you can just have her call me later.

69
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:30,723
Lipstick.

70
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:32,521
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

71
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,249
- Are, like, Piper and Leo...?
- You're late.

72
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,161
Dan, wait.

73
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:42,079
Well, I wouldn't know
where to begin anyway.

74
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:44,444
- Everything okay, sweetie?
- Oh, no.

75
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:48,004
- Come on, we gotta get going.
- Going? Where are we going?

76
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:49,238
I'll explain on the way.

77
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,685
No, Leo, you'll explain now.
We're not going anywhere.

78
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,159
Two hundred years ago,
a good witch turned evil,

79
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:59,002
started using her craft
against innocents.

80
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:01,808
Fortunately, she was tricked
into a cave and entombed.

81
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:05,086
But unfortunately, this morning,
Tuatha escaped.

82
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:06,803
Tuatha?

83
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:09,005
Who wouldn't go bad
with a name like that?

84
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,763
So you want us to find her
and vanquish her. What's the big deal?

85
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:15,319
The big deal is you can't vanquish her.
No witch can.

86
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,247
She kills good witches.

87
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:19,964
Leo, if we can't defeat her,
then who can?

88
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:22,484
There's only one person.
He's known as the chosen one.

89
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:25,243
- The chosen one, is he a witch?
- No, he's a normal person,

90
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:28,287
other than the fact that he was born
to use Tuatha's wand against her.

91
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,164
So, what do you want from us?
Why don't you just go get him?

92
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:34,685
I need you to protect him from Tuatha
until the wand comes to him.

93
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:35,918
It shouldn't be long.

94
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:39,206
Lore has it that once the witch is free,
the wand will find him.

95
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:41,087
But if she finds it first...

96
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:44,400
- She'll kill the chosen one.
- And then she'll come after you too.

97
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:50,442
The design of inlaid garnets
with pewter and ebony

98
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:52,486
is distinctly 18th-century European.

99
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:55,368
Eighteenth century?
I had no idea it was that old.

100
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:58,168
The faceted-cut amber headpiece
surrounded by the symbolic snake

101
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,446
suggests that it was
an ornamental staff or a ritual wand.

102
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:04,840
And I bought it
at a flea market for 15 dollars.

103
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:09,885
But you'll be very pleased to hear that
at auction you could easily get $5,000.

104
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,801
Good Lord.

105
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,437
Of course, an item
is only worth as much

106
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:16,998
as someone is willing to pay for it,
though. Isn't that right?

107
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:19,319
I'm sorry, who are you?

108
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:22,606
Jack Sheridan,
from Sheridan Internet Auctions.

109
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:25,403
If you own it, I can sell it.

110
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:28,808
Okay. How nice for you.
But this is my appraisal.

111
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,881
Oh, and it's a very impressive one too.

112
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:35,724
But can you guarantee this nice lady
that someone will actually pay

113
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:38,357
$5,000 for this at auction?

114
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:41,487
- There are no guarantees, but...
- Thirty seconds.

115
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:46,240
Betty, I'm willing to give you
$1,000 cash today.

116
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:49,242
Yeah, well, then you would be
robbing her of $4,000.

117
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,044
But you said yourself that you
can't guarantee that.

118
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:56,762
Oh, but I suppose you just have
$1,000 cash in your pocket.

119
00:09:57,569 --> 00:09:59,719
Well, would you like
to find out yourself?

120
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:03,638
No need. I can tell there's
not much there just by looking.

121
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:11,286
Betty, I can have $1,000 cash for you
this afternoon. What do you say?

122
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:12,768
I say sold.

123
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:16,845
Here's my address.

124
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:22,680
- And I'll see you there this afternoon.
- It's a deal.

125
00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:25,409
Cut, and that's a wrap.
Excellent, folks.

126
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:28,129
- Very entertaining.
- Yeah, for you.

127
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:31,566
Look, forgive me, I just...
I wanted to be on the same stage

128
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,606
- as Prue Halliwell.
- Why?

129
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:37,364
Because it gives my startup company
instant credibility, that's why.

130
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:40,477
You know, if the other specialists
at Buckland's

131
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:43,447
have your expertise and talents,

132
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,043
I might reconsider
their standing job offer.

133
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:47,927
I turned them down last year.

134
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,798
You wouldn't like it here, Mr Sheridan.
We don't lie or cheat.

135
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:53,363
I don't lie.

136
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,327
You know what, l...
I better get to the bank.

137
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:59,525
I have a wand to buy.

138
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,920
Wanna bet?

139
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:16,726
I don't know. An evil witch who gets
her jollies killing good witches?

140
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,483
Maybe we should have waited
for Prue to get home.

141
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:21,765
- There's no time.
- Okay, please tell me we're here

142
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:24,159
because the chosen one is a big,
burly football coach.

143
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:27,605
No. But he is the seventh son
of the seventh son.

144
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,200
We've been watching him
since he was a young boy.

145
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:32,405
Okay, so how old is he now?

146
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:36,448
- See, over there.
- He's a high school student?

147
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:39,601
- And he's a nerd.
- Hey, I didn't choose him, they did.

148
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:41,686
If he can help save you,
that's all I care about.

149
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:44,921
Leo, he's a teenager. How can we
let him go up against Tuatha?

150
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:46,238
She'll destroy him.

151
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,764
Not if he finds the wand
and learns how to use it.

152
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:50,999
Besides, she knows
he's the chosen one.

153
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,967
If we don't help him, she'll find him
and destroy him anyway.

154
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:56,881
Doesn't sound like
we have much of a choice.

155
00:11:57,369 --> 00:12:00,964
This is wrong. He should be battling
acne at his age, not evil witches.

156
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:03,040
Yeah, but look at us.
Do we look like we should be

157
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:05,359
the all-powerful Charmed Ones?

158
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:09,522
- What's his name?
- Kyle. Kyle Gwydion.

159
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:11,600
- Does he know yet?
- No.

160
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:14,602
Any idea on how we're supposed to
get him to come with us?

161
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:19,320
I have an idea. He likes magic, right?
Let's show him ours.

162
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:23,563
- Hey. It's Kyle, right?
- Do I know you?

163
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:26,243
Not yet, but you will.
You'll know the both of us.

164
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:29,207
I think you might have me confused
with somebody else.

165
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:31,564
- Nope, you're the one.
- The chosen one.

166
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:32,957
That was real subtle.

167
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:35,689
You heard what Leo said,
clock's a-ticking. Hey, Kyle,

168
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:38,761
do you believe in magic?
Real magic?

169
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:41,006
I gotta go.

170
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:43,922
Piper, we have to show him
before someone sees.

171
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:45,722
Kyle.

172
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:50,249
- Now what?
- You wait here.

173
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,801
Behind you.

174
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,724
- How did you do that?
- Magic.

175
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,925
Wanna know more?

176
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,760
Help me, somebody.

177
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:38,759
Help me!

178
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:47,600
Well done.

179
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:50,527
That's my wand.

180
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:54,003
My God! Who are you?

181
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:57,320
The last being you will ever see.

182
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:00,841
Betty.

183
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:28,479
No. It's all right.

184
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,408
We don't have to follow her.

185
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:36,764
She's a good witch.
She'll come back to us.

186
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:52,807
- So you're witches.
- Right.

187
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:57,281
- And I'm the chosen one.
- Correct.

188
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:01,283
And why exactly am I
the chosen one again?

189
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:03,440
Because you're the only one
who can defeat Tuatha.

190
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:04,598
Leo, please.

191
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,521
I'm sorry, we don't have
a lot of time here.

192
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:09,078
All the more reason
not to freak Kyle out.

193
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:11,160
Too late.

194
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:17,041
Look, Kyle, I know that
this is a lot for you to take in.

195
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,121
And your first instinct
is probably to resist it.

196
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:23,725
I mean, I know that's how we felt when
we first found out we were witches.

197
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,083
Still do sometimes.

198
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:27,968
But we've learned that you
cannot fight your destiny.

199
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:31,166
It's like fighting who you are,
who you're meant to be.

200
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:34,958
And your destiny is to vanquish
the evil witch Tuatha.

201
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:39,921
I bet one of my brothers
put you up to this. Right?

202
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,920
What, Sean?

203
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:45,001
No, no, I bet... I bet it was lan.
Or Dylan?

204
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:47,125
I'm always the butt of their jokes.

205
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:50,486
- Kyle, listen...
- No, you... You listen.

206
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:52,965
This is a joke.

207
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:55,924
I'm not the chosen one.

208
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:58,287
I'm no one.

209
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:02,244
You made a mistake.

210
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:04,965
- Kyle, wait.
- What do we do? What do we do?

211
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,244
Stop him.

212
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,677
- Whoa, who are you?
- Nobody.

213
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:14,760
- It glowed.
- That's the wand.

214
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,681
It has to be, it recognizes you, Kyle.

215
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:19,488
- Recognizes? What do you mean?
- Where did you get that?

216
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:22,448
From someone that I think that
I should tell you about in private.

217
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:25,123
- Someone named Tuatha?
- Tuatha?

218
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:28,399
Let Kyle hold the wand.

219
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:37,325
Go ahead, it won't hurt you.

220
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:51,048
It found you,
just like it's supposed to.

221
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:52,642
Okay, time out. Attic, anyone?

222
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:54,967
Kyle, why don't you go
into the kitchen

223
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:56,687
and help yourself
to whatever you want.

224
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,966
- That is, if you're staying.
- I'm staying.

225
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:02,438
I don't know for how long, though.

226
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,606
I'll be right back.

227
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,248
Leo, he's just a kid. Besides,
you haven't seen Tuatha's power.

228
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:15,718
I mean, she made
a woman disappear, literally.

229
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:17,880
It's his destiny
to defeat Tuatha, Prue.

230
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:21,241
- Then why did I get the wand?
- To make sure it got to him.

231
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:24,202
It's part of the lore. If you guys
were meant to defeat Tuatha,

232
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,803
there would be a spell in
the Book of Shadows, and there isn't.

233
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:29,244
- He's right. We checked.
- Twice.

234
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:31,764
Which means we need to spend
what little time we have left

235
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:33,362
teaching Kyle how to use the wand.

236
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:36,960
Look, Leo, I know that you never
guided us down the wrong path before.

237
00:17:37,129 --> 00:17:40,326
But please, at least let us
try to defeat Tuatha.

238
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:42,844
If we fail, then fine,
we'll help you with Kyle.

239
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:44,283
She'll kill you.

240
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:46,885
Don't bet on it.

241
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:52,562
All right, we need to start by finding out
where Tuatha is before she finds us.

242
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:59,444
- Piper, are you with us?
- Yep.

243
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:09,640
Hey, it's me.

244
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:12,720
- Hi.
- Who are you?

245
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:16,601
Apparently, I'm the chosen one.

246
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:21,604
I haven't seen you around before.
What's your name?

247
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,321
- Kyle.
- Jenny.

248
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:25,922
- You a friend of theirs?
- No.

249
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:30,560
No, I'm just supposed to help them
with something. Maybe.

250
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:33,527
- I don't know.
- Well, what's that?

251
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:38,806
- It's magic.
- I don't believe in magic.

252
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:42,043
You're kidding.
Everybody believes in magic.

253
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:43,284
Not me.

254
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,323
That is so cool.
How are you doing that?

255
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:13,199
I have no idea.

256
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:17,439
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

257
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:19,681
I was just...

258
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:21,885
Telling your friend goodbye?

259
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:23,038
Fine, I can take a hint.

260
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:25,962
Just tell Piper that my uncle Dan
needs to talk to her, okay?

261
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:27,926
- Sure.
- Bye.

262
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:30,084
Bye.

263
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:32,809
So still think you're not
the chosen one?

264
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:45,000
There you are.

265
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:00,520
"To disempower a witch.

266
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:03,408
Fresh human heart."

267
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:12,401
- Here it is. A scrying spell.
- Scrying? What's that?

268
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:15,527
It's what witches use to magically find
something or someone.

269
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:20,285
It says that we need a map,
a piece of string and a crystal.

270
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:21,804
Okay.

271
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:27,240
Day three. I'm definitely lost
in the woods.

272
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:29,639
Separated from the other two.

273
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:31,879
Running out of food,

274
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:33,687
water.

275
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:35,521
Little scared.

276
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:38,601
- Sorry, did I scare you?
- Hell, yeah, you did.

277
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:39,804
Are you lost?

278
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:42,802
Yeah, totally. Just walking
around in circles.

279
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:46,439
Couple of friends and me were making
a documentary on the Blair Witch.

280
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:58,402
Did you know that it takes
15 to 20 seconds

281
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:01,606
for a person to die after their heart
has been damaged?

282
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:03,925
And since that time's almost up,

283
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:08,002
from the bottom of my heart,
I thank you for yours.

284
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:35,398
Okay, we found her.
Lost Caves, Muir Woods.

285
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:46,758
Yeah, l...

286
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:49,045
I can't make it do it again.

287
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:53,408
- You did it before.
- I don't know how.

288
00:21:53,569 --> 00:21:56,208
I mean, I was just trying
to impress Jenny, that's all.

289
00:21:56,489 --> 00:22:00,243
Well, that's how. It came from
your heart, from inside of you.

290
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:01,842
- You willed it.
- So what?

291
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:06,082
So I'm supposed to will
some evil witch dead?

292
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,685
But why me? You know,
I don't understand, out of all people...

293
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:13,319
Don't sell yourself short, Kyle.
You saw what you did before.

294
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:15,286
Now, that was you.

295
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:18,282
All you have to do
is believe in yourself.

296
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:21,685
Now, try it again.

297
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:30,047
Leo, we found her.

298
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:32,006
So we're gonna go pay her
a little visit.

299
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:33,682
No, wait, don't. Please.

300
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:37,122
It's nothing personal, Leo,
it's just business.

301
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:49,401
You.

302
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:53,767
Thrilled to see me, I see.
This is a really nice house, Prue.

303
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:56,284
Buckland's obviously pays
better than I thought.

304
00:22:56,449 --> 00:22:58,167
What do you want,
and how did you find me?

305
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:02,527
I followed your scent.
Must de Cartier, right?

306
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:05,965
Now, that is a classy perfume.
Though I'm hardly surprised.

307
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:08,359
Could I have my wand back, please?

308
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,804
You see, Betty never called,
and I couldn't contact her,

309
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:13,961
because her address mysteriously
fell out of my pocket somehow.

310
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:16,006
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

311
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:19,206
So you're blaming me
for something that you lost.

312
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:21,360
Isn't that a little juvenile?
I mean, what's next,

313
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:24,566
a shoving match on the jungle gym,
a war over juice cups?

314
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:26,879
Prue, we really need to get going.

315
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:29,165
The wand is mine, Prue,
and you know it.

316
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:30,808
All's fair in love and war.

317
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:33,118
Piper.

318
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:35,678
- Hi, Dan.
- Piper, wait...

319
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:39,600
- Is he still here?
- Never left, actually.

320
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:43,239
Prue, I'm kind of in a hurry here,
so if I could just get my wand and...

321
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:45,798
All right, you know what?
Dan, Piper will call you back later.

322
00:23:45,969 --> 00:23:47,482
You, whoever you are,
sorry, no wand.

323
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:49,287
Leo, keep working with Kyle,
just in case.

324
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:52,122
Us, out the back door.
Out the back door.

325
00:23:57,249 --> 00:23:59,604
Don't you have
some other house to repair?

326
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:00,884
No.

327
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:07,957
We should be getting close.

328
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,360
Hey, there it is.

329
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:18,883
Kind of creepy in there. And dark.

330
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:21,358
All right, I'll go in first,
since she only knows about me.

331
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:24,726
You guys just wait a couple
of seconds, then follow.

332
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:49,917
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

333
00:25:12,729 --> 00:25:15,289
Thank you for not
keeping me waiting long.

334
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:17,201
- How did you know that...?
- Neophyte witches

335
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:18,722
are always so predictable.

336
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:23,720
Like I said, I cast a spell,
removed your powers.

337
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,005
Obviously, you didn't
count on that, witch.

338
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:29,042
And obviously, you didn't
count on her sister witches.

339
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,643
Are you guys okay?

340
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:39,404
Three witches.
I'll be ready for that next time.

341
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:43,362
Cool.

342
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:46,520
Well, it was.

343
00:25:56,169 --> 00:25:58,205
Both hands. All right,
you have to use both hands.

344
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:00,360
I didn't need both hands
when I made it spin before.

345
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:02,326
Well, you'll need both hands
against Tuatha.

346
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:04,719
If she gets the wand from you,
she becomes invincible,

347
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:06,925
and you will not
be able to vanquish her.

348
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:10,684
Now, just do as I say.
Pretend I'm evil, all right?

349
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:13,682
You connect to your destiny
by connecting to yourself.

350
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:15,840
Will me away.

351
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,285
Look, give it up, Obi-Wan, all right?

352
00:26:30,449 --> 00:26:32,440
- You got the wrong guy.
- No, I don't.

353
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:34,600
All right, you are not just
the seventh son.

354
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:37,522
You are the seventh generation
of chosen ones.

355
00:26:37,689 --> 00:26:40,999
It's in your blood.
You just have to believe.

356
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:43,200
Believe in what?

357
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,439
What, myself?

358
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:47,807
Forget it.

359
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:50,244
- Look, you can't just give up.
- Just did.

360
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:54,004
Innocent people are going to die.
Are you willing to live with that?

361
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:56,125
No, now, don't you
lay that crap on me!

362
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:58,405
Oh, does that make you mad?

363
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,805
Good. At least that means
finally you're being the real you.

364
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,084
Screw you.

365
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:06,205
That's right, get pissed at me.
Show me your anger.

366
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:08,485
Maybe you'll figure out
what you're really angry about.

367
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:11,243
You don't think you're the chosen one,
you think you're forgotten.

368
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:13,400
Sick and tired of it too, aren't you?
Aren't you?

369
00:27:19,729 --> 00:27:21,208
Leo?

370
00:27:29,209 --> 00:27:30,961
Not bad.

371
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,645
What was that crash?

372
00:27:34,449 --> 00:27:37,247
- What happened in here?
- Little training, that's all.

373
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:40,321
"That's all"? Do you have any idea
how much that's gonna cost to fix?

374
00:27:40,489 --> 00:27:43,925
Well, I know who's gonna be fixing it.
Leo, what if somebody saw you?

375
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:45,488
Oh, someone like neighbour Dan?

376
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:49,881
- Hey, you're bleeding.
- It's nothing.

377
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:53,525
- So you guys kick some butt or what?
- Or what.

378
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:56,283
Tuatha was ready for us,
or at least for me.

379
00:27:56,449 --> 00:27:58,007
She stripped away my power.

380
00:27:58,249 --> 00:28:01,082
And then literally disappeared
before I had the chance to freeze her.

381
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:04,125
It's a good thing she wasn't
expecting all three of us,

382
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:05,847
or we wouldn't have
gotten out of there.

383
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:09,206
You're lucky you did.
Now, will you help me with Kyle?

384
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:11,678
Why are you so ready to send
a teenager up against an evil

385
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:14,283
- that we can't even defeat?
- Because he can.

386
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:16,758
At least, he can with the wand.

387
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,806
And he's getting better at it too.

388
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:20,448
I'm out of here.

389
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:21,678
- Kyle, wait.
- No.

390
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:25,882
What the hell is the matter with you?
They're even scared of her.

391
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:30,645
I told you, you have made
a huge mistake. I can't do this.

392
00:28:38,689 --> 00:28:41,761
Leo, you can't make him.
Even if it is his destiny.

393
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,920
I hope he doesn't tell anyone
we're witches.

394
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,807
Won't matter much if we're dead.

395
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:48,085
Okay, nobody knows
the Book of Shadows better than you.

396
00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:50,558
So if black magic
can strip away powers,

397
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,880
then surely white magic
can do the same, right? Let's go.

398
00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:05,958
Joshua!

399
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:10,119
- I'm telling you, Heath, he's dead.
- He's not dead, Michael.

400
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:12,564
Joshua!

401
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:16,081
Hey.

402
00:29:16,449 --> 00:29:18,007
Looking for the Blair Witch?

403
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:30,486
Before the passing of this hour
Take away all of their powers

404
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,685
Find my wand.

405
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:01,204
Want me to heal that for you?

406
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:04,285
- I'm fine.
- Come on.

407
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:05,518
No.

408
00:30:05,689 --> 00:30:10,968
It just gets all confusing when
we're close and when you touch me.

409
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:13,723
I don't wanna be confused anymore.

410
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:15,242
Hey.

411
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:19,728
Look, Leo, you just do your job,
and I'll do mine, okay?

412
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:25,723
This is my job, Piper.

413
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:43,401
Thanks.

414
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:46,241
He'll never understand you,
you know.

415
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:48,843
Your secret, what you're all about.

416
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,324
Not like I can.

417
00:30:56,929 --> 00:30:58,521
Maybe not.

418
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:02,238
But at least I can count on him
to be there for me when I need him.

419
00:31:15,129 --> 00:31:17,848
- Kyle! Uncle Dan, stop.
- Who's he?

420
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,204
Just some friend of Piper's.
He's cool.

421
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:22,121
- I'll be home soon.
- Soon when?

422
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:24,041
- An hour?
- School night.

423
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,326
Half an hour.

424
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:28,363
Hey.

425
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:30,042
Where you going?

426
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:32,120
Just out of here.

427
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:34,883
- Where's your magic wand?
- It's not mine.

428
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:38,280
- Never was.
- Sure could have fooled me.

429
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:40,440
Are you okay?

430
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:44,047
How long have you known
the Halliwells?

431
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:46,325
Couple months. Why?

432
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:51,120
They have this screwed-up idea
that I'm...

433
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:54,642
Well, that I'm somebody that I'm not.

434
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:57,120
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

435
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:59,928
Phoebe once told me
that if it matters to you, it matters.

436
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:03,281
So if they think you're somebody,
Kyle, then you probably are.

437
00:32:08,129 --> 00:32:09,801
Thanks.

438
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:44,521
Piper?

439
00:32:45,249 --> 00:32:46,568
Any luck?

440
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:49,562
Well, I did find one spell,
but it requires a human heart,

441
00:32:49,729 --> 00:32:51,720
and unfortunately,
we're all still using ours.

442
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:54,768
Well, take mine. All it does
is get me in trouble anyway.

443
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,969
- Snake.
- Oh, I'm the snake?

444
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:00,881
- But you're the one who...
- Snake!

445
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:18,967
Look out!

446
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:24,206
- Tuatha... Okay, Piper, freeze him.
- I'm trying. It's not working.

447
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:27,279
Prue! Prue.

448
00:33:27,449 --> 00:33:29,519
Prue. What should we do?

449
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:33,878
- Kyle.
- Leo, do something.

450
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:37,969
Kyle, catch.

451
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:45,125
Die!

452
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:55,798
Thanks.

453
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:14,159
Okay, this is a potion
to induce sleep.

454
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:18,117
This one is to repel an evil threat.
And that one puts out a fire.

455
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:22,202
- What kind of potion does that?
- None. It's water.

456
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:25,640
I didn't have a lot of time. It was
the best that I could do, okay?

457
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:28,563
What about the potion
to give Kyle more courage?

458
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:30,321
I remembered wrong.
There isn't one.

459
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:34,240
- Well, that's disappointing.
- You guys, I'm scared.

460
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:37,719
And not just for him, but for us.

461
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,925
I don't like feeling so powerless.

462
00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:44,088
Maybe that's our lesson for the day,
not taking our powers for granted.

463
00:34:44,529 --> 00:34:46,804
Maybe. But if we're gonna
get our powers back,

464
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:49,164
then we're gonna have to help Kyle
defeat Tuatha.

465
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:51,365
Well, we're just gonna
have to find a way

466
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:54,839
to make Kyle feel more courageous
without magic, that's all.

467
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,681
Come on.

468
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:01,201
- How's it going?
- Good.

469
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:03,405
- I think he's ready.
- You think?

470
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,241
I'm ready.

471
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:07,764
I mean, as ready
as I can be, anyway.

472
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:12,128
You know, it's funny, I always
wanted to be somebody special.

473
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:14,405
You should be careful
what you wish for.

474
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:16,161
Believe me, we can relate.

475
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:22,398
Phoebe, the sleeping potion.

476
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,519
So young. So new to the craft.

477
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:33,566
Now, this is a sleeping potion.

478
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:45,608
Hey! What the...?

479
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:48,767
Now, the wand, if you please.

480
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:55,165
Not much of a chosen one, are you?

481
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:57,797
At least the last one
was able to entomb me.

482
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:59,721
Like I will now entomb you.

483
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:01,561
Prue, the courage potion.

484
00:36:05,689 --> 00:36:09,762
- What? There is no courage potion.
- No? Now who's teaching who?

485
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:12,800
Kyle, get the wand. You can do it.

486
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:18,999
I wish for the wand.

487
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:23,884
My wand!

488
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:35,443
Don't give up, Kyle. Believe.

489
00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:01,727
- I wish you gone forever!
- No!

490
00:37:13,249 --> 00:37:14,568
Leo.

491
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:23,006
- You're hurt.
- I'm okay.

492
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:33,722
- Let me get you some ice.
- Really, I'm fine.

493
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:37,127
- Are you getting even?
- No.

494
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:39,527
Just finally getting it.

495
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:41,880
What you want.

496
00:37:42,689 --> 00:37:44,645
What you deserve.

497
00:37:46,049 --> 00:37:48,722
A normal life...

498
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:52,767
...or at least as normal of a life
as you can get.

499
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:56,642
Which means a normal relationship.

500
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:58,322
Which I can't give you.

501
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:05,000
Guess we know now why witches
and whitelighters

502
00:38:05,169 --> 00:38:07,637
aren't supposed to fall in love, huh?

503
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:24,641
- It's broken.
- It served its purpose.

504
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:26,401
Yeah.

505
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:29,919
Thanks to your magical boost
of courage.

506
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:33,161
Kyle, Tuatha was right.

507
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:35,889
There was no courage potion,
we made it up.

508
00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:38,643
You defeated her all by yourself.

509
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:41,278
Well, still, it doesn't...

510
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:43,644
Doesn't change anything.

511
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:46,323
Nobody would believe me
even if I told them what I did.

512
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:48,884
Yeah, but you know what you did.

513
00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:50,721
And as long as you keep
believing in that,

514
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:53,005
you can change whatever you want.

515
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:56,280
Who knows what
you're still destined for.

516
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,369
What are you gonna tell him about
what happened to the poor lady

517
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:10,999
- who owned the wand?
- Well, what can I tell him?

518
00:39:11,169 --> 00:39:14,127
Look, I called him because I just
wanna get rid of this thing, that's all.

519
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:16,803
Are you sure it's not just an excuse
to see him again?

520
00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:20,120
Phoebe, don't be ridiculous.
This is business, it's not personal.

521
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:23,087
Where have I heard that before?

522
00:39:23,889 --> 00:39:25,242
Got a date, gotta go.

523
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:28,685
Well, for what it's worth,
I think Jack is pretty cute.

524
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:30,726
Yeah, well, he's a jerk.
How do I look?

525
00:39:30,889 --> 00:39:33,357
- Fab.
- Thanks.

526
00:39:34,209 --> 00:39:37,281
Hey. I just thought that you
might wanna have this back.

527
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:40,327
I mean, after all,
it is rightfully yours. Okay.

528
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:42,320
Hold it.

529
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:44,965
What's wrong with this picture?

530
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:46,528
Looks like it broke.

531
00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:48,761
Keen eye, Prue.

532
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:51,204
It kind of lowers the value
of the wand, don't you think?

533
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,601
Bright side, at least it's worth
what you were gonna buy it for now.

534
00:39:58,009 --> 00:39:59,601
Come on. Have a drink.

535
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:02,727
You can brag to me how you
outsmarted me with the wand.

536
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,037
I do like to learn from the best.

537
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:10,443
Okay, I'll brag a little.

538
00:40:12,649 --> 00:40:14,401
Bartender.

539
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:19,881
- Right this way, sir.
- Thanks.

540
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:21,323
You're welcome.

541
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:24,045
- Hi.
- Hi.

542
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,961
After you.

543
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:31,725
Thanks for coming. I hope a late,
late dinner is okay with you.

544
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:34,244
Look, I'm gonna make this
easy for you.

545
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,488
I know that you
and that handyman, Leon...

546
00:40:37,649 --> 00:40:40,288
- Leo.
- Right, Leo.

547
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,600
I know that you guys
are more than just friends.

548
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:48,326
I'm not dumb. I mean,
he's always around the house...

549
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:51,481
Dan, it's over.

550
00:40:54,729 --> 00:40:57,527
Oh, no, I don't mean you and me,
I meant him and me.

551
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,202
That's why I wanted
to see you tonight.

552
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:02,008
I didn't want there to be
any more confusion.

553
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:05,161
You sure?

554
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,001
Yeah, I'm sure.
