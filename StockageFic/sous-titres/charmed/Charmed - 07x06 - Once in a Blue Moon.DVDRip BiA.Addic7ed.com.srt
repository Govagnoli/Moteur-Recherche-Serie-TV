1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,428
Any idea what this meeting's all about?

2
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:15,557
- Probably to do with the kids.
- Why, did something happen?

3
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,603
I'm sure they've gotten kidnapped
by the latest demon or something.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,356
Paige, that is so not funny.

5
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,942
You get so emotional when you're PMS.

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:28,320
- Yeah, and you get mean.
- I do not get mean!

7
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:31,240
I'm above it all. Nothing happens to me.

8
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,533
Alrighty, then...

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,205
Right, nothing happens to you,
you're above it all.

10
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,123
Fine, so I get a little jumpy.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,001
- I get a little pissy, so watch it.
- We know.

12
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,379
Good news is,
we're over it at the same time.

13
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,215
As long as we don't
kill each other in the process.

14
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,759
Which brings me
to what we need to talk about.

15
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,386
That sounds serious.

16
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,305
That calls for ice cream
with three spoons.

17
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:58,517
Personal gain!

18
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:02,062
I know, but screw it, it's too good.

19
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:06,900
Anyway, I've been wanting
to tell you guys something for a while,

20
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,238
- I just didn't know how to say it.
- God, are you pregnant again?

21
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,825
No, this is not a good thing.

22
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,745
Do you guys remember Zola,
the Elder who disappeared?

23
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,498
- Yeah.
- Well, he didn't disappear.

24
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,041
He was killed.

25
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,585
Leo killed him.

26
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,253
Leo killed him?

27
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,840
It was an accident, he didn't mean to.

28
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,177
- I mean, he was tricked.
- You might want to tell that to Zola.

29
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,441
Hey, hey. What was that?

30
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,109
I was angry.

31
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,487
Yeah, but you blew it up
without even looking at it.

32
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,698
Our emotions are tied to our powers.

33
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,201
Apparently, I'm feeling a little weird.

34
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,660
Okay, but...

35
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,039
I was just looking for
a little understanding, that's all.

36
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:06,835
I know, we're sorry. It's just,
we're not fans of the Elders now.

37
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:11,757
It's not like Leo could hurt anybody.
We don't believe he could do that.

38
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,259
The Elders don't think that way.

39
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,429
If they prove he did,
they won't think he did by accident.

40
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:23,352
Sorry to interrupt. I have to tell you
something you're not gonna like.

41
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,020
Did you kill anybody else?

42
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,898
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,984
- You told them?
- I had to, it affects them too.

44
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:34,613
More than you know. They wanna
assign you a new Whitelighter.

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,740
- What?
- They're getting suspicious.

46
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,368
They wanna make sure you're protected.

47
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:43,205
- Protected from what? You?
- They're out of their minds.

48
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,416
- He's gonna be here tomorrow.
- I hope I don't blow him up.

49
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:51,255
- You can't blow up a Whitelighter.
- Why? She blows you up all the time.

50
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,843
We have enough people orbing in and out
on a daily basis. We don't need another.

51
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,555
Got it.

52
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,809
That was a great toaster.

53
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,077
You probably shouldn't
be doing that out in the open.

54
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,538
Please, nobody's here. It's midnight.

55
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,458
Besides, I would have sensed
if anybody was coming.

56
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,919
- You didn't sense me.
- You're an Elder.

57
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,130
Or, at least, you used to be.

58
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,673
I'm just here to tell you

59
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:38,218
that maybe you don't want
to go by the sisters' house tomorrow.

60
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,054
- Just a friendly warning.
- Oh, yeah?

61
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,224
Did you warn Zola too,
before something happened to him?

62
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,934
See, the word's out.

63
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,437
Nobody knows
which side you're on anymore.

64
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,565
Which is precisely why
I am going to the sisters'.

65
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,359
It's a dream job for any Whitelighter.

66
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:58,322
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to prepare myself.

67
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,795
Leo?

68
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,918
Oh, no! Oh, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

69
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,378
That's the second batch!

70
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,422
Would you turn that thing off?

71
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,424
I'll get the ladder.

72
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,968
Forget it!

73
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:30,432
- Okay, what is going on with you guys?
- Witches with PMS, look out!

74
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,020
Great. Now, not only am I exhausted,
but I'm starving.

75
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:40,192
I see your exhausted and your starving
and I raise you bloated.

76
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:44,613
Oh, no! No, that is so sad!

77
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,074
No weeping, you promised.

78
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,743
Have you guys seen
the new Whitelighter yet?

79
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,872
- No, you probably scared him off.
- No, that's the thing, I didn't.

80
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,542
He should've been here by now.
I'll be back.

81
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,086
Better not be with that Whitelighter.

82
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,921
Anyone else have weird dreams?

83
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:05,467
- No, you?
- Yeah, they were violent and painful.

84
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,637
- Hey, wanna go somewhere with me?
- Where?

85
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:12,349
I have to go over to Agent Brody's
place and try to snoop around.

86
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,226
Find out if he's a demon or not.

87
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,019
You think he's a demon?

88
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,064
- No, I don't. But Piper does.
- I don't know what he is.

89
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,025
More importantly,
we need to find out what he wants.

90
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,612
We have enough to worry about
without having to worry about him.

91
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,741
Can you go with Miss Jumpy, make sure
she doesn't orb out in front of him,

92
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,952
in case he is a Fed and nothing else?

93
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,913
- I can control myself.
- I can't go. I have to go to work.

94
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,708
I thought you weren't
going for a couple of days.

95
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,294
I'm not, but that's
when Les leaves and I...

96
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,546
I have this feeling he's pulling away.

97
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:46,425
Maybe he's pulling away from you
because he's, I don't know, leaving?

98
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,052
That might be true.

99
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,181
Okay, would you just
please be careful around Brody,

100
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,934
and we'll talk about
Leo moving in when I get back.

101
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,610
Odin?

102
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,947
- Where have you been?
- With the girls.

103
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,283
Why? What happened?

104
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,994
- What's wrong with him?
- You don't know?

105
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,454
No, I don't know.

106
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,999
- Think I did this?
- We don't know.

107
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,336
He was to report to the Charmed Ones
and you didn't want him to.

108
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:26,131
That makes me guilty? How do
you know a Darklighter didn't do this?

109
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:30,385
Does it look like a Darklighter
did that? You were the last to see him,

110
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,513
just like you were the last to see Zola.

111
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:36,266
- It wasn't me.
- No?

112
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,977
Then who was it?

113
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,734
Have a nice nap. Sweet dreams.

114
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,825
- Hey, can we talk to you for a sec?
- What about?

115
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,828
Well, it's about Leo.
You know, moving back in.

116
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:01,041
- Is there a problem?
- You know, we love... love Leo. But...

117
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,378
- But?
- You sure this is a good time for this?

118
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,923
I mean, like you said,
it's really crazy. So much is going on.

119
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,300
- Yeah, Zola, the Elders...
- Agent Brody.

120
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,262
And... he does hear voices.

121
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,472
We all hear voices sometimes.

122
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,394
We might hear voices, but we don't
see floating heads going with them.

123
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,856
All the more reason he should
be here, where he is safe.

124
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,816
- What about the boys?
- What?

125
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,110
Aren't you afraid they'll be in danger?

126
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,195
From who, Leo? That's ridiculous.

127
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,574
- No, whoever's after Leo.
- Have you thought it through?

128
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,119
Look, I just want my family back,
isn't that enough?

129
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:43,333
What is going on with our powers lately?

130
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,336
I don't know,
but it's getting awfully expensive.

131
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,923
- What happened?
- Good question.

132
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,760
I'll be with Leslie, we'll talk about
what we were talking about later.

133
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,847
- Nothing to talk about.
- Want me to cast a spell to clean?

134
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,849
No more magic unless we have to.

135
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,058
We might have to.

136
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,520
I found out why the Whitelighter
didn't show. He was attacked.

137
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,231
- By a Darklighter?
- No, by me.

138
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:09,651
- That's what the Elders think.
- You've gotta be kidding.

139
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,571
- I was the last one to see him.
- Well, obviously not.

140
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,449
- Maybe the Elders are setting you up.
- Piper...

141
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,619
What? They haven't been
your greatest allies lately.

142
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,205
I'm concerned that it
has to do with you guys.

143
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:25,000
I mean, he was gonna come here
and be your Whitelighter, your guide.

144
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,628
Maybe somebody doesn't want that.

145
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,840
- I'll check the Book of Shadows.
- I'll do it. Find out about Brody.

146
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,593
He could have something to do with this.

147
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,807
Listen, I'm sorry
for getting you into all this.

148
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,686
It's not your fault. Let's go prove it.

149
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,242
Since when do you read horoscopes?

150
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:03,580
Since I decided to make
Conflicted in Castro my last letter.

151
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,792
She doesn't know
if she should stay with someone.

152
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,670
Worries that their signs
might not be compatible.

153
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:13,465
- I didn't know you believed in that.
- Well, I don't, but I know you do.

154
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,634
I'm just channelling the boss here.

155
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:17,845
Let me see.

156
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:23,517
"Expect the unexpected when the
mystical second blue moon of the year

157
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:28,647
rises over the next three nights, and
Mars and Aries... Romance can flourish."

158
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:32,109
- Sounds promising.
- Yeah, for her maybe.

159
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,531
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

160
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,950
Les, something's wrong.

161
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,953
I know it is.
I've been feeling it the last few days.

162
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,582
- I've been feeling the same from you.
- Do you wanna talk about it?

163
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:50,836
What's there to talk about? I'm moving,
you're back and that's it, isn't it?

164
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,046
- It doesn't have to be.
- Doesn't it?

165
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,341
What are we gonna do,
fly back and forth and see each other?

166
00:11:56,508 --> 00:12:00,012
- You're only moving to LA.
- After that I'm moving to Philly.

167
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,723
- We'll work it out.
- We barely see each other.

168
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,893
- How're we gonna do it long-distance?
- We see each other.

169
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,731
Only when you don't bail at
the last minute. Which you do, admit it.

170
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:16,069
- Yeah...
- Editorial is waiting on your copy.

171
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,865
All right, all right.
I... I gotta do this.

172
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,243
Okay, so when do you wanna talk?

173
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,289
I don't know.
How about tonight at dinner?

174
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,124
I can't do it tonight.

175
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,878
But I can do breakfast tomorrow,
and then maybe dinner?

176
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:35,130
And then maybe breakfast again?

177
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,425
I'll hold you to it.

178
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,836
Definitely a bachelor.

179
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,963
Hey!

180
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,096
Guess the secret's out.

181
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:28,725
- Can you do that whenever you want to?
- And apparently when I don't want.

182
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,519
Piper's gonna kill me.

183
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,355
- I won't tell her.
- Thank you.

184
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:37,401
Not as long as you tell me
why you broke into my apartment.

185
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,822
Blackmailing.
I knew there'd be something.

186
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,365
Let me guess.

187
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,701
You don't believe I'm a federal agent.

188
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:51,081
You came here to find out
if I'm a demon or something, right?

189
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:52,749
Maybe.

190
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,502
Best way to find out
is to test my blood, isn't it?

191
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:59,464
Funny, for a guy
who claims he's not a demon,

192
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:04,094
- you sure do know a lot about them.
- No, I know a lot about witches.

193
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,221
I know a lot about you.

194
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,976
Go ahead, forensic kit's right there.
I've got nothing to hide.

195
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,444
- May I?
- You may.

196
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:32,206
- If that's O positive, you owe me.
- I don't owe you anything.

197
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,418
I don't have much time Paige.
None of us do.

198
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:40,631
If I'm right, there's a threat coming.
A power unlike anything you've seen.

199
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:45,677
- You're gonna need my help to stop it.
- How do I know you're not the threat?

200
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,138
I don't wanna hurt you.

201
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,526
- I give up.
- We've gotta be missing something.

202
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:04,071
Only thing that attacks
a Whitelighter is a Darklighter.

203
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,490
He wasn't shot with poison,
he was mauled.

204
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:09,743
- What do you mean, like, by an animal?
- I don't know.

205
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,371
Whatever it was,
it's gotta be supernatural.

206
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,414
Otherwise, he would've orbed out.

207
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,292
There's gotta be more than one,
he was so messed up.

208
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,546
- So we'll set a trap.
- A trap?

209
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,675
- With crystals, we've done it before.
- What'll you use to lure the demons?

210
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:26,927
Whitelighter, if they're after that.

211
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,930
- Elders'll never go for it.
- Nobody's gonna get hurt.

212
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:34,685
We'll set the trap for whoever
or whatever it is before they attack.

213
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:38,397
If we don't find out who's doing this,
they're gonna keep blaming you.

214
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,732
This could exonerate you for everything.

215
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,113
I'll get the boys,
you should take them to Magic School.

216
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,789
You can't be saved.

217
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,917
You're a danger to them all.

218
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,889
Well, that oughta do it.

219
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:15,184
That ought to do what?
Burn down the house?

220
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,895
Remember, we don't know
what we're up against.

221
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,105
So I just thought
I'd throw in the works.

222
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:24,484
You're not ready yet? You're still
working on the vanquishing potion?

223
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,654
- I'm refining it.
- You called me down here an hour ago!

224
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,700
- We don't know when they'll attack.
- You mean maul me.

225
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:34,661
You know, for a Whitelighter,
you're really wimpy.

226
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,165
- That's why they sent him.
- I heard that.

227
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:42,127
Relax, will you, please?
We're not gonna let anybody hurt you.

228
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,337
Hey, where's Leo?

229
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,131
At Magic School so he
has an alibi when they attack.

230
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:49,426
When they attack,
all we do is trigger the crystals?

231
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:52,179
Theoretically,
but that's why we have backup.

232
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,349
- Did you test Brody's blood yet?
- Yeah, he's not a demon.

233
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,601
That makes him tomorrow's problem.

234
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:01,063
- How's it going in here?
- The sitting duck is still sitting.

235
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,442
- Grumpy. Very grumpy.
- Remember, it's almost midnight.

236
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:09,988
- That's when things get exciting.
- Especially with a blue moon rising.

237
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:12,658
Wait a second.

238
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,578
That reminds me
of something I read in the Book

239
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:20,374
about how if there are
two blue moons in one year,

240
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,043
that seems
to only happen every 50 years.

241
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,878
That doesn't bode well.

242
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,554
Pretty...

243
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,352
What the hell?

244
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,894
- Wake up. Wake up, wake up!
- Where are the boys?

245
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,022
- The boys are fine, we're not!
- Keep it down.

246
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,318
- Hey!
- Hey, yourself! Look!

247
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,030
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

248
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:35,574
- What happened?
- We're what happened to him.

249
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:38,327
- What are you talking about?
- We're in the cage.

250
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:40,162
I think we trapped ourselves.

251
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:43,540
- No, we didn't. Did we?
- I think that dream I had was real.

252
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,543
So, you're saying
that we did this to him?

253
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,296
- You have a better explanation?
- That is crazy.

254
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,301
As you were saying?

255
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,762
Okay, what does this mean?
We're demons?

256
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:01,016
- No, we didn't turn into demons.
- We turned into monsters.

257
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,852
We're testy, but that's ridiculous.

258
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,480
It can't be that.
It's gotta be something else.

259
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:10,150
- The blue moon?
- We gotta get out, this is crazy.

260
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,195
Paige, try to orb
one of these crystals away.

261
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,446
Crystal!

262
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:21,537
Blue moon?

263
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,957
Bright side,
the Elders can't blame Leo any more.

264
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,750
No, now they can blame us.

265
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,753
Take him to Magic School
and find someone to heal him.

266
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,463
How do I explain that?

267
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,507
Tell them that we got knocked out.

268
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:37,803
Whatever you do, stay calm and don't
turn into anything in front of them.

269
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,186
Gotta find a way
to stop this from happening.

270
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,981
I can't. I have to go
meet Leslie for breakfast.

271
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,608
- Come on!
- I know, but if I don't show up again,

272
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,111
he's never gonna talk
to me again. Gotta go.

273
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,363
Better be home before the moon rises.

274
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,657
And stay away from red meat.

275
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,792
I thought you were
supposed to trap them?

276
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:12,880
- It kinda caught us by surprise.
- You see what they look like? Demons?

277
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,882
It was night.

278
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,427
We have to find who did this
and vanquish them before they attack.

279
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:21,972
I'm ordering a lockdown
until we catch these beasts.

280
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,808
"Beasts". That's a harsh word,
don't you think?

281
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:29,188
At least you've been exonerated.
I'm sorry I doubted you.

282
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,481
So am I.

283
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,818
We have a lot of healing to do,
Leo, I admit.

284
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,821
Forgiveness must prevail
if we're to work together.

285
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,574
Now, this New Power that we're sensing,

286
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:44,077
it is coming closer
and it's more threatening.

287
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,372
- Okay, New Power. What New Power?
- We don't know exactly.

288
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:51,585
But if it's responsible for this attack,
Elders could be next.

289
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,462
Help us, Leo.

290
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,303
- Okay, I have to find Agent Brody.
- Why?

291
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,557
He talked about that New Power thing.
He must know something about it.

292
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,310
Be careful. Watch out for those beasts.

293
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:12,439
- About those beasts... That would be us.
- What are you talking about?

294
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:15,651
Those funky powers,
the sharp fangs, the claws.

295
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:20,280
We're the ones attacking Whitelighters.
Something is transforming us.

296
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,826
It may not be
this blue moon thing, after all.

297
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,703
I have to go.

298
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:44,763
Leslie! Hi! I am so sorry.

299
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,975
I'm here now. Things got
a little wild back at the house.

300
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:52,020
- Phoebe, it's a quarter to ten!
- I know, and I would have called, but...

301
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,273
Leslie, please... I said I was sorry!

302
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,608
I know you are. You always are.

303
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,277
Don't be mad at me.

304
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:02,281
- Come on, I really wanted to be here.
- Let me guess, something came up?

305
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:05,868
- Yes.
- You can't tell me, you never can.

306
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:09,288
- Not because I don't want to...
- It's complicated. I know.

307
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:12,040
Would you stop
finishing my sentences, please?

308
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,334
Well, why not?
They all end the same way!

309
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:22,634
Look... I'm sorry, it's just...
I'm frustrated.

310
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,139
I didn't think
I was gonna like you this much.

311
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,767
Yeah, I know the feeling.

312
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,939
I gotta go to work.

313
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:39,276
Wouldn't wanna be late on my last day.

314
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,040
Paige.

315
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:55,792
Since when do you use doors?

316
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,878
Look, I need to talk to you.

317
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:01,048
Great, don't tell me I didn't check out.

318
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:04,051
What? No, you checked out.
You knew you would.

319
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:08,305
I need to talk to you about the New
Power thing you were telling me about.

320
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:11,266
- Did something happen?
- I'm not sure.

321
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:14,728
Let's just say that you aren't
the only one who's concerned.

322
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,231
- Did you see? Did they attack?
- Just curious,

323
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,358
how do you even know
about them anyway?

324
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:23,403
- That's a... That's a long story.
- Why not give me the short version?

325
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:26,615
Look, you said you
wanted my help, didn't you?

326
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,700
No, I said that you would need mine.

327
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,081
Please, will you
just tell me what you know?

328
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:35,916
I just know they're coming.

329
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,794
That's why I'm here. I... I don't know.

330
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:41,296
Everything seems
to fit a certain pattern.

331
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,549
Pattern? What pattern?

332
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:50,430
All I know is that they come from
ancient times, when they were in power.

333
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:54,142
I'm not sure why, but something
happened and they went away.

334
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:58,146
Now they're trying to come back.
They've been trying for some time.

335
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:01,817
And to do that, they need power.

336
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,403
And that's the pattern.

337
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,447
I mean, they're always after it.

338
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,159
It won't be long
before they come after yours.

339
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,953
I think they may have already tried.

340
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,038
You can't let them.

341
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:19,626
You gotta do everything
you can to stop them, otherwise...

342
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:22,754
- Otherwise what?
- They're gonna kill you.

343
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,258
Just like they killed my parents.

344
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:39,688
I was... five when it happened.

345
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,234
No one knew who did it.

346
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,947
That's why I became a cop. To find out.

347
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:54,912
I never would've imagined that it
would've brought me to here, but it has.

348
00:24:56,914 --> 00:25:00,876
I am not leaving this city
until I prove it.

349
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:19,561
You're certain he's the most powerful?

350
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:22,189
- He's their leader.
- Was their leader.

351
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:29,404
You're not going anywhere.

352
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,865
Why are you doing this? Who are you?

353
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:35,994
- I think a direct approach is best.
- We tried that, it's not working.

354
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:39,164
Leo's being drawn
back to his family, back to good.

355
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,834
But he's not there yet.

356
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,002
We must drive him away,

357
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:48,757
make them afraid of him,
if we're to succeed.

358
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:54,346
And you're going
to help us do exactly that.

359
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:03,981
This one should work
if the beasts are possessing us.

360
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:08,068
This'll work if the last one doesn't.
It should knock out about ten of 'em.

361
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:13,240
This one... Well, this one,
only use if you really, really have to.

362
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,741
Why, what is it?

363
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:17,161
A little bit of everything,
just in case.

364
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:21,248
- Piper, I'm not using these on you.
- You might have to.

365
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,208
It's the last night of a blue moon.

366
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,502
All we have to do
is wait until it passes.

367
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,297
Unless it's not
the blue moon that's doing this.

368
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:30,757
- Paige said that...
- The New Power, I know.

369
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,801
If it's after power, why do all this?

370
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:35,596
- It doesn't make sense.
- Better safe than sorry.

371
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,599
Paige and Phoebe
are coming home in a couple of minutes.

372
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,268
- We need the cage ready.
- I know you're scared.

373
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:44,605
I'm not scared. I'm worried
we're gonna kill somebody.

374
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:47,024
You're not gonna kill anybody.
I promise.

375
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:50,277
You saved me, now let me save you.

376
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:54,573
Then maybe... it'll be time
for me to move back in again.

377
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:56,950
It already is.

378
00:26:58,202 --> 00:27:00,120
Grab those.

379
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:12,299
- Who are you?
- Actually, I'm about to be you.

380
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,303
- Are you coming?
- I'll be right there.

381
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,520
Do you think we should
put some snacks in the cage?

382
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:27,648
- Like what, a wildebeest?
- Please don't say "beast".

383
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:31,318
We don't know how long we're
gonna be in here. What if I get hungry?

384
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:34,863
We'll have Leo throw us
a Whitelighter, don't worry about it.

385
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,658
Well, I do worry about it.

386
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:40,786
I just don't like
not knowing what's going on.

387
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:42,579
Leo thinks it's the blue moon.

388
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,873
All we have to do
is make it till morning

389
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,292
without eating anyone,
and we'll be fine.

390
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:51,088
What if Leo's wrong? I mean,
it's not like he's been himself lately.

391
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:53,966
- We've been through this.
- No, not enough.

392
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:57,678
Look, trust me, we don't
have to worry about him any more.

393
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,513
Talking about me?

394
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,183
- Where are the potions?
- Potions?

395
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:06,144
I think I left them in the kitchen.

396
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:09,815
What was that?

397
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:11,608
What was what?

398
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:14,486
Okay, I'll get them from the kitchen.

399
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:17,072
Keep your eye on us after we transform

400
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:19,741
and make sure we don't
move any of the crystals.

401
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:23,287
Oh, no. I don't want Leo here,
in case we attack him.

402
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,957
- Who could that be?
- Oh, I think I know.

403
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:29,626
- I'll take care of it.
- You'd better hurry.

404
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,296
Why would you attack me?

405
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,548
Technically, you're still an Elder.

406
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:38,886
We feel the same way about Elders
as we do Whitelighters, so...

407
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:42,806
...just to be safe.
- So, you'd view me as a threat?

408
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,392
Probably.

409
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:55,194
- Hi!
- Leslie, hey.

410
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:57,571
- Let me guess, bad time?
- Actually...

411
00:28:57,738 --> 00:29:00,073
- I just wanted to apologise.
- For what?

412
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,077
Well, for the way I acted earlier.
I was... I was just so...

413
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:08,957
- Yeah, really upset, I know.
- Now who's finishing whose sentences?

414
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:11,376
- Yeah...
- I didn't wanna leave it like that,

415
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,545
- that's all.
- And I don't either.

416
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,173
Is it possible
I could call you tomorrow?

417
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,634
We're running out of tomorrows.

418
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,555
Yeah, I know. I'm gonna call you
tomorrow, I promise. Okay.

419
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:25,182
Take care.

420
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:31,104
- Leo, what are you doing?
- Television!

421
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:38,153
- Piper, are you okay?
- No.

422
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,905
Still think Leo's fine?

423
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:43,492
That wasn't Leo.
He was possessed or something.

424
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:47,996
- Again? Well, it seems to happen a lot.
- And if it did happen again,

425
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:51,416
it can't be connected
to the blue moon, it's not up yet.

426
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,377
Maybe it's the New Power thing.

427
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:56,839
- Maybe that's who's setting Leo up.
- But why? For what?

428
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:00,217
Well, if Agent Brody's right,
for power.

429
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,437
- Okay, now what?
- Throw the potion!

430
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,152
Hey, over here!

431
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,907
Piper!

432
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:29,872
You have betrayed us! Again!

433
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:31,999
What're you doing?

434
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:35,586
- I'm warning you! Stay out of this!
- Oh, no, Piper! Do not...

435
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:37,045
You'll be stopped!

436
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:14,917
- What happened?
- You attacked us.

437
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,711
Really? How come
I'm the one with the headache?

438
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:20,714
We were forced to defend ourselves.

439
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:23,217
- Where's Leo?
- I sent him away.

440
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,928
- Away where?
- That's none of your concern now.

441
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:30,390
You attempted to save him,
you failed, that's that.

442
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,683
The hell it is!

443
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,770
He tried to kill two more Elders!

444
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:37,648
No, he was possessed,
you just didn't see it.

445
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:40,609
What I saw was something
I never would've imagined.

446
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:42,861
The Charmed Ones turning into demons.

447
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:45,280
No, that wasn't demonic, that was...

448
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:48,659
...you know, that time of month.
- No, it was a blue moon.

449
00:31:48,826 --> 00:31:51,578
We didn't have a choice,
we can't control it.

450
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:54,373
I'm keeping you
till we figure what to do with you.

451
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,542
What to do with us?
Let us go so we can

452
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,461
- find out who the demon is.
- Out of the question.

453
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:01,964
You won't be finding out
about that New Power.

454
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:05,133
Only they could've
sent the demon after Leo.

455
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,220
You said yourself they
may be coming after the Elders.

456
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:10,931
But what if you turn back into?

457
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:14,101
That was just the blue moon.
It won't happen for 50 years.

458
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:18,272
By that time we'll just be a menace to
our rest home. So I think you're safe.

459
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:21,275
Very well. See what you can find out.

460
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:24,444
- Nope, not without Leo first.
- He can't be trusted.

461
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:27,156
He wouldn't be
vulnerable to possession if...

462
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:28,365
You can give us Leo,

463
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:31,535
or you can find your own
damn connection to the New Power.

464
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,292
What's going on?

465
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,794
You're about to be exonerated, again.

466
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:43,255
Book of Shadows.

467
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,971
What else do you want from me?

468
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,765
I did what you asked.

469
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:57,853
You gotta protect me. They'll find me!

470
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,105
We already have.

471
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:06,069
Who were you talking to?

472
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:13,202
What happened?
Did you just freeze me?

473
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:14,870
She asked you a question.

474
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:20,042
- Would you rather I blew you up?
- Wait, don't.

475
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:25,589
- If I tell you, they'll kill me.
- If you don't tell us, we'll kill you.

476
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:28,091
You may want to pick your poison.

477
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:32,888
They're more powerful
than anything you've seen.

478
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:34,973
Who is?

479
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,351
No!

480
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:44,191
Well, I guess Leo
wasn't seeing things after all.

481
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:46,944
Can we get out of here now, please?

482
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:50,823
Whoever you are,
stay away from my husband.

483
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,558
Brody.

484
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:20,727
Paige, hey. I was getting worried.

485
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:22,396
Yeah, I know.

486
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:26,066
That's why I wanted to call you,
to let you know I was okay.

487
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,026
I'm glad you did.

488
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:31,363
So, what happened?
This New Power wasn't really after you?

489
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,866
No, it was actually...

490
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,118
...after something else.

491
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,623
I mean that's... That's good, obviously.

492
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,462
I was just hoping to, you know,
get a lead out of this, that's all.

493
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:51,175
If it makes you feel any better,
they were after my brother-in-law.

494
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:53,927
- Brother-in-law?
- Yeah, well, not directly.

495
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,889
They actually used
a demon to get to him.

496
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:58,098
A demon?

497
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:00,434
He's fine now, we dispossessed him.

498
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:03,937
- Wait, you did what?
- Well, we got rid of the demon.

499
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,732
We get possessed all the time,
it's no big deal.

500
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:10,444
Hello?

501
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:16,074
Yeah, sorry. I guess
I'm just a little new at this stuff.

502
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,619
I thought you said
you knew about demons?

503
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:22,164
No, I said I knew a lot about witches.

504
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:26,835
The rest are just... theories.

505
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:28,962
That is, until I met you.

506
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,965
Well, be careful what you wish for.

507
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:34,885
- What'd you mean?
- What you don't know can't hurt.

508
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:37,513
It's already hurt me,
that's why I'm here.

509
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,767
I'm glad you're okay, Paige.

510
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:44,895
Thanks.

511
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:50,442
- Bye.
- Yeah.

512
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:09,837
Hey.

513
00:36:11,255 --> 00:36:12,881
Hey.

514
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:15,259
Packing up?

515
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:17,719
Yep, packing up.

516
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:21,181
I left your stuff in the cabinet.
I can put it back if you want.

517
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,724
That's okay, I can do it.

518
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,312
What time's your flight?

519
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:29,857
Noon.

520
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,653
- You ready to come back?
- More than you know.

521
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:40,576
- Thanks to you.
- Me? No, I didn't do anything.

522
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:44,830
- I just kept the seat warm for you.
- You did more than that.

523
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:46,623
And you know it.

524
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:52,337
When I first met you, I was...

525
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:55,132
...totally lost.

526
00:36:55,924 --> 00:37:00,179
That's why I needed to get away
from all of this, you know?

527
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:03,515
I couldn't give advice...

528
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:06,059
...especially not about love.

529
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,314
And I realised that...

530
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:14,359
...I was just afraid.

531
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:18,906
But I'm not afraid any more.

532
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,170
Thank you.

533
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:35,797
You're welcome.

534
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:40,260
I guess it just wasn't meant to be?

535
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:41,678
You and me?

536
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,056
Maybe not right now.

537
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:49,269
But I do think
our signs are compatible, so...

538
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:15,128
See ya.

539
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:18,507
See ya.

540
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:40,028
Where were you? I was worried.

541
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:42,906
I was just... checking on the boys.

542
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:46,785
We found the possessor demon
right where you said he'd be.

543
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:48,203
Did you vanquish him?

544
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:52,249
No, but some creature head thing did.

545
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,877
- You saw him?
- Yeah, we saw it.

546
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:59,214
- Don't think we've seen the last of it.
- That's what I'm worried about.

547
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:03,051
Come on, let's go home.

548
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:04,970
I can't.

549
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:09,057
Well, the Elders said
you were free to go.

550
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,685
It's not the Elders
I'm worried about, Piper.

551
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:14,897
I'm worried about you.
I'm worried about everybody.

552
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,774
The Elders were right.

553
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:21,653
This New Power was after me
because I was vulnerable.

554
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,740
You know, vulnerable enough
to put my family at risk.

555
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:29,578
Piper, you were
almost killed because of me.

556
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:33,707
Because of what they did to me.
I can't let that happen. I won't.

557
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:37,127
Leo, I know
you've been through a lot. I do.

558
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:39,379
But you fought so hard.

559
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,299
And the boys need you. I need you.

560
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,261
It's too dangerous.

561
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,225
I have to stay away from you
for your own sake.

562
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:53,060
I'm sorry.
