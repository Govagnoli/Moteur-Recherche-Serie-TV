1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,549
- That's not me.
- Sure looks like you.

2
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,594
No, I mean, the picture's me.
The column is not me.

3
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:14,097
I knew a man couldn't
give advice like a woman.

4
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,893
Men are all about, like,
fixing the problem.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,188
Isn't that what advice columnists
are supposed to do?

6
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,148
No... I mean, yes.

7
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,609
But first you're supposed to listen,

8
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,780
then you're supposed to validate
feelings. That's what a woman would do.

9
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,741
But not a man.
They go straight to fixing it.

10
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,410
This glass ceiling in Sausalito?

11
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:39,164
Leslie tells this woman step by step
how to deal with her boss.

12
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,834
There are no feelings in there,
no emotions.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,796
My readers are gonna read that.
They're gonna know I did not write it.

14
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,591
- This is a nightmare.
- Honestly, it's real subtle.

15
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,051
They might not notice.

16
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,513
Even the letters that he picks,
they're all fix-it letters.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,642
I left him three messages about this
yesterday. He did not call me back.

18
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,687
I thought the whole point
of this little vacation

19
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:04,523
was for you to relax and recharge.

20
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,360
Yeah, I know. But it's still
my column. I still care about it.

21
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,696
Any big change takes some adjusting,

22
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,615
so for a while you're
gonna feel a little lost.

23
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,368
See, you just validated my feelings.

24
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,620
Phoebe, you need to stop obsessing,

25
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:23,458
unless, of course,
you're obsessing 'cause you like him.

26
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,170
No, I don't like him. He's like...

27
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,841
Well, forget about it and find
something else to obsess about.

28
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,428
I know, you're right. I have
to find a way to channel my energy,

29
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,556
find something to be passionate about.

30
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,225
Paige with Magic School, you saving Leo.

31
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:45,397
I'm not saving him. I'm just hoping
that by spending some time with the boys

32
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,150
that he'll feel loved and needed,

33
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:51,195
and realise that life
isn't all that bad.

34
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,948
Excuse me, but you're gonna
have to take that someplace else.

35
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,410
- Take what?
- You know, that.

36
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,164
- It's called breast-feeding.
- Customers are complaining.

37
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,083
What?

38
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:11,048
- Let's go. I gotta go anyway.
- No, Piper. You've done nothing wrong.

39
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:14,134
- You can't do this.
- Actually, yeah, I can.

40
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,557
Sorry.

41
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,852
- It's no big deal. Let's go.
- That's horrible.

42
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,103
We're goin'.

43
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,897
This is a losing battle.

44
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,650
Magic School was a noble experiment.

45
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,818
But I'm afraid it's run its course.

46
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,821
What about these kids?
Where are they going to go,

47
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,074
to learn how to develop their magic?

48
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:41,078
- Where did you learn to develop yours?
- I learned from my sisters,

49
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:45,332
and they did from their mother and
grandmother. But not everybody has that.

50
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,834
What these kids need...

51
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,006
What these kids need is guidance.

52
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,552
The point remains,
that with Gideon no longer around,

53
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,763
the safety of this institution,
both to the students

54
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,975
and to the outside world,
can no longer be guaranteed.

55
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,685
I can guarantee it!

56
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,605
I mean, I can try to guarantee it.

57
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,776
I fight demons on a weekly basis,
and I think that more than qualifies me

58
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,571
to be able to deal
with some magical students.

59
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,912
Like I said, they need some guidance.

60
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,748
She can guide me any day.

61
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,878
Check it out,
I just cast an awesome spell.

62
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,838
These kids are special.

63
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,685
Naked woman!

64
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,178
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to conjure her.
It was an accident.

65
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,681
It's okay, Duncan.
I know you didn't mean to.

66
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,850
Just tell me what happened, fast!

67
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,478
I don't know. I was bored,
messing around with a history book,

68
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,106
and then poof, out popped Lady Godiva.

69
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:18,068
That's Lady Godiva.
That is so cool. I mean, it's not cool.

70
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,488
But it's okay. Send her back
and everything will be fine.

71
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,658
I don't know how to.
I only know how to conjure her.

72
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,829
Okay, that is bad. Not that you're bad,
this is a bad situation.

73
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:33,041
But I know you didn't mean it
so you're not really bad. It's okay.

74
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,334
We'll fix it.

75
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,255
I hope.

76
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,306
Need to borrow this.
I'll have it dry-cleaned.

77
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,725
- Is that who I think it is?
- Lady Godiva.

78
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,727
Pretty impressive use of magic?

79
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,897
Don't you know how dangerous it is
to mess with history?

80
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:59,151
- If we don't send her back before...
- I'm all over it.

81
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,530
That's it! Shoo! Get out of here!

82
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,408
Get out with your raging hormones!
Bye, bye.

83
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,453
- Lame.
- What happened? Where am I?

84
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,122
- What is this place?
- It's okay, you're safe.

85
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,500
I'm gonna take you home, okay?

86
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,794
Oh, well, well, that's one
screwed-up mess you made.

87
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,297
Good job, Duncan. You scored big.

88
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,382
Shut up, Simon, leave me alone.

89
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,095
Nice thing about the Magic School,
such intense frustration.

90
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:31,099
All pent-up. Let me help you let it out.

91
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,478
Pack your bags, boys,
Duncan just got us evicted.

92
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,982
You son of a bitch, leave me alone!
Stop picking on me!

93
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,317
Hey, break it up.

94
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,323
Interesting.

95
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:54,498
I have a very good feeling about this.

96
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,170
Piper, I can't believe you,
of all people, are against this.

97
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,214
We have to do something.

98
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:08,512
You are not writing a letter
to Ask Phoebe about my breast. Leo!

99
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,306
You're the one
that said I needed a cause.

100
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,310
So you can keep your mind off
the column, not write a letter to it.

101
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,146
How am I supposed
to keep my mind off of the column

102
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:21,316
when he's about to blow my cover,
maybe even my career?

103
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,986
You're obsessing. Leo, you're late!

104
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,781
I don't know what you're worried about.
He won't pick the letter.

105
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,408
It's way too feminine.

106
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,703
Somehow I know you're gonna
find a way to make him pick it.

107
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,497
So what? We hit
two Neanderthals with one stone.

108
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,958
I cannot believe
you're not supporting me.

109
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,044
What is there to support?
Phoebe, it's already a law.

110
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,173
- So let's sue the manager.
- I don't have time to sue.

111
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,925
I have other things
to worry about like work.

112
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,679
I'm on sabbatical, I don't have
to worry about that. I'm lost.

113
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,348
For crying out loud, Leo!

114
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,561
That's not Leo.

115
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,563
Hey, guys. Book still upstairs?

116
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,940
- Wait a minute.
- Hold it.

117
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,358
What happened?

118
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,486
Well, this is Godiva.

119
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,280
Say hello.

120
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,782
Godiva?

121
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,120
As in Lady Godiva...

122
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,872
...in the flesh, so to speak.

123
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,625
- Are they witches too?
- Yeah.

124
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,794
The meeting kind of went long,
got a little boring,

125
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,840
- and the kids grew restless and...
- So they conjured a sex object?

126
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,469
I'm no sex object! I was riding
through town in my natural state

127
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,096
to protest my husband's unjust taxes!

128
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,853
Wait. Riding as in plucked out
in the middle of?

129
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,398
Paige, she has to finish that ride
or else it could change...

130
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,734
Yeah, history as we know it, I got it.

131
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,070
Even worse,
if I don't send her back soon,

132
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,614
the Elders are gonna
shut down Magic School.

133
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,576
I don't think that's worse
than changing the course of history.

134
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,412
Okay, okay.

135
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,541
On the other hand, how much history

136
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,960
could a naked lady on horseback affect?

137
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:07,840
- Excuse me! My ride is important.
- Okay.

138
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,760
Even so, need to find a spell
to send you back. Come on.

139
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:16,598
See what I mean? We have
bigger naked breasts to worry about.

140
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,185
Paige has her naked breasts
to worry about, I've got yours.

141
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,771
Leo!

142
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,366
Piper!

143
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,744
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm late
for work. Wyatt's been fed,

144
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:42,374
Chris has had his early nap
and they're just very excited to see ya.

145
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,918
Now's not really a good time.

146
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:49,590
But when is a good time?
Sometimes we just have to make the time.

147
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,426
Once I've taken care
of any threats towards them.

148
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,846
Don't be ridiculous.
You can't vanquish every threat.

149
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:59,516
Besides, even if you did,
it doesn't change the fact that...

150
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,227
I killed another Elder?

151
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:06,064
- Yeah, but it wasn't your fault.
- It doesn't change the facts.

152
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,943
The fact is the boys need a father.
That's really all that matters.

153
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,821
I can't understand
why you're focusing on bad stuff

154
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,241
when you have
some good stuff in your life.

155
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:31,256
Hi. Could you please
not do that around the children?

156
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:34,259
- You brought them here.
- Your son brought us here.

157
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,679
There's a scouter demon in the swamp.
If I don't go there...

158
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,767
If I don't spend some time in P3,
we will lose our only source of income.

159
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:45,187
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

160
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,232
Just make sure you burp Chris,
and you will be fine.

161
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,651
Now I gotta go, so help me out.

162
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,932
- Phoebe.
- Hi!

163
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:25,561
- What are you doing here?
- I came to look for my favourite pen.

164
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,481
I left it in here somewhere. I can't
seem to write a thing without it.

165
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,609
I dumped all your stuff
in this bottom cabinet here.

166
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,404
- Oh, you dumped?
- What does it look like?

167
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,868
It's a fountain pen,
nothing really special.

168
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,580
Hey, since I'm here,
maybe I can help with stuff.

169
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:45,998
Help?

170
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:49,960
Yeah, you know, maybe help
pick tomorrow's letter or something.

171
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:53,172
- I thought you were on sabbatical.
- Still my column.

172
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,674
Having a little trouble
letting go, I see.

173
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,218
No. I'm not having trouble letting go.

174
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,804
I just came here to find my pen.

175
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,681
Couple weeks, you won't notice.

176
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,976
I'm afraid my readers
are already noticing.

177
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:09,479
- That you can't find your pen?
- That I'm a man.

178
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,691
I mean, you're a man when
you're supposed to be a woman.

179
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:17,362
You're not very good at picking letters.
You only pick problems you can solve.

180
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,866
For someone taking a break,
you've given this a lot of thought.

181
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:23,368
I'm just saying, you know, that...

182
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,496
I mean, the point...

183
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,290
What was I saying?

184
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:32,628
Something to do
with, "Me Tarzan, you Jane."

185
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,632
Yeah, cute. Very cute. Let's see.

186
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,634
Oh, what's this one?

187
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,345
Oh, this looks like a great one.

188
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,264
"Breast-feeding in Bayshore".
What do you say?

189
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,141
Breast-feeding?

190
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,519
Seems a little cause-y, don't you think?

191
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,230
- Out of your league?
- No, I like breasts,

192
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,316
I just don't feel the need
to give any advice on them.

193
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:57,861
Yeah. Like I said,
you're not good at picking letters.

194
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,990
So, if you find my pen, please call me.

195
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,499
Okay.

196
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,543
Queen Elizabeth.

197
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:16,296
Catherine the Great. Joan of Arc.

198
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,301
Lady Godiva.
Good thing you have long hair.

199
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,136
I'm in the history books?

200
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,515
Yes, and if I can keep anything
from happening to you

201
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:29,560
before I send you back,
you'll remain there.

202
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,235
- What's wrong?
- Lord Dyson.

203
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,946
- Is that your husband?
- No. An evil land baron

204
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:44,783
who feeds on the pain of peasants,
suppresses them for his own gain.

205
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,370
He's the weasel who convinced
my husband to tax them.

206
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,497
Were you scared, doing what you did?

207
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,917
It was what, 1,000 years
before women received equal rights?

208
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:57,296
It's the right thing. It's the
only way to make my husband see

209
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,631
I was serious
about my stand to shock him.

210
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:02,426
And history, too, apparently.

211
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:03,844
Okay, mount up.

212
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,685
- Will it be painful?
- No, it's magic.

213
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,980
- You won't feel a thing.
- Magic.

214
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,274
I didn't think it really existed.

215
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,944
Oh, it exists.
It's just something that's hidden.

216
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,654
You can't see it.

217
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,948
See, not a lot of things have changed.

218
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,665
Robe?

219
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,752
Oh, I almost forgot.

220
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,674
Good luck... saving all this.

221
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,302
Thanks. Good luck on your ride.

222
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,557
From lands afar
and time and space

223
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,976
Take her now from this, our place

224
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,145
One that dwells so must remain

225
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,397
Send her back to her domain

226
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,527
What's wrong?

227
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,779
I don't know, it should have worked.

228
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,075
Stay here.

229
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,665
What happened?

230
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:18,836
You tell me. You were the one who said
you could control these students.

231
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,797
I don't see how conjuring
Lady Godiva caused this.

232
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,508
Unless she wasn't
the only thing conjured.

233
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,385
Boxes!

234
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:35,143
At least this shows how much kids need
help learning to control their magic.

235
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,689
This is a disaster.
A complete, utter disaster!

236
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,067
By all means, don't repress yourself.

237
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,032
- To be whole again.
- Who the hell are you?

238
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,786
I've had it with you
and your stupid ideas!

239
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,251
So much repression to feed on.

240
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,671
You!

241
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,340
My lady.

242
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,718
Watch out!

243
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,972
No matter.

244
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,310
I'll just collect more power
and then I'll be back.

245
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,696
It's okay, it's just a graze.

246
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:30,365
I still can't believe
an Elder attacked you.

247
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,327
I know, they're supposed
to be pacifists, right?

248
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,162
Have you seen Leo lately?

249
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,873
Speaking of which... Leo!

250
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,628
He's a little mad at me. I can't say I
blame him. I did kind of mess things up.

251
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,923
Well, that doesn't explain
why he tried to kill you.

252
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,216
Pardon me.

253
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:51,678
I think the demon did something to that
Elder, freed up his repressed anger.

254
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,264
He probably
wasn't breast-fed as a child.

255
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,517
- Phoebe!
- What?

256
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,687
We wouldn't even be in this situation,
the demon wouldn't even be here

257
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,525
if I hadn't had the great stroke
of genius to try to save school.

258
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,986
- Why do you think he tried to kill her?
- If I could just...

259
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:12,366
Maybe he knew that since they came
together, they have to leave together.

260
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:16,286
- Why wouldn't he want to go back?
- If you would just listen to me!

261
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,915
- Oh, wow!
- That's just a lot.

262
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:25,420
It is apparently still the only way
I can get anybody to listen to me!

263
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:30,050
Woman, keep your clothes on.
This is a family show, really.

264
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:37,724
I know that man,
or demon as you call him.

265
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,727
- It's Lord Dyson.
- The land baron?

266
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,814
Except in my time he was different.

267
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,315
Smaller, weaker.

268
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,443
Okay, so how did he get stronger?

269
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,698
It's okay, doorbell,
newfangled contraption.

270
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,620
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God, it's Leslie.
- Don't answer it.

271
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,540
- What if it's about my letter?
- Forget the letter.

272
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:04,918
- Can everyone have a cause but me?
- Yes!

273
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,713
Upstairs. Upstairs!

274
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,384
Leslie, hey. What a surprise.

275
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,386
I brought you a peace offering.

276
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,018
- Oh, those are my sisters.
- I thought you just had two.

277
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:25,772
Yeah, the other one is a cousin,
distant cousin, twice removed.

278
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,025
Come in, come in.

279
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,405
So, you drove all the way over here
just to give me this lovely pen?

280
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,324
Well, it's your pen, isn't it?

281
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,743
You know this is not my pen.

282
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,288
You're right. Bought that
from a street vendor on my way over.

283
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,790
Just looking for an excuse.

284
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,461
You have a nice place. The paper
pays you better than I thought.

285
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,588
So, what are you really doing here?

286
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,884
I thought you might
like a chance to apologise.

287
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:59,431
- For what?
- Trying to slip that letter past me.

288
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,892
- What?
- Look, I know you wrote it.

289
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:05,062
I recognise your handwriting.
I've studied your work.

290
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:07,481
You have?

291
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:11,068
How else am I gonna get away
with ghost-writing a column for you?

292
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:14,655
That's the problem. I don't
think you're getting away with it.

293
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,240
Because I'm a man.

294
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,784
Because you pick letters
a man would pick.

295
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:21,912
Ask Phoebe wouldn't pick
a breast-feeding letter.

296
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,414
- Oh, no?
- No, because it's a cause.

297
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,626
- She doesn't do causes.
- I know what letters I'd pick.

298
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:30,504
Then why are you taking a sabbatical?

299
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:38,220
Look, I'm sorry. It's just...
The only reason I took this gig

300
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:41,348
is 'cause I'm a huge fan of yours.

301
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,768
I mean, of your column.

302
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,104
And I just want
to do the best job I can,

303
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:51,525
but I can't really do that with you
looking over my shoulder all the time.

304
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,569
All right?

305
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,197
All right.

306
00:19:58,407 --> 00:19:59,867
All right.

307
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:06,832
Would it be cheating too much if I
peeked ahead to see what becomes of me?

308
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,794
Well, seeing as you're probably not
going to remember any of this,

309
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,671
I don't see why not.

310
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:16,216
The closest thing I can find
is a demon who feeds off anger,

311
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,719
but you already got him...

312
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,847
Remember when Leo used
to come when you called him?

313
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,686
It says here your Lord Dyson
mysteriously disappeared

314
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,563
the day you rode through town.

315
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,065
Well, I doubt that's just a coincidence.

316
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:36,361
And the tax was repealed,
which means I accomplished my goal.

317
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:42,034
No offence, lady, but you drop
your trousers, liberation for all,

318
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:46,872
and suddenly your demon vanishes off the
face of the earth for all of eternity?

319
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,458
- Isn't that a little far-fetched?
- No.

320
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,085
Not if the demon
feeds off of repressions.

321
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,214
Maybe that's how he gains his strength.

322
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,510
Well, then, that would
make the reverse true as well.

323
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,971
Your ride starved him into oblivion.

324
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,773
Please tell me you weren't
vanquishing demons with the children!

325
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,235
Chris was fussy, it calmed him.

326
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,612
Oh, really?

327
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,200
- Is that Lady?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

328
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,410
A little healing, a little healing.

329
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,875
And then we need you
to find out what they know

330
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:35,629
- about some sort of repressor demon.
- You want me to go up there?

331
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:38,465
I'll get the Elfin nanny
to watch the kids.

332
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:43,720
- That's not what I was worried about.
- Hello. Heal, ouch, hurt. Focus.

333
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:48,183
It wouldn't hurt to have a chat with the
Elders to see what they think about...

334
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,060
...the demon.

335
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:54,565
- What if they know about?
- If they knew, we would know by now.

336
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,568
Are they talking about Lord Dyson?

337
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,487
No, they're talking
about something that Leo did

338
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,949
- that they don't want me to know about.
- Just go.

339
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,953
Let's find out what we can
about this repressor demon

340
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,331
before it starts to feed off
our repressions, shall we?

341
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,925
So this is the land of the free?

342
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,052
Hey, hey, sorry.

343
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,388
Oh, infuriating, isn't it?

344
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:29,016
Well, don't hold back. Let it out.

345
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:37,858
Such a plethora of repression,
it's hard to choose.

346
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:41,069
Who's next? Who's next?

347
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:50,913
Oh, I love this century!

348
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,634
More. I need more.

349
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,055
Come on, who's still
out there holding it in?

350
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,780
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

351
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,116
Why do we have to meet here?

352
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:32,120
- Why couldn't we meet up there?
- You didn't hear?

353
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:36,124
An Elder's gone missing, Leo.
Perhaps killed.

354
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:41,421
- We can't be too careful.
- You think I did it?

355
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:45,175
- You killed Gideon.
- He tried to kill my son.

356
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:48,470
- I was protecting my family.
- We understand.

357
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:50,556
But this is different.

358
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,559
The Elder was Zola, Leo.

359
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:59,398
And we understand that he was trying
to reach out to you when he disappeared.

360
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:06,113
We are your family, Leo.
You are one of us.

361
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,365
I don't know that I am any more.

362
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,326
Everything's changed.

363
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,329
Just because of what Gideon did?

364
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:17,666
Leo, good is not perfect.

365
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,501
Sometimes it messes up.

366
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:24,173
But that doesn't mean
it isn't still good. And we are.

367
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,633
- Are we?
- Listen to me, Leo.

368
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:30,095
We have sensed a great
and new threat gathering,

369
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:33,098
one which will take
everything we've got to fight.

370
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:36,226
And we need you for that.
We're gonna need everyone.

371
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,478
You know what I need?

372
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:41,940
I need information on a demon
that feeds on repression.

373
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:45,068
Can you help me out or not?

374
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:47,863
I'll see what I can do.

375
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,949
Think about what I've said.

376
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,752
You can't trust her.

377
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,421
You can't trust any of them any more.

378
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,220
Why are you doing this to me?

379
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,555
Who are you?

380
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:22,272
I can't believe how empty
this place is without students.

381
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,692
Well, I'm hoping you'll
find a way to save it after all this,

382
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,445
- for your nephews' sake.
- Thanks, no pressure.

383
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,155
Nope.

384
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:33,075
- Ready to summon?
- Yep, all ready to go.

385
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:36,328
I think we should wait for Leo
and find out what he knows.

386
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:39,289
It doesn't matter.
History will take care of them,

387
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:42,626
- as long as you finish your ride.
- Promise.

388
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:46,713
And thank you for giving me
a glimpse of what's to come.

389
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,676
Thank you, for showing us
you're more than a box of chocolates.

390
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:53,095
- I'm sorry?
- Never mind.

391
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:54,972
Okay, here we go.

392
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,724
We look to find the evil set free

393
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,853
Bring this demon before us three

394
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,231
Hi, there.

395
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:09,653
- Why didn't he explode?
- Chanting, chanting.

396
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,282
Okay, okay, okay.
From lands afar, in time and space

397
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:17,035
Take them now from this our place
To the dwell, some must remain

398
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,872
Send them back to their domain

399
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,172
It worked!

400
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,719
That's not good.

401
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,264
Well, at least they're gone.

402
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:40,976
Great, will you guys drop me off
at the office on your orb home?

403
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:44,938
I thought you weren't looking over
Leslie's shoulders any more.

404
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:48,567
Well, I'm not, but first I have
to get him to pick my letter.

405
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:51,111
Orbing!

406
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:57,659
Okay, thanks, meet you guys at home.

407
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:07,628
Looks like everyone took Elise's
sexual harassment memo literally.

408
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,255
Phoebe? What are you doing here?

409
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:15,052
And what are you wearing?
Who? Who's watching our children?

410
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,137
Why aren't you at home with them?

411
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,015
- Excuse me?
- Come on.

412
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,228
Okay, what the hell is going on?

413
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,314
I think I know.

414
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:31,109
We should have waited for Leo.

415
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,278
Shut up!

416
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:38,283
It's not so bad if you like grey.

417
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,703
I don't understand
how everything changed so much.

418
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,040
Well, we sent the demon back
stronger than when he came.

419
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:47,209
Strong enough to kill Lady Godiva.

420
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:50,629
It's hard to believe
her ride affected just everything.

421
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:53,090
Apparently it had an impact on us women

422
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:56,176
because it sent us back
like a thousand years or so.

423
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:58,011
- We have to fix this.
- Oh, no!

424
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:01,098
I left Wyatt and Chris
with the Elfin nanny before...

425
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:05,018
That's okay, they're boys.
They're probably treated like royalty.

426
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,396
Hey, why didn't we change?

427
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:10,524
Probably because we were
at Magic School and protected?

428
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:13,360
What do these women think they're doing?

429
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:21,994
Okay, guys, I think we're attracting
a little too much attention here.

430
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:24,371
What say we orb back
to the Book of Shadows?

431
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:26,206
- I don't want to go home.
- Why?

432
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,625
Did you hear what Leslie said?

433
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:31,920
We can't stay here,
we're attracting too much attention.

434
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:34,756
Yeah, and we wouldn't want
to be flogged.

435
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,892
So much for your
breast-feeding campaign.

436
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,393
- Cute.
- Hey!

437
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:54,193
Every peep out of you adds
an extra flogging to your sentence.

438
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:58,614
What is flogging exactly?

439
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,576
I don't know but how about we orb out
of here so we don't have to find out.

440
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:06,038
Where are we gonna go?
We still have to fix this somehow.

441
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:09,124
- That's two extra floggings each!
- Okay.

442
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:13,337
Look, we need to figure out something
'cause I need to feed someone soon.

443
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:15,339
What if Lady Godiva is still alive?

444
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:19,593
Paige, I know you're upset. We all are.
But we can't bring her back to life.

445
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,386
No, why can't we conjure her?

446
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:24,848
She'd still be alive and her ride
would still be ahead of her.

447
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,935
I don't know how that's
gonna get us back to our world.

448
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,312
Maybe it will
if she can finish her ride.

449
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,940
We'd have to vanquish the demon first.

450
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,150
- We just have to get out of here.
- Leo!

451
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:38,070
Oh, what if he's different
in this world too?

452
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:41,990
That s a mighty fine question. Leo!

453
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:46,995
What are you guys doing here?
What are you wearing?

454
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:50,415
Look, we're kind of in a hurry,
so Cliff Notes version:

455
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:54,670
Demon killed Lady Godiva,
we changed history, we gotta fix it.

456
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:56,672
So, are you with me or what?

457
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,465
Lady Godiva?

458
00:29:58,632 --> 00:30:01,301
Yeah, she probably
doesn't mean much to you,

459
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,679
but apparently she means a lot to us.

460
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:07,015
Duncan. We're gonna
need Duncan to conjure her.

461
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:09,268
Leo, can you take me to Magic School?

462
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:14,273
Magic School's been shut for years.
Everyone's in hiding here, even demons.

463
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,192
- No one dare uses magic.
- Talk about repressed.

464
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,780
But magic still exists, which means
this kid Duncan has to be somewhere.

465
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:33,917
They got no place else to go.

466
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:36,670
Keep them here for their own safety.

467
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:41,967
Go back to Phoebe and Piper.
Help them find the history book,

468
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:46,346
we're gonna need it. Don't ask,
it will just give you a headache.

469
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:49,892
Duncan?

470
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:52,394
Nobody by that name here.

471
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:55,105
Yeah, well,
I don't have time to play games.

472
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:59,151
Yeah, neither do I, so if you're
thinking of jacking my stash, don't.

473
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:02,070
Murdock root, this is your stash?

474
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:06,283
Look, lady, I'm warning you.
Back off, understand?

475
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,498
- You one of them Freedom Fighters?
- I don't know about that,

476
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:16,251
but I would like to free you
from this life you've got going here.

477
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:19,838
- I just need a conjuring spell.
- Are you trying to get me hanged?

478
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:24,009
'Cause these guys get away with piss-ass
magic doesn't mean we're not watched!

479
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:27,346
I come from a world
where good magic isn't wasted.

480
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:30,557
And it can be that way again.
I need your conjuring spell.

481
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:33,602
You are one of the do-gooders,
spewing that crap.

482
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:37,606
No, this is crap, okay?
Because I know you have dreams,

483
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:40,651
you have hopes,
and you're just suppressing them.

484
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,237
Think I'm scared of my dreams?
No, 'cause I'm not!

485
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:47,783
You have a choice.
You can either step up and be a man,

486
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,993
or you can crawl back in your rat hole.

487
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:53,497
It's up to you.

488
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:08,720
No Joan of Arc, no Catherine the Great,
none of them are in here.

489
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:10,556
Keep looking.

490
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:15,644
It's pretty amazing that this world
is so much more repressed,

491
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:17,312
and yet Leo seems freer.

492
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:19,606
Yeah, I almost forgot what he was like.

493
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:25,779
Okay, I got the spell.
Did you find Godiva?

494
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:29,074
Yep, right here.
But talk about your fine print.

495
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,785
It doesn't matter,
as long as she's in there.

496
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:34,913
So, wait, I don't understand.
If you return her back

497
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,042
to just before she was killed,
history will reverse itself?

498
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:41,753
Warned you about
the headache thing, right?

499
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,507
We get them here, you blast Dyson
and we send her back right away.

500
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:50,429
- I thought we send them back together.
- Not if Dyson doesn't exist any more.

501
00:32:50,596 --> 00:32:52,764
But first we gotta make sure we're okay.

502
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:57,603
There's no buried resentments that a
hungry demon could feed off of? Phoebe?

503
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:01,231
No, I'm fine. As long as Leslie's
not in the room, I'm fine. You?

504
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:04,610
No. I pretty much tell you guys
when I'm pissed off.

505
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:06,320
That's a good point. Paige?

506
00:33:06,487 --> 00:33:09,406
Sometimes I feel repressed
being the little sister.

507
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:13,619
What, you want to be the oldest sister?
Come on now, get over it.

508
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,537
Okay, I'm over it.

509
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:18,665
Where royals once lived, so did she

510
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:22,586
Bring forth the naked lady
from the 11th century

511
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,601
That's more like it.

512
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:41,230
Paige, I thought you were
sending me back?

513
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:42,439
Change of plans.

514
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:45,943
Perhaps I need a little more power.

515
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,737
Okay.

516
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,116
Nice try.

517
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:57,496
Piper.

518
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:01,083
So much bottled up anger.

519
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:07,381
You know what?
Enough with your moping.

520
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:09,758
The Elders screwed you?
What about me?

521
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:11,218
What are you doing?

522
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:14,471
I am not gonna raise
two little boys all on my own

523
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:18,308
because you're too busy
feeling sorry for yourself, all right?

524
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:19,977
So get over it! Seriously!

525
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:22,104
Now, where was I?

526
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,482
Energy ball!

527
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:29,570
- That's not good.
- Piper, enough!

528
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,951
Okay, you get Piper, I'll get him.

529
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,248
- Piper!
- Piper, snap out of it!

530
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,959
It's the demon doing this to you,
not Leo!

531
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,213
No!

532
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:53,468
Piper.

533
00:34:58,557 --> 00:35:00,976
How am I supposed
to know I was so repressed?

534
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:02,227
You couldn't tell?

535
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:05,898
I'm a working single mother,
I barely have time to brush my teeth,

536
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:08,901
- let alone self-reflection.
- You should make time.

537
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:11,987
Nothing that needed healing.
She's a little shaken up.

538
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:15,032
- I bet she is.
- Well, we better come up with a plan

539
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,868
because Dyson
is getting stronger as we speak.

540
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:20,746
- Thanks to Piper.
- All right!

541
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:23,415
- When he comes back...
- And he will.

542
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:25,584
...he might be too strong to stop,

543
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:28,420
especially if he taps
into Leo's repressed rage.

544
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:32,090
I'm not going to be able
to finish my ride, am I?

545
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:34,301
No, you're not.

546
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:45,562
Orb her out of here.

547
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,357
No, she won't stand a chance,
he'll feed off Leo.

548
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:57,241
Just get her out of here,
we'll think of something.

549
00:35:58,116 --> 00:36:01,245
"We'll think of something"?
That's the best you can do?

550
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:12,714
I'm officially open to other ideas.

551
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:16,343
Okay, maybe we should let him
get to Leo. Maybe he'll overdose.

552
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,263
- Or become unstoppable.
- He already is that.

553
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:21,431
Okay, I am orbing you guys out of here.

554
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:24,726
No, actually you're gonna
let him feed on you. See ya!

555
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:26,812
- Good luck, man!
- What?

556
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:29,982
Let's see what
you've been hiding from me.

557
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:34,194
There's so much, so ready to come out.

558
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:37,656
Let it out, let it all out.

559
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:39,908
You demons have it so easy.

560
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,412
No morality to worry about,

561
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:47,249
no attachments, no one to lose.

562
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,959
Yeah, you tell him, Leo.

563
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:52,629
When you kill, you feel nothing!

564
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:14,067
How you doing?

565
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:17,529
Feels good to get rid
of all that stuff, huh?

566
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,867
You did it, you vanquished him.

567
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:23,619
Thanks to Leo.

568
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:27,414
Finally, I'm free!

569
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:30,751
Yes, you are.

570
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:54,816
Me? Why don't you send her back?
I don't want to use magic any more.

571
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:58,779
You can't stop using magic any more
than you can stop breathing, Duncan.

572
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:01,406
Well, I don't want
to be that way any more.

573
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:03,534
You don't have a choice, none of us do.

574
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,036
Look, you messed up, big deal!

575
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:09,998
That's what you're here for, to learn,
to gain control over your powers.

576
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:13,877
You have to show that you can fix this
for all our sakes.

577
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:15,838
What if they're watching?

578
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:19,967
I hope they're watching.
You can do this.

579
00:38:25,222 --> 00:38:27,015
So...

580
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,643
...you ready to go back?

581
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:32,104
I can't wait.

582
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:37,568
Duncan, the spell?

583
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,696
Right. Right.

584
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:44,449
A time for everything
and everything in place

585
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:47,452
Return what's been moved
through time and space

586
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:56,253
I knew you could do it.

587
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,007
I got this one.

588
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:04,678
You can't help yourself, can you, Paige?
You just can't leave well enough alone.

589
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:08,682
If "well enough alone"
means shutting down Magic School,

590
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,475
then no. Then no, I can't.

591
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:15,022
If you don't give these amazing kids
a place to go and express themselves,

592
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:18,901
then you are going to be crushing
their spirits and relegating them

593
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:21,904
to hiding in caves and alleyways
and abusing magic

594
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,616
- with nowhere else to turn!
- I think you've made your point.

595
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:28,368
- So...
- So...

596
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:32,498
...we won't shut it down.
- What?

597
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:35,459
As long as you can prove
that you can keep running it.

598
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:38,921
Me? Oh, no, no, no.

599
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,007
No, I'll find someone.

600
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:47,596
You can do this.

601
00:39:57,689 --> 00:39:59,525
Hey, this better be good.

602
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:02,820
I was just in the middle
of putting Wyatt down for a nap.

603
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:07,574
Yeah, it looks like Lady Godiva has
quite an impact on our Phoebe's cause.

604
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:09,910
Oh, my goodness.

605
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:20,295
Yeah!

606
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:38,313
This man is still living
in the 11th century.

607
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,943
He wants women to be barefoot
and pregnant and stay at home.

608
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:47,156
He thinks we should be ashamed
of breast-feeding,

609
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:51,201
the most natural thing in the world.
Well, shame on him!

610
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:54,705
I'm not ashamed
and neither should you be.

611
00:40:57,457 --> 00:41:01,545
It's a shame that women have
to take off their clothes to be heard.

612
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:05,382
We shouldn't have to be
exploited like this. Right?

613
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:07,217
Right! Yeah!

614
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:12,931
There! Are you satisfied now?
