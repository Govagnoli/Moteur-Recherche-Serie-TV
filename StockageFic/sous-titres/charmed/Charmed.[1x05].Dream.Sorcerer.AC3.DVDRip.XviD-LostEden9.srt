1
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,145
Are your parents terrorists?
Because, baby, you're the bomb.

2
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,023
Jim, Jim.
Ask if it hurt when she fell.

3
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,983
- Excuse me?
- When you fell from heaven.

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,820
Did it hurt? Because I know
an angel when I see one.

5
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,241
I'm no angel. I'm a witch.

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,287
But don't tell my sisters I told you.

7
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,999
Oh, I'm so glad
you guys are still here.

8
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,293
What are you staring at?

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,588
They have been going at it
for almost an hour.

10
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,381
Hello.

11
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,345
I can't even look.

12
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,888
I know. I hate being single.

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,639
Waitress coming through.

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,225
Special delivery.

15
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,561
- Hey, Skye.
- Hey, Skye.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,146
Hi.

17
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,817
I think there's been some mistake.
I didn't order this.

18
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,195
I know. You have a secret admirer.

19
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,071
He ordered it for you.

20
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,577
- Who is that?
- I have no idea.

21
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,079
I'm just following
the bartender's orders.

22
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:24,083
And apparently,
he's been eyeing Prue all night.

23
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:27,712
Skye, can you do me a favour?

24
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,049
Tell him thank you and I'm flattered,
but I'm kind of seeing someone else.

25
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:33,134
- Sure.
- Thanks.

26
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,845
This is a nice change of attitude.

27
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,557
I'll say. Does this mean you're thinking
of getting serious with Andy?

28
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,726
Lately, I've been thinking
about a lot of things.

29
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,108
- She didn't want the drink?
- I'm sorry, no.

30
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,360
She's flattered,
she's just seeing someone else.

31
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,988
Yeah, sure she is.

32
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:59,160
How about you? Maybe you'd like
to have a drink with me sometime?

33
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:02,330
Oh, well, that's really sweet of you,

34
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:06,125
but I'm not allowed
to date the customers.

35
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:09,837
- Skye.
- An order's up,

36
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,298
so I've gotta run.

37
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:49,418
Hello, Skye.

38
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:51,295
What the...?

39
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:56,925
You're in my world now, Skye.

40
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:05,267
You look beautiful in that dress.

41
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,811
I knew you would.

42
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,023
I don't understand.

43
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:14,735
It's your dream,
but it's my fantasy.

44
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:16,820
Where am I?

45
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:22,117
You're dreaming. I'm visiting.

46
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:25,579
- You're in my dream?
- Yes.

47
00:03:25,746 --> 00:03:28,165
But I can make it mine.

48
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,252
You can walk.

49
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:36,923
In dreams, I can do anything.

50
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:44,181
I can dance in your dreams.

51
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,189
I can alter your dreams.

52
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:08,037
Hey.

53
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:14,210
And I can kill you in your dreams.

54
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:17,714
No, please.

55
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:26,514
Did you know that if you die
in your dreams, you die in real life?

56
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:30,893
- Please don't hurt me!
- Please don't hurt me!

57
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:35,648
No, Skye, you rejected me.

58
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:38,443
And now you gotta pay.

59
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:41,404
- Please, I'll do anything!
- Please, I'll do anything!

60
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:45,032
Sweet dreams.

61
00:06:30,637 --> 00:06:31,972
What have we got here?

62
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,309
Her name is Skye Russell, early 20s.
She's a waitress at Quake.

63
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:39,146
Every bone in her body's
been crushed.

64
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:43,608
Coroner said it's as if she had
fallen off a 20-story building.

65
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:47,195
But we're inside an apartment...

66
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:50,115
...on the ground floor...

67
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,160
...and her body hasn't been moved.

68
00:06:59,624 --> 00:07:04,921
<i>Keep going.
And press and press and press.</i>

69
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:08,466
<i>Keep working it through.
And press.</i>

70
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:12,929
I give up. Two weeks, and nothing's
strengthened but my temper.

71
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:16,224
Piper, here's the problem.
You didn't read the fine print.

72
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:19,185
See, it says right here,
$19.95 for the video

73
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,187
and 20 grand for the plastic surgeon.

74
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:22,772
Yeah, well, it's worked.

75
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:26,359
She's the most desired female
in America, what every man wants.

76
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:29,404
Of course men want her.
Men are no different from women.

77
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:30,905
We all want what we can't have.

78
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:33,575
Which is why we need to stop
thinking about what men want

79
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:35,618
and start thinking about
what we want in a man.

80
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,746
Tons of fun, lots of heat and no
strings attached. That's what I want.

81
00:07:39,998 --> 00:07:44,210
I know this may not sound very PC,
but I want romance.

82
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:48,214
Long, slow kisses,
late-night talks, candlelight.

83
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:52,176
I love love. I'd take what
Prue has in a flat second.

84
00:07:52,343 --> 00:07:56,222
Then you'd have to deal with the family
secret, which isn't exactly normal, is it?

85
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:06,691
Did you see the coroner's report?

86
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,237
Skye Russell died of massive
internal haemorrhaging.

87
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:13,572
Her body literally imploded upon itself.

88
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:15,825
Ever seen anything like it before?

89
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:19,996
On jumpers, but the bodies
were usually found on sidewalks.

90
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:24,959
There aren't signs of external damage
consistent with any type of fall.

91
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:28,879
- In fact, there's not a scratch on her.
- Yeah, well, maybe we were wrong.

92
00:08:29,046 --> 00:08:31,799
- Maybe her body was moved.
- From where? How?

93
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:35,719
The front door was locked and bolted,
each window had bars on it,

94
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:37,888
none of which had been
tampered with in any way.

95
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:41,308
Nobody but she was in
that apartment last night.

96
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:45,229
It's not a suicide, Morris.

97
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:49,441
And it's sure not death by natural
causes, which leaves only one thing.

98
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:52,903
- Murder.
- I hate it when we say that.

99
00:09:02,204 --> 00:09:03,539
Here you go, Mr Manford.

100
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:06,083
Chicken with rice and vegetables,
just the way you like it.

101
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,920
Chicken well-done, light oil on
the vegetables, and rice steamed dry.

102
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:11,421
Thanks.

103
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:13,423
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

104
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:16,885
Hey, why are you doing that?

105
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:19,846
Skye didn't show up for her shift today,
so we're short-handed.

106
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:26,395
So, what's up?

107
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:29,898
I found this spell:

108
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:31,900
How to attract a lover.

109
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:34,695
No, Phoebe, forget it.
We're not casting any spells.

110
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:38,115
Come on. There must be more
to our powers than warlock wasting.

111
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:40,283
I'm ready to have some fun
with our magic.

112
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:42,285
No. No personal gain, remember?

113
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:44,704
How is it personal gain
if we're using our powers

114
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:47,290
to bring happiness
to another person?

115
00:09:47,457 --> 00:09:51,002
And in my case,
lots and lots of happiness.

116
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:53,129
- Could you pass me that colander?
- Yeah.

117
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:55,382
Look, I'm not talking
about marriage here.

118
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:57,676
We have our 30s
to freak out about that.

119
00:09:57,842 --> 00:09:59,386
This...

120
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:02,347
This spell is about
having a good time.

121
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:07,310
I admit, it's tempting. The dating
scene can be a little frustrating.

122
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:10,605
But bringing a man into our life
through a spell?

123
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:13,358
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but isn't that a little bit desperate?

124
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,985
No, how is asking for what
you want being desperate?

125
00:10:16,152 --> 00:10:17,987
I say it's not. I say it's empowering.

126
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:23,368
<i>Besides, the Book of Shadows says
we could reverse the spell at any time.</i>

127
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:33,545
Piper! Phoebe!

128
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:37,507
Prue, you're home.
I thought you had a date with Andy.

129
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:39,634
No, he had to cancel.
What are you doing?

130
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,594
Piper, I was wrong.

131
00:10:41,803 --> 00:10:44,931
The spell calls for cayenne pepper,
not black pepper.

132
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:49,394
Did I say spell?

133
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:52,397
I meant recipe.

134
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:55,525
We are so busted, aren't we?

135
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:58,402
I would say yes.
What spell are you casting?

136
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,572
I realised today that Phoebe may
have stumbled onto something.

137
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:03,282
Something that actually makes sense.

138
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:05,535
Now I'm worried.

139
00:11:06,077 --> 00:11:08,162
All the spells are in this book
for a reason, right?

140
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:11,582
I think this spell could be a harmless
opportunity for us to test our powers.

141
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:13,251
You know, really get
a handle on them.

142
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:16,087
I mean, why else would it say
we can reverse it at any time?

143
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,214
All I want is someone
special in my life.

144
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:21,550
And this spell provides that exactly.

145
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:24,095
I can translate.

146
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:27,056
- You've got to be kidding.
- We were hoping you would join us.

147
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:31,185
No, I've got enough complications
in my life. You two are on your own.

148
00:11:31,685 --> 00:11:33,229
You know where to find us.

149
00:11:33,813 --> 00:11:36,273
Be careful what you wish for.

150
00:11:39,193 --> 00:11:41,487
- Okay, you wanna go first?
- No. You go first.

151
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:43,072
Okay.

152
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:45,157
Hey, that's not fair.

153
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:50,329
You want a man who is single,
smart, endowed.

154
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:53,791
- Employed.
- Oh, sorry, "employed."

155
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:58,629
"A man who loves sleeping in
on Sundays, sunset bike rides,

156
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:02,758
cuddling by a roaring fire

157
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:04,510
and late-night talks.

158
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:09,223
A man who loves love
as much as you do."

159
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:12,684
- Wow, you're a romantic.
- Yep.

160
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:14,561
Your turn.

161
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:17,314
You want the sexy silent type

162
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:20,359
that finds you driving through town
on the back of a Harley

163
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:21,902
at 3:00 in the morning.

164
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:26,782
"A man who appreciates scented
candles, body oils and Italian sheets."

165
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:31,536
"He's about hunger
and lust and danger.

166
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:34,122
And even though you know all this,
even though you know

167
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:38,085
he'll never meet your friends or share
a holiday meal with your family,

168
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:42,464
you still can't stay away."

169
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:44,883
- And he recycles.
- He recycles?

170
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:48,970
Yeah. And I think it goes without
saying that we both want a man

171
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:52,599
who is well... employed.

172
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:54,643
You're seriously twisted.

173
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:59,314
- This is the spell we have to say?
- Yeah.

174
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:01,816
We're lucky. If we were men
looking for women,

175
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:04,236
the spell requires
putting a piece of honey cake

176
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:06,613
in a sweaty armpit for days.

177
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,533
- Okay. I think we can say this.
- Okay.

178
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,662
<i>- I conjure thee. I conjure thee.
- I conjure thee. I conjure thee.</i>

179
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:16,373
<i>- I'm the queen, you're the bee.
- I'm the queen, you're the bee.</i>

180
00:13:16,623 --> 00:13:19,667
<i>- As I desire, so shall it be.
- As I desire, so shall it be.</i>

181
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,421
<i>- I conjure thee. I conjure thee.
- I conjure thee. I conjure thee.</i>

182
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:25,757
<i>- I'm the queen, you're the bee.
- I'm the queen, you're the bee.</i>

183
00:13:25,965 --> 00:13:28,718
<i>- As I desire, so shall it be.
- As I desire, so shall it be.</i>

184
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:36,017
- Do you think it worked?
- I don't know.

185
00:13:36,184 --> 00:13:38,353
The big spells usually require
all three of us.

186
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:46,527
Is it for me? Is it for me?

187
00:13:46,694 --> 00:13:50,198
Who's this?
I'm sorry, do I know you?

188
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,201
Yeah, we met at Quake.

189
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:55,370
Well, we didn't actually meet.

190
00:13:55,536 --> 00:14:01,042
I sent you a glass of chardonnay,
and you sent it back.

191
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:04,796
Still, you know, I was wondering,

192
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:07,215
maybe you'd like to
go out sometime?

193
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:10,468
Look, as I told the waitress,
I'm just not available.

194
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:13,554
<i>How did you get my number,
my name?</i>

195
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:15,973
Hello?

196
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:18,476
Who is it?

197
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:20,603
That guy from Quake
who sent me a drink.

198
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,315
- What did he want?
- He asked me out.

199
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:27,401
Hello. Missy May,
where are you going?

200
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,405
I'm going to Quake to see if my
spell worked. Wanna join me?

201
00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:33,240
- Pass.
- No, thanks.

202
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:35,701
I'm gonna take a bath.

203
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:21,872
Hello, Prue.

204
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:26,418
- Who...?
- Who am I and how did I get in?

205
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:29,463
- I don't care, just get...
- Out of the bathroom?

206
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:31,465
- Piper, help!
- Piper, help!

207
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:36,261
Scream all you want.
No one can help you.

208
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:38,889
- How did you...?
- Know what you're thinking?

209
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:41,683
- Know what you're going to say?
- Yes.

210
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,773
I am in your unconscious.

211
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:51,151
I know your every thought
and desire.

212
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:53,278
Who are you?

213
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:58,033
I'm the man of your dreams.

214
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:03,497
You are not real. You don't exist.

215
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:06,666
That's what your mother
used to say, isn't it?

216
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:10,378
Every night
before you went to sleep?

217
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:14,716
- You are not real. You don't exist.
- As she tucked you in,

218
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:16,926
- she'd say...
- You are not real. You don't exist.

219
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:20,680
...if you saw any monsters...
- You are not real. You don't exist.

220
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,600
...to tell yourself they weren't real.

221
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:28,480
- You are not real. You don't exist.
- They...

222
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:30,482
...didn't exist.

223
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:35,653
I can't move. Why can't I move?

224
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,158
Because I'm going
to love you to death.

225
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,264
Prue? Are you okay?

226
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:07,018
- Yeah.
- You were yelling.

227
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:10,313
Yeah, I had a...

228
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,275
- I had a really bad thing.
- A thing?

229
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:17,403
Yeah.

230
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:20,114
I'm okay now.

231
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:23,242
I promise. Just go back to bed.

232
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:40,051
Oh, my God.

233
00:17:50,186 --> 00:17:53,439
Do you remember what Mom
used to say about nightmares?

234
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:58,277
She said if we saw any monsters to tell
them to go away, that they didn't exist.

235
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,778
Always worked too.

236
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:01,989
Yeah, well, not this time.

237
00:18:03,073 --> 00:18:05,284
He knew about Mom.

238
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,954
He knew what she told us,
and how did he know that?

239
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:12,249
And what about the marks
on my back?

240
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,794
Piper, they were there
and now they've disappeared.

241
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,089
I don't know how and I don't know why,
but they were definitely there.

242
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:22,760
How many hours did you work
this week? Sixty, 70?

243
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:25,971
And what are you doing today,
on a Saturday no less?

244
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:30,476
The auction starts on Monday, and
the shipment arrived three days late.

245
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:34,855
And you're changing the subject.
You don't believe me.

246
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:38,609
No, I believe you think
you saw marks on your back.

247
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:41,403
But I'm watching you down
your third cup of coffee,

248
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,198
and we're talking about a nightmare
you had while asleep in the tub.

249
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:47,993
So isn't it possible that exhaustion
made you see those marks

250
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,579
and not some dream guy?

251
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:53,040
No. He was in my dream.
It was real.

252
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,334
So why didn't you use
your power to help you out?

253
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:58,670
- You know, move him away.
- I don't know.

254
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:00,213
Morning.

255
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:04,885
What...?

256
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:08,471
Excuse me, but who are you?

257
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:11,558
- Who cares?
- Hans,

258
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:14,978
I found your T-shirt.

259
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:17,731
Was it in the hammock or...?

260
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:20,025
- It doesn't matter.
- Thanks.

261
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,651
Sure.

262
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:23,486
<i>Hammock?</i>

263
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:25,655
- Well, I gotta run.
- Okay.

264
00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:27,991
I'll meet you later for lunch.

265
00:19:28,158 --> 00:19:30,660
- Okay.
- I almost forgot.

266
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,801
Don't worry. We had safe sex.

267
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,469
A lot of safe sex.

268
00:19:56,978 --> 00:20:00,023
- It's all here in their FBI files.
- Why do you do this to me?

269
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:01,774
Three young women,
completely unrelated

270
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:04,652
except for the fact they died
the exact same way as the waitress.

271
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:09,240
Medical examiner listed them
all as jumpers. Case closed.

272
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:11,534
Look at the crime photos.

273
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:14,954
All the vics were found
locked in their rooms.

274
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:19,667
We got the M.O.
Of a serial killer here, Morris.

275
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:25,590
I'm telling you, Piper,
the spell worked.

276
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:27,925
A little louder, Pheebs,
I don't think Oakland heard.

277
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:31,470
Well, it did. Get this.
Hans doesn't go to bars.

278
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:33,598
He's never been to Quake.
But last night,

279
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:37,643
he's on his way back
from his acting class when, bam!

280
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,981
Flat tire on his motorcycle,
right across the street from Quake.

281
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,108
So he comes in
to use the payphone,

282
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:49,530
and who should he bump into but me,
exiting the ladies' room.

283
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:51,949
Phoebe, you threw his clothes
all over the house.

284
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:54,243
That's not a spell working,
that's hormones.

285
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,871
No, it's not like that.

286
00:20:57,121 --> 00:21:00,416
I really like Hans. He's really cool.

287
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,210
And he likes me too.

288
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:19,143
Mr Manford, here you go. Chicken,
rice, veggies, just the way you like it.

289
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:21,770
Thank you, and please call me Jack.

290
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:27,985
Has anybody ever told you
how truly beautiful you are?

291
00:21:29,236 --> 00:21:30,988
Have you been drinking?

292
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,366
A sense of humour. I love that.

293
00:21:35,784 --> 00:21:37,494
Wait, Piper, don't go.

294
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:39,496
I don't know why,

295
00:21:39,663 --> 00:21:42,583
but I've gotta get to know you.
Have dinner with me.

296
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,127
Can you hang on a second?

297
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:01,143
Prue Halliwell, please.
It's her sister Piper.

298
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:04,062
You know you shouldn't have
dinner with that guy.

299
00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:06,440
Why not?

300
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:10,318
Because you should
fly to Paris with me.

301
00:22:11,653 --> 00:22:14,072
Tell her it's an emergency.

302
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:21,288
So you're not actually thinking of going
out with this Jack guy, are you?

303
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:23,540
Have you finished
the Cromwell miniatures yet?

304
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:25,834
Rex. Hang on a second.

305
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:28,086
No, I'm still cataloguing
the Rembrandt sketches.

306
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:30,588
Oh, well, set them aside.

307
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:34,342
The letters of Ernest Hemingway
are now first on the block.

308
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:36,761
Thanks, boys.

309
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:40,181
I don't believe it,
I'm gonna be here all night.

310
00:22:40,348 --> 00:22:42,475
Piper, let me call you back.

311
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,233
Jack stayed through the entire
lunch shift, talked my ear off,

312
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,485
had me laughing at all his stories

313
00:22:52,652 --> 00:22:56,155
and somehow convinced me
to have coffee with him.

314
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:59,534
Hans and I are going dancing at Rave.
You and Jack should come join us.

315
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:02,078
Well, if our dinner date lasts
as long as our coffee break,

316
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:04,330
we wouldn't make it there till closing.

317
00:23:04,497 --> 00:23:07,458
Maybe we could all meet
back at the house later.

318
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:11,546
This has worked out
so great, hasn't it?

319
00:23:11,754 --> 00:23:13,214
Yeah.

320
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,011
Great.

321
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:24,183
So this is a dream lab?
They actually pay people to sleep?

322
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,145
If you wait here, I'll tell Mr Berman
you'd like to speak with him.

323
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:29,272
Thank you.

324
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:34,443
Look, just because Berman
dated the first victim...

325
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,904
- Julie Derikson?
...doesn't make him a killer.

326
00:23:37,071 --> 00:23:40,032
Yeah, but it's a great place to start.

327
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:43,411
Hell, it's our only place to start.

328
00:23:43,577 --> 00:23:45,246
What do you know
about this place anyway?

329
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:47,999
It's a privately funded
research facility.

330
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:50,960
And Julie Derikson worked here too.

331
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:55,297
She and Berman were teamed
together on some experimental project.

332
00:23:56,507 --> 00:23:58,926
Hello, inspectors.

333
00:23:59,677 --> 00:24:01,178
How may I help you?

334
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:12,731
You Whitaker Berman?

335
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:16,318
Yes. What's this about?

336
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,863
We're conducting an investigation.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

337
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,824
Oh. Regarding?

338
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:25,661
You know this woman?

339
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:34,211
That's Julie Derikson.
She was my girlfriend.

340
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:39,091
I was heartbroken when she...

341
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:42,719
Forgive me,

342
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:45,722
it's just very hard. I...

343
00:24:46,348 --> 00:24:48,016
I still miss her.

344
00:24:48,892 --> 00:24:51,520
Another woman died
just like her the other night.

345
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:53,855
A waitress, crushed
to death in her sleep.

346
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:56,066
Oh, you're kidding.

347
00:24:56,358 --> 00:24:57,734
No.

348
00:24:57,901 --> 00:25:00,320
That's... That's awful.

349
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:03,990
Could you tell us your whereabouts
the night before last?

350
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:08,662
I was here in the lab, asleep.

351
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:11,164
I left in the morning.

352
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:13,583
Any witnesses
who can confirm that?

353
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,463
A night's worth of data,
two scientists and a lab technician.

354
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,674
Shall I have them paged?

355
00:25:20,882 --> 00:25:24,761
No, that's okay, Mr Berman.
We're sorry we disturbed you.

356
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:26,721
Thank you for your time.

357
00:25:39,025 --> 00:25:41,403
What else can I tell you?

358
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:45,156
When I get stressed,
I get hives in very strange places.

359
00:25:45,323 --> 00:25:48,827
Which is nothing compared to what
happens when I panic, believe me.

360
00:25:48,993 --> 00:25:51,287
Your honesty is so refreshing.

361
00:25:52,122 --> 00:25:54,582
Well, it helps keep
my ulcer under control.

362
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:59,003
It's the '90s. Is there anyone
who doesn't have one?

363
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,382
- Would you like to see my tattoo?
- Would you like to see mine?

364
00:26:03,591 --> 00:26:05,301
Is there nothing I can say
to turn you off?

365
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:07,220
There really isn't.

366
00:26:07,428 --> 00:26:09,305
Which is kind of strange, actually.

367
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:11,182
Not really.

368
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:14,727
Jack, you're under a...

369
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:21,234
Spell.

370
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:33,287
Hey there.

371
00:26:48,594 --> 00:26:51,222
Give me 30 cc's of Androvin.

372
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:53,432
Thirty cc's? That's twice...

373
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,811
I'll be in REM sleep
quicker and longer.

374
00:26:56,977 --> 00:26:59,730
Set the dream-inducement system
to level 12.

375
00:26:59,897 --> 00:27:02,983
You haven't got the results back
from level eight.

376
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:07,404
This is my grant, my experiment.

377
00:27:07,571 --> 00:27:11,534
Set the machine
and give me the shot.

378
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:29,385
Hello, Prue. We meet again.

379
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:34,390
All that work, all those hours,
you fell asleep at your desk.

380
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,018
- Someone help!
- What do you hide from at work?

381
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,562
Is it the pain of your past

382
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:44,525
or the uncertainty of your future?

383
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,902
I don't hide from anything.

384
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:49,530
You can't move
out of the chair, can you?

385
00:27:50,822 --> 00:27:52,616
Don't you wonder why?

386
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:57,079
Because I don't want you to.
You're powerless, Prue.

387
00:27:57,287 --> 00:28:00,249
- Go to hell.
- I, on the other hand, am all-powerful.

388
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:03,210
You don't wanna talk to me?
That's fine.

389
00:28:04,086 --> 00:28:05,545
There's always Piper, Phoebe

390
00:28:05,712 --> 00:28:08,465
or any number of young,
single women out there.

391
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:10,967
It's an endless pool
for the Dream Sorcerer.

392
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:12,511
No, wait, I'll stay.

393
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:14,763
It's too late. You're falling asleep.

394
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,431
No, I'm fine. I'm awake.

395
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:19,101
Shall I sing you a lullaby?

396
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:20,936
I don't think so.

397
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,733
- No!
- Good night, Prue.

398
00:28:35,575 --> 00:28:37,786
- Hello.
- Hi, you're still at the office.

399
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:42,415
Yeah, can I call you back?

400
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:45,418
Sure. I'm at the station house.

401
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:48,755
<i>- Everything okay?
- It is now.</i>

402
00:28:49,714 --> 00:28:51,966
Thanks, Andy.
Thanks for calling.

403
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:54,469
I just wanted to hear your voice.

404
00:28:55,428 --> 00:28:57,097
Okay, bye.

405
00:28:58,807 --> 00:29:01,434
Prue? Bloody hell.

406
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:20,244
The man is in a wheelchair.

407
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:23,539
He's got no motive,
and he's got an alibi.

408
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:27,585
So tell me again why you think
Berman is our suspect.

409
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,588
- Dream leaping.
- Dream leaping?

410
00:29:31,047 --> 00:29:33,966
That's what Berman's researching
at the lab, dream leaping.

411
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:36,719
The ability to project himself
into someone else's dreams.

412
00:29:36,886 --> 00:29:40,223
Into women's dreams
and killing them?

413
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,058
Now who's dreaming?

414
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:46,020
Not just any women.
Women who reject him.

415
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:48,022
Just like Julie Derikson did.

416
00:29:48,231 --> 00:29:50,566
She broke up with him
while they were driving somewhere.

417
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:54,278
They got into an accident.
That's why he's paralysed.

418
00:29:56,197 --> 00:29:58,532
It's all there in the police report.

419
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:00,576
The day after he went
back to work at the lab,

420
00:30:00,743 --> 00:30:02,453
Julie Derikson died suspiciously.

421
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:08,042
Six months later, two more women
died in their sleep, crushed to death.

422
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:10,669
Coincidence? You tell me.

423
00:30:11,796 --> 00:30:14,465
Love to. Can't.

424
00:30:14,673 --> 00:30:16,258
Let's go.

425
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:24,266
I'm home.

426
00:30:39,073 --> 00:30:41,450
- You're home early.
- Yeah, so are you.

427
00:30:41,617 --> 00:30:44,411
What's with all the flowers?
You and Jack fighting already?

428
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,916
I wish. The flowers were all waiting
on the doorstep when I returned.

429
00:30:49,082 --> 00:30:52,503
They're from men I barely know
and men I've never met.

430
00:30:52,753 --> 00:30:54,713
All the flowers in here are for you.

431
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,508
Oh, well,

432
00:30:57,674 --> 00:31:00,177
- I know they're not from Hans.
- What happened?

433
00:31:00,385 --> 00:31:04,306
He wouldn't leave me alone all night.
He kept touching me.

434
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,850
And practically every guy
in the bar was hitting on me.

435
00:31:07,017 --> 00:31:11,855
Finally, I couldn't take it anymore.
I ditched Hans and left him at the club.

436
00:31:12,022 --> 00:31:13,690
So how was your date?

437
00:31:13,857 --> 00:31:18,445
Perfect. Everything was perfect.
Even my faults were perfect.

438
00:31:18,737 --> 00:31:20,113
And this is a bad thing?

439
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:24,701
It wasn't real. Everything he said,
everything he felt,

440
00:31:24,868 --> 00:31:27,662
it was because of the spell.
Not because of me.

441
00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:30,790
Piper, you don't know that.
Maybe he meant every word.

442
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:34,252
Maybe if it wasn't for the spell,
he would've never had the chance

443
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:36,504
to feel those things,
let alone say them.

444
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:38,131
No, Phoebe,

445
00:31:38,298 --> 00:31:41,176
Iove is a magic between two
people that cannot be explained

446
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:43,595
and cannot be conjured.

447
00:31:43,762 --> 00:31:46,473
What we did, it's just... It's not right.

448
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:50,977
Even our poor cat's in hell.

449
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,356
Go away, horny tomcats.

450
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:58,359
Let's reverse the spell.

451
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:06,367
Hello?

452
00:32:06,534 --> 00:32:09,204
- Prue, where are you?
- I'm still at the office.

453
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,540
Look, I fell asleep and that man from
my dream, he tried to kill me again.

454
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:14,834
- What?
- Yeah, I don't understand why.

455
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:18,254
All I know is, I'm only safe if I stay
awake. If I fall asleep, I'm dead.

456
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:20,381
Stay where you are.
We'll come pick you up.

457
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,884
No, I don't wanna stay here
another minute.

458
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:26,054
<i>Look in the Book of Shadows and see
if you can find anything on this guy.</i>

459
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,057
He calls himself
a Dream Sorcerer, okay?

460
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:34,812
- Nothing?
- Nada.

461
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:36,105
There's gotta be something.

462
00:32:36,272 --> 00:32:39,233
I'm telling you, there's no
Dream Sorcerer stuff anywhere.

463
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,028
<i>That's impossible. The Book
of Shadows has never let us down.</i>

464
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:44,780
Maybe he's not a demon.
Maybe he's a mortal.

465
00:32:44,947 --> 00:32:47,950
- Then he's got one hell of a power.
- You're not kidding.

466
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:52,079
Demon, mortal. There's gotta
be some way to stop him.

467
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,624
That's gotta be Prue.

468
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,709
Wait. What are we gonna tell her?

469
00:32:56,876 --> 00:33:00,004
That we can't help her?
That she can never go to sleep?

470
00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:07,553
Come on, answer the phone.

471
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:12,725
- Hello?
- Hey, did you find anything?

472
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:16,562
No. But don't worry, you're not in this
alone. Phoebe and I will help you.

473
00:33:16,771 --> 00:33:18,606
We don't even know what he is.

474
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,901
The most important thing right now
is for you to get home safely.

475
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:26,322
Okay, look, just keep talking.
Don't let me fall asleep.

476
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,907
She sounds exhausted.

477
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:32,620
Okay, blast the air conditioning, crank
the stereo and roll down the windows.

478
00:33:32,786 --> 00:33:36,081
Don't crank the stereo. What's that
song we'd sing when we were little?

479
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,500
- The road-trip song?
- Yeah. Did you hear that, Prue?

480
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:40,586
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, don't worry.

481
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:44,089
Everything's gonna be fine.
Nothing is gonna happen.

482
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:46,675
- Phoebe!
- What the...? Hans?

483
00:33:46,884 --> 00:33:48,927
Let me in, I have to see you!

484
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,429
Go away.

485
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:54,600
<i>- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- Piper? Phoebe?</i>

486
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,896
You left me.
How could you leave me?

487
00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:00,981
- Hans, please.
- Ever since I met you,

488
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:03,817
I can't do anything. Eat, drink, sleep!

489
00:34:03,984 --> 00:34:05,819
All I can do is think about you!

490
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:08,030
Piper.

491
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,490
Phoebe.

492
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:12,826
The time is now, Prue.

493
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,703
We're almost there.

494
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:18,498
Piper, Phoebe, where are you?

495
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:20,667
What have you done to me?

496
00:34:25,005 --> 00:34:27,382
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

497
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:29,176
Prue.

498
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:39,019
Prue. Prue!

499
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:41,354
She's not there.

500
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:44,274
Say good night, Prue.

501
00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:51,948
<i>- The mobile unit you are...
- She's not answering.</i>

502
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:11,718
I can't fall asleep.

503
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,639
Can't fall asleep.

504
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,396
Watch the line.

505
00:35:23,563 --> 00:35:25,940
- What's open?
- Trauma 1.

506
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:28,109
- What do you got?
- I got a 27-year-old female.

507
00:35:28,276 --> 00:35:31,904
One-on-one, car versus utility pole.
BP, 80/40. Pulse, 110.

508
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:34,365
Semiconscious at the scene.

509
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:38,161
Pupils are responsive.
Miss Halliwell, hang in there.

510
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:40,204
Must stay awake.

511
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,582
Must stay awake.

512
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:47,503
Where's X-ray? I want a C-spine now.
And have CT prep for us.

513
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,758
- Do you want a CBC and an MLP?
- Yes.

514
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:57,305
Ready. One, two, three.

515
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:07,315
- Resps down to 35. Pulse ox is falling.
- That can't be.

516
00:36:07,773 --> 00:36:10,109
Give me 500 mics of dopamine
and get ready to intubate.

517
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,903
Stay with us, Miss Halliwell.

518
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,530
Damn, she's unconscious.

519
00:36:17,158 --> 00:36:20,161
- How did I get here? I'm not...
- Asleep?

520
00:36:20,786 --> 00:36:24,790
Actually, you're unconscious.
You fell asleep at the wheel,

521
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:29,211
hit a pole. Terrible, terrible thing.

522
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:35,301
Speaking of pain,
you really hurt me last night.

523
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:37,845
And not just my feelings.

524
00:36:38,137 --> 00:36:39,930
Suffer.

525
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:44,768
We're definitely out of range.

526
00:36:46,353 --> 00:36:49,440
Want a little wine with your death?

527
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:58,949
Mr Berman insists that he's not
to be disturbed during his experiment.

528
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,869
I don't care. We wanna talk to him.
Just wake him up.

529
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:04,163
It's not gonna be easy.
He's heavily sedated.

530
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:06,290
Just get to work.

531
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,167
- I hope you're right about this.
- I know I am.

532
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:14,172
The question now isn't if Berman's
gonna kill again, but who?

533
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,558
- Do you like the dress?
- I've worn better.

534
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:27,811
Yeah.

535
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:47,163
Excuse me.
You called us a little while ago.

536
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,624
Our sister is here, Prue Halliwell.

537
00:37:53,295 --> 00:37:55,714
- Your sister's still in Trauma 1.
- Is she okay?

538
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,133
Go to the waiting room,
a doctor will be right with you.

539
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,593
Okay, thank you.

540
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:10,895
Mr Berman! Mr Berman, wake up!

541
00:38:11,062 --> 00:38:14,899
I don't care what it takes.
You wake him up. Now!

542
00:38:19,404 --> 00:38:21,489
Berman, wake up!

543
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:24,284
Come on, Berman!

544
00:38:27,287 --> 00:38:29,122
<i>Wake up, Berman!</i>

545
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:30,957
Andy.

546
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,171
We're here, Prue, right beside you.

547
00:38:37,338 --> 00:38:38,673
Can you hear us?

548
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:42,176
<i>Prue?</i>

549
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,304
Piper? Phoebe?

550
00:38:45,471 --> 00:38:47,974
<i>- Prue?
- They can't help you.</i>

551
00:38:48,141 --> 00:38:50,685
You're mine now.

552
00:38:58,109 --> 00:39:00,027
I'm scared.

553
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:02,822
I know. Me too.

554
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:05,616
What do we do?

555
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:08,452
We don't let her give up.

556
00:39:08,953 --> 00:39:13,124
Prue, listen to me.
You have got to fight this guy.

557
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:15,918
- Don't leave us.
- You can do it.

558
00:39:16,127 --> 00:39:18,921
- We need you.
- Use your power, Prue.

559
00:39:19,547 --> 00:39:20,881
Come back to us.

560
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:25,970
<i>- Use your power, Prue.
- You can do it, Prue.</i>

561
00:39:26,137 --> 00:39:28,347
Where are you?

562
00:39:28,514 --> 00:39:30,349
You're powerless.

563
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:33,435
<i>- Prue, you can do it.
- You're stronger.</i>

564
00:39:33,602 --> 00:39:35,646
<i>Use your power against him.</i>

565
00:39:35,813 --> 00:39:39,024
<i>- Use your power, Prue.
- Don't leave us.</i>

566
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:40,734
<i>Prue.</i>

567
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:45,990
<i>- You can do it.
- Use your power.</i>

568
00:39:47,574 --> 00:39:50,619
<i>- Prue.
- Shall I say good night?</i>

569
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:57,084
No, let me.

570
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,461
Good night.

571
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,309
I don't believe it.

572
00:40:14,476 --> 00:40:17,521
- He's dead.
- I'll never doubt you again.

573
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:23,610
Prue?

574
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:26,780
Are you okay?

575
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:29,616
Yeah, I'm okay.

576
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:33,078
What about the...?

577
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:36,164
He's gone.

578
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,894
Knock, knock.

579
00:40:58,061 --> 00:41:00,689
- Tell me you're here to pick me up.
- Hi.

580
00:41:00,897 --> 00:41:03,525
No, Dr Black said
one more day just to be sure.

581
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:06,194
Yeah, and you know, it wouldn't
kill you to get some rest.

582
00:41:08,238 --> 00:41:10,323
Phoebe, it's okay.
Thanks for the flowers.

583
00:41:10,907 --> 00:41:12,450
Yeah.

584
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:15,161
What's going on?

585
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,704
Long story, not very interesting.

586
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:19,791
Does this have anything
to do with your lust spell?

587
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:23,545
- But don't worry.
- We reversed the spell last night.

588
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:26,172
- Piper called Jack.
- The guy that you had dinner with?

589
00:41:26,506 --> 00:41:28,466
And he didn't remember anything.

590
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:32,554
- And Phoebe called Hans.
- And he didn't remember anything.

591
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,056
So don't worry,
everything is back to normal.

592
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,141
- Good.
- Afternoon, ladies.

593
00:41:37,934 --> 00:41:39,269
Surprise.

594
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,938
Yes, it is.

595
00:41:42,105 --> 00:41:44,565
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't tell him.

596
00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:46,651
Guilty. Come on, let's go.

597
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:48,152
Okay. Bye.

598
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,281
- We'll see you later tonight?
- After we raid your closet.

599
00:41:53,658 --> 00:41:55,451
Brought your favourite.

600
00:41:56,452 --> 00:41:58,162
Oh, cheeseburgers and fries.

601
00:41:59,747 --> 00:42:01,749
Glad to see every bone
in your body's not broken.

602
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:04,210
- What?
- The car accident.

603
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,212
Never mind.

604
00:42:07,421 --> 00:42:09,090
Thank you.
