1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:05,797
Okay. How's this?
He looks like a little angel.

2
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:12,054
Yeah, now that you mention it,
not so big on the whole "up there" look.

3
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,348
Maybe we should try the brown again.

4
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:23,440
Okay, then. Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:28,028
You know what? It is kinda blah, huh?
I like the Moroccan one.

6
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,613
Other people are waiting.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,742
I've waiting years. Ever since Wyatt
was born, I wanted a family portrait.

8
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,661
It's always one thing or another,

9
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,705
he's going you know what,
you're going bonkers.

10
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,417
- She exaggerates a little.
- Now that I have everyone here,

11
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,879
I'm not gonna be pressured
into making any hasty decisions.

12
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,840
At this point, it wouldn't be.

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,760
Can I help it
if I want it to be perfect?

14
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:56,139
Piper, it's gonna be perfect no matter
what the backdrop. You look beautiful.

15
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,267
Okay, then. Let's do this.

16
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,019
Alrighty, then. Here we go.

17
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,355
Happy octopus, everyone say cheese.

18
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:14,575
- Guys, this really isn't a good time.
- This can't wait.

19
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,120
- Neither can this.
- We've gotten word of something.

20
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,790
Someone has information
which could bring the sisters to us,

21
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,001
help them to see the beauty of our way.

22
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,919
Really? Great. Are you sure?

23
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:30,424
Yes, but she's under attack
by demons, even as we speak.

24
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,595
You must save her and bring her home,
so she can share what she knows.

25
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,182
She may be our last best chance
at convincing the sisters.

26
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,395
This isn't gonna go over very well.

27
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,112
- Good job. Nice smiles, everyone.
- Okay, got it, great.

28
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,698
- So I gotta go.
- We get three poses.

29
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,034
I know, but something's come up.

30
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,161
Are we going to do this or what?

31
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,500
It's the Elders, isn't it?
We can't have a grace period,

32
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,336
a normal family moment
without them jingling?

33
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,047
It's not always
gonna be like this, Piper.

34
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:14,009
What is it, like a dog whistle now,
only you can hear it?

35
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,761
You have keys to the car?

36
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,357
Try to see your way
out of this, little traitor!

37
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,083
This can't be right.

38
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,298
My hero.

39
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:59,198
I have got a lump that won't quit
from one of those little snits.

40
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,951
- You sure you can't heal a demon?
- Don't push it, I saved your life.

41
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,621
Only 'cause
the stuffed shirts made you.

42
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,916
I still don't understand
why you didn't just shimmer out.

43
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,294
And miss you coming to meet me?
That would have been rude.

44
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:16,173
Plus, I'm eager to make a deal
with your bosses.

45
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,343
So why did the Elders send you anyway?

46
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,012
They know we had a thing?

47
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,847
We didn't have a thing.

48
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,808
Trying to put that ugly past
behind you, I get it.

49
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,437
- Don't waste seeing powers on me.
- Don't have to be a seer to know.

50
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,857
So, is this where it all happens?

51
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,693
Oh, my God.

52
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,696
Don't tell me that's...

53
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,158
Tell me why your fellow
demons are trying to kill you.

54
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,410
The Elders didn't tell you?

55
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,081
You know, you're hard to read.

56
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,458
But that's okay. I like a challenge.

57
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,793
Answer the question.

58
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,046
I'm selling them out
for bigger things and they're miffed.

59
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,298
Not that they wouldn't
do the same to me.

60
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:02,719
I gotta fill Piper in. Sisters find
you up here, they're gonna kill you.

61
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,431
No, actually they won't.
I've seen my death, no babes involved.

62
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:10,519
Then they'll definitely kill me,
so I need to break it to them gently.

63
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,771
You stay here.

64
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,109
Okay.

65
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,490
Damn!

66
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,743
Don't make any loud noises.

67
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,996
I have a soufflÃ© in the oven

68
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,915
and you have done
enough damage for one day.

69
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,085
- I'm sorry. It was...
- I don't know what I was expecting.

70
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,838
I don't know why I thought
it would be different,

71
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,633
why I thought we could have
a normal family when you're just a blur.

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,302
That's a little extreme.

73
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,471
It's not like I'm running away
all the time. It was once.

74
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,016
No. No, I mean the picture.

75
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,898
In the picture, you're just a blur.

76
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,904
But you know what? What the heck,
I'm gonna hang it anyway.

77
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,280
Better than nothing.

78
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,325
It was important.

79
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,244
And so is Paige's
dinner date tonight with Kyle.

80
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,122
So, if you're done being
errand boy for the Elders,

81
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,918
can you give the kids a bath,
because I need to finish her dinner.

82
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,004
They want us to protect a demon.

83
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,215
They want us to do what?

84
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,052
- Protect a demon, just until...
- No, I heard you the first time.

85
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:29,389
The answer is absolutely not. This
is how things spiral out of control.

86
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,605
I think you should wear
this green top. It's really cute.

87
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:40,442
You could wear it with jeans, and
you'll be comfy and he'll be comfy.

88
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,819
I'm dressed, I'm not changing, go away.

89
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,573
I know, but don't you think
that's a little much for a house date?

90
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,285
He's gonna walk in the door
and wanna throw you down on the floor.

91
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,079
Exactly.

92
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,039
All right, but look at this one.

93
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:57,459
It's sparkly, it's soft, it's cashmere.

94
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,337
I already have butterflies
in my stomach, honey.

95
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:04,550
I just... I don't need Cupid
fluttering around me also.

96
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,636
You really do look beautiful.
Let me get this for you.

97
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:08,971
Thank you.

98
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,599
I cannot believe that I hooked up
so many couples in this town,

99
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,519
and does my own sister
listen to me? No.

100
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:19,273
I took your advice
and made a home-cooked meal,

101
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,983
even though I can't cook.

102
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,112
Yeah, minor detail. The point is,
you'll be home, you'll be on your turf,

103
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,573
you don't have
to talk about Avatar stuff.

104
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,284
I hope that's all
that's holding him back.

105
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,870
Oh, honey, he's a workaholic.

106
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,914
I mean, there's chemistry
between you guys, right?

107
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,667
There is so much chemistry,
I feel like I'm...

108
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,920
Okay, you know what?
I don't need to hear how you feel.

109
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:47,426
This is gonna work out
because it's too good for it not to.

110
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:50,804
- You think so?
- Yes, I do.

111
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,185
- To make sure, I'd wear the green top.
- Enough with the green shirt!

112
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,645
You're right,
he'll love what you have on.

113
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,648
- Demon! No active power, do something!
- Mirror!

114
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,490
Is that my bad luck or yours?

115
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,742
Plant!

116
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,579
Leo, a little help, please!

117
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,081
Did she just call for Leo?

118
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,043
There is a demon in the attic
and you didn't tell me?

119
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,086
I tried, but you wouldn't let me.

120
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,047
Sure, blame me. Good God!

121
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,519
What is your problem? Are you crazy?

122
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,272
I brought her. We need to protect her.
She has information we need.

123
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,983
I don't think so. Piper, are you okay?

124
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,905
Okay, Kyle's coming tonight.
There'll be no demons in this house!

125
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,198
Not any night.

126
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,617
That surly one is your wife?

127
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:57,204
- Surly? Do you know her?
- Who cares, just blow her up!

128
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,039
- You can't.
- Watch me.

129
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,918
Fine. Kill me. Who cares if I have
enough to kill all upper-level demons?

130
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,378
You should hear her out.

131
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,296
Especially after hunky guy here

132
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,299
went to all that trouble
to rescue me from demons.

133
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,762
Wait, the Elders are getting us
to save demons from other demons?

134
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,264
Unbelievable!

135
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,141
The demons don't
want her working with us.

136
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,435
We just have to protect her until...

137
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,897
Okay, that's Kyle. Get upstairs!

138
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,276
Relax, relax. Everything
is gonna be great, and later,

139
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,987
everything gonna
be really, really great.

140
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,238
Really?

141
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:35,826
Hey, easy with the goods there, sister!
Just don't let him eat the eggplant!

142
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,579
What? What's wrong with my eggplant?

143
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,582
Hi.

144
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,252
Hey. You... you look beautiful.

145
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,962
Thank you.

146
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,630
You're welcome.

147
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,132
She's a traitor!

148
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,801
- The Seer must die!
- Strike harder!

149
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,511
- Kill her!
- Death to the Seer!

150
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:55,846
Quiet!

151
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,058
The Seer is protected
by the Charmed Ones now.

152
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:04,271
We'll never get to her before
she sells us out. We have no choice

153
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,356
but to release Zankou!

154
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,902
No, Zankou can never be freed.

155
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,320
She's right.

156
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,825
The Source banished him
for good reasons. He's too powerful.

157
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,368
He'll control us all.

158
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,163
We need his powers
to go up against the witches.

159
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,624
What the Seer tells them
will destroy us.

160
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,461
She must be stopped or we'll die.
I say free Zankou.

161
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,593
Or not.

162
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:41,808
Anyone else afraid to go up
against the Charmed Ones?

163
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:49,942
So, not only do you run a school
and battle demons, you cook too?

164
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,153
Well, actually, I...

165
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:57,032
Would you like some eggplant?

166
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,661
I can't. I'm allergic to eggplant.

167
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,706
Really? Interesting.

168
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,625
I'm stuffed. It was great.

169
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,753
I can't remember the last time
I had a home-cooked meal.

170
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,421
I'm glad we put a stop to that.

171
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,759
So, I like you, you like me,
I don't see what the big problem is.

172
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:19,513
Wow! You just say whatever
pops into your mind, huh?

173
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,390
You're avoiding the question.

174
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:24,518
Well, I don't know how to answer it.

175
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:29,189
Okay, just... Why don't you
just tell me what's on your mind?

176
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,441
Okay.

177
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,737
Do you remember a little while ago, I...

178
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,073
...I told you I didn't have any secrets?

179
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,368
Please tell me you're not married.

180
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,246
No, no, it's nothing like that.
It's more like...

181
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,582
I don't want you
to be disappointed in me.

182
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:54,590
What if I told you
I did not cook this meal?

183
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,887
You didn't, huh?

184
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,390
No, I can't cook.

185
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,810
I talked Piper into doing it for me.
Do you hate me?

186
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:08,770
No.

187
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,816
No, I don't.

188
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,159
Don't mind me. As you were.

189
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,330
I think maybe we should go upstairs.

190
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,128
Darryl, hey!
Now's not really a good time.

191
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,631
Not that I'm not thrilled to see you.

192
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:39,801
Listen, I'm here
about Inspector Sheridan, Phoebe.

193
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,803
And what I think he did to her.

194
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,932
Well, what's going on? Did you find her?

195
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,476
No, and when I confronted Brody on it,

196
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:50,354
he said that she jumped
to a top secret task force.

197
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,315
- That's why there's no record.
- That's it, right?

198
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,318
No. There's always a record somewhere.

199
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,821
So I looked for something
that you could scry with.

200
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,490
- And?
- Her apartment,

201
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:05,118
her records, all have been
cleaned out, like a professional job.

202
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,412
Someone does not want me to find her.

203
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,582
I think that someone
went upstairs with your sister.

204
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:14,127
Forget happy endings,
we can't even have a happy beginning.

205
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,129
Look...

206
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,175
...I found this jammed
behind Sheridan's deck.

207
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:23,011
It's a long shot, but,
you know, if she used it...

208
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,848
I'll see what I can do.

209
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:35,023
Oh, and can you get me one of those
cute little scrunchie-faced dogs?

210
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,068
A shar-pei, I think they're called.

211
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,778
I always wanted a pet.

212
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:43,031
Oh, and if you can throw in
a lap pool, that would be great.

213
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,868
Narrow it down to your top ten demands.

214
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,371
Hey, I've got something you want, okay?

215
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,624
The minute I spill my guts,
I have no more bargaining chips,

216
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,586
so I'm milking it for all I can.

217
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,796
Were the boys okay when you left?

218
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,215
Yes, Miss Donovan was reading to them.

219
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,426
Did you get the shar-pei down?

220
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,971
'Cause Chris has that rash
and Wyatt's been a little cranky.

221
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,599
They're fine.
We leave 'em there all the time.

222
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,728
Exactly, they spend more time at Magic
School lately than they do at home.

223
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,939
- She's right, you know.
- You stay out of it.

224
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:20,527
I don't want to leave them. We need to
take care of this before demons attack.

225
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:24,072
On that note,
let's move this along, shall we?

226
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:27,951
See, it's endless. I'm never gonna
be able to spend time with my kids

227
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:31,538
while we're single-handedly
trying to rid the world of demons.

228
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,500
Hello? I'm a demon you can get rid of.

229
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,960
Preferably before I'm ambushed again.

230
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,964
Okay, here's her list.
Go see what the Elders have to say.

231
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:44,384
Hold on, I've got one more thing
I'd like to add to that list,

232
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,429
and it's something
only the Elders can give.

233
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,056
And it's a deal-breaker.

234
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,268
I want to be made human.

235
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,103
What?

236
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,650
Why in the hell would a powerful
demon want to be made human?

237
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,946
"Hell" being the operative word,
as in I live there and it sucks.

238
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,573
You know,
I don't think you know anything.

239
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,742
I think it's all just one big scam.

240
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,286
How do we have any proof?

241
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,039
Hello, beautiful!

242
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,217
I can't believe I slept with that guy!

243
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:28,762
Apparently the cage is not working
so great for you, so stay down.

244
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,393
- How's it going in there?
- I'm not loving the demon interruptus.

245
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,196
That proof enough for you?

246
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,790
Well, I guess Chris won't be using this.

247
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,960
I gotta stop trying to keep
anything nice in this house.

248
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,421
Ouch! You know, that hurts.

249
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:05,507
Yeah, well, get used to it,
'cause if this is a setup...

250
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,217
This is not a setup.

251
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:12,681
Can someone please just remind me
why we are protecting a demon?

252
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:17,186
She's selling out her buddies, so we're
doing the witness protection thing.

253
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:21,398
If you want us to make a deal
to make you human,

254
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,483
you need to give us something.

255
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,153
Wait, back up! Did you say "human"?

256
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:31,909
I know. I know, I wouldn't actually
have a soul, but I could live with that.

257
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,411
This is so weird.

258
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:38,624
And also a waste of my time because
I was in the middle of something.

259
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,586
Okay, okay, fine. I'll give you
something, a little enticement.

260
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,087
Baited breath.

261
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:47,090
Okay, sure, I have
a little black book of demons,

262
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:51,803
but I also have the skinny
on the little thing called the Avatars.

263
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:58,060
- What do you know about the Avatars?
- What do you know about 'em?

264
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,939
Didn't I tell you he'd like the dress?

265
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,357
Stop doing that.

266
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,734
Could we get back
to the Avatars, please?

267
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,778
I know that they're close.

268
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,364
Closer than you think.

269
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:13,116
Could be here... any minute.

270
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:17,996
Kyle!

271
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,124
Okay, powwow. Powwow.

272
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,002
Let's go.

273
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,424
Not you, you stay here.

274
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,385
Okay, here's what I don't get.

275
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:34,805
Why does the Seer want to be human
if the Avatars are so close?

276
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,308
You'd think she'd want to be evil
if evil was about to take over.

277
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:42,187
- Unless the Avatars are good.
- Yeah, right. Is that possible?

278
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,190
Either way, I need her gone
and I want my boys home.

279
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,151
So, go up to the Elders
and see if you can make a deal.

280
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:51,154
I'll stay with the Seer.
Since we have similar powers,

281
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,032
maybe I can tap into hers
and find out what she knows.

282
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,492
Good. Go.

283
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,501
You've put me in an awkward position.

284
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,506
Why didn't you tell me
I was rescuing a demon?

285
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,633
There wasn't time.

286
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,137
Besides, we couldn't take
the chance that you would say no.

287
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:18,140
You take a bigger risk
by parking a demon in the house.

288
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,976
We know it's dangerous,
but we're at a crossroads.

289
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,145
Brody is a threat we didn't count on.

290
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:26,857
He has the means to destroy us and
the passion to turn them against us.

291
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:30,944
We're taking a calculated risk
in the hopes of guiding the sisters.

292
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,238
This isn't calculated. It's foolhardy.

293
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,241
The Seer is unpredictable.
She'd out me in a heartbeat.

294
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,327
Except she thinks you're an Elder,

295
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:41,455
since she sent her message
to them. We intercepted it.

296
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,081
She'll see through me.

297
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:46,293
She won't if you get her
what she wants. Make the deal.

298
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,171
Think about it, Leo.

299
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:53,091
With her power, she can literally
show the sisters our future,

300
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,844
help them to understand
what we're offering

301
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,847
in a way no one else can, not even you.

302
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,935
They should be back by now.

303
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,979
They're dead. The witches killed them.

304
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:10,192
Yeah, well, we'll all be dead soon
if we don't pull out all the stops.

305
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:14,655
And what stops are you
pulling out, shapeshifter?

306
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,115
You're a coward with no power.

307
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,575
I'm just saying.

308
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,161
I'm telling you,
we should release Zankou.

309
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,454
No way.

310
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,257
You girls really should take
better care of your things.

311
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,676
There are some singed pages here.

312
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:40,097
You should tell your demon friends to
be more careful when they attack next.

313
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,598
Look at this.

314
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:46,478
You're like a family, and there's,
like, pictures of fun times and stuff.

315
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:51,233
Look at Wyatt.
That's his first birthday.

316
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,444
Are those my earrings?

317
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,656
Yeah, sorry. They called out to me.

318
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,325
You're so... close,

319
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,329
and you like each other
and you're happy,

320
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,874
- and...
- Happy and?

321
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,170
Push harder on that shoulder.
If you're not getting a premonition,

322
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,255
you could at least work out that knot.

323
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,842
Can't blame a girl for trying, you know?

324
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:20,429
When I first started getting visions,
I had to touch people too.

325
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,306
Phone.

326
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:26,268
- Phone.
- Oh, phone. You're good.

327
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,354
Hello?

328
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:33,483
Darryl, now is not really a good
time again. Let me call you back?

329
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,110
All right.

330
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,114
Not that I'm okay
with you stealing my stuff,

331
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:42,910
but those earrings really
do look amazing on you.

332
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,370
Then again, what wouldn't?

333
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:49,458
You know, sugar,
much as I enjoy the flattery

334
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,503
and the bonding
and even the touching,

335
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,882
you're not getting anything out
of me until you make me human.

336
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,468
Okay. I get it.

337
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,846
But what I don't get
is why you want to be human.

338
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:06,016
Did the bad stuff just start
to get to you after a while?

339
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:09,645
No. The good stuff did.

340
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:13,023
In my line of work,
I see a lot of good and bad,

341
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,026
and the good's... just better.

342
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:19,863
Problem is I can see it,
but I can't feel it.

343
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,075
That's the thing about vision.
It's a blessing and a curse.

344
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:27,746
Yep. You know, being a demon
is about feeding the endless emptiness,

345
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,874
and... I'm sick of it.

346
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,001
I long for the...

347
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:36,797
...the subtle notes in between.

348
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:41,093
The Avatars have something to do with
that, right? I'm just not sure what.

349
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,680
Right, bargaining chip.

350
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:48,267
It's not like I'm being tight-lipped
and mean for no reason.

351
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:51,520
I can't give you what you want
or I won't get what I want.

352
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,192
I see. You're not even sure
I have anything you want.

353
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,237
Look, I want to trust you.

354
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:04,283
I really do. But you're a demon.

355
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:08,704
How about I help you
with your other problem instead?

356
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:12,166
You know, the thing
with the cop... Sheridan.

357
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,920
If I find her for you...
then would you trust me?

358
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:27,014
What the hell are you doing?

359
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:30,100
We're wasting time.
We should have orbed in.

360
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:34,730
Yeah. That's why I drove, thinking maybe
it would give you time to chill out.

361
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:37,733
If the Avatars are on
their way like the Seer says,

362
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,818
we've got to be prepared.

363
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,154
What is that? You're freaking me out.

364
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,489
That's why the Avatars
killed my parents.

365
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:49,286
- A vanquishing potion that kills them.
- I didn't know one existed.

366
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:52,039
They didn't know what they found.
All they knew was

367
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:55,459
that this ancient civilization
fought off this power with it.

368
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,753
The Avatars went into retreat till now.

369
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,964
Well, I think that's great.

370
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,467
Now you have the potion,
we know where it is,

371
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:06,637
and we can just put it away
and bring it out if we need it.

372
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:10,015
Paige, I have spent my entire life
preparing for this moment

373
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:12,518
when I could finally
meet them face-to-face.

374
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:17,856
Look, you have to let my sisters
and I help. This is what we do.

375
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:22,236
I know you've had a lot of pain.

376
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,404
Okay?

377
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,866
One potion is not gonna fix everything.

378
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,203
Would you let us help you?

379
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,332
No, this is my fight. You don't know
what I've had to do to get this far.

380
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,000
What do you mean?

381
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,837
I told you.

382
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:43,215
I've done some things
that I'm not proud of.

383
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:46,927
We all have.

384
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:59,231
- We don't negotiate with demons.
- She could give us everything

385
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:01,441
we need to go
after upper-level demons.

386
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,194
In exchange for making her human?
I don't think so.

387
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:09,032
We have more pressing concerns
than demons. Like the Avatars.

388
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,493
She might know something about them too.

389
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,495
- What does she know?
- She's cagey,

390
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:16,373
but she might have
foreseen something about them.

391
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:19,626
Well, then that might
be worth bargaining for.

392
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,045
But we need to know
what she knows first.

393
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:26,008
Then and only then will we see
about giving her what she wants.

394
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:35,893
- Darryl.
- You're late.

395
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:38,437
Who is this?

396
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:42,274
The Seer. Seer, Darryl. Darryl, Seer.

397
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:45,235
Let's see if Sheridan's here, shall we?

398
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,945
Hold on a second.

399
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:50,824
You really think after all this time
I wouldn't recognise a demon?

400
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:54,119
- I can't believe you brought a demon!
- She brought me.

401
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:57,915
Go easy on him, his wife's had him
sleeping on the couch all week.

402
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:02,711
- How does she know that?
- Seer, get it? She sees things.

403
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:07,174
She's harmless, and very good at what
she does. I can't hold a candle to her.

404
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:10,135
Oh, that's so sweet. And so not true.

405
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,346
And don't worry, she'll get over it.

406
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:15,516
Just bring her some
of that marzipan that she likes.

407
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:18,393
You think Amy
would like the little fruit...

408
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,230
I can't believe
I'm listening to a demon.

409
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:24,191
Don't be rude.
She found this place. Let's go.

410
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:30,364
I was thinking that this crazy-ass stuff
wouldn't happen any more, like this.

411
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,741
I know, it's why
you don't hang out with us.

412
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:35,160
But you got to admit
you sort of miss it.

413
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:36,745
Phoebe...

414
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,207
...what is your demon friend doing?

415
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:44,169
Okay, there's plenty of time
for this when you're human.

416
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:48,048
Oh, come on, take off your shoes,
let me feel the grass through you.

417
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:51,844
Yeah, we gotta get back
before Leo does, otherwise he'll flip.

418
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,181
You coming, Darryl?

419
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,897
What kind of place is this?

420
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,358
It's a mental hospital.

421
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:10,821
I've never seen this side
of good in my visions before.

422
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:14,408
It's so... bad.

423
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:18,996
Yeah. Well, there's a downside
to being able to feel things sometimes.

424
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:22,666
Well, I'd still take good
that's not always good

425
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,877
over bad that's never good.

426
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,379
Somehow, I know exactly what you mean.

427
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:29,339
I'd try that one.

428
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:43,979
There's more.

429
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,070
It's Sheridan.

430
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:54,948
Oh, my God.

431
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,284
I told you Brody did something to her.

432
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:03,081
Paige, please pick up the phone.

433
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,750
Pick up the phone.

434
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:18,013
Leo, we need to get Paige away from Kyle
before she ends up in a coma too!

435
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,933
I can't get over the fact
that you were crazy enough

436
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,935
to take the Seer out of the house.

437
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,646
I needed to find out
if she was dating a madman.

438
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,482
And she is, so please, Leo,
you need to go get her.

439
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:32,194
- I could have taken her.
- I came back, didn't I?

440
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:33,403
Because you need us.

441
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,864
No, and because she likes us.

442
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:39,743
Okay, are you two buddy-buddies
starting to read each other?

443
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:44,748
What are you afraid of? That I'm
gonna tell her your dirty little secret?

444
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,959
What makes you think I have secrets?

445
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:51,630
Paige is in danger. We have
to get Piper out of Magic School

446
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:54,424
so we can get Paige out
of Kyle's apartment.

447
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,385
Okay, but don't go anywhere.

448
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:59,847
Make sure these potions are near you.
She's no good to us dead.

449
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:03,058
Don't make me come back
and separate you.

450
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:07,229
So... Okay, if the Avatars are bad,

451
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:10,357
wouldn't it be safer
for you just to stay a demon?

452
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:13,527
You're wondering if hubby
is wrong about the Avatars.

453
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:17,823
Yeah. I mean, is it possible that
they're good? Is it really possible?

454
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,616
It's a smart question.

455
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:24,163
One I am sure to answer for you once I
get my lap pool and the ability to feel.

456
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:28,667
Fine, but first you're gonna have to ID
some of your demon buddies for me.

457
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,089
We could be making a huge mistake here.

458
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:36,508
We don't have a choice.

459
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,404
Lexonaro bestia

460
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,281
Lexonaro

461
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:13,629
Finally.

462
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:20,135
Too bad The Source isn't still alive.
I owe him for this.

463
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:22,638
One of you was against freeing me.

464
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:25,265
Who was it?

465
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:29,269
It was me.

466
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:32,022
The Source incarcerated you
for a reason.

467
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:34,274
Because you're too dangerous.

468
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:39,822
I like an honest demon.

469
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:44,368
- Now where's the Seer?
- You know about?

470
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:48,997
I could sense it all from my prison.
I even know about the Avatars.

471
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:52,167
The demonic forces await your word.

472
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:57,172
A legion won't get past the
Charmed Ones. But a shapeshifter might.

473
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,132
I'm a shapeshifter.

474
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:03,011
Good! Good. Good.

475
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:10,185
Now I'm one too.

476
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:18,193
Piper. Leo. Come in.

477
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:23,115
Hey, guys, what's up?

478
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:26,243
Well, so much for breaking it
to her before it's too late.

479
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:30,205
What's up is that...

480
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:33,709
...you know how Morris was
looking into how maybe Sheridan...

481
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,003
Tell 'em, Leo.

482
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,257
Phoebe and Morris found Sheridan in
a mental institution. She was in a coma.

483
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:41,758
You put her there.

484
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:47,890
Yeah, I actually know. Kyle told me.

485
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:51,101
You know? And you're okay with this?

486
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:56,982
Well, we all do things we're not
proud of sometimes. Right, Leo?

487
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,693
That was different. He shot an innocent.

488
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:03,155
- With a tranq dart.
- That put her in a coma.

489
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:06,116
He did that to help us.
She was gonna expose us.

490
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:08,911
It's just temporary.
She's completely safe.

491
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:11,997
I will bring her out,
after the Avatar threat's over.

492
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:13,874
After losing a chunk of her life?

493
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,043
You should understand sacrifice.

494
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,588
Whatever he's done is to try
to help rid the world of evil.

495
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:22,424
It appears that he's the evil,
not the Avatars.

496
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:26,303
Are you insane? Of course they're evil.
They killed my parents.

497
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,931
Okay, this is gonna
take a while to figure out.

498
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:31,475
Why don't you get dressed so we can go.

499
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:33,227
I'm staying here.

500
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,071
That went swimmingly.

501
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:47,616
Okay, Furies: Toxic.

502
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:50,035
Emphasis on "ic". Hate me.

503
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:53,580
Oh, the Grimlocks,
emphasis on the "grim". Hate me.

504
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:58,126
Okay, so, what I'm gathering is pretty
much every demon in this book hates you?

505
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:01,296
Pretty much, which is sad
because they're my family.

506
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:04,842
Well, I mean it would
be sad if I had feelings.

507
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:08,679
Well, don't worry, I'm gonna put
something in the spell about that.

508
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:10,430
Thanks.

509
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:14,351
You really care about
what happens to me, don't you?

510
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:17,437
Yeah, I do... I guess.

511
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:19,106
That's nice.

512
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,525
I like that.

513
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,615
Hey, where is Paige?

514
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:32,035
- She stayed with Kyle.
- What? Even after you told her?

515
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:34,997
We didn't get a chance.
Kyle beat us to the punch.

516
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:37,624
And apparently she's okay with it.

517
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,126
I am not okay with it.

518
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:41,378
Neither am I, but first things first.

519
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:44,256
We need to get this demon
creature out of the house.

520
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:48,635
We need the information about the
Avatars so I can use it as a leverage.

521
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:52,014
- You know my terms.
- Your terms are ridiculous!

522
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:54,766
Look, what if I guarantee
you get what you want?

523
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:57,060
Oh, I'm supposed to trust you now?

524
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:01,148
What is with you two?

525
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:04,234
Look, all I know
is the Avatars are a powerful force

526
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:07,070
and your secret weapon
is locked in here.

527
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,031
Phoebe, please speak to her?

528
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:13,494
Okay, remember how you said that you
could sense that I care about you?

529
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:17,206
Well, I can sense
that you care about me too.

530
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:21,376
So, please give me
the information that we need.

531
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,713
I can't tell you.

532
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:28,258
But I can show you.

533
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:40,187
Phoebe?

534
00:33:58,247 --> 00:33:59,623
Hi, Aunt Phoebe!

535
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,583
Hi, Wyatt. Hi, big guy.

536
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,628
- Mommy, Mommy!
- Oh, hi!

537
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:09,591
What are you doing, my little ladybug?

538
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:12,553
Mommy, Chris was scaring me
about the demons again.

539
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,805
Chris, it's not nice to tease.

540
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:18,267
What did I tell you about the demons?
They don't exist any more.

541
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,685
Not since the Avatars.

542
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:23,814
She's smiling, right? That's good.

543
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,483
She's seeing Utopia.

544
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,943
No demons.

545
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,405
Beyond good and evil.

546
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:45,460
You betrayed me. Now you pay.

547
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:56,597
What? What was it?

548
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,516
I saw the most beautiful thing ever...

549
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,187
...and the most terrible.

550
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,111
Now you know why I'm doing this.

551
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:14,198
Yeah, with no demons
in the future, you'd be extinct.

552
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:18,243
If I even get to that future,
which if Zankou has his way, I won't.

553
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,162
The future is volatile.

554
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:24,041
The things we do could change it.
What you saw may never happen.

555
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:27,544
But if the good part of what I saw
could happen, it would be great.

556
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:29,421
It was incredible, I was so happy

557
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:33,300
and calm and peaceful and my little
girl... Oh, my God, she was so cute.

558
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:36,678
Yeah, not normally big
on the rugrats, but she was cute.

559
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,056
Now I'm even more worried about Paige.

560
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:42,100
Kyle wants to destroy
something that could be great.

561
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,602
Okay. Hang on a second.

562
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:47,689
We don't know this for sure. You made
the Avatar future seem threatening.

563
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,776
If I made it sound peachy,
you wouldn't have helped me.

564
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:54,947
The fact is, I didn't see anything
threatening. How about you, Leo?

565
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,702
Okay, yeah, seriously,
what is it with you two?

566
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:04,122
Are you gonna tell her or shall I?

567
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:08,710
I told you I liked a challenge.
So, what's it gonna be?

568
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:13,674
Look, apparently
what she has seen is that...

569
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,677
...I know the Avatars are good

570
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:19,388
because I'm an Avatar.

571
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:22,724
What?! That's insane.
What does that mean?

572
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:25,185
That means I believe in what they want:

573
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:26,895
A world beyond good and evil.

574
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:31,400
You've been living in our house
as an Avatar and you haven't told us?

575
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:33,026
Look, I'm the same old Leo.

576
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:34,361
Only not!

577
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:38,866
You went from psycho guy to happy guy,
because you became an Avatar?

578
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,868
What changed for me was knowing

579
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:44,872
that we could have this life that we
always wanted, a life without demons.

580
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:47,416
They showed me this peaceful world,

581
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,585
happy, like Phoebe saw in her vision.

582
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:53,630
The point is not "happy",
the point is why didn't you tell me?

583
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:58,552
I couldn't tell you. Everybody has
to come to the truth in their own time.

584
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,096
Leo, you know what? Don't guru-talk me.

585
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:03,348
You are in far too much trouble...

586
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:07,269
Okay, guys, guys. Can we just
put this on hold for a second?

587
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:09,521
She's right. This can wait. She can't.

588
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:12,900
I've seen her vanquish.
We have to make her human right now.

589
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:15,360
She held up her end.
It's the Elders' turn.

590
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:19,531
I can't say the Seer saw Utopia.
They're not gonna believe me.

591
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:21,074
They will believe me.

592
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,994
Piper's gonna help
get your stuff for your new life.

593
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:26,371
Get the dress
that matches those earrings

594
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:28,749
'cause you're gonna look amazing in it.

595
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,460
We'll be right back with the spell.

596
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:43,889
What is she doing here?

597
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:46,600
I'm here to give you what you want.

598
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:51,522
So, the Seer told you something.

599
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:55,651
Yes. She told us that
the Avatars' future is a Utopia.

600
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:58,779
That's not possible.

601
00:37:58,946 --> 00:37:59,988
I've seen it.

602
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:04,701
It's gonna take more than that.
That's why I'm here to show it to you.

603
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:17,256
What did I tell you about the demons?
They don't exist any more.

604
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:18,966
Not since the Avatars.

605
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:25,264
It's not possible.
This must be some sort of a trick.

606
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,475
You've seen the vision.
Take your time sorting it out.

607
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,269
But I will need that spell.

608
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,021
But this might be all a sham.

609
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:35,983
Then it's not the Seer's fault.
She's the messenger.

610
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,653
But you do have to honour
your end of the deal.

611
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:50,914
Oh, hi. I'm glad you're here.
I was worried about you.

612
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:53,250
I was picking up some clothes.

613
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:59,840
If you're looking for your red
winter jacket, I gave it to the Seer.

614
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,800
Why, do demons feel cold?

615
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,136
Except she won't be a demon any more.

616
00:39:04,303 --> 00:39:06,805
The Seer told us something
about the Avatars?

617
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:11,310
Better. Because of their shared power,
she was able to give Phoebe her vision.

618
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:12,769
How bad was it?

619
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:17,107
That's the thing.
According to Phoebe, it was good.

620
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:21,570
You're willing to believe
a demon over Kyle?

621
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:24,281
I'm just trying to keep an open mind.

622
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:28,577
Piper, everything we know about
them points to them being killers.

623
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:33,332
Don't you think that we should explore
what they're all about, just in case?

624
00:39:33,499 --> 00:39:36,418
Explore what?
How about this? You explore.

625
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:38,837
When you find something out,
give me a call.

626
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:41,882
I'll be there to vanquish them
with Kyle's potion. Okay?

627
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:57,147
You know, I don't think Phoebe
would mind throwing in some shoes.

628
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:59,691
Oh, thanks, but I won't need them.

629
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:03,946
As soon as I'm human, I'm hoping your
guy will orb me to Golden Gate Park

630
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:06,532
and I can finally
run through that grass.

631
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:08,784
Have you thought of a name for yourself?

632
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:11,078
Oh, it's Kira. It always has been.

633
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:15,082
It's just everyone calls me the Seer.

634
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:18,293
Okay, honestly, now...

635
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,296
...how do I look?

636
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:23,298
I've never worn anything so...

637
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:25,759
...fun.

638
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:29,888
- Kira, you look great.
- Thanks.

639
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:32,474
Did you get the spell?

640
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:37,312
Leo's got it. He's downstairs trying
to convince Paige not to leave.

641
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:40,232
Yeah, I know, I already tried.

642
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:44,111
We're kinda pushing it here. The
demon could show up any minute, so...

643
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,780
Maybe you should get the spell.

644
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:49,867
Hey...

645
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:53,287
You look really great.

646
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:57,082
- Sure you don't mind me borrowing it?
- No, not at all.

647
00:40:57,249 --> 00:41:00,586
Although I'm much more
of a black kind of guy myself.

648
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:04,339
I think it's a lot more
appropriate for a funeral.

649
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:06,008
Don't you, Kira?

650
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:07,926
Wait, how did you?

651
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:14,808
- Hello, sugar.
- Did I call you that ever?

652
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:19,897
What I meant to say was,
"Hello, swirling particles of scum!"

653
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:22,441
You always were amusing.

654
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:27,571
But still, I can't allow you to betray
us all just to save your own ass.

655
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:32,159
It's good to be back.

656
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:45,631
That wasn't you.

657
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:48,342
That was the demon from my vision.

658
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:56,642
We can't keep doing this.
There's gotta be a better way.

659
00:41:56,808 --> 00:42:00,771
There is a better way. She
showed it to me and it was beautiful.

660
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:02,689
I think I want to meet them.

661
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:05,067
And I want you to, but...

662
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:09,238
...you need a clear mind to do so and
I don't know that now's the right time.

663
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:12,032
Now is the best time.

664
