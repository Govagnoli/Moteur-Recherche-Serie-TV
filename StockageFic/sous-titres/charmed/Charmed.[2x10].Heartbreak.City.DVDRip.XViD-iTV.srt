1
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:16,567
- Cindy.
- Max.

2
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:18,641
- Hi.
- Hi.

3
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:21,248
Working late, huh?

4
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:24,287
- Yeah. So, what else is new, right?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:30,204
It's a match.

6
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:31,842
You guys survive Y2K all right?

7
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,079
Sure. If you ask me,
it was all just a bunch of hype.

8
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:35,238
Definitely.

9
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:40,483
- Well, I guess I'll see you around?
- Yeah, okay.

10
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,321
- Take care.
- Yeah. You too.

11
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:50,647
Cindy, I know those last few loves
of yours didn't work out.

12
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:52,481
You've been hurt, and you're scared.

13
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,038
But you gotta take a risk
if you want to find the real thing.

14
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:57,643
And Max is real. Open up to him.

15
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:02,081
And Max, Cindy's love and compassion
awaits your discovery,

16
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:04,638
but she's afraid that you're still
in love with your ex-wife.

17
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,367
You've got to reassure her.

18
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,127
Life is short, you two, so...

19
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,206
Have a better one together, okay?

20
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:19,963
Listen,

21
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,640
you wanna grab
a cup of coffee or something?

22
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:25,284
Coffee? Yeah, sure.

23
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:27,167
- I'd like that.
- Great.

24
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:40,279
Hello, old friend.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

25
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:41,768
Drazi.

26
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:47,042
- You knew I'd find you.
- Listen, Drazi...

27
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,369
You couldn't leave it alone.
You just had to get involved.

28
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:56,121
You crossed the line.

29
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:58,328
"Crossed the line"?

30
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,441
I am the line.

31
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:02,848
You're the one that went too far.

32
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:05,125
- Now you're gonna pay.
- No, wait.

33
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:09,322
Not very pleasant.

34
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:12,161
You're killing me.

35
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:14,724
I'm gonna do more than that,
a lot more.

36
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:16,448
How does it feel, huh?

37
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:18,002
I can tell you. I know.

38
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:21,206
Thanks to you, I know what it feels like
to have your heart ripped out.

39
00:02:21,369 --> 00:02:23,405
Do you wanna know
that kind of pain, do you?

40
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:30,360
No. I got a better idea.

41
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:33,123
You're gonna just hate it.

42
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:35,765
Your little magic ring

43
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:38,682
you use to slip in there
between the heartbeats,

44
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,409
plant your little thoughts of love.
Well, I'm gonna borrow it.

45
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:44,720
I'm gonna use it to tear apart
some of your more recent unions.

46
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:46,481
No. Drazi, no.

47
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:50,642
I'm gonna turn love into hate.
And that hate

48
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:53,802
is gonna slowly
and very painfully kill you.

49
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:55,641
And in the end,

50
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,445
you're gonna wish
that I had ripped your heart out.

51
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,366
Drazi!

52
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,688
Fifth wheel, cutting in.

53
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:13,443
- Oh, would you stop that.
- Well, it is a double date.

54
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:15,884
It would have been a triple date
if Kevin hadn't cancelled.

55
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:19,405
I know. It seems to be an epidemic
lately, guys cancelling on me.

56
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,082
You know what happens
when they cancel.

57
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:23,365
- Back to square one.
- Do not pass go.

58
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:26,282
And all accrued nookie credits
are thrown out.

59
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:29,641
- There's a penalty?
- Oh, yeah.

60
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,686
You know, this glimpse
at the feminine mystery

61
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:34,443
frightens me to no end,
so allow me to change the subject.

62
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:36,645
- What did you think of the movie?
- I liked it.

63
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:39,482
- Loved it, except for the bell-bottoms.
- It was okay, I guess.

64
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:41,640
Oh, who are you kidding?
I heard you sniffle.

65
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:43,765
- I'm fighting a cold.
- Liar.

66
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:45,084
Jack?

67
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:47,444
As far as classics go,
it was no Dirty Dozen.

68
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,002
I slept through it.

69
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,882
- You slept through Dirty Dozen?
- No, Love Story.

70
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,721
The last thing I remember
is a hockey game.

71
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,569
- That was the very beginning.
- Okay, let me guess.

72
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:59,243
Boy meets girl,
Grim Reaper swipes girl

73
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,127
and boy is left
with his hockey skates?

74
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,844
That's a review.
Anybody want a coffee?

75
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:06,364
I hope so, because I am buying.

76
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:10,288
So difficult.

77
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:14,686
What?

78
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,280
Hey, you're coming to
get coffee, right?

79
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:24,608
I'm just gonna get a cab,
call it a night. I'm pooped.

80
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:27,727
- I'm sorry that Kevin backed on you.
- It's his loss.

81
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:31,802
It is so his loss,
because you are beautiful, my sister.

82
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:33,197
You're so beautiful.

83
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,599
All right, go to your man,
have some coffee.

84
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,765
- Okay. I love you.
- I love you too. Bye-bye.

85
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,645
- I need your help.
- Let go of me.

86
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,640
Hate will destroy everything
if you don't help.

87
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:52,277
- I am warning you, buddy.
- Phoebe, you gotta believe me.

88
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:55,998
- I know why you can't find love. I'm...
- Hey, you. Let go of her.

89
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:03,600
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

90
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:06,526
- What was that about?
- I'm not sure.

91
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:22,485
Piper, are you still asleep?

92
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:34,481
Hey, Prue, guess who
got lucky last night.

93
00:06:58,049 --> 00:06:59,368
I'll get it.

94
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,323
- I will get it. Hello?
- Morning.

95
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:07,845
Hey, Prue. Did that coffee
keep someone up all night?

96
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:10,807
Okay, believe it or not,
all we did was talk.

97
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:13,164
- Yeah, right.
- No, I swear.

98
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:15,968
Look, we just talked about everything.
It was really great.

99
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:18,563
Really?
How did he react to the witch part?

100
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,243
Cute. All right, where's Piper?

101
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:23,081
Oh, she's still at Dan's.

102
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:24,802
Hey, if only I'd bagged Mr. Creepy,

103
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:27,039
we could have scored
a Halliwell hat trick last night.

104
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:29,006
- Don't be mad.
- No, I'm not mad.

105
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,808
I'm thrilled, for you both.
I mean, it's been a long time.

106
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:33,288
You deserve to be happy.

107
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:35,724
You're gonna need
a new lock on that back door.

108
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:38,118
Phoebe?

109
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,325
All right, I'm getting rather used
to you kicking love in the teeth.

110
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:49,049
Okay. Who are you,
and what do you want?

111
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,439
More importantly,
I know who you are, Phoebe.

112
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:55,003
And that's why I'm here.
I need your help.

113
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,765
- Charmed Ones kind of help.
- I will ask again, who are you?

114
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,920
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

115
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,842
- Try me.
- Well, for lack of a better name, I'm...

116
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:07,000
...Cupid.

117
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:16,158
Oh, my.

118
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:19,327
Eggs over, bacon crisp,
box of jewellery and dry toast.

119
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:20,842
A box of what?

120
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:22,880
Do you want a morning paper
with that?

121
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,483
- What did you do?
- It's not a big deal. It's not a ring.

122
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:28,125
But I don't want you to feel
like you gotta keep it.

123
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:31,042
- If you wanna take it back, you can...
- I get it, I get it.

124
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,328
You gonna open it?

125
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,161
Because if you want to,
you can take it back.

126
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,599
Hey, is something...?

127
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:04,565
Phoebe, what are you doing in here?
How did you get in here?

128
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:06,481
We have got a very big problem.

129
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:08,523
Piper, Cupid. Cupid, Piper.

130
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:11,249
Hi, sorry to interrupt. Glad things
are working with you and Dan.

131
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:13,326
- What?
- You have to come home really fast.

132
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:16,123
Yeah, a demon of hate stole my ring,
and he'll use it to find loves

133
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,167
that I put together so he can destroy
them, which will in turn destroy me.

134
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:20,603
- Wait.
- He's telling the truth.

135
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,039
The demon's name is Drazi.
He's in the Book of Shadows.

136
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,245
Phoebe's working on the potion
that'll vanquish him.

137
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:27,320
- And Prue is on her way home.
- Home from where?

138
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:30,720
From Jack's.
Okay, hurry, okay? Kiss very fast.

139
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:41,568
Okay.

140
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:43,447
Okey-dokey.

141
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:48,843
...the matter?
- Yes, there is.

142
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:52,888
But not with you. There is absolutely
nothing the matter with you.

143
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:55,917
But I do have to go.

144
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,207
Hold on. What happened?
I don't understand.

145
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:01,485
It has nothing to do with you,
I swear.

146
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:04,123
Then what does it have to do with?

147
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:07,409
It's complicated.
But thank you for this,

148
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:09,480
and you'll see it on me
tonight at the club.

149
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,685
Hello, young lovers.

150
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:41,918
So we're actually supposed
to believe that you're Cupid?

151
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:43,721
So you guys can believe
in warlocks

152
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:45,447
and demons,
but you can't believe in me?

153
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,526
- Where's the chubby baby?
- Guys.

154
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:49,720
- And the bow and arrow?
- Where's the warty chins,

155
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:52,244
hooked noses and pointy hats?

156
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,605
All right, show us something
supernatural.

157
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:57,124
Drazi took my ring.
It's my power, it's how I get in.

158
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,883
- Get in?
- People's hearts, to awaken love.

159
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:01,368
See, but Drazi is all about hate.

160
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:04,282
And he's gonna use the ring to get
in the same way. We're wasting time.

161
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:06,998
You're still gonna have
to back up the Cupid claim.

162
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:08,882
Okay, fine.

163
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:12,724
Dan, Jack, Clay.
Andy, my sincerest condolences.

164
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:16,199
Eric in London, Alan in college.
Not Jeremy the warlock.

165
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,843
Joe in college, Barry in high school,
Tim in eighth grade.

166
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:22,599
Ken, Kyle, Steve, Mike, Ken again.

167
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:27,724
Brian, Joel, Martin, Peter,
Paul. Tony.

168
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:30,484
Okay, you know I didn't love
all those guys, right?

169
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,082
Yeah, well, they wanted to love you,

170
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:34,080
but your closed heart
eventually sent them away.

171
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:37,286
My closed heart?
I do not have a closed heart.

172
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:39,724
Look, if people get the feeling
that there's nothing there,

173
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:42,039
eventually it's hasta la vista, Phoebe.

174
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:44,485
That explains the recent rash
of cancelled dates.

175
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:50,248
Okay, so wait, our past relationships,
you made those happen?

176
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:53,037
Well, actually, my assignment here
is only two years old.

177
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:55,319
I helped you two
meet Jack and Dan,

178
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:58,203
but most of your prior loves
were the work of fellow agents.

179
00:11:58,489 --> 00:11:59,888
- Agents?
- Oh, yeah.

180
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:02,609
I'm just one of many.
We work in secret all over the world,

181
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,043
making connections.

182
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,801
Did you connect me and Leo?

183
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:08,958
No, that was the work of you two.

184
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:12,083
Those connections we're forbidden
to make, for obvious reasons.

185
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:15,077
Can we go back to the
hasta la vista remark, please?

186
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:18,400
We don't have time right now to debate
the topic of your closed heart, Phoebe.

187
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:21,527
We gotta finish the potion so we can
vanquish Drazi before it's too late.

188
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:23,884
Okay, how are we supposed
to find him?

189
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:26,159
The same way he can find me.
We can sense each other.

190
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,399
We're connected in a cosmic way.

191
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:30,725
There's a fine line
between love and hate.

192
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:31,958
- Oh, brother.
- Hey,

193
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:34,438
don't take Drazi lightly.
You guys are in danger as well.

194
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,486
We're in danger every day.
We're used to it.

195
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,804
Not like this.

196
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:40,847
Look, if Drazi succeeds, eventually
he'll kill your ability to love.

197
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:42,328
And believe me,

198
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:44,241
that's a fate worse than death.

199
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:49,803
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.

200
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:56,279
Sorry, they didn't have any roses.

201
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:59,922
You're too good to be true.

202
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,801
I still can't believe
this is all happening.

203
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:03,482
Believe it.

204
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:12,046
Touching. Really touching.

205
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:17,528
Cindy, could you be a bigger fool.
He's still sleeping with his ex-wife.

206
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:23,601
He looks at you as a desperate,
lonely woman. Easy sex.

207
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:26,722
Max, she's nothing
but a gold-digging tramp

208
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:31,440
who wants to hitch her wagon
to your big fat wallet.

209
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:34,407
Just as soon marry you
and kill you for the insurance.

210
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,523
Bye-bye.

211
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:42,126
- You pathetic...
- Bitch.

212
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,644
Take your damn flowers.
Give them to your ex-wife.

213
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:48,006
The bank's closing, baby. You're not
laying one finger on this guy's money.

214
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:50,285
- Screw you.
- Up yours.

215
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:07,407
Prue, Phoebe.

216
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:11,999
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

217
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:16,325
- What's wrong?
- It's Drazi.

218
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,168
He's killing...

219
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:20,686
...love.

220
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:33,402
Yes, ma'am, go ahead.

221
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:36,208
He just walked into traffic.

222
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,447
- Dumb-ass.
- Oh, yeah?

223
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:41,803
- Is he gonna die?
- I can't answer that, ma'am.

224
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:45,006
Because he should, you know.
I don't think I've ever known anyone

225
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:47,444
who deserved to be hit
by a car more than that guy.

226
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:49,368
It's Max.

227
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:51,644
Is he one of yours?

228
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,686
Yeah, I matched him up
with Cindy last night.

229
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:56,158
- She was afraid to risk love too.
- Are you picking on me?

230
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:58,041
- Phoebe, I'm...
- Do you think it's easy

231
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:00,279
finding love with all
the demon-hunting we have to do?

232
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:01,928
Your sisters aren't having a problem.

233
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,762
You know what, let's just stay focused.
We have things to do.

234
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:07,608
- Are you sure Drazi did this?
- I'm positive.

235
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:09,528
He's still here too. I can feel him.

236
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:11,441
- He's close.
- Where?

237
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:15,928
There.

238
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:19,602
Do you think he knows who we are?

239
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:22,288
- Apparently.
- He's getting away.

240
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:23,643
- Do you have the potion?
- Yes.

241
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:25,640
All right, let's go.

242
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:28,319
- We're not gonna catch him.
- Piper, freeze him.

243
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:30,320
- He's too far away.
- Hit him with the trolley!

244
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,248
- I can't move the trolley.
- Somebody better do something fast.

245
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,367
- What?
- Surprise.

246
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:43,962
That didn't work.

247
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:56,398
- Are you back with us?
- I think so.

248
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:58,959
I really gotta get a handle on that.

249
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:01,729
- I don't understand.
- She astral-projected.

250
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,999
- Did you get him?
- No, I just slowed him down a bit.

251
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:06,239
You guys, I'm fine.
Go get him. Hurry.

252
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:11,604
God, I love this new power.

253
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:19,240
Hiding behind witches' skirts?

254
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:21,360
Stealing things
that don't belong to you?

255
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,682
Okay, go.

256
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:28,488
What the...?

257
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:37,799
No. No!

258
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:45,407
- Did you get him?
- Did we?

259
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,563
Sure looks like it, but I don't know
what happened to my ring.

260
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:50,879
Shouldn't have been affected
by what we did to Drazi.

261
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:54,678
So that's it, right?
You're done, you can just move on?

262
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:56,441
In a hurry to get rid of me, Phoebe?

263
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:58,082
Look, Cupid,

264
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:01,286
I know you're just trying to help, but
did you ever think that maybe I'm just

265
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:04,486
- not ready for love right now?
- No, you're more than ready.

266
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,447
- You know what? Don't start. Just go.
- I need the ring to get back.

267
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:10,484
I mean, they'll issue me another one.
But the problem is

268
00:17:10,649 --> 00:17:13,004
- I need it to get back to them.
- Wait, you're stuck here?

269
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:14,961
No, actually, you can help
get me back home.

270
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:16,562
One more potion,

271
00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:19,641
some well-chosen words from the
Charmed Ones, and I'm on my way.

272
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,520
- Care to help me with that potion?
- Me? Why me?

273
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,845
Because you're free tonight
and they have dates.

274
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:28,807
Hey, how did you know...?
Never mind. Scratch that.

275
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:39,568
- What are you smiling at?
- You.

276
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:03,767
Well, looks like
you can't kill love after all.

277
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:08,202
But you sure can screw with it.

278
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:12,838
Very nice. Do you like it?

279
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:13,998
I love it.

280
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:17,047
Well, thank your sister.
She helped me pick it out.

281
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:20,286
- Okay, guilty.
- Well, thank you both.

282
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:22,327
And I'll thank you again later.

283
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,358
If that's all it takes,
where can I buy one?

284
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:28,328
Okay.

285
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:32,643
You know what, why don't we
find a table and get some food.

286
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:42,047
So this will send you back?

287
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:45,161
I drink this, you and your sisters
say the magic words, and I'm gone.

288
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:47,678
I cannot believe that I'm stuck here
doing the grunt work

289
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:50,317
- while they're...
- Twisting the night away?

290
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:52,885
- Don't blame them.
- No, I'm not blaming anybody.

291
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,564
- It's just, I'm here.
- Stuck with me.

292
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:01,001
I'm sorry, but did you do
something specific to tick Drazi off,

293
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:04,127
or did he also find your honesty to be
a complete and total pain in the ass?

294
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:06,200
Drazi fell in love
with a mortal woman.

295
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:09,247
I redirected her love towards
a mortal man, away from Drazi.

296
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:12,358
She's married now, very happy.

297
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,958
But Drazi blames me
for denying him love.

298
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,126
A hundred slow strokes there.

299
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:22,647
So are you telling me
that demons love?

300
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:24,688
Frighteningly so.

301
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:27,327
Love of evil, love of fear.

302
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:30,401
Sometimes a love of the very things
they hate. In this case, a human being.

303
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:33,807
You know, if a demon
can open his heart,

304
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:35,368
there's hope for you too, Phoebe.

305
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:38,441
Okay, you know,
my heart is not closed, okay?

306
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:41,646
- It's open, just not to everybody.
- Your heart is closed.

307
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:43,563
I'm picky.

308
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:46,197
- No, you're terrified.
- Of what? What am I terrified of?

309
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:48,121
I don't know, you tell me.

310
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:49,688
I don't wanna play this game.

311
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:53,167
Well, then at least stir correctly.

312
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,282
Like that.

313
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:00,408
So how does this work?

314
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:02,202
It transports you.

315
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:06,528
It's your travel potion
with an aphrodisiac kicker.

316
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:08,641
Really, an aphrodisiac?

317
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:10,848
Lavender, oysters,

318
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,285
rosemary and chocolate
and your basic caris-root compound.

319
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:16,283
But the key ingredient

320
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:18,203
is desire.

321
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:20,963
Desire?

322
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:23,561
A desire to go home.

323
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,688
Because home...

324
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:27,962
Is where your heart is.

325
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,082
Are you afraid of loss?

326
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:35,926
You know, I swear, if you barf up
"It's better to have loved and lost

327
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:38,398
than never to have loved at all,"
I might just have to...

328
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:47,767
Smells really good.

329
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,841
So tell me, what has not loving
gotten you?

330
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:56,682
It's kept me safe.

331
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:58,608
Safe from what?

332
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:02,247
From people leaving.

333
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:04,443
Your mother?

334
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:07,805
- Yeah.
- And your father?

335
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:13,642
And you.

336
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:17,767
Are you falling for me?

337
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:21,797
No, I am not falling for you,
thank you very much.

338
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:25,564
Ladies and gentlemen, Phoebe
Halliwell, running away from love.

339
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:29,404
You're Cupid. Okay?
You're the one that's leaving me.

340
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:32,561
Look, Phoebe, what I am is
the potential for true love, that's all.

341
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:36,247
Because once you let love in,
it'll never leave.

342
00:21:37,689 --> 00:21:39,839
Don't confuse the message
with the messenger, Phoebe.

343
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:42,648
It's what you've always done.
See, messengers make mistakes.

344
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:44,362
They get lost, they run away.

345
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:46,802
They even die.

346
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:50,439
But their message, "open your heart,"
it comes from life itself. Hear it.

347
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:52,288
For my sake.

348
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:55,519
And yours.

349
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:00,803
Your having an in with the owners

350
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:03,164
of one of the hottest clubs in town
has its benefits.

351
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:05,797
- Free chicken wings.
- To name one.

352
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:09,006
- And the pleasure of our company?
- And to name two more.

353
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:10,443
Thank you.

354
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:12,361
Bathroom break, Piper?

355
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:14,838
All right, yes, ma'am.
See you boys in a minute.

356
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:16,362
All right.

357
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:22,725
Oh, my God, I have to pee.

358
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:25,362
Okay.

359
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:28,047
You're okay with that, aren't you?

360
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:29,768
Okay with what?

361
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:31,602
This.

362
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:33,680
I mean, I don't really want you
mad at me.

363
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:35,123
Why would I be mad at you?

364
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:37,685
Because I let Dan buy it for you.

365
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:39,482
No, Prue, it's okay.

366
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:40,918
It's great.

367
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:45,164
Really. And you don't wish
that it came from Leo?

368
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:46,682
No.

369
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:49,842
I don't, really.

370
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,127
This feels strange.

371
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,728
What do you mean?

372
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:55,847
Well, I mean, we have these...

373
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:59,320
...guys out there waiting for us.
Who care about us.

374
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:03,125
Correct me if I'm wrong, but things
are going pretty well right now, right?

375
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:06,520
Yeah, nothing like a night out on the
town after a hard day of demon-killing.

376
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:08,088
Okay, I'm serious.

377
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:10,441
I mean...

378
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:12,042
You know...

379
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:14,200
Think about it.
I mean, we did great today.

380
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:17,406
And now tonight, it's like we're just...

381
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:19,605
Finding a balance in our lives?

382
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:21,568
Exactly.

383
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:23,961
I do feel pretty good.

384
00:23:24,489 --> 00:23:26,366
Yeah, I think
we're gonna be okay.

385
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:29,686
Except that there's still
our little secret.

386
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:34,201
Oh, Piper, everybody has secrets,
including Jack and Dan.

387
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:37,805
Yeah, well, unless they're
transvestite Nazi war criminals

388
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:40,802
with great face-lifts,
then I think we've got them beat.

389
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:43,644
Okay, so we're never
gonna have normal lives.

390
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:44,878
Not ever.

391
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,483
But that doesn't mean
that we can't try sometimes.

392
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:50,118
With someone like Dan, perhaps?

393
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:54,564
With whoever, sweet girl,
I just want you loved.

394
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:56,481
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

395
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:00,239
About time.

396
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:04,277
Dan, I will never understand the whole
tandem pit stop thing that women do.

397
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:05,763
Yeah.

398
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:08,284
- Hey, Jack, speaking of mysteries...
- Yeah.

399
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:11,088
You know, Piper has this strange
habit of sometimes just sort of...

400
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,682
- Vanishing?
- Yeah.

401
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:14,607
Prue does it too.

402
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:16,767
I figured that. Does it bug you?

403
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:20,444
A little, but I'm not gonna give her
the third degree about it.

404
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:23,442
It's like time just stands still
for a few seconds.

405
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:26,362
And when it starts up again,
she's like a total different person.

406
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:28,760
- Ask her about it.
- No, I have.

407
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:31,489
- She gives me the run-around.
- Then don't ask.

408
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:35,445
Hey, guys,
are Prue and Piper around?

409
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:37,679
Yeah, they're in the ladies' room.

410
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:39,601
- Thanks.
- Excuse me, have we met?

411
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:42,039
Yeah, you look really familiar.

412
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:44,722
I've been around.

413
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:46,966
Yeah. Okay, come on.

414
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:51,048
And see, that's another thing.

415
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:53,763
There's strange guys
that always show up at their place.

416
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:57,046
They pop in, they pop out.
Who the hell are they?

417
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,561
It sounds like someone's
falling in love.

418
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:09,560
Yeah, maybe.

419
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:29,039
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

420
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:31,643
Evening, ladies.
I trust everything's going well.

421
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:34,041
- Very well.
- Prue?

422
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:39,240
Well, it's a little early to tell, but all
the signs are pointing to maybe.

423
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:41,960
Did you get everything
we need to send him home?

424
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:46,361
Yeah. He drinks this while
we say this, and he's gone.

425
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:48,008
Any idea where you wanna do this?

426
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:49,887
In there. Stockroom.

427
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:53,444
Is this gonna take very long,
because, you know...?

428
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,805
Go tell your boys
you'll be back in a few minutes.

429
00:25:56,249 --> 00:25:58,683
- Okay.
- And don't dawdle.

430
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:03,803
Ain't love grand?

431
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:10,287
Welcome back. I was starting
to get a little worried there.

432
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:26,157
Dan, Piper still loves Leo.

433
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:29,568
Always has, always will.

434
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:34,400
You are nothing more
than geographically desirable.

435
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:39,798
After all, a girl can't get much closer
than the stud next door.

436
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:47,127
Jack, Jack, Jack.

437
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:50,122
Does the term "transition man"
mean anything to you?

438
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:54,328
Well, it should,
because Prue is using you.

439
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:59,481
You are everything
she always knew she never wanted.

440
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,520
And now for you, Piper.

441
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,248
What's the matter?

442
00:27:11,449 --> 00:27:12,882
I can't believe it.

443
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:14,881
What, is it Drazi?

444
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:16,881
He's alive.

445
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:20,442
Why don't you just admit it.

446
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:22,201
You're just using me
to make Leo jealous.

447
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:24,837
- Can you leave him out of this?
- I'd love to. What about you?

448
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:27,762
Rebound guy, is that it? What makes
you think I'm gonna take this crap?

449
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:30,648
You think I'm just gonna jump in the
sack with you on the second date?

450
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:33,482
- Why don't you just drop dead.
- I can't believe you're threatened.

451
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:35,844
You think I'm an idiot?
You think I don't know?

452
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:37,528
- All right, you guys...
- Shut up!

453
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:42,319
- It isn't over between you two, is it?
- That's really none of your business.

454
00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:44,207
- Fine, why don't we just end it.
- Fine.

455
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:47,202
- We are dating, aren't we?
- No, we're not. Not anymore.

456
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:48,961
And you can have that back too.

457
00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:52,007
Fine. I'm sure Leo will replace it with
something that means more anyway.

458
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:54,205
- Probably.
- I'm just glad that nothing happened.

459
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:55,563
Yeah, well, you and me both.

460
00:27:55,729 --> 00:27:57,799
I'm really glad.
I mean, I learned a valuable lesson.

461
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:00,802
- Never go out with a jerk.
- Thanks for the evening, Prue.

462
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:02,402
- All right, bye-bye.
- Wait, wait.

463
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:04,844
It's not them, Phoebe,
they're caught in Drazi's spell.

464
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:08,319
- If he did this, why didn't you sense it?
- Because I thought he was dead.

465
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:10,121
You're still here?

466
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:13,008
None of this would have happened
if you would have just left us alone.

467
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:14,761
Now, get out. Get out of my club!

468
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:17,079
- Wait, where are you going?
- There's nothing I can do.

469
00:28:17,249 --> 00:28:18,921
- They're trapped.
- We are not trapped.

470
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:21,557
For the first time in my life,
I see things how they really are.

471
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:24,004
Now, whoever you are,
whatever you're selling, just get out.

472
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,241
No, no. Don't. Listen to me.
Okay, hi, hi. Look.

473
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:30,719
You guys are under a spell.
Okay, this is not you. Listen to me.

474
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:33,005
If you're with him,
why don't you go too.

475
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:35,086
What?

476
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:38,246
No. You guys. What...?

477
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:42,643
We vanquished Drazi.
How is this happening?

478
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:45,409
- The ring must have saved him.
- What, so he's invincible now?

479
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:47,048
Maybe not.

480
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:49,245
Maybe if destroying the loves
that I put together

481
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:51,525
is killing me,
maybe the reverse is true.

482
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,964
Patching things up between
everybody just might kill him.

483
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:56,723
But you can't do that without the ring.

484
00:28:56,889 --> 00:28:58,641
Well, I've got you.

485
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:00,162
I'm sorry, what?

486
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:03,685
Your heart's as big and as true
as any I've ever seen, Phoebe.

487
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:05,248
You'll be my ring.

488
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:09,118
I'm... I'm flattered, I think. But I have
no idea what you're talking about.

489
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:12,287
You will. Come on, we've gotta start
with the first couple Drazi tore apart.

490
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:14,480
Okay.

491
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:19,083
I cannot believe Jack.
Who the hell does he think he is?

492
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:21,604
Jack? What about Dan?
We're out on a date

493
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:24,078
and he accuses me of being in love
with someone else.

494
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:25,523
Totally out of line.

495
00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:29,006
- We're better off without them.
- Well, certainly not worth crying over.

496
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:31,683
I have never hated someone
so much in my entire life.

497
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:33,248
Me either.

498
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,561
Although I have to admit,

499
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:40,403
some of the things Dan said
were kind of true.

500
00:29:40,689 --> 00:29:43,328
I do think about Leo sometimes.

501
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:47,001
Jack wasn't wrong when he said
I was on the rebound.

502
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:49,080
Still, it's all so weird. I mean,

503
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:52,241
one minute the four of us
are laughing and having a great time.

504
00:29:52,449 --> 00:29:54,963
And the next, we're all acting like
we hate each other.

505
00:29:57,209 --> 00:30:01,805
- What?
- I was just thinking about Drazi.

506
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:05,928
No way. He couldn't have had anything
to do with this. We vanquished him.

507
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:10,361
- Jack's scum.
- So's Dan.

508
00:30:12,449 --> 00:30:14,405
- Are you scum?
- No, I'm not scum.

509
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:16,082
I knew you weren't.

510
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:18,404
There she is. We gotta hurry.

511
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,918
But wait, I'm still not exactly sure
what the plan is.

512
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:23,000
- It's simple. Just talk to her.
- About what?

513
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:25,239
She's just the same as you.
Her fears are your fears.

514
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:27,365
Just pretend
you're talking to yourself.

515
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:30,886
Here she comes. Cindy? Hi.

516
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:34,768
- Do I know you?
- No, but we know you.

517
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:36,408
And we know about Max.

518
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:38,361
- How is he?
- I don't know.

519
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:41,043
Look, I'm really sorry
about what happened,

520
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:45,043
and I'm not even sure how
it happened. But I'm sorry.

521
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:46,648
Hurry. Hurry.

522
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:48,640
Cindy, Cindy. Look, look.

523
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:50,967
Sooner or later,

524
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:53,525
Max's pain will go away.

525
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:55,362
But yours won't.

526
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:58,767
- Excuse me?
- I mean, it hasn't yet, has it?

527
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:01,358
The pain of love lost deepens

528
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:03,879
if you don't deal with it.

529
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:07,406
Look, I know.

530
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:09,685
I know what it's like, believe me.

531
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:12,727
I closed myself off to love, too,
because I was afraid.

532
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:16,564
But you know what? Fear and love
cannot live in the same house.

533
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:18,768
You're getting to her.

534
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:21,440
It's because the people that we love

535
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:23,606
eventually leave us.

536
00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:26,442
So we've given up on love.

537
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:31,720
- You mean love's given up on me.
- No.

538
00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:36,879
It hasn't. It can't. Your fear of loss
has left you paralysed.

539
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:40,761
Believe me, I know.
But you can change that.

540
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:43,568
You can take the risk and love again.

541
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:47,246
I mean, hey, they don't call it
lover's leap for nothing, right?

542
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:49,127
- What?
- Actually, "lover's leap"

543
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:50,802
was a reference to suicide, Phoebe.

544
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:54,687
Let me rephrase that.

545
00:31:55,489 --> 00:32:00,165
Go to Max, push through
whatever hate or fear or doubt

546
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:02,718
that you think might exist
between the both of you.

547
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:04,648
Just tell him what's in your heart.

548
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:07,445
- I love him.
- Then tell him that.

549
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,681
Now, before it's too late.

550
00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:14,684
Who are you?

551
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:18,598
Messengers.

552
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:20,768
Thank you.

553
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:25,607
I'm starting to feel better already.

554
00:32:26,689 --> 00:32:28,964
- You were good.
- I was good, wasn't I?

555
00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:30,403
Yes, ma'am.

556
00:32:30,969 --> 00:32:34,359
So why do I feel that was more
for my sake than for Cindy's?

557
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:35,883
Because in order to let love in,

558
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:38,563
you have to overcome the obstacles
within yourself.

559
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:40,842
You know, we have to go reconnect

560
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:43,239
Prue and Piper's love connection
before it's too late.

561
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,599
You know that the more couples
we put back together,

562
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:48,283
the more Drazi's gonna come
looking for me, wherever I am.

563
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:51,163
- Isn't that the plan?
- Yeah.

564
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,167
I just wanna make sure you know
what you're getting yourself into.

565
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:20,960
They didn't have any roses.

566
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:22,922
Cindy.

567
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:25,284
I am so sorry
for whatever happened today.

568
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:28,283
- I don't know what came over me.
- It's okay.

569
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:31,248
It doesn't matter.
I didn't mean it either. None of it.

570
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:32,968
- Really?
- Really.

571
00:33:40,329 --> 00:33:41,603
Cupid.

572
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:44,729
You think you can undo
what I've done?

573
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:47,888
You're dead.

574
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:56,801
This better be good.

575
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:58,687
Should I know
what you're talking about?

576
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:01,079
Don't buy the innocent act.
She pulls it all the time.

577
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:02,728
I beg your pardon?

578
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:04,726
Just cut to the chase, Piper.
Why did you call?

579
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:07,562
- What? I didn't...
- Prue, I wanna talk to you.

580
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:10,038
Isn't this your number?
"Come to my house, ASAP"?

581
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,319
Oh, that's really pathetic,
paging yourself.

582
00:34:12,529 --> 00:34:14,087
- Pathetic?
- Prue.

583
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,519
- I'm sorry, I meant moronic.
- Why are you here?

584
00:34:16,689 --> 00:34:18,839
- You called.
- Oh, you wish.

585
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:22,405
- What is going on?
- Hate. And it's gotta stop.

586
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:24,799
I asked Jack and Dan
to come over here.

587
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:26,328
And what is he still doing here?

588
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:27,763
Trying to help you.

589
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,243
No reason to hang around here.

590
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,843
Oh, on the contrary.
Everyone on the couch. Now.

591
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:35,160
- Just mind your own business.
- Hey, don't talk to my sister like that.

592
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:37,923
- Please.
- Okay. Everyone on the couch, now.

593
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:40,522
Come on.

594
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:56,604
- Phoebe, I don't understand.
- Okay, well, be quiet and you will. Sit.

595
00:34:58,569 --> 00:35:00,161
You don't look okay.
Are you all right?

596
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:02,797
- I'm having a rough day.
- Though we can change that.

597
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,646
You are all acting

598
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:08,767
- like you're under some kind of spell.
- Phoebe.

599
00:35:08,929 --> 00:35:11,489
Would you stop thinking
and just feel?

600
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,562
Look, I know that some ugly things
were said tonight.

601
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:18,119
- But you can get past that.
- Assuming that we want to.

602
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:19,961
Prue, I know you want to.

603
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:22,518
Remember how you felt
the first time you saw Jack?

604
00:35:22,689 --> 00:35:24,805
- How would you know?
- I hated him.

605
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:27,842
My point exactly. Opposites attract.

606
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:30,718
But after a while, he started
to make you smile, didn't he?

607
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:34,643
He made you laugh.
Look at him again. Remember that.

608
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:50,723
And, Piper, I watch you
when you talked to Dan.

609
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:55,519
And I see light and warmth and hope.
And I know you feel that way.

610
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:57,282
You still feel that way.

611
00:35:58,009 --> 00:36:00,523
And, Dan, you don't need someone
whispering in your ear,

612
00:36:00,689 --> 00:36:03,203
telling you not to trust Piper.
Trust yourself.

613
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:06,640
I'm not saying
you have to tell me everything.

614
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:08,640
But when you deliberately
keep secrets from me...

615
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:12,404
It's not because I want to. I told you,
it just has nothing to do with you.

616
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:14,207
But does it have
anything to do with Leo?

617
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:17,918
No. It has to do with you and me
and what I would like us to become.

618
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:26,203
It's working.

619
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:28,599
- Where is he?
- He's close.

620
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:30,482
Okay. Okay. Here's the plan.

621
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:33,686
Jack, Dan, go down to the corner
market and get whatever you want.

622
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:37,159
If the food of love
is Cheetos and soda, then play on.

623
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:39,599
And can you pick up
a couple of frozen pizzas?

624
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:41,248
So you want to talk?

625
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:45,847
Yes. That's very good, Jack.
Very good. You're quick.

626
00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:47,727
- I'll drive.
- Yeah, okay.

627
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:49,322
Take your time, don't hurry.

628
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:50,922
Bye-bye.

629
00:36:51,649 --> 00:36:53,879
- Hey, what the hell is going on?
- Okay.

630
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:56,041
Think, you guys.
Do you remember Drazi?

631
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:57,722
He's still alive.
And if Cupid's right,

632
00:36:57,929 --> 00:37:00,318
he's on his way here as we speak.

633
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:04,402
Whatever bad feelings you've had
for Dan and Jack, Drazi did it.

634
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:07,039
He's twisted
your relationships with hate.

635
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:10,724
- So, what do we do now?
- Exactly what you're doing right now.

636
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:12,959
You let Dan and Jack
back into your hearts.

637
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:15,962
- Okay, hold up. I don't love Jack.
- No, but you like him a lot.

638
00:37:16,649 --> 00:37:19,004
And it's helped
to make you open to love.

639
00:37:20,649 --> 00:37:22,082
Hello, lover boy.

640
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:27,044
I should have finished you off
the first time.

641
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:31,085
Okay, so much for loving him to death.
What do we do with him now?

642
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,888
- Same thing, only different.
- Been there, blew that.

643
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:38,486
Yeah, only difference is,
the ring won't be protecting him,

644
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,487
it will be protecting him.

645
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:44,038
- How can you be sure?
- I can't.

646
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:49,566
But love is a risk.
If he's taught me anything, it's that.

647
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:01,403
No. No.

648
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:03,528
No. Not again.

649
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:12,237
Is he gone this time?

650
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:15,122
- Yeah, he's definitely gone.
- How do you know?

651
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:18,322
Because I've never felt better.

652
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:22,363
I knew you could do it.

653
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:26,039
And now I have to go.

654
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:29,200
- I know.
- I won't be far.

655
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:33,802
Don't mourn me, Phoebe.
Remember me, celebrate me

656
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:36,404
and seek me out.

657
00:38:56,929 --> 00:38:58,806
Now, that boy can kiss.

658
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:07,208
You gotta remember, though,
the mission was successful.

659
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:08,404
Bronson made it home.

660
00:39:08,689 --> 00:39:12,238
- Just in time to make Death Wish.
- Oh, no.

661
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:14,286
You'll love it, I promise.

662
00:39:16,649 --> 00:39:19,880
Sorry, Phoebe. I almost forgot
to get our parking validated.

663
00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:22,358
- No problem, Kevin.
- Hey.

664
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:25,562
You know, I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry

665
00:39:25,729 --> 00:39:27,481
that I cancelled on you
the other night.

666
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:31,523
Love means never having
to say you're sorry.

667
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:33,727
What?

668
00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:36,926
It's nothing. We saw Love Story
here the other night, and...

669
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,725
- Never mind.
- I love that movie.

670
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:42,962
- Really?
- Yeah.

671
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:45,208
Me too.

672
00:39:46,169 --> 00:39:48,205
Now.

673
00:39:52,009 --> 00:39:53,522
- Hi.
- Hello.

674
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:56,727
Let's grab some coffee. I am buying.
