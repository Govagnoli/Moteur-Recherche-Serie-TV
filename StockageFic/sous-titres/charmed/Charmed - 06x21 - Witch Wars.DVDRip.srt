1
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,385
Welcome back to Witch Wars.

2
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:14,014
Tonight, on a very special episode,
you'll see the ultimate battle

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,643
when the gamemasters themselves
take on not just any witches,

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,896
but the legendary Charmed Ones.

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,148
It'll be winner takes all,

6
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:28,070
and we will take all.
Their lives, their powers,

7
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:32,908
and last but not least,
their progeny.

8
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,000
Sorry I'm late. I'm not moving
real fast these days.

9
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,795
Are you sure you don't wanna be
born any time soon already?

10
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,130
- Don't be in such a hurry.
- I hate to rush things,

11
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,716
but what do you say we get this
family meeting started?

12
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,803
You know, you could cut back
on those triple lattes a little bit.

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,263
Hey, where's Leo?

14
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,806
He's on the witch killer path,

15
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,600
which you all should be
focusing on as well.

16
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,229
We actually have bigger things
to deal with, Gideon.

17
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,398
Like trying to figure out
who's after Wyatt.

18
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,526
And I think I might
have an angle on that.

19
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,279
- You found the demon?
- It may not be a demon.

20
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:14,241
Look, we've relied on magic
all this time and it's gotten us nowhere.

21
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,035
And since I can't rely on
my premonitions to help,

22
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,414
I've had to resort to statistics.

23
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,457
- Statistics?
- Yes.

24
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,210
Did you know that 50 percent
of violent crimes

25
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,546
are perpetrated by
someone the victim knew?

26
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,089
So don't you see?

27
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,049
Whoever turns Wyatt evil
might actually be

28
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,010
someone we know
or even care about.

29
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,928
A mortal? Lmpossible.

30
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,098
Really? Because the crime reporter
at the newspaper

31
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,809
said that it's usually someone
you least expect.

32
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,228
All right, now you're
making me nervous.

33
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,984
Phoebe, this theory might make
sense in the lives of normal people,

34
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,653
but you aren't normal people.

35
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,822
There's an entire underworld
of demons out there

36
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,533
who want you dead,
and today is no exception,

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,286
which brings me back
to the witch killer.

38
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,123
Hold up, Phoebe's
onto something here.

39
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,585
I mean, we've practically overturned
every demonic stone, right?

40
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,837
- At least this is new.
- I don't believe this.

41
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,464
Someone is killing witches,

42
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,801
possibly as we speak.
How is that not your only priority?

43
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,595
Because we're running out of time.

44
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,264
What do you mean? Why?

45
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,434
- I should have told you sooner.
- Told us what?

46
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,020
What happens to Wyatt
happens before I'm born.

47
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:28,357
- What?
- And you're just telling us this now?

48
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,776
I thought I'd given myself
enough time. I'm so sorry.

49
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,822
Then how do we know
that this witch killer

50
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,491
isn't the one that's after Wyatt?

51
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,495
Given this new information,
it seems to time out properly.

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,332
Okay, it's time
to divide and conquer.

53
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,043
Paige and Chris,
you help Leo with the witch killer.

54
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,796
I'm gonna go chase my theory.
And Piper, you don't worry.

55
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,506
We're gonna find
this guy, I promise.

56
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,399
Is something wrong, sir?

57
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,026
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.

58
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:17,030
I think they're just about
to figure us out.

59
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,062
What'd I ever do to you?

60
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,813
You're sure he's a demon, right?

61
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,234
That give you the right to commit
unprovoked violence against me?

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,739
Tell us everything about the witches
that were murdered.

63
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,366
I don't know anything, I swear.

64
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:48,997
Oh, the witches.

65
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,917
Well, the one last night,
she put on a great show.

66
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:56,338
She shot fire from her hands
and she put up a great fight.

67
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,886
Why did you just do that?
He was just starting to talk.

68
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:07,641
He was lying. A, there was no witch
murdered last night, and B...

69
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,519
Another witch was killed last night.

70
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,355
- You were saying?
- That's a coincidence.

71
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,899
There's no way he could have
been there to see that.

72
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,901
Did she shoot fire
out of her hands?

73
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,153
Yeah, how did you know?

74
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,947
More to the point, how did he know?

75
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,616
Maybe he was working for
an upper-level demon.

76
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,328
Oh, right, we just happened to trap
the apprentice to the exact demon

77
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,665
that we're trying to catch
and know nothing about.

78
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:35,210
- What are we talking about?
- Paige vanquished our lucky break.

79
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,172
- You don't know that.
- What do we know?

80
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,384
Well, we know that one demon can't
possibly be doing all of these killings,

81
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,512
so I'm thinking that someone
is getting demons to join forces.

82
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,931
You think somebody
is trying to organize the underworld?

83
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,686
Seems like it. And unfortunately,
I seem to be the only person

84
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,897
concerned about the fact
that Phoebe is out there,

85
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,982
roaming around in the world
without any powers.

86
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,735
Without her active powers.
She can still cast spells.

87
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,737
Right, so when
a demon attacks her,

88
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:05,032
let's hope that Phoebe can come up
with a little rhyme just in time.

89
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,242
No, no, no. I'm gonna go
bring her some potions.

90
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,996
- Well, what should we do?
- Pray that she doesn't get attacked.

91
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,671
- And what do I get out of it?
- Fame, glory,

92
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,507
the respect of the entire underworld.

93
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,343
And, of course,
the powers of the witch you kill.

94
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,345
If you win.

95
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,347
If I play, I'll win.

96
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,600
A demon of your considerable power,
we have no doubt.

97
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:35,020
As long as it's entertaining.

98
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,440
Just out of curiosity, how did you
come up with the idea anyway?

99
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,900
We can't take all the credit.

100
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,945
You'd think demons would
have invented reality television,

101
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,571
but somehow humans beat us to it.

102
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,324
Still, it's the best idea we ever stole.

103
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:51,245
And demons everywhere love
to watch. So if you're ready to play,

104
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,040
just draw your blood
and sign on the dotted line.

105
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,543
Draw my blood? Why?

106
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,754
So that your powers, should you for
any reason lose, will revert to us.

107
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:04,007
My powers? You gotta be kidding me.
There's no way I'm signing...

108
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,801
I thought you were planning to win.

109
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,637
And if you don't, you'll be dead.
You won't need your powers.

110
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,597
But it doesn't mean
I want you to have them.

111
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,392
It's quite a racket
you got going on here.

112
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,061
Get all these guys to sign
their powers over to you,

113
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:19,565
and then risk their lives all for some
chance to kill some stupid witch?

114
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,235
No, the witch is not the point.
The point is fame. The point is...

115
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,237
Fortune. Yeah, I got it.

116
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,740
That may work on the silly morons
you have playing this game so far,

117
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,535
but it won't work on me.

118
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,329
If we don't get
an upper-level demon,

119
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,165
we will never collect
the powers we need.

120
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,585
We just have to be patient.
As the game gains in popularity,

121
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,379
more and more powerful demons
will want to play.

122
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,589
How do you know?

123
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,924
Because if human beings
are foaming at the mouth

124
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,636
to humiliate themselves on national
television, and they are,

125
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,598
then demons are an easy mark.

126
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,309
Upper-level humans?

127
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:59,271
Donald Trump has his own show.

128
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,774
Just be patient, my love.

129
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:07,196
And together,
we'll rule the underworld.

130
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,908
It's an old goal, but a good one.

131
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:16,413
Disarm and I will reveal myself.

132
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,712
- What is that, an Elder?
- Kill him.

133
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,339
What I have to offer

134
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:31,178
is far better than anything
my death will ever bring you.

135
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:40,354
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you again.
You seem super busy.

136
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,023
- You're always super busy.
- That's why I chose crime beat.

137
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,484
So many bad guys,
I knew I'd never be out of work.

138
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,571
That's funny. You are funny.

139
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,742
Thanks for those statistics,
they really helped me.

140
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,161
- Are you flirting with me?
- What?

141
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,247
When a woman who looks like you
flirts with me,

142
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,706
it means they want something.

143
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,876
Okay. Yeah, you got me.

144
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,172
I'm interested in dedicating
a month of my column

145
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,841
to the protection of our children.

146
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,344
And I was sort of wondering,
you know, if something,

147
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:16,223
God forbid, were to happen
to my nephew Wyatt,

148
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,560
what do you think the police might do
to try to figure out who did it?

149
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,729
- They'd make a flow chart.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, a what?

150
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,858
You do realize that
I'm on a deadline here, right?

151
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,069
Should I go back to the flirting?

152
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,406
- I guess I could use some coffee.
- That's great.

153
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,492
You're great. I'm buying.

154
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,744
- Oh, my God.
- What?

155
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,248
You gotta just give me one second.

156
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:46,879
Have you lost your mind?

157
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,881
No, another witch
was killed last night.

158
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,591
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

159
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,259
And she had active powers.

160
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,761
So I need you to go home
where I can keep an eye on you.

161
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,264
Paige, you're my baby sister,
not my babysitter.

162
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,474
Oh, that's clever. You're very clever.

163
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,477
I'm glad while I'm panicking
you have the time to be clever.

164
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:06,565
Okay, it's sweet that you're worried.
I'm fine, and have a lot of work to do.

165
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,942
- Do your work from home.
- I can't do it from home

166
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,320
because Kyle Donie is not at home.

167
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,948
Who's Kyle Donie?
Is this about a guy?

168
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,868
No, it's not about a guy,
it's about a reporter.

169
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,705
One who knows everything there is
to know about criminal investigation.

170
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:25,501
Since we don't have Darryl's help
anymore, he's the only resource I have.

171
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:31,131
Fine. Explosive, acid, smoke bomb.
Use them.

172
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,050
Thanks, Mom.

173
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,973
Okay, where were we?

174
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,684
Oh, you were flirting with me poorly,

175
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,103
and I was helping you
find your bad guy.

176
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,233
If I could find you through
my demonic contacts,

177
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,110
then how long do you think it'll be
before the Charmed Ones

178
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,029
find you and shut you down?

179
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:58,825
They know about the witch killings,
so it's really only a matter of time.

180
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,452
And you're here to warn us?

181
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,579
No, I'm here to help you.

182
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,123
Now, why don't I believe that?

183
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,085
I need the Charmed Ones
distracted for a while

184
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,129
whilst I accomplish
an important mission.

185
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,007
I thought your game might be
the perfect thing.

186
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,051
You want us to target
the Charmed Ones?

187
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,512
No, I want you to use them.

188
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,973
Make them your next stunt,
if you will.

189
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,308
We'll plant a witch in their care,

190
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,811
have her be the next target
in your game.

191
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,481
Your contestants will have to
get past them to get to her.

192
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,316
Get past the power of three?

193
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,735
That's a suicide mission.
No one will sign up.

194
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,488
The power of three isn't a factor
because Piper is convalescing

195
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,533
at my school for the duration
of her pregnancy.

196
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,201
It would draw upper-level demons.

197
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,995
I don't trust him.

198
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,122
Why would an Elder
sacrifice an innocent witch

199
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,665
or put the Charmed Ones
in danger?

200
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:51,420
I don't, and that's part of the deal.
There will be no blood drawn.

201
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,881
You will set up a series of tasks.

202
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,508
Have the demons... Oh, I don't know,

203
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,219
steal something from the witch
to begin with.

204
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,846
Let it escalate from there.

205
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,097
Steal something?

206
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:07,352
If you kill innocents,
or in any way harm Charmed Ones,

207
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,190
then your game will be over
and you will be dead.

208
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,653
- Understand?
- We don't take kindly to threats, Elder.

209
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:23,619
How would we put the witch target
into their care,

210
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,372
or, say, put them under surveillance?

211
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,166
Get the contestants ready.

212
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:33,170
Put a witch under non-lethal attack
and I'll take care of the rest.

213
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,757
The cameras?

214
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,989
- Clever.
- Thanks.

215
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,910
Don't disappoint me.

216
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,959
What's the matter with you?
Why do you trust him?

217
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,212
I don't. But with all the powers that
we'll get from the demons who sign up,

218
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:19,174
we'll have more than enough
to kill him when the time comes.

219
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,760
As well as the Charmed Ones.

220
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,768
So, what is it we're looking for?

221
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,479
Any demon powerful enough
to be organizing the underworld,

222
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,022
or any demon who might be running

223
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,316
some sort of training camp
for younger demons,

224
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:41,363
- or any demon that could be...
- So basically any demon.

225
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,699
Yeah.

226
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,203
This sucks, you know that?

227
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,330
We're running out of time
and we've got nothing,

228
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,040
repeat, nothing to go on.

229
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,209
We've faced worse.

230
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,628
What's worse than not knowing?

231
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,964
For over a year now,
I've been looking.

232
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:02,176
And you didn't know this deadline
was looming, but I did.

233
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,013
I knew every single day.

234
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,684
- That's why I was never able to relax.
- Why didn't you tell us?

235
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,437
Because I didn't wanna
get you involved.

236
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,649
I was trying to protect you.

237
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:21,236
Chris, we're your parents.

238
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,907
We're supposed to protect you,
not the other way around.

239
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,537
Hey, I got a new scrying crystal.

240
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,874
Amethyst. I thought we could use
the extra power boost.

241
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,667
What exactly are we scrying for?

242
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,085
Witches under attack.

243
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,087
I don't want any more getting killed.

244
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:42,716
And that includes my sister, who's
now determined to stay at the office

245
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:46,386
ever since your son
dropped his little bomb this morning.

246
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:47,721
I already said I was sorry.

247
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,515
And he shouldn't have to say it again.

248
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,725
All right, Dad.

249
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,562
Gideon, what are you doing here?
Is Piper okay?

250
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,439
Hardly.

251
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:01,568
Thanks to Phoebe's ludicrous theory,
everybody's a suspect in her mind.

252
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,570
She's terrorizing the entire school.

253
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,239
So you want me to talk to her?

254
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,741
I'd be eternally grateful.

255
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,455
What are you scrying for?

256
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,916
Witches under attack.

257
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,088
Got one, in the Mission.

258
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,423
You should both go. Hurry.

259
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,622
No. Help!

260
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,792
That what you were hoping for?

261
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,677
Hey, help me!

262
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,640
Got it.

263
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,935
Damn it.

264
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,855
- What the hell just happened?
- I don't know.

265
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,899
Wait, who are you?

266
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,067
We're the Charmed... One.

267
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:27,112
Come on, I'll take you
somewhere safe, okay?

268
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,490
Where are we?

269
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,702
It's okay, you're gonna be safe here.
What's your name, anyway?

270
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,746
I'm Tali.

271
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,916
How can I ever thank you guys
for saving me?

272
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:42,711
Okay, I don't think you need to
because I don't think we did.

273
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:44,755
I'm not even sure
they were after you.

274
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,715
Yeah, they were after your necklace.

275
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,092
Oh, my grandmother's amulet.

276
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,013
Amulet? Is it magical?
Does it have any power?

277
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:55,641
No. No, not at all.

278
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,476
This is all very strange.

279
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:02,606
Wait, this thing is powerless?
Then why did you want us to steal it?

280
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,484
It got the Charmed Ones involved,
didn't it?

281
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,319
So when do we get
our shot at them?

282
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:11,114
Be patient, this was only round one.

283
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,408
Stay tuned.

284
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:21,875
Yeah!

285
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,507
Mrs. Winterbourne?
Hold it right there.

286
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,844
Well, hi, Wyatt. Hi, Piper.

287
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,221
Never mind that. I just wanted
you to know that Wyatt

288
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:38,684
will not be in your class tomorrow,
or ever again for that matter.

289
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,227
Why? Is there a problem?

290
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,688
A problem? You mean like when
Wyatt was playing with

291
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:45,023
that little girl at the Play-Doh table
this morning?

292
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,860
You mean Emily?
She's such a sweet, little psychic.

293
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,113
She stole his dough
right out of his hands.

294
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,198
And you did absolutely nothing.

295
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,909
Well, stole is a little harsh,
don't you think?

296
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,327
She's only two years old.

297
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,454
No, that's not the point.

298
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:03,083
What message is this sending him,
that people can just take from him?

299
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,418
That people can hurt him,

300
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,546
that grown adults will not be there
to protect him?

301
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,089
- Piper.
- What?

302
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,632
We need to talk.

303
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:13,594
Would you mind taking Wyatt for
a stroll just for a minute, please?

304
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,137
What?!

305
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,639
It's all right, go ahead.

306
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:21,852
I'll be right over there.
Come on, let's go.

307
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,147
Are you out of your mind?

308
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:28,984
Piper, do you realize you're driving
everybody nuts around here?

309
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:32,279
Well, I don't really care, because,
see, I'm trying to protect our son.

310
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,448
From who, his
"Mommy & Me" teacher?

311
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:37,868
Hey, how do you not know
that she's the one who's after him?

312
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,037
- If Phoebe's right...
- She's not.

313
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,538
How do you know?

314
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:44,416
Because why would anybody
we know want to turn Wyatt evil?

315
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,252
It just doesn't make any sense,
just like Gideon said.

316
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:51,298
How do you know it's not him?
Or us for that matter?

317
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:52,841
- Piper.
- No, I'm serious.

318
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,261
What if he saw what this life
did to us, and how hard it was,

319
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,472
and just decided to
take the easy way out.

320
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,432
- It's not what happened.
- How do you know?

321
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:03,268
Because Wyatt
is surrounded by love.

322
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,313
We love him,
whether we're together or not.

323
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:09,233
He's got a brother that risked
everything just to save his life.

324
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,569
Plus he's got two aunts who would
rather gouge out their own eyes

325
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,530
than see anything bad
happen to him.

326
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,163
Just promise me
we'll keep him safe.

327
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,541
I promise.

328
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:33,048
That's him, the Brute Demon.

329
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:36,385
Okay, upper-level demons
with overwhelming physical strength.

330
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,721
They work alone, generally
crushing skulls of their victims.

331
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:42,558
You're lucky he wasn't after you.

332
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,269
Okay, this isn't making sense.

333
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:49,022
Are you sure that that amulet
did not have magical powers?

334
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:52,359
I'm positive.
It was just a family heirloom.

335
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,486
Do you have anything else
of your grandmother's?

336
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:57,114
Her wedding ring, why?

337
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,783
That's a great idea.
We can use it to scry for the amulet.

338
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,619
- Find out where the demon went.
- Okay, people, heads up.

339
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,289
I need your address books,
your phone books, all your books.

340
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,623
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.
- Hi.

341
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,002
This is Tali. She was attacked
by three upper-level demons today.

342
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,172
Wow, and you lived to tell about it?
Congratulations.

343
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,132
About those books?
I'm kind of in a hurry.

344
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,259
Phoebe, we actually need your help.

345
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:20,470
How bad was it?

346
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,223
Well, they stole
my grandmother's amulet.

347
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:26,602
Really, how powerful was it?
Could they use it for mind control?

348
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,271
Oh, no, it was just decorative.

349
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:31,064
Decorative.

350
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,941
Yeah, pretty much.

351
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,361
Saving my nephew
or kleptomaniac demons?

352
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,238
I really need those books, guys.

353
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,532
- Pheeb.
- What? This is important.

354
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,327
I'm gonna draw a police flow chart
of everyone in Wyatt's life

355
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:46,622
who can possibly be a suspect
and I don't wanna forget anybody.

356
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,207
Fine, my book is in my bedroom.

357
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,791
Mom's is down in the kitchen.

358
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,503
- Great. I hope you find your amulet.
- Thank you.

359
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:53,795
I'll be at the office.

360
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,047
But please don't need me,

361
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:58,050
because I really think
I'm onto something here.

362
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,885
Stubborn little witch.

363
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,515
She's not playing along.

364
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:05,933
What if she finds us out?

365
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,851
- She won't.
- How are you gonna stop her?

366
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,565
Thanks for sharing.

367
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:21,865
Athames?

368
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,243
I thought we'd agreed
nobody would be hurt.

369
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,037
The weapons are part of the game.
It's how powers are taken.

370
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,832
Don't worry, only the players
will be using them on each other.

371
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,417
More dead demons?
Not a problem for me.

372
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,587
More dead Elders wouldn't be
a problem for us either.

373
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:38,257
- What do you want?
- This whole distraction

374
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:42,010
isn't working as well as I'd hoped,
especially not on Phoebe.

375
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,846
She's meeting with
the reporter again,

376
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:47,182
and I won't have him feeding her
any more information.

377
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:48,976
You want him dead?

378
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,145
No, of course not.
I want him out of the way.

379
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,605
How are we supposed to do that?

380
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:57,150
Be creative. Plant more cameras,
make him part of the game.

381
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:01,488
Use the Shapeshifter. I like him.

382
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:05,450
Still, he is a demon, which means
there's only so much we can control

383
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,619
in the risk department.

384
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:10,956
I expect you'll do your very best.

385
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,586
Did he just give us an opening?

386
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,297
He must be more desperate
than we thought, which means

387
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:22,092
that maybe he won't shut us down
after the first witch dies.

388
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:30,475
- Come on, get in there.
- Oh, man.

389
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,646
Yeah!

390
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:38,734
Next?

391
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,404
All right, finally.

392
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,493
Witch Wars, yeah!

393
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,621
Witch Wars!

394
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:54,500
- Welcome back to Witch Wars.
- Nobody shushes me.

395
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,378
You want battles,
you thirst for blood?

396
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,214
You ain't seen nothing yet.

397
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,467
Of course, that warlock won't be
seeing anything ever again, will he?

398
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,095
In round two, these three
upper-level demons

399
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,765
will again have to get past the
Charmed Ones to get the witch.

400
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:12,851
But this time they're not going
after her necklace,

401
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,062
they're going after her life.

402
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,856
Before we get started, let's introduce
our newest contestant.

403
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:20,901
He's a darklighter all the way
from the Northeast underworld.

404
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,362
- Good to have you with us.
- Good to be here.

405
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,157
Now remember,
your athames will absorb

406
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:32,079
the powers of your victims
as well as each other.

407
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,706
The last demon standing
will be awarded

408
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:37,292
all of the powers
collected at the end.

409
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,086
For the winner,

410
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:41,880
a serious power boost.

411
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:45,509
For the losers, certain death.

412
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,387
Oh, one more thing:

413
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:51,849
Since the Shapeshifter
failed to get the witch's amulet

414
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,643
at the end of round one,
he must now take on the added risk

415
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,605
of confronting a Charmed One
directly. In this case, Phoebe.

416
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,399
Oh, great.

417
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,818
And the Brute Demon,
having won round one

418
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:05,946
by claiming the amulet, has won
the right to make the first move.

419
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,906
Yeah!

420
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:11,535
Now the players will enter
the confessional cave

421
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:15,414
to share their strategies
with the audience.

422
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:22,462
Let's watch.

423
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:28,093
One of the Charmed Ones is getting
ready to scry for the amulet, right?

424
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:31,930
To find me. Good.
I'll be waiting for her.

425
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:36,727
And when I take her out,
the witch will be mine.

426
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:40,939
It's suicide to go up
against a Charmed One.

427
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:47,321
But if I could persuade Phoebe
to invite me home with her,

428
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,324
she'd be leading me
right to the witch.

429
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:52,784
All I gotta do is bide my time,

430
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:57,372
wait for that stupid Brute
to get himself killed,

431
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,501
then make my move.

432
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:03,003
Okay, so we have
the immediate family

433
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,548
and then the close friends of
the family. Who's next?

434
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:09,718
Anyone the child originally came
in contact with in the last six months.

435
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:14,056
Okay, but the child's been
in seclusion for the last six months.

436
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:17,434
So are we talking kids in the nursery,
and teachers?

437
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:20,854
And his mother's hairdresser,
or your handyman, or clergyman.

438
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,857
Okay, let's just say,
hypothetically speaking,

439
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,734
that the police
are running out of time.

440
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:29,655
They can't research everyone
the child's met in the last six months.

441
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:32,115
- Who do they focus on then?
- Immediate family.

442
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,034
They've ruled out
the immediate family.

443
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:37,037
Okay, I kind of preferred
the fake flirting to this.

444
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,790
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I just get very emotional

445
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,458
when things have to do
with my family.

446
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:45,170
Well, that's why the cops usually
do this part and not the parents.

447
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,005
Or the aunt.

448
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,466
Okay, so, what would
the cops do next?

449
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,344
It sounds to me like you're looking
for some kind of magic formula,

450
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:53,595
and there just isn't one.

451
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:55,722
Can't you just narrow it down
a little bit?

452
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:59,309
Well, statistically,
when it's not a crime of necessity,

453
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,104
you're looking at white men
between the ages of 25 and 50,

454
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:03,856
usually someone you'd least expect.

455
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:05,858
Maybe... Maybe even trust.

456
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:08,861
Think on that. I'll get coffee.

457
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:35,804
Making any progress?

458
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:38,265
No, not yet. I thought you were
getting coffee.

459
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:41,351
I changed my mind.
If I have caffeine this late,

460
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,023
- I can't sleep.
- Not gonna sleep until I figure this out.

461
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,402
Hey, how's it going here?

462
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:52,946
Paige and Tali went
to get her grandmother's ring.

463
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,281
How's Mom doing?

464
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:55,491
She's scared.

465
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,493
She's holding up.

466
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:58,911
And how are you doing?

467
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,746
About the same.

468
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,418
- Got it.
- So, what are you planning to do

469
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:07,753
when you find them?

470
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,088
I mean, could this be
some kind of trap?

471
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:13,091
Honey, it can always be
some kind of a trap.

472
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:14,635
You shouldn't go alone.

473
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:17,930
He's right, Paige.
If these are the witch killers...

474
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,432
- I got it.
- Why don't you guys go with her?

475
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:21,975
If they wanted to kill me,

476
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:25,187
they would have done it
when they had the chance. Right?

477
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:27,606
No, I'm sorry.
I can't leave you unprotected.

478
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,858
I'll stay.

479
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,610
Come on.

480
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:42,746
Lambs to the slaughter.

481
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:55,342
Okay, that looks like a trap.

482
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:56,718
Let's get out of here.

483
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:06,687
Told you he'd eat it.

484
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,313
That's gonna leave a mark.

485
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,695
What's that?

486
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,990
That's us.

487
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:25,372
Then you gotta keep going. Is there
any place where you can go...?

488
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:26,915
Okay, what's going on?

489
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:31,837
Chris.

490
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,221
I win, you lose.

491
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,517
Darklighter! Darklighter! Darklighter!

492
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:55,777
I am so sorry,
I didn't even see him coming.

493
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:58,697
It's okay, it's not your fault.
We're being watched.

494
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:00,282
What?

495
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:03,452
Sons of bitches,
where are the cameras?

496
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,953
What cameras?

497
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:07,456
There's some live feed going on
with the crystals.

498
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:10,584
Yeah, except for I think they cut it off.
I'm not seeing anything.

499
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,211
- Well, who?
- I don't know.

500
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:14,838
I vanquished the Brute Demon
before I could ask him.

501
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:16,757
What is this, some kind of game?

502
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,801
Actually, it might be.

503
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,137
What are you talking about?

504
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:25,098
Well, I heard something,
when I was down in the underworld.

505
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,935
- But I thought it was a rumour.
- You thought what was a rumour?

506
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,521
Well, that there was this
demonic game show.

507
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:33,565
Kind of like Survivor
but only for demons.

508
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:35,817
And you didn't tell us this why?

509
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:37,694
Because I didn't think
it was relevant.

510
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:39,988
That's your theme song
of today, did you notice?

511
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:42,032
Paige.

512
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:45,994
Look, I'm sorry.
Well, at least it explains

513
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:48,497
how the demon we trapped today
knew that the witch died.

514
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:52,167
He was watching it on TV.
Pretty sick.

515
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:54,127
No sicker than any other
reality TV show.

516
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:57,631
- I'm just saying.
- Except this one's about

517
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,258
killing witches for entertainment.

518
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:02,886
Yeah, we have to get out of here
because they are listening to us.

519
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:08,600
We're gonna find you.

520
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:10,936
We need more powers, fast.

521
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:14,940
Don't worry. Cue the confessional.

522
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:25,617
One demon down, one to go.

523
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:28,537
All I have to do is wait for Phoebe
to kill the Shapeshifter.

524
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,372
Then I can make my move.

525
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,416
What if she doesn't?

526
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:37,254
I mean, why wait? Why not just
eliminate the competition yourself?

527
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:40,048
Good point.

528
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,304
A reality what?
You have got to be kidding me.

529
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,389
All right. I'll be home
as soon as I can.

530
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:50,017
- Is something wrong?
- Kind of.

531
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:52,394
Listen, thanks. I have to get going.

532
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:53,979
I was having a really good time.

533
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:56,857
- Really?
- Yeah.

534
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,027
Well, thanks again for all your help.
Maybe we can talk more tomorrow.

535
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:04,615
Or since you're heading home,
I could just come with you.

536
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,033
I'm sorry?

537
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:10,537
To check out your place. Look for any,
you know, easy entry points.

538
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:13,040
I mean, most bad guys
usually attack at home.

539
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,209
Are you sure about that?
I think I read that...

540
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,793
I'm the expert, right?

541
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:22,216
So let me just come home with you,
make sure everything is all right.

542
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:25,427
Yeah. Well, that's not gonna happen.

543
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:27,137
See, I'm not going home.

544
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:30,224
I have to go somewhere else...

545
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:32,434
Take me to your house, witch. Now!

546
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,023
Chris! Leo!

547
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:47,491
Phoebe.

548
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:51,078
You still alive?

549
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:55,249
Oh, come on.

550
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:56,875
Missed by that much.

551
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:10,931
The witch is dead,
and I'm the last demon standing.

552
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:13,976
That's the game, my friends,
that is the game.

553
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:15,811
Well, not quite.

554
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:17,437
What?

555
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:24,444
As you know, all good reality TV
shows have one final twist.

556
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:28,657
That's a cheat.

557
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:35,289
Now, it's our turn to play.

558
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:42,880
You gotta admit, it's a good twist.

559
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,804
Found it.

560
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:54,933
Power-sucking athame.

561
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:56,351
And?

562
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,228
Well, that's it.

563
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:00,731
It doesn't say anything about
what kind of demon uses it

564
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:02,441
or what the "WW" stands for?

565
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,777
- No.
- Well, that's not a big help.

566
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:10,073
Okay. Well, we could scry with
the athame or the crystal thingy.

567
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,202
- No, I tried.
- How about a return-to-sender spell?

568
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,704
Tried. Our magic is blocked.

569
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:18,749
So then we've got nothing.

570
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,668
Yes, we have nothing
but a houseful of cameras

571
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:23,754
and an underworld full of voyeurs.

572
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:26,757
Piper, why don't you go relax?
We can take it from here.

573
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:31,220
No, I'm fine. I mean... And relax?
Relax where? We're being watched.

574
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,222
Not here, not at magic school
they're not.

575
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,350
Leo's right. You should go lay down.
We've got it under control.

576
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:40,771
You don't touch me.
You're the reason I look like this.

577
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,364
You have to put a stop to this.

578
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:52,241
You're missing the bigger picture.

579
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:55,828
- Sir, another witch is dead.
- That wasn't supposed to happen.

580
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:57,913
You're dealing with demons,
what did you expect?

581
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,958
Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

582
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,585
How far are you willing to go?
Phoebe was nearly killed.

583
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,754
No, she wasn't. She's strong.

584
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,923
She protected herself
as I knew she would.

585
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:10,759
They weren't supposed to
go after the Charmed Ones.

586
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:14,096
Yes, they were.
That was my plan all along.

587
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:17,516
To get the gamesmasters
to try to kill the Charmed Ones.

588
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:20,727
- But why?
- To get them off my trail.

589
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:23,188
To get them believing
that it's the gamemasters

590
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:25,941
who are after Wyatt, as if they've
been after him all along.

591
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:29,069
What if they succeed?
What if they kill the sisters?

592
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:32,364
I have no intention of letting
that happen.

593
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:36,785
I only want Wyatt eliminated,
not them.

594
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,587
I think I might have found something
that can help.

595
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:49,923
It's the crystal thingy.

596
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:52,009
It's an ancient form
of magical voyeurism.

597
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:54,845
The Ronyx crystal.
It predates even the crystal ball.

598
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:58,640
Our demon friends must have found
a way to put a new spin on an old idea.

599
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:00,058
Wait a minute.

600
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:04,146
It's got an incantation to activate it.

601
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,118
Welcome back to Witch Wars.

602
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:21,872
Tonight, on a very special episode,
you'll see the ultimate battle

603
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:25,501
when the gamemasters themselves
take on not just any witches,

604
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:27,461
but the legendary Charmed Ones.

605
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,089
It'll be winner takes all,

606
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:35,844
and we will take all.
Their lives, their powers,

607
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:39,723
and last but not least,
their progeny.

608
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:47,689
That's what their show is about,
killing us?

609
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,400
Then either me or Wyatt.

610
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:54,238
It has to be Wyatt. Which means...

611
00:35:55,364 --> 00:35:58,075
Oh, yes, this makes perfect sense.

612
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:01,787
What about any of this
make perfect sense?

613
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:03,038
Don't you see?

614
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:07,417
These gamesmasters are the demons
you've been looking for all along.

615
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:10,087
The ones who are after Wyatt.

616
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:12,756
- What?
- They've been collecting powers,

617
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:17,177
hoping to gain enough
to be able to collect yours.

618
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:18,428
And then get Wyatt's.

619
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:21,473
Well, it kind of fits in
with Phoebe's theory then.

620
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:24,643
Right? We don't know who they are
but they know who we are.

621
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:27,396
- I'm gonna kill them.
- No, Leo, you're an Elder now.

622
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:29,064
Nonviolent, remember?

623
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:30,691
Watch me.

624
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:33,402
We're gonna have to find them first.

625
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:35,779
Do you think we could trace
the signal back to them?

626
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:38,615
No, not without Piper.
I think they're too strong already.

627
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:41,577
No, we don't need Piper.

628
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:42,870
Because we have this.

629
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:46,748
And they're not gonna kill us on TV.

630
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:49,042
We're gonna kill them.

631
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:51,253
What if they never go back?

632
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,964
They will. If there's one thing I know
about the Charmed Ones,

633
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:57,176
they never run away from a fight.

634
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,970
- What exactly are we looking for?
- Anything that will let us

635
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:02,431
vanquish the gamemasters
without the power of three.

636
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:05,392
It's showtime.

637
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,027
Hi.

638
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:19,156
Anybody wanna play a game?

639
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:28,749
When are they coming back?

640
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,224
Now that's good television.
Give me the athame.

641
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,683
Are you sure about this?

642
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,268
It's for Wyatt.

643
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,116
Feels good to have powers again.

644
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:04,493
Give him hell.

645
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:18,423
This game's over.

646
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:20,717
I couldn't agree more.

647
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:30,102
See what happens when you
make a play for our baby?

648
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,520
Who wants to play next?

649
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:37,568
What's the matter? Scared of me?

650
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:42,281
Well, are you? Are you?

651
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:04,178
Looks like your show's
just been cancelled.

652
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:08,056
- Where's Phoebe?
- That's a good question.

653
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:10,100
God, that was great.

654
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:13,395
I wanna kill somebody else.
Chris, find me another demon to kill.

655
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,063
We gotta get these powers out.

656
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:17,482
You're the one who wanted me
to have a power, remember?

657
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:18,901
Yeah, not a demonic power.

658
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:20,360
Beggars can't be choosers.

659
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:24,865
Oh, poor little powerless Phoebe,
she can't even take care of herself.

660
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:26,950
Okay, I'm sorry.

661
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,953
I admit it, I was... I was wrong.

662
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:32,206
Would you mind repeating that,
please?

663
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:35,292
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

664
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,544
I clearly underestimated you.

665
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:40,297
You are very powerful.

666
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:43,634
That's all I wanted to hear.
Now who wants to stab me?

667
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,969
- What?
- The only way to get the powers out.

668
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:47,763
Come on, I dare you.

669
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:50,474
I double dare you.
I triple dare you. L...

670
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:53,268
Stop, I'll stab her.
Leo, be ready to heal?

671
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,650
- You stabbed her?
- Oh, you would have too.

672
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:01,693
She was pretty obnoxious.

673
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,571
Yeah, demonic powers
on an empty stomach.

674
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:06,990
- Not such a good thing.
- No, it was a great thing.

675
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:09,743
- You saved Wyatt.
- We all did.

676
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,412
So we're 100 percent certain
these were the demons

677
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:14,832
we were looking for all along?

678
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,210
To our nephew,
may he always be safe.

679
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,588
I can't believe it's finally over.

680
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:24,550
Believe it. You just saved the future.

681
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,011
- Mom.
- Yeah, I know.

682
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:40,732
Sigmund, try to relax.
We were successful today.

683
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:42,860
They're off our trail.

684
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,447
Even better, their guard is down,
which makes it that much easier

685
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:50,993
to eliminate the threat.

686
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:52,953
His name is Wyatt.

687
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,746
I'm sorry?

688
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:56,373
What if Phoebe was right?

689
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,293
What if future-Wyatt
wasn't turned evil by a demon?

690
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,503
He's just an innocent baby.

691
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:03,380
What if, in trying to
eliminate a threat,

692
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,299
we are actually creating a monster?

693
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:07,551
That's such a tender age
to be betrayed

694
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:09,720
by those who have
sworn to protect you.

695
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:11,263
What if that's what turns him?

696
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:14,558
It's possible. Anything is possible.
But armed with this future knowledge,

697
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:19,146
we have to try to make sure
that it doesn't happen this time.

698
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:22,524
The only way to be sure
is to stop this now.

699
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:26,862
Sigmund! This child
should never have been born.

700
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,365
He is enormously dangerous.

701
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:33,327
Why am I the only one who seems
to understand that?

702
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:35,704
That's a very good question, sir.

703
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:39,750
And with all due respect, it's why
I can't let you go through with this.

704
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,836
I'm going to tell the sisters the truth.

705
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:10,614
I'm sorry, old friend.

706
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:14,701
But this too is for the greater good.

707
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:21,375
Forgive me.
