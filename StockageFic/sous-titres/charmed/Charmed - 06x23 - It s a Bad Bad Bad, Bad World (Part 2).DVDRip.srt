1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,753
Previously on Charmed:

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,756
For our plan to work,
we need to get the sisters...

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,342
And Leo and Chris out of the way.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,723
It opened up a portal
to another world.

5
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,558
- Like evil?
- Precisely.

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,769
And if you encounter
your counterparts, be careful.

7
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:19,978
They will kill you.

8
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,442
I'll take mine, you take yours.

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,778
- It was Gideon all along.
- And he's still out there.

10
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,947
He wasn't vanquished here,
he wasn't in our world.

11
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,157
The imbalance has caused
a shift in both worlds.

12
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,288
Put him in the playpen.
Don't want him to see.

13
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,124
- But Phoebe...
- Just do it.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,462
Okay, there we go. There you go.

15
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,422
Don't let him out of your sight.

16
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,218
- What's wrong, what's taking so long?
- I don't know.

17
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,637
Damn it, Leo, you should have
just healed her outside.

18
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,807
Right, and risk you getting shot too?
I don't think so.

19
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,769
Okay, so I just sent our evil twins
through the portal, although...

20
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,856
What happened?

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,692
- Thank God.
- Stay with Wyatt.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,569
I got him.

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,364
- You okay?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,450
Just remind me to never park in
Mrs. Noble's driveway again.

25
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,828
Will someone please tell me
what is going on here?

26
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,872
The neighbourhood patrol
shot her point-blank

27
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,540
and nobody so much
as blinked an eye.

28
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,041
What? Why?

29
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,002
Because by getting us all
to the evil world,

30
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,087
Gideon screwed up the balance,
the grand design.

31
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,048
If you ask me, the grand design was
messed up in the first place.

32
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,844
Wait, so are you saying because of
what he did, our world is bad now too?

33
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,263
No, on the contrary, it's good.
Too good.

34
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,682
Where every little infraction
is a capital offence.

35
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,309
And everyone just accepts it.

36
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,061
Oh, so we're starring in a little movie
called Pleasantville?

37
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,315
Okay, how come
we weren't affected?

38
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,193
Because we must have been
crossing over when the shift occurred.

39
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,528
Well, that must mean Gideon's
not affected either.

40
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,363
No, he wouldn't be,
because he's an Elder.

41
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,033
How do we know he's not using
this situation to his advantage?

42
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,619
- To come after Wyatt?
- Because I'm gonna find him first.

43
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,663
No, you can't hurt him, Leo.
Not until he shifts the balance back.

44
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,540
And you know he knows
how to do that.

45
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,378
Oh, my God, we totally forgot about
Piper. We have to get to the hospital.

46
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,964
- Who's gonna watch Wyatt?
- I will.

47
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,384
Look, I didn't come all the way from the
future just to lose him now, all right?

48
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,519
I think we should drive.
I don't wanna risk orbing.

49
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,772
All right,
just watch your speed, okay?

50
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,840
Oh, give me a break.

51
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:39,303
You're lucky.
It could have been worse.

52
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:44,099
Well, well, well,
the new peeping Elder.

53
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:48,562
How the mighty have fallen,
so to speak.

54
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,897
Show yourself.

55
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,482
Only if you agree to a truce.

56
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:56,236
I promise, it is in your best interests.

57
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,113
Why not.

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,950
This particular day
couldn't get much worse.

59
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,161
Actually, it could.

60
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,996
You could die.

61
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:10,751
The world has changed, my friend,
as you've obviously just witnessed.

62
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,505
You're referring to the witches
constantly hunting me.

63
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:20,511
That wouldn't happen to be some of
your doing, now, would it, friend?

64
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,264
Not by intent, but it's why I'm here.

65
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,768
If I'm to shift things back
to the way things were,

66
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,896
to give evil a fighting chance again,

67
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,191
then you and I must work together.

68
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:38,487
Now, why would you wanna
give me a fighting chance?

69
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:43,825
To restore the balance,
the grand design,

70
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,828
as I am honour-bound to do.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,998
Just out of curiosity,

72
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:55,003
how is it this imbalance
happened to occur?

73
00:04:56,588 --> 00:05:01,343
Come on. You can say it.
I know you can.

74
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,765
"I made my move on the boy
and I screwed up."

75
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,809
I took a calculated risk.

76
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,478
You screwed up.

77
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:16,108
And now you wanna hide out
down here with me,

78
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:20,821
and just hope that the boy's aunties
don't know how to find you.

79
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,241
Isn't that about right, friend?

80
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:30,289
Believe me, you don't want this child
growing up any more than I do, Barbas.

81
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,124
His power is too great.

82
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:36,461
He is an enormous threat
to both of us.

83
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,965
I see.

84
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,178
Any shift between good and evil

85
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,764
is supposed to happen
naturally over time.

86
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,475
By intervening,
I've allowed too much good

87
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,644
to corrupt the other world.

88
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:58,817
And the only way to get it back
is for a great evil to corrupt ours.

89
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:02,112
Oh, and you just naturally
thought of me.

90
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,072
I'm very flattered.

91
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:08,785
I have to complete what I started,
for everyone's sake.

92
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,621
Help me.

93
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,790
Distract the sisters.

94
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,253
And I will help you
get your world back.

95
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,053
You won't find Gideon that way.

96
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,515
We've already tried.

97
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,935
What are you doing here?

98
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,521
I'm here to remind you
of your responsibilities.

99
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,564
My responsibilities now
are to protect my son.

100
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,150
How? By taking revenge
on one of our own?

101
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,819
Gideon stopped being one of us
when he went after Wyatt.

102
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,947
Oh, that's not for you to decide.

103
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,033
You're but one voice
in a chorus, Leo.

104
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,619
We can't allow you to take matters
into your own hands.

105
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,247
- Gideon did.
- Yes, and look what's he's wrought.

106
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:57,459
The world is spiralling out of control.
Innocents are being hurt, killed.

107
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:02,047
- All because one Elder acted alone.
- I know what I'm doing.

108
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:05,008
Gideon thought he knew
what he was doing too.

109
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,762
Truth be known, he was not alone
in his thinking.

110
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,723
There are others who share
his fears of Wyatt.

111
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,059
That your union with a Charmed One

112
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,895
might have created too great
a concentration of power.

113
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,857
- Wait, so you're on his side?
- No, of course not.

114
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,819
- What Gideon's done is inexcusable.
- Then let me handle him.

115
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:27,948
Please, Leo, your emotions
are clouding your better judgment.

116
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,994
The fate of the world is more important
than any one child.

117
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,704
Not more important than my son.

118
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:37,040
They're all your sons,
your daughters.

119
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,377
They're who you should be protecting.
That's the greater good.

120
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:46,675
Come, help us find a way to restore
what was while we still can.

121
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,219
I can't.

122
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,513
Not until I stop Gideon.

123
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:01,899
Anti-immunologist to the quarantine.
Anti-immunologist to the quarantine.

124
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,443
You're all done, sir.
All you have to do is pay your fine.

125
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,819
Okay.

126
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:09,364
- You know, I'd really like to, but I can't.
- Over here?

127
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:14,745
Wow, it's just as creepy in here
as it is out there.

128
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,664
Actually, creepier.

129
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,791
Welcome to
San Francisco Memorial,

130
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,418
how can I help, help, help you?

131
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,337
Well, you could take it
down a notch.

132
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,174
She's kidding. She's a kidder.

133
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,635
Just out of curiosity,
what happened here?

134
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,304
- Was it a freeway accident?
- Oh, heavens, no.

135
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,972
It's always like this around here.

136
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,267
- Lawbreakers, you know.
- Right.

137
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,603
- You visiting?
- Yes. Piper Halliwell.

138
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,981
Halliwell, Halliwell.
What was her offence?

139
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,276
Oh, no, no offence.
She's having a baby.

140
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,321
Oh, a baby!
Oh, why didn't you say so?

141
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,115
- Because we were just too excited.
- Oh, of course you are.

142
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,410
There's nothing more exciting
than a baby.

143
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:59,248
Room 1402. But don't dawdle.
Visiting hours are almost over.

144
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,916
You have a wonderful day,
now, okay?

145
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,709
Day?

146
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,088
It's almost 8:00.
It should be dark now.

147
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:09,967
Dark? Why on earth would anyone
say such a depressing thing?

148
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,678
Lmagine the sun going away,
not having sunshine all the time.

149
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:15,514
Anyone who'd want
that should be, well, well, shot.

150
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,728
She's joking.
It's my sister, the jokester.

151
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,480
We're gonna go see
our other sister now.

152
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,399
She's having a baby. Yeah.

153
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,944
Okay, have a good day, everyone.

154
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,663
Oh, there you guys are.
Where have you been?

155
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,249
- Seems normal.
- Come on, come in.

156
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:46,211
- Piper, you okay?
- Of course I'm okay.

157
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,005
I'm having a baby,
for crying out loud.

158
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,007
Jell-O? It's really yummy.

159
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,800
No, thanks.

160
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,093
Excuse me.

161
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,344
How'd you like your dinner?

162
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,764
Are you kidding? The frozen peas
and processed turkey?

163
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,225
It was to die for.

164
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,894
Oh, here, let me give you a hand.

165
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,234
- Piper, that's not funny.
- Oh, that's okay.

166
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,070
- It's my fault it even happened.
- Why is it your fault?

167
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,282
I used my cell phone in the hospital.
Talk about your big no-nos.

168
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:19,411
- Hey, good luck with the little one.
- Thanks.

169
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:22,372
He really should have known better.

170
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,292
Piper, snap out of it.
This is crazy-making.

171
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,336
- What is?
- This. Everything.

172
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,421
You, the hand,
the whole damn world.

173
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,173
It's driving me insane.

174
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,468
Phoebe, you really should not swear.
They will cut your tongue out.

175
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,095
This is ridiculous.

176
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:41,600
Okay, Piper, you have to listen to me.
Wyatt is in danger.

177
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,477
What do you mean?
What kind of danger?

178
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,771
It's Gideon.
He's trying to kill him.

179
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,695
- It's not funny, I'm being serious.
- That's ridiculous.

180
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,114
He's an Elder. He couldn't hurt a fly.

181
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,911
- What's so funny?
- Oh, don't ask.

182
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,498
- Whoopsie, that's not good.
- What's not good? What's going on?

183
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,751
Those darn contractions are a lot
more painful than they should be.

184
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,587
- What does that mean?
- Visiting hours are over. Bye-bye, now.

185
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,507
- No, we're not leaving her.
- Well, I'm sorry, but rules are rules.

186
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,300
Did you wanna keep your legs?

187
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:20,097
- We'll call you.
- Okey-dokey.

188
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,018
Are you sure we should leave?
I'm worried about her.

189
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,688
We have to. We can't wait for Leo.
We have to fix this.

190
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,898
This isn't the world we want
Chris to be born into.

191
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,358
Okay, but how?

192
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,236
Okay? Especially now
that we're down a sister?

193
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,614
Maybe we should have
another little talk with ourselves.

194
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,664
You were right.

195
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,709
Piper's the only one
of the sisters affected.

196
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:53,297
And therefore the only one
that can affect her sisters.

197
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:57,759
She can cast a spell on them,
make them think as she does,

198
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,679
so that they won't be
concerned about me either.

199
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:04,308
And your theory is that I'm
going to make her do this.

200
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,393
How, exactly?

201
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,145
By doing what you do best:

202
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:11,064
Tapping into her fear
of losing her sisters.

203
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,983
I don't know.

204
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,070
She's out in cloud-cuckooland
someplace.

205
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,657
She's in a place where she doesn't
even fear her own affliction.

206
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:25,120
What makes you think
she's gonna fear losing a sister?

207
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,956
Family means everything to Piper.

208
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,042
In any world.

209
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,877
The sooner you hit that nerve,

210
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:36,006
the sooner we both
get what we want.

211
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,599
Anything?

212
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,644
I thought I had him for a second,
but I lost him.

213
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,979
Well, keep looking.
Gideon's bound to surface again.

214
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,649
Well, maybe you should ask
the other Elders for some help.

215
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,526
No.

216
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:57,778
Trouble in paradise?

217
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,614
Let's just say we're not
seeing eye to eye.

218
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:04,743
Well, then, maybe you should,
I don't know, quit.

219
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,664
The girls are gonna need another
whitelighter the moment I'm gone.

220
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,500
That's not why you
want me to quit, Chris.

221
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,710
Okay. Fine, I admit.

222
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:17,714
I'd like to go back to a future where
my parents are still together, all right?

223
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,551
It's just like I said
when I was making the potion...

224
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,178
Potion.

225
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,931
- What about the potion?
- Gideon didn't want it to work, right?

226
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:29,142
But he did want us in this other world,
which means it probably does work,

227
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,853
which means we can get you home.

228
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,897
- No. I'm not going back.
- Chris, you have to.

229
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:38,026
Not until I finish what I came here
to do, and that's to save Wyatt from...

230
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,778
Turning evil.

231
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,864
What?

232
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,365
Well, what I don't understand is,

233
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:46,034
if Gideon always viewed
Wyatt as a threat,

234
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,245
why did he turn him evil in my future?

235
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,789
I don't think he did, intentionally.

236
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:54,126
I think Gideon tried to kill
Wyatt in your future.

237
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,714
Only, just like in this time, he found out
that Wyatt can protect himself.

238
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:03,385
So he probably had to get him away
so he could figure out how to do it.

239
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,929
- You mean kidnap him.
- Imagine being taken away from us

240
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,347
for weeks, maybe even months,

241
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,933
constantly fending off
Gideon's attack.

242
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,937
I had no idea.

243
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,273
We're gonna change
that future, Chris.

244
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,777
For both of your sakes.

245
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,951
The power of four has worked before.

246
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,662
Yeah, but that was when
we were in the same world.

247
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,040
We can't even contact them now.

248
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:37,294
There must have been a way that
Gideon contacted his evil counterpart.

249
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,130
Hey, do you hear an echo?

250
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,686
- I knew it.
- I knew it.

251
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,231
Nice to see you.

252
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,191
So is your world as
messed up as ours?

253
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:00,901
I've never seen everybody
so miserable.

254
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,737
- Every little good thing that happens...
- Gets punished.

255
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,823
Limbs get cut off
for saying "gesundheit."

256
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,158
I never thought I'd say this,

257
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,160
but I would kill for
some daylight right now.

258
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,995
We got plenty of it in our world.

259
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,372
- It sucks.
- It sucks.

260
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:14,790
So, what do you think happened?

261
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,458
I think we did too much
good together

262
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,544
when we were trying to
get Gideon in your world.

263
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,087
My thoughts exactly.

264
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,631
Maybe we need to do some
serious evil on your side

265
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:23,882
to shift the balance back.

266
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,467
- Right.
- The problem is,

267
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:29,388
I don't know if our collective powers
will work with us in different worlds.

268
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,181
Well, we better think of
something fast,

269
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:34,101
because Gideon's still
after Wyatt in both of them.

270
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,478
- The power of three.
- What?

271
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:39,356
If we can cast a spell on
our respective Pipers...

272
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,108
We're back to full power again.

273
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,653
Then bring us to your side
so we could shift the balance back.

274
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,697
And then kick some ass.

275
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,366
I like it.

276
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,453
Security to the prison floor.

277
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,664
Does it hurt when I touch here?

278
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,292
Boy, that smarts.

279
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,461
Well, we might be looking
at a C-section here, Piper.

280
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,006
Might be the only way
to get the baby out safely.

281
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,799
Safely?

282
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,927
Oh, let's get another ultrasound,
shall we? I'll be right back.

283
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,899
It would be so sad if your sisters

284
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,985
weren't here to help you
through all this.

285
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,112
You heard what they said
about Gideon.

286
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,408
Imagine, saying such ugly lies

287
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:34,870
about such a nice person.

288
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,166
Gideon is trying to kill Wyatt,
we have to stop him.

289
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,210
No, no, no, no.

290
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,879
- Stop it. He's an Elder.
- No, Piper, he's evil.

291
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:47,007
No, he's not. Now, shush
before someone hears you.

292
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,220
No, no, no, don't hurt them.
They didn't mean it.

293
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:02,189
You have to help them conform.

294
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,982
Save them from themselves

295
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:08,946
before it's too late
and you lose them forever.

296
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:21,250
Call now the powers blessed be

297
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:27,005
To make my sisters happ... Happy

298
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,927
What are you doing here?
Is Piper okay?

299
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,263
No, but she will be, thanks to us
and our evil twins.

300
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,014
Wait, you saw them? Where?

301
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,308
In Gideon's office.
Talk about your vanity mirrors.

302
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,518
We have a plan.

303
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,937
We're gonna shift the world
back from Gideon

304
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,647
so he can't use it to his advantage.

305
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,775
- How?
- We're gonna use a spell to...

306
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:52,072
- What just happened?
- I don't know.

307
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,324
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah.

308
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,952
Yeah, I've never felt better.

309
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:01,373
Okay, so back to the plan.
You were saying?

310
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,668
Yeah, the plan is just to go
see Piper in the hospital.

311
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,172
- That's a really good plan.
- I know.

312
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,313
No time to dawdle.
There's a baby on the way.

313
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,690
Guys, this is crazy.
You can't leave like this.

314
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:30,235
Well, we can't very well ignore
Chris' birth. We have to celebrate.

315
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,696
I'm the baby.
I give you permission not to.

316
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,865
What, and miss all the excitement?

317
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:38,243
Seeing you for the first time.
Burping you.

318
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,536
Picking out a name.

319
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:40,996
I already have a name.

320
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,748
Oh, gosh, you do, don't you?

321
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:45,792
Well, now would be
the perfect time to change.

322
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,711
How did you get your name?

323
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,254
It doesn't start with a P.

324
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:50,714
It was Leo's father's name.

325
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,343
That is so sweet.

326
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,428
I can't wait to tell Piper.

327
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,889
I'm gonna get her bag.

328
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:02,434
It's in the kitchen, all ready to go.

329
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:05,062
Oh, you are gonna be so cute.

330
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,482
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

331
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:13,779
Okay.

332
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,074
We need to snap them
out of this, fast.

333
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:20,244
Piper must have cast a spell.
She's the only one who could do this.

334
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,996
- Why would she do that?
- She wouldn't.

335
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,083
Unless Gideon wanted her to,

336
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,460
to distract them like before
so he can go after Wyatt.

337
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,754
- All set.
- Let's go.

338
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,757
You guys can't leave yet. Gideon
might be coming for Wyatt any minute.

339
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,425
Oh, is he babysitting?

340
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,011
No, he's trying to kill Wyatt.

341
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,472
Don't tell me you don't remember.

342
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,560
You're laughing. That's great.

343
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,728
Your nephew's almost killed,
and you're laughing.

344
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,439
You're silly. Yes, you are.

345
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,233
Oh, yes, you are.

346
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:54,111
Like an Elder would ever,
ever do that.

347
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,364
Must be the spell. They don't remember
because Gideon doesn't want them to.

348
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,283
A spell? What spell?

349
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,119
Visitors.

350
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,830
Hey, stay with Wyatt.

351
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,584
Wait, stop, stop, stop.
Okay, you cannot open that door.

352
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,836
- What if it's the patrolman?
- That's a good point.

353
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:12,462
I forgot to move my car.

354
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,047
Finally.

355
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,301
Well, I'll just have to take
whatever's coming to me.

356
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:18,802
What?

357
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:24,183
- Hi, ladies. Chris.
- Hi.

358
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,685
We thought you were the patrol guy,
come to shoot Phoebe.

359
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,812
Sorry. Actually, I'm here to get Chris.

360
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,481
I'm afraid I have to take him
into custody for assaulting me.

361
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,816
Dude, I didn't assault you.

362
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,861
- No, but evil Chris did.
- That wasn't me.

363
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,323
- You're still a fugitive anyways.
- Okay, you're not helping, thanks.

364
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:42,910
You know, I'm only giving you this
chance because we used to be friends.

365
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,828
That is so sweet, Darryl.

366
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:49,625
And evil double or no,
someone has to do the time.

367
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,668
Take him away, Darryl.

368
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,631
- So, what, you're just gonna leave?
- Listen, young man,

369
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:59,051
we can do this the easy way
or the hard way. Your choice.

370
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,552
I don't have time for this.

371
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,183
Have a nice day.

372
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:17,152
I was thinking if Gideon did get to
Piper, maybe he left a trail I can follow.

373
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:18,946
Hurry.

374
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,616
If I know Leo, then right around now
he'll be figuring out

375
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,701
that I made Piper cast the spell.

376
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:28,413
No, no, no, correction,
I made her cast the spell, remember?

377
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,624
The point being
he'll go to Piper next

378
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,378
to see if he can't find
any magical clues to find me.

379
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,798
- Find me, you mean.
- Actually, yes.

380
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:41,760
- But then again, that's what we want.
- Oh, really?

381
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,804
With the sisters
sufficiently distracted,

382
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,765
Leo is the last powerful being
in my way.

383
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:49,768
One who you should
easily be able to distract

384
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:52,104
whilst I make my move on Wyatt.

385
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:56,984
I don't know, this all is starting
to sound very interesting,

386
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:02,364
but, you know, it seems to me like I'm
the one doing all the heavy lifting here.

387
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,950
- Have you noticed that?
- Barbas!

388
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,078
While you, you're hiding out
down here,

389
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:12,166
relaxing in my lair,
all safe and sound.

390
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:16,628
What could possibly be wrong
with that picture?

391
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:20,382
Leo is the last impediment,
I promise.

392
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,343
Paralyse him with his greatest fear,
keep him occupied,

393
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,472
and we'll be one step closer
to returning the world to a place

394
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:30,767
where evil at least
has a chance again.

395
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:37,024
You're such a tease.

396
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:50,204
Excuse me, do you know
where the maternity ward is?

397
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:53,290
Are you kidding?
That's everyone's favourite hang-out.

398
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:55,501
- Just go in that elevator and...
- Thanks.

399
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,586
You're welcome.

400
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,380
- Paige.
- Leo.

401
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:03,133
Well, it's about time the nervous
father made an appearance.

402
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:04,801
Where's Phoebe? Is she with Piper?

403
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,971
Of course. We would never leave
Piper alone at a time like this.

404
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,015
Good. I wanna ask her
if she's seen Gideon.

405
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:13,018
Gideon? No, silly,
not with the complication.

406
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,394
Complication?

407
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,814
- Oh, dear, you don't know?
- Know what? Is something wrong?

408
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:21,026
Well, I'm sure the doctors
are gonna find out any minute

409
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:23,403
and everything is gonna be
just peachy.

410
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:27,115
- I gotta go see her.
- No. That's against the hospital rules.

411
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,243
- Screw the rules.
- Okay.

412
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,620
But you're going to get in trouble.

413
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,714
Wyatt?

414
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:49,680
Watch as the thing you fear most
comes to life and the future is lost.

415
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,271
- What?
- What's the matter, Dad?

416
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:58,689
Don't you recognize me?

417
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,816
I'm the Wyatt you're trying to save.

418
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,484
The one from Chris' future.

419
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,783
It'd appear that there is
no way to save him,

420
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,994
that he is lost to evil.

421
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:14,163
Excalibur.

422
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:17,457
And that you are a failure
as a father.

423
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:21,253
This isn't right. You're good.

424
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,546
I'm here to save you.

425
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:24,298
I don't think so.

426
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,236
Hello?

427
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:08,091
Okay. It's time to get you out of here.

428
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,100
Don't make me sacrifice you both.

429
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,373
Dad.

430
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,679
Dad.

431
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,557
Chris.

432
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:59,434
In trying to save one son,

433
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,521
you have lost both sons.

434
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:07,359
- Very, very sad.
- No!

435
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,783
Wyatt. Wyatt.

436
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:16,618
It's for the best, Leo.

437
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:25,878
Chris. Chris.

438
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:39,933
Finally.

439
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:42,352
Now what are you doing?

440
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,398
Would you come on?
Let's get this thing over with.

441
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,650
Not so fast.

442
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:51,445
This will take some thinking.

443
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:55,532
And I'd prefer not to get
stabbed again if I can avoid it.

444
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:57,284
How cute.

445
00:26:57,451 --> 00:27:01,622
The great big Elder is afraid
of the teeny-weeny, itsy-bitsy baby.

446
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,790
Oh, he's much more than that.

447
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,543
Trust me. Cocky, too.

448
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,463
Notice his shield's not even up.

449
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:14,134
His shield is not up
because you pierced it already.

450
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,720
Fools and idiots.

451
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:23,435
Why is it that every time
you want something done right,

452
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:27,105
you gotta do it yourself?

453
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,399
No!

454
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:35,030
Slippery little devil, isn't he?

455
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:37,491
Now look what you've done.

456
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:40,118
Well, you didn't tell me
that he could orb.

457
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:43,705
I didn't know he could.
That's why I wanted to be careful.

458
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:46,375
Although I doubt he's able
to orb out of the underworld.

459
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:49,670
Even he's not that powerful yet.

460
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:54,633
Now, I suppose all of this means
that you've lost your interest

461
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,635
in fixing the world at this moment.

462
00:27:56,802 --> 00:28:00,389
And allow the Charmed Ones
the chance to rescue him? No.

463
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:04,476
The world stays exactly as it is
until Wyatt is eliminated.

464
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:10,399
You and I will have to work
together to find him.

465
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:11,733
Quickly.

466
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,029
Or perhaps we could work together
in order to eliminate him,

467
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:20,617
seeing as how much trouble
you're having by yourself.

468
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,494
Interesting.

469
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:26,248
It could work, especially if you
bless the athame too.

470
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:29,376
But to try,
we need to get him back.

471
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:31,545
Well, then, you track him
with his orbs.

472
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:37,676
I'm going to track him
with his fears.

473
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:45,058
- You have to find Wyatt.
- We're gonna find him together.

474
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,561
It won't work, you've already tried.

475
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:51,315
Gideon's magic did this to me.

476
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:52,900
He's the only one who can stop it.

477
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,737
Just go.

478
00:28:57,696 --> 00:29:00,491
Saving Wyatt saves the future.
You know that.

479
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:02,618
Gideon doesn't know how
to kill Wyatt, remember?

480
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:06,163
- We still have time.
- Only till the trauma turns him.

481
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,333
I'm not gonna choose between
you and Wyatt, Chris. I can't.

482
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:10,959
You don't have to, Dad.

483
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:14,087
Find Gideon...

484
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:15,797
...and you save us both.

485
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:22,638
All right. All right, but I'm not
leaving you alone. I'll be right back.

486
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:24,306
Where are you going?

487
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,642
To get your one of your aunts
to watch over you.

488
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:31,021
Look, you're gonna be fine, okay?
I promise.

489
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:48,121
Okay, Auntie Paige, big smile.

490
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:56,004
Leo, don't you think you
should be more careful?

491
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:59,174
I mean, you don't wanna
bring back the witch trials.

492
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:00,717
Gideon got to Chris.
He's hurt bad.

493
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:05,097
What? Now, why would Gideon
want to hurt Chris?

494
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:08,267
- To get to Wyatt, which he's done.
- Gideon is the paragon of all good.

495
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:09,852
I told you that, remember?

496
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,855
- Smile.
- But he's not good.

497
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:15,315
He's trying to kill my sons.

498
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:17,985
Your nephews. How can that be
good under any circumstances?

499
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:21,071
- Oh, I don't know, but...
- You don't understand. Chris is dying.

500
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:24,950
- What?
- I have to find Gideon,

501
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:28,078
but I can't leave Chris alone.
Somebody has to be with him.

502
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:30,747
Come on. I know, deep down inside,
family matters to you

503
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:35,085
more than this twisted sense
of right and wrong.

504
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:37,337
You love him, I know you do.

505
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:41,008
And that's gotta trump everything,
even this stupid spell that you're under.

506
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:42,426
You have to help me save him.

507
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:44,303
You have to help me
save them both. Please.

508
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:53,020
- What just happened?
- I think we were under a spell.

509
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:54,271
And he took us out of it.

510
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,524
- Okay, come on. Let's go.
- No, we can't all go.

511
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:00,068
Piper's being prepped for surgery.

512
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:03,405
- Surgery? What's the matter?
- They're not saying.

513
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,657
Don't worry, we're not
gonna lose either Chris.

514
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:09,077
I'll go home, you stay here,

515
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,580
and you, you go find Gideon.

516
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:17,419
Chris?

517
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,302
Easy, easy.

518
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,637
We got one of them. Stand by.

519
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,517
- Darryl, what's going on?
- Good day, Miss Matthews.

520
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,894
- Where's Chris?
- Chris?

521
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:35,187
Chris who?

522
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:37,272
Paige, please.

523
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:40,150
We've been waiting here to give you
one last chance to turn him in,

524
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:41,360
for your sake.

525
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,155
Go to hell.

526
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:49,701
Watch your tongue.

527
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,294
He's gotta be hiding
in the underworld.

528
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:02,422
I agree. It's the only place
he can go to avoid being sensed.

529
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:04,800
Which means he must have
both of our Wyatts there too.

530
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,135
Still, it's too vast.
We have to narrow it down.

531
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:11,390
Wait, it is too vast.
For Gideon too, right?

532
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:13,892
- Somebody's gotta be helping him.
- But who?

533
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:16,395
Whoever helped him
get to Piper in the hospital.

534
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:19,565
- I went and tried to pick up a trail.
- But I was overwhelmed with...

535
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:21,191
...hope.
- Fear.

536
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,693
- Barbas.
- Barbas.

537
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,320
- So if we find Barbas...
- We'll find Gideon.

538
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:26,738
For both of our sons.

539
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,055
Damn.

540
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:55,976
Leo. Leo.

541
00:32:57,728 --> 00:33:00,689
Sorry. I was in the underworld,
looking for...

542
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:02,774
What's wrong?

543
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,155
What's going on?
The hell are you doing here?

544
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:10,324
Nothing. We didn't have to.

545
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,452
I'm sorry, Leo.

546
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:21,335
- Chris.
- Hey.

547
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:23,420
Hey, I'm here right now.

548
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:27,299
You can hold on, okay?
Hold on, hold on.

549
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,510
I'm here. You can hold on, okay?

550
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,138
Don't give up, okay?

551
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:34,515
You either.

552
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:41,730
No, no, no, please.

553
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:43,190
No.

554
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:46,360
No, please. No.

555
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:19,518
No! No!

556
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:33,240
Leo, stop it.

557
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:34,992
What are you trying to do, kill us?

558
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,910
This isn't gonna bring him back.

559
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,955
I promised him
I'd get him home safely.

560
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:42,291
I know, but you can still
save his future.

561
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:44,918
And you can still save Wyatt,
we just have to hurry.

562
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:48,463
And you have to focus, okay?

563
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:51,300
Look, you were saying something
about the underworld,

564
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:54,469
about looking for
something there. What?

565
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:56,930
Barbas.

566
00:34:57,514 --> 00:34:59,433
Barbas? What's he got
to do with this?

567
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,727
He's working with Gideon.

568
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,813
That's how I think he got to Piper,

569
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,523
that's how I think he got to me.

570
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:08,984
Gideon teamed up
with a demon for that?

571
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:10,569
No.

572
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:14,281
An act of great evil in our world
restores the balance.

573
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:17,993
That's what I think
he was using Barbas for.

574
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:20,954
So they're working together.

575
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:25,501
That means they must be
in contact with each other, right?

576
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:27,044
So?

577
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:29,755
So that means maybe that's
a way to find Gideon.

578
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:33,008
The next time they try to contact
each other, you can just intercept it.

579
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:39,932
Wyatt?

580
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:44,019
Wyatt, can you hear me? It's Daddy.

581
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:46,230
Wyatt?

582
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:49,233
Wyatt, can you hear me? It's Daddy.

583
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:57,366
Hello, son.

584
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:02,496
So sorry to lure you like this.

585
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:06,416
Barbas, where are you?

586
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,002
Barbas.

587
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,677
It's time.

588
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:19,680
Well, it took you long enough.

589
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:23,267
Your impatience is growing tiresome.

590
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:26,436
I blessed it already.

591
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:27,771
Now it's your turn.

592
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:32,734
Is something wrong?

593
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:37,114
As a matter of fact...

594
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:45,038
...there is.

595
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:53,505
Why?

596
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:56,383
Because you murdered my son.

597
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:03,056
I'll be right back.

598
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:08,979
Leo, please.
You have to understand.

599
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:12,900
I am only doing this
for the greater good, I swear.

600
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:16,612
How is killing a child
ever for the greater good, huh?

601
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,822
And who the hell are you
to decide that?

602
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:26,163
I'm an Elder, so are you.
It's what we do.

603
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:27,456
I'm not one of you anymore.

604
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:29,708
Leo, listen to me.
You know what happens.

605
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:32,794
You know what
Chris came here to stop.

606
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:37,883
Let me finish what I started.

607
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:42,804
Let me save the future
the only way it can be saved.

608
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:46,600
You're the reason the future's
threatened, Gideon. Not Wyatt,

609
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:49,353
- No.
- But because of what you do to him.

610
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:54,274
I'm about to make sure neither one
of you get the chance again. Mirror.

611
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:57,486
- You ready?
- Yeah, but remember,

612
00:37:57,653 --> 00:37:59,571
you can't do anything.
I have to do this alone.

613
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,823
I know.

614
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:05,160
- Do what?
- A great evil.

615
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:22,302
Fade away? What do you mean,
he just faded away?

616
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:24,471
In Leo's arms, after he died.

617
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:28,684
Yeah, maybe he didn't die, I mean,
maybe he was just going back...

618
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:33,021
Oh, God.

619
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:36,400
Poor Leo.

620
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,240
Dr. Roberts, how's Piper?

621
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:45,784
Well, it depends on how
you look at it, I suppose.

622
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:48,537
Me, I like to think she's
moving off to a better place.

623
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:51,039
- What?
- What is that supposed to mean?

624
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:52,833
Well, I think you know what I mean.

625
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,545
She's haemorrhaging.
We can't stop it. It's everywhere.

626
00:38:57,254 --> 00:38:59,506
But let's all try
to think positively, shall we?

627
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:00,799
No, you listen to me.

628
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:04,303
You get your ass back in that room
and you save my sister and her baby,

629
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:05,846
you understand me?

630
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:07,514
Security.

631
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:10,225
- Let's take care of this.
- Locked and loaded.

632
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:12,644
Okay, they shoot people here,
remember?

633
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:15,272
We gotta get Piper out of here.
We gotta get her to Leo.

634
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,274
We can't.
We don't know where Leo is.

635
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:18,859
We can't just do nothing.

636
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:24,406
What's going on?

637
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:40,589
Phoebe, it's night.

638
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:44,510
Everything's back to normal?

639
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:48,805
I'll do everything I can, I promise.

640
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,558
Excuse me.

641
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:56,104
Leo must have done something.

642
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:13,121
You have no idea what you've done.

643
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:21,797
Didn't know you had it in you.

644
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:24,258
Our worlds can never
cross over again.

645
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:26,718
Take care of your family.

646
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:28,512
You too.

647
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:46,697
Hi.

648
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:51,368
I got you. You're safe now.

649
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:53,787
I have you.

650
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:57,749
I have you.

651
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:04,423
- To Triage.
Please report to Triage, stat.

652
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:08,427
He found him.

653
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:11,180
Hey.

654
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:13,015
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

655
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:15,392
He wasn't with Gideon long enough
to do any damage.

656
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:17,060
What happened to Gideon?

657
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:22,399
How's Piper?

658
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:24,818
She's resting comfortably.

659
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:27,362
Is she okay?

660
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:28,614
We stopped the bleeding.

661
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,449
Obviously, we had
to perform a C-section,

662
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:32,242
but I think she's gonna be okay.

663
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,204
And the baby, is he all right?

664
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:38,040
You tell me.

665
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:48,759
Congratulations.
He's perfectly healthy.

666
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:50,010
Really?

667
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:53,639
Oh, look, he's beautiful.

668
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:55,265
Baby Christopher.

669
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:01,230
That's your brother.

670
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:05,234
Looks like we didn't lose him
after all.

671
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:14,368
Can we see Piper?

672
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:18,038
Well, maybe just one of you for now.

673
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:22,125
Go tell her we love her.

674
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:31,510
Where'd that baby go?
That's your brother.
