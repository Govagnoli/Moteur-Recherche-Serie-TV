1
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:05,130
No, wait. The cocktail napkins
were delivered here

2
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,549
for some insane reason, okay?

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:12,221
So be outside in 20 minutes,
I'm gonna do a drive-by, all right?

4
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,557
Please let me have my keys!

5
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,559
They're on the counter.

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,188
Oh, sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

7
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,024
That's okay, I'm just a little frazzled.

8
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,694
I've gotta check on Chris,
and then I gotta get to the store,

9
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,572
and then I gotta go
and pick up Wyatt early

10
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,575
and make cookies
for a Valentine's Day party.

11
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,037
And then I gotta take these to P3.

12
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,627
All of which pales in comparison
to what you're going through.

13
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,170
No, you know, life goes on.

14
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,632
I'm just happy
to have Christy back, I guess.

15
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,884
- But?
- But she hasn't even said anything.

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,803
I mean, I told her
I wanted to call Mom and Dad

17
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,346
and she closed up even more.

18
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,431
Well, you know,
it's only been a couple days.

19
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,767
Yeah, but what if I never
get through to her?

20
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,853
You will. I mean,
you just have to be patient.

21
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,189
She's been through something
none of us can even imagine.

22
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,526
So, I mean, the only thing you can
really do is just be there for her.

23
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,319
And if you need anything,

24
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:13,824
we are just a call
or an orb away, okay?

25
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,497
Knock, knock.

26
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,374
Hey, I brought you some breakfast.

27
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,588
Christy?

28
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,053
Christy?

29
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,187
Christy?

30
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,355
Christy, it's okay, you're safe now.

31
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,648
You're gonna be okay.

32
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,034
They're coming.

33
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,134
Well, I guess we figured they'd try
to get Christy back sooner or later.

34
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,178
Yeah, I just wish it was later
rather than sooner.

35
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,972
Give the girl time to heal.

36
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,600
I just wish we knew who "they" were
and why they're coming.

37
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,269
And why they want her back.

38
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,813
Well, it doesn't matter, because
they won't be getting her back.

39
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,399
That's why we're here, sweetie.
How is she?

40
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,484
Very scared.

41
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:16,488
Well, has she said anything? You
know, who these demons might be,

42
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:17,823
when they're coming?

43
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,117
No, nothing.

44
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,327
Okay, well,
we need to try to come up

45
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,162
with some sort of game plan,
don't you think?

46
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,999
But we don't know anything. We don't
know why they've been keeping her.

47
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,793
Which is why we have to find out
what she knows, get her to open up.

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,628
I just think it's too much
for her right now.

49
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,505
Look, they held her captive
for 15 years,

50
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,383
she must know something,
at least be able to ID them.

51
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,177
I just don't wanna pressure her
right now.

52
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,053
Well, sweetheart,
she's already under pressure

53
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,972
because she knows
that they're coming.

54
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,266
Do you think they're contacting her?

55
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,101
Well, maybe.

56
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,521
Then again, maybe she's got some
sort of telepathic thing going on.

57
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,399
It would actually kind of figure
that she'd have powers, right?

58
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,693
Maybe that can be why
they wanted her in the first place.

59
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,904
And why they want her back.
You have to talk to her.

60
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,156
I just don't think she's ready for that.

61
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,533
Look, if it's coming from you,
she'll be okay.

62
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,914
She's your sister. There's no
stronger bond than that, trust us.

63
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,250
All right, I'll try.

64
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,714
Okay, I'm gonna whip up
a quick potion

65
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,800
and you go to the "Book" and make a list
of all the telepathic demons, okay?

66
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,010
Oh, you're in a hurry.

67
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,180
Yeah, well, I got a new condo
to enjoy.

68
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,100
Lamp!

69
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,982
Excuse me, but I don't think
you recognise my entrance.

70
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,110
Fear not, ladies,
I'm one of the good guys.

71
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,571
The best, actually, so...

72
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:44,743
Oh, yes, the legendary manor,
where generations of Halliwells

73
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,578
have blossomed into witches.

74
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,330
Who are you
and what do you want?

75
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:54,002
Of course. Ladies, I am
Simon Thaddeus Reginald Marx,

76
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:58,924
and I'm here to take
Paige Matthews as my wife.

77
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,228
We've been at this for two days.

78
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:17,109
If you want your suffering to end,
you will tell me who took the witch.

79
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,444
I don't know.

80
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,323
- I swear!
- Come on, you were in on it.

81
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,701
Why else would you
leave your post?

82
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,954
I told you, I was called away.

83
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,082
Please, you've gotta believe me!

84
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,668
Do you think they'll believe you?

85
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,672
They, who could decimate
our entire clan on a whim.

86
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,219
They chose us to watch over her.
To break her down, and in return,

87
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:48,182
we'd share in the ultimate power
for which she is the key.

88
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,809
If we don't get her back,
we're all dead.

89
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,020
I've questioned all of the Scathers.

90
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,647
No one called him away.

91
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,985
Last chance.
Who are you working for?

92
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,445
He may not even know.

93
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:05,073
He may have been tricked,
perhaps telepathically.

94
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,660
The witch has answered
to unseen voices before.

95
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,829
We've seen it.

96
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,664
If so,

97
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,083
he's a liability.

98
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,627
He's been breached.

99
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,838
Gather the witch's things.
We'll find her another way.

100
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,549
We cannot use dark magic.
They may sense it.

101
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,843
They'll know something
has gone wrong, we cannot risk it!

102
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,012
We have to risk it.

103
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,265
We must find out who took the witch
if we are to survive.

104
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,185
<i>I know all about the Charmed Ones.</i>

105
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:38,106
I... I grew up on stories
of the Warren line of witches.

106
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,859
Grams and her many, many lovers.

107
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,654
And of course,
Patricia's tryst with her whitelighter.

108
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,448
Goodness, you're a randy bunch.

109
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,742
Is there some sort of
magical "Enquirer" I've not heard of?

110
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,954
Wow, our families worked together
during the Salem witch trials?

111
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,082
That is so cool.

112
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,085
Well, you know,
I'm just saying, he checks out.

113
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,713
Well, you know,
I am a descendant of the Mighty Marx,

114
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,385
which is a very powerful,
very noble line of witches.

115
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,345
To be honest with you,
I'm a little surprised

116
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:09,972
you don't know who I am, but...

117
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,226
My goodness, you're fetching.

118
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,605
Oh, that's so sweet. Did you?

119
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:23,318
But you're not half-whitelighter,
which is a requisite for my future mate,

120
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,070
so sorry to disappoint you.

121
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,532
- But you, on the other hand, are.
- Did you just say "future mate"?

122
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,493
No, no. That was... That was...
It came out wrong, apologies.

123
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,703
Okay, here's the deal.

124
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,997
We're actually super, super busy,
so it would be fabulous

125
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,790
if you could just orb yourself
off now.

126
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:41,420
I'll ignore that, but, Paige,
I'm not leaving without you.

127
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,339
After all, we are destined to be wed.

128
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,592
Okay, who says?

129
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,304
Well, only 40
of the most powerful oracles

130
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,389
and soothsayers
from around the globe,

131
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,224
plus a wizard or two, so...

132
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,145
When you think about it, Paige,
it makes all the sense in the world.

133
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,397
Bringing our two magical lines
together,

134
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,691
we would be
the ultimate power couple.

135
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,068
Okay, we're not gonna be
bringing our lines

136
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,614
or bringing anything together,
for that matter, okay?

137
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,532
- But why not?
- Because I don't want to!

138
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,534
And because I have a boyfriend.

139
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,703
A boyfriend? I see.

140
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,415
And who is he?
A witch? A whitelighter?

141
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,667
His name is Henry
and he is a parole officer

142
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,419
by trade and he is a mortal.

143
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:26,548
Oh, an immortal, no less.
Very impressive.

144
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:31,595
No, not immortal,
a mortal, as in non-magical.

145
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,642
With all due respect, that makes
absolutely no sense to me at all.

146
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,562
Having a mortal around whilst
you're fighting evil is, well,

147
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,814
let's face it, irresponsible.

148
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,692
Okay, you need to go now.

149
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,736
Unless you wanna stay
and help us vanquish demons.

150
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:48,987
But of course, ma'am.

151
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,491
Having a powerful witch around
like myself can only be an asset.

152
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:56,370
Tell me, how does Harry fare
in a magical battle?

153
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:02,543
Henry, and he fares just fine
in whatever he wants to fare in.

154
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,002
I'll be honest with you,

155
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,339
I'm a little surprised
you're not taking to this.

156
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,842
You know, me?
I mean, imagine, if you will,

157
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,678
the evil we could vanquish
as a couple.

158
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:17,224
We are not now,
nor will we ever be, a couple!

159
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:22,521
Well, that did not go too well.

160
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,107
Piper.

161
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,243
May I be of some assistance?

162
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,454
Bags.

163
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,336
Are you crazy?
What if somebody saw that?

164
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,797
Well, what if somebody were
to see you shopping?

165
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,717
A witch of your standing? No, no.

166
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,844
After all, there are people
for things like that.

167
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:58,056
- Who are you?
- I am Simon Thaddeus

168
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,892
Reginald Marx.

169
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,313
Of the Marx line of witches?

170
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,483
It's a very noble, very... Never mind.

171
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,071
Moving on.
First of all, I'm here to state my case.

172
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,700
Great. Well, I don't have time for that,
because I have to go pick up my son.

173
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,248
Again with the magic.

174
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:28,629
Piper, I'm here to appeal to you,
you being the practical Charmed One.

175
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,424
Now, listen to me: It is my destiny
to marry your sister, Paige.

176
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,093
Oh, for God's sake.

177
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,804
Forty of the most powerful oracles
and soothsayers

178
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,640
from around the globe
have predicted it.

179
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,099
Plus a wizard or two.

180
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,101
Good luck with that.

181
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,525
According to your sister,

182
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,152
a demon could be attacking
at this very moment,

183
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:56,823
and I want you to know that I am
fantastic at vanquishing demons.

184
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,660
Well, that's great,
but we can handle our own demons.

185
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:03,789
You'll see,
it is my fate to be with Paige.

186
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,255
Oh, God.

187
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,800
Oh, God. Oh, God!

188
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:19,763
- I'm so sorry, I wasn't even looking, I...
- That's okay, don't worry about it.

189
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,100
- Greg?
- Piper?

190
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:25,727
Hi.

191
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,438
Oh, my God.

192
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:33,151
Look, Christy, you're safe now.

193
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,279
I promise,
I am going to keep you safe.

194
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:39,241
But I need your help to do that.

195
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:46,123
Do you know who they are,
who's coming?

196
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:50,836
Do you hear them, like voices?

197
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:56,258
Yeah?
That's good, that's really good.

198
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,803
What do they say?
What do they want?

199
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,727
You know, it's okay.

200
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:12,357
You know, we can talk about it later.

201
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,860
Don't worry, it's okay.

202
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,705
I mean,
who does this guy think he is?

203
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:30,292
He just shows up and announces
that we're destined to be together?

204
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,504
Well, according to 40 oracles
and a soothsayer,

205
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,088
your future husband.

206
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,423
That is really not funny.

207
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,550
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,928
How's the list coming?

209
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,931
Well, I have a dozen
that have telepathic powers.

210
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,849
Well, hopefully
Billie can convince Christy

211
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,393
to narrow it down for us a little bit.

212
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,523
Who's here?

213
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,025
Rats, I forgot.

214
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,568
Henry and I have a lunch date.

215
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,738
Oh, you might wanna reschedule
in case a demon attacks.

216
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,199
Oh, look at you,
you sound like Sir Full-of-Himself.

217
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,495
Well, he might not be your Mr. Right,
but he does have a point.

218
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,206
<i>Paige, I don't run away
from a fight, okay?</i>

219
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,625
Come on, I deal with violent,
dangerous criminals every day.

220
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,712
But those violent, dangerous criminals
do not throw fireballs at you.

221
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,423
Well, what about Piper's kids?
I mean, they're here all the time.

222
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,050
They have powers
to defend themselves.

223
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,052
They do?

224
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,429
So please just go?
I will call you in a little bit.

225
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,014
Well, hold it, hold it, hold it.

226
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,891
If I run away every time
a demon attacks,

227
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,561
I'm gonna be running away
all the time, right?

228
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,772
Okay.

229
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,442
Okay, come on, baby.

230
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,112
Oh, hi, sorry. Oh, thanks.

231
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,948
- Go on. Wyatt's really gotta go.
- Okay.

232
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,241
If you could just put those

233
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,034
on the dining-room table,
that'd be great.

234
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,452
- Sure.
- Thanks.

235
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,955
Sweetie,
don't forget to wash your hands!

236
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:53,000
I hear we have demons attacking?

237
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:56,628
- How did you hear that?
- You know, your friend, Simon?

238
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,881
British? Very cocky?

239
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,632
- Who's Simon?
- Nobody.

240
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,219
Okay, I have two seconds
for you to catch me up. Go.

241
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,889
Okay. Christy finally spoke.

242
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,974
Unfortunately,
she said something weird:

243
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,060
- "They're coming. "
- Who's coming? When?

244
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,563
It's okay.
Phoebe and I got this under control.

245
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,648
We didn't tell you because
you've got a crazy day.

246
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:20,277
Crazier than you think.
Guess who I just ran into, literally.

247
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,654
- Whom?
- Greg.

248
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,282
- Greg?
- Fireman Greg.

249
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,118
Oh, he was the hot Greg.

250
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,038
You gonna go out with him?

251
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,373
Oh, God, don't be ridiculous.

252
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,377
Christy, what is it? What's wrong?

253
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,421
- Christy, please, I wanna help you.
- I'm afraid.

254
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,590
I know you're afraid.
Nothing's gonna happen to you,

255
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:43,008
you're in a very safe place.

256
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,761
- You can't stop them.
- Stop who?

257
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,598
- Christy, please.
- You can't stop them from coming.

258
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,267
When? When are they coming?

259
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,771
Now.

260
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:02,152
So how long does it usually take
for demons to attack?

261
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:06,365
Well, it could be any time, really.
You know, it depends.

262
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,700
- On?
- On timing, you know.

263
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,537
Usually the worse it is for us,
the better it is for them.

264
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,121
You know, that kind of thing.
Mustard?

265
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,374
- No, thanks.
- You can still opt out if you want.

266
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,709
Not a chance.

267
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,670
Incoming!

268
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,882
What? What is it?

269
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,133
They're here.

270
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,928
Get down!

271
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,727
Sweetie, why don't you
orb up to your room?

272
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,191
Fireball!

273
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,780
No!

274
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,287
It's okay, I'm all right, I'm okay.

275
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:56,582
Are you okay?

276
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,092
What's going on? What happened?

277
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,761
Ask the firestarter.

278
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,355
Paige...

279
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,107
You know you could
have been killed?

280
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,109
- Paige, I'm okay.
- No, you're not okay.

281
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:26,278
You were hit by a fireball.

282
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,738
Which was actually my fault.

283
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,741
No, it was not your fault.
I'm a grown man, I chose to be here.

284
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,787
Henry,
I really think you should leave.

285
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:37,956
We don't know
if they're coming back.

286
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,374
Paige, I'm not leaving.

287
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,462
I am not having this on my head,
okay? So please? Please.

288
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,339
All right.

289
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,888
I know that was
probably hard for you.

290
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,641
I guess it would have been harder
if I was planning his funeral.

291
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:01,772
Well, looks like Christy has a few
more powers than we realised, huh?

292
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,565
Yeah, maybe more
than even she knew about.

293
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,818
Maybe that's why those demons were
holding her hostage for all those years.

294
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:10,531
Maybe they were trying to co-opt
her powers for themselves.

295
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,824
But I don't think she's that powerful.

296
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,160
I mean, unless they know
something that we don't.

297
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,747
Well, all the more reason for her
to open up so we can find out.

298
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,249
I just think she's too freaked out.

299
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,584
Well, she needs to get
un-freaked out, and fast.

300
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,339
Okay, I'm gonna go drop off Wyatt
with Dad and Chris

301
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:30,092
and get one of the other moms
to take over cookie duties.

302
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,301
Wait, why?

303
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,178
What do you mean, "why"?
Why do you think?

304
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,180
We can handle this, Piper.

305
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,765
- Yeah, but...
- No buts.

306
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,309
Listen, you bake
and spend time with Wyatt

307
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,436
and hopefully we can figure out
who we're up against

308
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,729
before they come back.

309
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,398
Or before Christy
burns down the house.

310
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,740
- Christy.
- I'm sorry.

311
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,909
I didn't mean to do that.

312
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,829
No, it's okay,
you didn't do anything wrong.

313
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:02,207
- Did you know you could do...?
- No.

314
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,627
But they did.

315
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,547
"They"? You mean the demons?

316
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:11,008
Were those the same ones?

317
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,803
Who are they?

318
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,014
I don't know.

319
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,017
- I never knew.
- It's okay.

320
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:23,270
I told you we'd protect you,
and we did.

321
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,440
Look, I am not gonna
let them hurt you anymore.

322
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:27,691
I promise.

323
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:33,071
It's over, don't you see that?

324
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,325
The Charmed Ones
are protecting her now.

325
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:37,910
We still have time.

326
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,038
- They haven't sensed anything yet.
- How do you know?

327
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,581
How do you know
they are not deciding

328
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,208
our punishment as we speak?

329
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,044
Because they would have acted
by now if they had.

330
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:50,255
They're not known for their patience.

331
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,924
We have to get the witch back
somehow.

332
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,342
Impossible.

333
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:54,843
We do not have the power to go up

334
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,179
against the Charmed Ones
and survive.

335
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,264
Still,

336
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:05,604
it would be better to be vanquished
by the witches than by the Triad.

337
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:10,234
That would be a fate worse
than death.

338
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,697
Then perhaps we should escape,
hide from them.

339
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:19,785
They're the most powerful evil
ever known.

340
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,914
They'd find us.

341
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,129
- Prepare the ritual.
- The ritual?

342
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,756
For the Triad?

343
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,551
We cannot tell them we've lost her,
that is suicide.

344
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:36,969
We have no choice.

345
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,596
They're the only ones
who can get the girl back now.

346
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,599
We'll just have to hope
they show us mercy.

347
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:48,647
- Hi.
- Hey.

348
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:49,898
What are you doing here?

349
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:53,902
Hey, I'm sorry just to show up
like this, Piper, but I've got...

350
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,990
You've got a little something there
on your cheek.

351
00:19:58,782 --> 00:19:59,825
Frosting?

352
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:04,329
No, I was just baking cookies
for my son's party.

353
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:06,915
- Anyway...
- Anyway.

354
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,751
There's a guy in my station,
he used to work at a body shop,

355
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,837
and he says he can fix our cars
for next to nothing.

356
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:14,840
- Oh, that's great.
- But there's a catch.

357
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:18,093
You see, he's leaving this afternoon,
his next shift isn't for, like, four days.

358
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,012
But if we get your car
down there right now,

359
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:21,889
he can take care of everything.

360
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,515
Well, I can't go.

361
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:26,685
I've gotta bake a zillion cookies
and drop them off at Wyatt's school...

362
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,645
I smell smoke.

363
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:32,691
Well, you know,
I burned a few cookies.

364
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:40,699
Looks like you burned
more than a few cookies.

365
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,118
Well, you know, kids.

366
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:45,996
Those are the cookies.

367
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,708
All right, you go, I'll watch him.

368
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:52,794
Hey, buddy.

369
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:57,841
Hey, little man, what's up?

370
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,053
Pretty cool truck.

371
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:04,348
Master Wyatt, it's an honour.

372
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,393
Harry.

373
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,938
Now, you must understand
that your kind

374
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:14,566
and our kind
simply can't commingle.

375
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,443
Where did you come from?

376
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,904
There is a reason why mortals
should stick to their own.

377
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:22,574
- Well, actually, there's a few reasons...
- Mortals?

378
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,327
- Simon?
- Darling.

379
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,540
What are you doing here?

380
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,834
I'm just explaining things
to Harry here.

381
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:34,586
If you mean Henry, that is not him.

382
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,173
In fact, I don't know who that is.

383
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,176
I'm Greg. We met once before,
when I was dating Piper.

384
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:44,388
Oh, right, Greg.

385
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:47,599
Okay, excuse us.

386
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:53,021
You need to get out.

387
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,111
- Are you insane?
- Are you?

388
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:03,240
Those were Windsor roses, my dear.
From East Sussex, very rare.

389
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:06,577
We do not practise magic
in front of mortals.

390
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:07,786
Must be very trying.

391
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,123
But I can assure you, Paige,
once we are wed...

392
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:13,458
We are not going to be wed.

393
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:17,796
Not now, not ever. Get out.

394
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,887
You take that one, I got that one.
Let's crash them.

395
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,431
- Come on.
- Hey. How's it going?

396
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:28,724
Not so good.

397
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:32,144
Simon just orbed in
in front of your friend.

398
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:34,479
- Luckily, he didn't see anything.
- Oh, thank God.

399
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,315
Did you find
who that shoe belongs to?

400
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,984
No, we haven't yet,
but we're on top of it,

401
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,861
and it's not your job,
so don't worry about it.

402
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,989
Hey, Piper, if you want my buddy
to fix the car, we better get going.

403
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,909
Oh, gee, that's really great, but...

404
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,036
Come on,
we'll drop off the cookies on the way

405
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:52,080
and Wyatt can play on the firetruck.

406
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:55,334
- We can catch up.
- Yeah, hold that thought.

407
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,128
I don't think that's a good idea.

408
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,964
Actually, I think it's a great idea.

409
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,217
What with Simon orbing in
and out of here willy-nilly,

410
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,676
and demons are trying to attack...

411
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:05,969
No, that's not what I mean.

412
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:08,597
I mean, spending the day
with another man,

413
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:10,349
while Leo's frozen and all.

414
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:12,518
Piper, it's not a date,
he's just a friend of yours.

415
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,144
A friend that I used to sleep with.

416
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,688
Well, don't sleep with him.
Easy solution to that problem.

417
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:19,691
Go have fun.
Remember how to do that?

418
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:34,748
My word, this man is a pig.

419
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:38,710
Who are you?

420
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:42,798
I, sir, am your girlfriend's
future husband.

421
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,222
Nothing.

422
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,057
You got anything yet?

423
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:57,688
Yes, I see my new condo
with me not in it.

424
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,400
- I should just move back here.
- Here's what I'm not understanding.

425
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:04,653
If we've identified them
and know who they are,

426
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,863
why can't we find them?

427
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,156
And the Scather demons
don't even have telepathic powers.

428
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:10,826
Maybe I was right, maybe Christy
does have some power of telepathy

429
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:12,035
and she contacted them.

430
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:15,080
You know, maybe she's suffering
from that Stockholm syndrome thing.

431
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:18,417
Well, possibly, but it doesn't explain
why we can't find the demons.

432
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:21,587
Oh, God, maybe we should
have accepted Simon's help.

433
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,840
Oh, are you still thinking
about the Brit?

434
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,009
No, I'm not thinking about him.

435
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,721
He just may have had a point,
that's all.

436
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:33,932
The age-old question,
to date or not to date a mortal.

437
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,935
I just keep thinking, if that fireball
had been two inches to the left,

438
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:38,979
there would be no Henry to save.

439
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:40,230
Does that make me selfish?

440
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:43,192
Only you can answer that, sweetie.

441
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,069
Right.

442
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,280
Okay, well,
back to the matter at hand.

443
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,991
You realise that once
we summon them,

444
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,994
there is no turning back.

445
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:57,206
They will come.

446
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,249
Proceed.

447
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,806
Why have you summoned us?

448
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:23,732
How could you let her escape?

449
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:25,400
Why did you not summon us
immediately?

450
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,528
My lord, we thought
we could get her back.

451
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,197
You failed us,
just as I predicted you would.

452
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:31,573
We didn't fail you.

453
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,867
For 15 years we held her for you,
and now...

454
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:41,458
We mustn't let our anger
get the best of us.

455
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,627
We can't lose sight
of the bigger picture.

456
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:46,088
There is no bigger picture
without the witch, Asmodeus.

457
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:47,297
She is the key.

458
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:51,260
And without her, we can't possibly
hope to get the power we need.

459
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:53,178
We should decimate
this miserable clan

460
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:54,847
before anything else goes wrong.

461
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,557
No, wait. You don't understand.

462
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,976
- The witch was rescued by her sister.
- So?

463
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:02,145
So they are both under the protection
of the Charmed Ones.

464
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:04,481
- The Charmed Ones?
- That's why we summoned you.

465
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:06,400
We don't have the power
to go up against them.

466
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:09,695
- Neither do we.
- Not yet, we don't.

467
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,157
Not unless we get the witch back.

468
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:16,034
And if we do,

469
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,662
you'd better not lose her again.

470
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,834
Look, just because demons
use their powers to do bad things

471
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,128
doesn't mean all powers are bad.

472
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:28,088
You can use yours for good.

473
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:30,382
Look, you are in
the light now, Christy.

474
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,009
There is good magic all around you.

475
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:35,095
You just have to believe it.
You have to trust it.

476
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:37,389
How?

477
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:41,018
Well, like this.

478
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:51,695
See? It's easy. Just focus on what
you want and you can do it.

479
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,322
All right, why don't you try now?

480
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,366
Come on, don't worry,
you can do it. I'll be right here.

481
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:59,870
Come on. Come on.

482
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:04,249
Now, I want you to focus
really hard on what you want, okay?

483
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:05,959
See it in your mind's eye.

484
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,182
- I did it.
- I told you!

485
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:26,104
Whoa, that's a lot,
maybe I should put that out.

486
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:31,777
<i>You know, it's not easy
having magical powers.</i>

487
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:34,821
But then again,
you will never understand that.

488
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:37,866
Where'd you say you're from,
again?

489
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:41,119
Sussex, with homes in Devonshire,
Manchester, London.

490
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,122
And when...
When Paige and I are wed...

491
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:46,333
Listen, I told you
that's not gonna happen, got that?

492
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,543
Paige is my girl.

493
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,920
Is it really fair of you
to be keeping Paige away

494
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,339
from the magical world
she's destined to be in?

495
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:54,299
I'm not keeping Paige away
from anything.

496
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:55,676
But you are.

497
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:57,427
You see,
it is destiny to combine the Marx

498
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:58,804
and Matthews magical line.

499
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:00,055
Once we are a couple,

500
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:03,934
we will be the most powerful force
of good the world has ever seen.

501
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:07,020
Well, I think Paige and her sisters
are doing fine without you.

502
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:08,772
But I think Paige deserves
so much more,

503
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:10,399
and I can give it to her.

504
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:13,610
I'm getting tired of you insinuating
that I am not good enough for Paige.

505
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:16,864
I'm not insinuating it, I'm saying it.

506
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:21,326
All right, look, pal,
I may be new to this magical world,

507
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:24,913
but I'm not afraid of demons,
and I'm definitely not afraid of you.

508
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:26,623
- Not afraid?
- No.

509
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,833
- Not afraid?
- No.

510
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,794
I tell you what, let's wait until you've
had a fireball thrown at your face

511
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:34,298
and then we'll have a little discussion
about how brave you think you are!

512
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:37,217
Already happened this morning.
I'm still here.

513
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:38,927
And how embarrassing
that must have been.

514
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:41,513
Let me guess,
Paige had to heal you. Correct?

515
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,056
Yeah. So?

516
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:47,019
So it is only a matter of time
before you are beyond healing,

517
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:50,355
leaving poor Paige too devastated
to fight the great fight.

518
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:54,151
- You know what? We're finished here.
- Are you blind, man?

519
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:56,945
Can't you see that you're a liability
in every sense of the word?

520
00:28:57,112 --> 00:29:00,199
And the fear of you being blown up
will make it impossible

521
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,075
for Paige to ever truly
be honest with you.

522
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:05,913
Look, pal, I don't know who you are,
and I don't really care.

523
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,040
You're not getting Paige,
you got that?

524
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:10,042
- Really?
- Yeah.

525
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:13,045
Well, if you won't listen to reason,

526
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:15,714
then I guess there's only
one thing left for us to do.

527
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:17,966
I guess so. What's that?

528
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,514
I challenge you to a duel.

529
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:28,894
Are you sure I can't pay him
something more for this?

530
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,271
No, he's good. Don't worry about it.

531
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:34,066
Well, it doesn't seem right,
especially since it was my fault.

532
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:36,026
It's no big deal, he's a fireman.

533
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:37,903
He likes to help people.

534
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,822
Is that why you became a fireman?

535
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:42,407
I guess. I mean, it sure ain't the pay.

536
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:51,542
You know, I wanted to call you,
stay in touch.

537
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:55,546
But I felt weird after I heard you
and Leo got back together.

538
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,966
Yeah. Of course.

539
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:00,884
Hey, I don't mean to pry or anything,

540
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:04,137
but I couldn't help notice
that he didn't seem to be around.

541
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:06,265
Is everything okay?

542
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,102
Yeah, sure.

543
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,187
You know, it's great.

544
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:14,481
So is he around?

545
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:18,652
Well, Leo's been away.

546
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,863
Away?

547
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,656
Away.

548
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:25,242
Excuse me.

549
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:27,744
- Hello?
- I think you need to come home.

550
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:28,954
<i>What do you mean? Why?</i>

551
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:30,831
Well, we've ID'd the demons
that took Christy,

552
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:32,791
but we can't find them anywhere.

553
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,752
Well, they're low-level,
they shouldn't be that hard to find.

554
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,881
Yeah, we think something is going on,
like maybe they're being protected

555
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,758
by other demons.
More powerful demons.

556
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,635
Like who?

557
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:47,264
- What was that?
- Hurry.

558
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,266
Phoebe?

559
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,685
- Phoebe?
- Is something wrong?

560
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:53,645
Actually, I need my car now.

561
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:56,648
- But it's not finished.
- Oh, that's okay.

562
00:30:57,316 --> 00:31:00,819
Do you think you could watch Wyatt
for me for a little while?

563
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:04,656
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, thanks, bye. I owe you.

564
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:09,745
Help!

565
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,500
Jacket!

566
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:18,837
Oh, my God! Billie, what happened?

567
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:21,590
I cannot believe this,
I cannot believe what just happened.

568
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:23,175
What?

569
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:25,135
Christy just attacked me!

570
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:26,929
What? Where is she?
Where'd she go?

571
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:29,681
She just left
with one of the demons.

572
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:35,771
I don't understand, you guys.
Everything was going so well.

573
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,856
I mean, she was laughing,
we were having fun, and...

574
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,525
Oh, I just don't know
how this happened.

575
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,318
Hang on a second.
Start from the beginning.

576
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:43,028
What were you guys
doing right before?

577
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:45,322
Well, I was showing her
how to control her powers,

578
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:47,950
the same way you guys showed me,
and she was getting it.

579
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,369
- She was really excited.
- And then?

580
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:53,288
And then she started hearing
some voices,

581
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:55,082
voices she started talking to.

582
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:57,793
- What was she saying?
- First, she wanted them to go away.

583
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,711
And then it was something
about being the key,

584
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,755
or that she didn't wanna
be the key or...

585
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,549
Wait a minute, what key?

586
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:05,217
To the ultimate power?

587
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:07,845
Excuse me?

588
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,889
- Oh, no, not another one.
- Yeah, I don't know.

589
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:13,225
Well, that explains
why they took her now.

590
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:14,810
And then the weirdest thing
happened.

591
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:17,938
She just changed.
Her expression got very dark.

592
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:19,481
Then that demon
from before showed up

593
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:21,108
and before I knew it, I was on fire.

594
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:25,946
What?

595
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,323
Well, it's just, if that's true,

596
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,952
the demon that took her
didn't have telepathic powers.

597
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,912
Which means
she had to contact them.

598
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:37,791
That's ridiculous,
why would she do that?

599
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,251
Because they're all she knows.

600
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:43,547
No. No, that's not what happened,
okay? You guys weren't there.

601
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:47,092
Christy and I connected as sisters.

602
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:51,346
So if those demons didn't contact her,
then some other demons did, okay?

603
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:52,973
That's a possibility.

604
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:55,517
So, what are we waiting for?
How do we find her?

605
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:57,603
Well, I guess we could start
by trying to figure out

606
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:59,730
who this Ultimate Power is.

607
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:03,150
And maybe they tie in to how
we're supposed to get Leo back.

608
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:10,949
Henry?

609
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:12,993
<i>Paige,
what do you know about duels?</i>

610
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,455
<i>- Duels, why?
- En garde, sir!</i>

611
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,957
<i>Wait! What are you doing?</i>

612
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,460
I have to go.

613
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:31,094
What the hell?

614
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:32,304
Paige, yes, great.

615
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:34,473
Best for you to see this yourself,
first-hand.

616
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:40,604
Now, I know this might look
a little extreme,

617
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:43,398
but I am determined
to make my point.

618
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,486
- Simon, knock it off!
- But you see, my dear, I can't.

619
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,112
For your sake as well as his,

620
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,406
it's far better
you face the truth now than later.

621
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,784
- Look, for you to be with Harry...
- Henry!

622
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:56,495
Whatever. For you to be with him
instead of me...

623
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:02,459
...would be a terrible mistake.

624
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,387
I got him right where I want him.

625
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:20,102
All right, you pompous son of a bitch,
you think you're the perfect man

626
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:22,020
for Paige just because
you know a little magic?

627
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:24,523
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

628
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,359
- You don't know anything about her.
- On the contrary, sir,

629
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:30,195
I know everything there is to know
about Paige Matthews, thank you.

630
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:31,947
- Where is she ticklish?
- Ticklish?

631
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:34,283
Third toe, left foot.
Right below the neck.

632
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:37,244
Did you know she only salts popcorn
on the right side, never on the left?

633
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:39,496
And every time she watches
"The Wizard of Oz," she cries.

634
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:40,998
Every time, did you know that?

635
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:42,875
No, why would you?
Because you don't even care.

636
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,836
You just want some trophy witch
so you can have a nice power couple.

637
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:47,379
I care about Paige.

638
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:50,424
- I love her.
- And I love him.

639
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:53,594
Paige. Paige, you can't be serious.

640
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,596
Yeah, we're both serious.

641
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:59,224
Beat it, pal.

642
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,602
What he said. Cross the pond.

643
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:07,107
I told you I never run from a fight.

644
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:09,526
- Thank you.
- Sorry, sorry.

645
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:11,278
That's okay. That's okay.

646
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:17,701
Nothing except stuff about all
the other Ultimate Powers we faced.

647
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:20,954
Billie, did Christy say anything else
that might be able to help us?

648
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:25,125
She's calling for me, I can hear her.

649
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:27,920
She wants us to reverse
the "to call a lost witch" spell

650
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,171
so we can come find her.

651
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:33,342
- How does she know about that spell?
- It doesn't matter, we're not going.

652
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:35,594
She doesn't want you guys
to go, just me.

653
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,387
Well, no, it could be a trap.

654
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:39,181
It's not a trap. I trust her.

655
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:41,808
Even though, you know,
she did try to kill you?

656
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,686
I have to. I can't lose her again.

657
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,272
Okay, fine.

658
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:49,233
But if you're not out of there
in five minutes,

659
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:51,276
we're coming in to get you.

660
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:57,699
Christy?

661
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,410
Are you there?

662
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,132
Your sister can't be saved,

663
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:16,301
and neither can you.

664
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,561
Christy, help me, please!

665
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,319
Don't let them make you do this.

666
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:35,946
You have the power
to stop them, use it!

667
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:40,576
Christy, look, we're sisters, okay?

668
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:42,911
They can't come between us,
nobody can.

669
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,621
Hold your fire. No!

670
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:47,958
We don't want to hurt the key.

671
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:51,378
We can combine our powers together
and put an end to this once and for all.

672
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,633
We can do this together. Trust me.

673
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,677
Surround her.

674
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:39,134
- Well?
- It's over.

675
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:59,696
So why did you want to come here?

676
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:02,616
I don't know, it's just kind of...

677
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:04,284
It's, like, our place now, right?

678
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:06,328
I mean, ever since you told me
that you were...

679
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:07,746
A witch?

680
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:09,915
It's okay, it's not a bad word,
you know.

681
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:13,877
Oh, no. No, not at all.

682
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,426
- Henry, are you okay?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, great.

683
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:24,179
Top of the world. Literally, right?

684
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:27,558
- Do you want me to heal that for you?
- No.

685
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:30,018
No, I like it.
It's like a battle scar, right?

686
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:32,938
It says I fought for my girl and I won.

687
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,109
Yes, you certainly did.

688
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:43,157
I mean, I faced demons and fireballs,
magical suitors, orbing.

689
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:46,827
I mean,
I think I passed the test, right?

690
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,371
What test?

691
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,083
You love me, don't you?

692
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:55,210
Yes, I love you.

693
00:38:58,213 --> 00:38:59,256
Because...

694
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:09,808
Paige,

695
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:11,143
will you marry me?

696
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:14,188
Yes.

697
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:38,879
Hello!

698
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:42,883
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi. Looks like somebody had fun.

699
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,178
- Can you say thank you?
- Thank you.

700
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:49,681
- We gotta get it back here, kiddo.
- There you go.

701
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:53,352
There you go.
You're welcome, buddy. Anytime.

702
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,064
Hey, why don't you go play
and I'll be right there, okay?

703
00:39:58,774 --> 00:40:00,859
He's a great kid.

704
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,071
Thank you for everything.

705
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:05,572
Oh, it was my pleasure.

706
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:15,499
I'm sorry.

707
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:18,961
No, no, it's okay.
I mean, no, it's not okay.

708
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:20,504
It's definitely not okay.

709
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:22,256
I just thought, you know,
with Leo gone...

710
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:24,550
No, I mean, he's not gone.

711
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:28,720
I didn't say he was gone, he's just...
You know, he's away.

712
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:31,139
Okay.

713
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:34,351
Listen, Greg, you're a great guy,
really, and if, you know,

714
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:37,062
the situation was different...

715
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:41,358
But Leo is coming back.

716
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:46,613
I understand.

717
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:52,077
Well, it was really great
to see you again, Piper.

718
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,455
You too.

719
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:06,466
What am I wearing?

720
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:10,179
Oh, that's a John Stamos T-shirt.
You were totally obsessed.

721
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:11,513
I was not.

722
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,558
<i>Yes, you wanted to marry
Mr. Full House.</i>

723
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:16,935
Well, you wanted to marry Pee-wee.

724
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:19,146
No, I didn't.

725
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:23,192
I'm sorry about attacking you.

726
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:25,110
That wasn't me.

727
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:27,404
I was being controlled.
I would never hurt you.

728
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:30,991
Oh, stop, I know. I know.

729
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:34,912
Is it really over? I mean, for good?

730
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:38,332
I'm not gonna let anyone
take you away ever again.

731
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:39,625
I promise.

732
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,674
Phoebe!

733
00:41:49,134 --> 00:41:51,553
- You scared me.
- What are you doing?

734
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:53,430
What does it look like I'm doing?

735
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:56,934
I'm eavesdropping. I don't get to do
that anymore now that I moved out.

736
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,353
Well, stop it!

737
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:02,439
Spoilsport. What's wrong with you?

738
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:06,151
- Your fireman?
- No, thank you.

739
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:07,653
Christy.

740
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,239
Oh, well, don't worry about her,
she's doing fine.

741
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:11,448
That's not what I mean.

742
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:13,742
She's the key, and whatever
that means, it can't be good.

743
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:15,828
Well, maybe it is,
maybe she's here to help us fight

744
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:18,580
whatever comes next, you know.
Maybe they both are.

745
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:20,833
Well, I guess we're just
gonna have to wait and see.

746
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:27,548
She's in position.

747
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:31,593
We're almost there.
