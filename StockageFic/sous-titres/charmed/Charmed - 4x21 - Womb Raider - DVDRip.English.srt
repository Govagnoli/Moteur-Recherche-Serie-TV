1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,348
This isn't happening.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,272
- This can't be happening.
- What's going on?

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,908
Ruptured placenta, possible prolapsed
cord, she's 5 centimetres.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,071
Let's tell O.R. to get set up
for a crash C-section.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,229
- You got it.
- No wait!

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,311
- I'm only two months pregnant.
- She's full-term.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,550
No, you're wrong.
Where are my sisters?

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,149
I need my sisters.
Did you call them?

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,157
- There was no time.
- We're less than a minute

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,515
from skin to baby. Scalpel.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,359
Uterine incision.
I need another stretch.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,112
There's nothing to be afraid of.

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,316
I'm afraid of what's inside me.

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,391
I can see the baby.

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,270
Oh, God. Please let it be normal.
Please, please, please let it be normal.

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,558
Shoulders. And he is out.

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,917
Would you like to see your new boy?

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,191
He's beautiful.

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,749
He is beautiful.

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,151
Here you go.

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,555
I see her!
Don't let her take my baby!

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,437
Don't let her take my baby!
Don't let her take my baby!

23
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,870
So he asked me out again last night,
but he was so quiet during dinner

24
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,476
that, I swear, I could hear
his stomach digesting.

25
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,791
I always preferred quiet men,
they make good listeners.

26
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,552
What's that, dear?

27
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,796
Oh, hi, sweetie. Come, sit, eat.

28
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,439
Oh, no.

29
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,397
I can't, that smell...

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,828
Smells good.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,560
- Morning sickness, Leo.
- Morning, noon and night.

32
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,597
It's more like
around-the-clock sickness.

33
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,159
Did you get a good night's sleep?

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,914
- The nightmare came back.
- With the Seer?

35
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,276
She wants my baby. I know it.

36
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,718
I'm afraid that she's gonna
summon me to her at any moment.

37
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,997
Well, she could only get to you
when you chose evil. You're safe now.

38
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,789
I swear to you, the Seer
will never lay a finger on your baby.

39
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,393
She'll have to get through us first.

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,397
Thanks, guys.

41
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,792
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you know,

42
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,473
pain comes in waves.

43
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,518
Honey, you lost your husband.
It's okay to be very upset.

44
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,238
No, I can't.

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,992
I have to stay strong for the baby.

46
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,195
He's all I have left of Cole.

47
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,478
I'm gonna go check
the Book of Shadows.

48
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,870
There might be some
magical protection against the Seer.

49
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,915
Missy Paige,
you need to go to work.

50
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,589
Well, I'll be late. Phoebe doesn't need
to be stressed while she's pregnant.

51
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,554
Paige, wait.

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,034
Go ahead, say it.

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,474
Say what?

54
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,677
Something that I know, on some level,
you've been dying to say to me.

55
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,955
- There's nothing.
- Come on.

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,959
You knew Cole was evil
the whole time

57
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,553
when everyone thought
you were crazy.

58
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,996
And thanks to you, we vanquished
The Source and gave Cole peace.

59
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,590
So go ahead, say it.
Say, "l told you so."

60
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,315
I will not. It's not my style.

61
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,593
I was so unfair to you
for the last few weeks,

62
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,036
when you were right, and I just--
I want to clear the air right now.

63
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,393
You're really sweet,
and I appreciate the gesture,

64
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,278
but everything is totally fine.

65
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,430
- Another hot flash?
- It's when I move too fast.

66
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,997
Phoebe, that's not really a typical
pregnancy symptom, I don't think.

67
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,549
Maybe it's time
we get that baby checked out.

68
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,711
I just haven't had
a chance to make--

69
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,632
A doctor's appointment?

70
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,916
Well, I have one. It's yours.

71
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,435
Aren't we supposed to find out
about the fertility tests?

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,113
Yeah, but Phoebe needs
that appointment

73
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,793
more than we do right now.

74
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,520
How can I go to the doctor when
I have a demonically challenged baby?

75
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,399
Who knows what effects the Seer's
tonics had on the little guy.

76
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,154
This is my point exactly.
If it'll make you feel better,

77
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,790
I'll go with you so I can put
the freeze on if anything goes wrong.

78
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,433
You're going.

79
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,192
Into the stirrups for you.

80
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,996
Dane, son of Goath.

81
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,910
May the world's evil flow
through your soul tonight

82
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,913
and grant you eternal darkness.

83
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,192
Are you prepared to take the power
and position of The Source

84
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,430
before these leaders
of the underworld?

85
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,874
I am.

86
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,629
Stop the coronation.

87
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,952
Seer, I didn't see your name
on the guest list.

88
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,510
Always a rare privilege,
but not the best timing.

89
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,591
- What brings you here?
- A vision.

90
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,233
I saw The Source's true heir
leading the underworld.

91
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,594
If that was your vision,
you need glasses.

92
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,433
The Source's heir lives
in the belly of a witch.

93
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,635
He's right.

94
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,075
The underworld cannot wait months
for a baby to be born,

95
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,151
then years for it to grow up.

96
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,436
It needs leadership now.

97
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,797
In my vision, I saw The Source's son
taking immediate power.

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,995
How can an unborn child
lead the underworld?

99
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,197
With my help, he can.

100
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,712
What do you need
from this council?

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,714
A chance to prove my vision true.

102
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,075
She has no right to ask this.

103
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,356
I was chosen by these leaders!

104
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,830
But you have no direct lineage
to The Source, by blood or by magic.

105
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,838
You have until tonight
to bring us The Source's heir...

106
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,676
...or the throne belongs to Dane.

107
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,392
Your hormone levels
are unusually high

108
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,028
for a mother in her eighth week.

109
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,237
Have you seen a doctor since
you found out you were pregnant?

110
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,119
I was under the care of a seer.

111
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,638
It's kind of like a New Age doctor.

112
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,318
Well, you really should have seen
a doctor before today, a real doctor.

113
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,836
Do you think that there could possibly
be something wrong with my baby?

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,560
Well, let's just take a peek, shall we?
Why don't you lie back,

115
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,832
and I'm gonna do an ultrasound.

116
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,152
Now, this gel's a little bit cold.

117
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,517
What? What's wrong?

118
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,954
Hot flash.

119
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,591
- A very, very, hot, hot, hot flash!
- Not a good sign.

120
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,796
Yeah, she's been getting
those a lot lately.

121
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,872
No, not like this one.
I mean, it felt like my head

122
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,270
was on fire, for real.

123
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,670
Well, let's just have a look, okay?

124
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,508
Well, there. See?

125
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,158
There's the little--

126
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,710
- Here you go. Here.
- What happened?

127
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,314
That's a good question.

128
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,118
What happened?

129
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,319
It's about time. My head was on fire
like a tiki torch a few seconds ago.

130
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,674
Do not change the subject.

131
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,798
Did your baby just electrocute
the nice doctor man?

132
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,711
Yeah. I think so.

133
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,713
But he was just protecting himself
because that gel was really cold.

134
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,598
Protecting himself? Unborn babies

135
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,558
don't perform magic tricks
in the first trimester, Phoebe.

136
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,314
- What is going on?
- I don't know, but don't panic, okay?

137
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,040
We'll wrap up here,
and we'll go home and panic.

138
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,551
It says here the Seer
has served multiple Sources.

139
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,837
Looks like she's been around
for thousands of years.

140
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,918
- What's going on?
- My baby did magic.

141
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,472
- And almost killed my doctor.
- It was self-defence.

142
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,952
Well, I guess that's what you get when
you breed with The Source of All Evil.

143
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,835
Okay, can we not say "breed"?
You know, I'm not a horse.

144
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,031
And Cole wasn't all evil,
he was part good.

145
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,670
And I'm all good, so this baby
has a lot of good in him.

146
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,798
What if there's not?

147
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,269
Then there will be.

148
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,716
My love was able to save Cole.
It'll save our son too.

149
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,435
- Let's hope so.
- No, we'll make it so.

150
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,160
Okay? So, what did you find out
about the Seer?

151
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,912
Well, she's immune
to spells and charms,

152
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,992
but the Book does classify her
as an upper-level demon.

153
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,469
So we can make
a vanquishing potion.

154
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,193
Not without a tissue sample.

155
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,356
Actually, the Seer mixed her own blood
into my prenatal tonic.

156
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,438
- Nasty.
- Yeah.

157
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,875
Cole kept some extra bottles
in the safe at the penthouse.

158
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,232
You think you're ready to go
to the penthouse?

159
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,508
You haven't been there, you know,
since he died.

160
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,831
I don't think I'll ever be ready,

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,639
but I can't keep borrowing
your clothes.

162
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,639
Okay, let's go.

163
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,631
Wait, don't you have to work?

164
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,268
I'll take the afternoon off.
Who needs vacation time?

165
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,954
- Paige, you can't keep--
- Yes, I can.

166
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,031
Thank you.

167
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,599
Bitch!

168
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,753
What the hell was that for?

169
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,908
I don't know. You'd have to ask him.

170
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,629
Okay. Why did your mommy
push Paige out the window?

171
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,994
No, it's not like that.

172
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,631
It's just-- He took over
for a split second. I had no control.

173
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,357
But why me? I have nothing
against that little f--

174
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,030
- Foetus.
- I'm sure he's sorry.

175
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,676
Aren't you sorry?

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,958
Kids at this age,
they don't know any better, you know?

177
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,076
Okay, I think I'd better go
check with the Elders,

178
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,071
see what they know about this baby.

179
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,439
Whatever it is, I'm sure
it has something to do with the Seer.

180
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,670
Let's go get that blood.

181
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,553
What was that out there,
flying practice?

182
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,836
Baby shoved me out the window.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,070
Wait. Hold on a second.
I left four messages here.

184
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,549
Has anybody in this house
learned the magic of a telephone?

185
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,472
Darryl, it's been a very rough week.

186
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,710
Right. Phoebe,
how are you holding up?

187
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,269
It depends on what part
of the day you ask me.

188
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,557
Look, I know you've got
a lot to deal with already,

189
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,109
but there's business
I don't think can be put off any longer.

190
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,554
I'm sure it's pressing,

191
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,870
but not as pressing as the demon
that's after Phoebe.

192
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,314
Don't count on it.

193
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,597
Cole worked at a high-profile law firm.
Right now you three are the only ones

194
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,034
who know he's dead.

195
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,953
Can this wait? We really need
to get to the penthouse.

196
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,749
Good, because that's where
I need you to handle this business.

197
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,628
It has to look like Cole left in a hurry,
that means packing up all his stuff

198
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,439
and personal belongings.

199
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,594
You okay?

200
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,149
Yeah, I'm fine.

201
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,550
I'm sorry, so why do you want me
to pack up his stuff?

202
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,235
I made an appointment with you
at Missing Persons today.

203
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,960
Wait, you want Phoebe
to report Cole as missing?

204
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,792
She has to,
otherwise somebody else will,

205
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,554
and she'll become the prime suspect
in his disappearance.

206
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,234
So you want me to pack up his stuff
so it looks like he left me.

207
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,799
That's right.

208
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,315
We cannot give the police
any reason to suspect foul play.

209
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,356
I mean, technically,
you three did kill him.

210
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,558
- What is that?
- Well, that's where we, you know...

211
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,360
This place looks like a crime scene.

212
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,436
Is there anything you can do?

213
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,795
Let the object of objection
Become but a dream

214
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,871
As I cause the seen to be unseen

215
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,957
Thanks.

216
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,759
I just wish I could make the rest
of your pain go away that easily.

217
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,592
So do l.

218
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,512
You murdering witch!

219
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,519
Phoeb--

220
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,558
- The baby made me do it.
- Know what, now we split up.

221
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,711
You two go pack,

222
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,393
we'll find the Seer's tonic.

223
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,836
Okay. Where is this baby
that everybody keeps talking about?

224
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,993
I mean, is it an invisible baby?
Am I gonna step on it?

225
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,353
No, Darryl, it's a little bit
more complicated than that.

226
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,069
Am I the only one who's worried about
that thing growing inside of her?

227
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,071
No.

228
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,233
But right now the Seer
is our first priority.

229
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,550
I think she said it's behind
this painting over here.

230
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,880
Okay, so now what?
She doesn't know the combination.

231
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,473
We don't need it.

232
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,392
Safe door.

233
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,113
If financial disaster ever strikes,
you'll find I come in handy.

234
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,671
There's nothing in here.

235
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,273
- No tonic?
- No.

236
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,069
But there's this.

237
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,715
It's Cole's handwriting.

238
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,354
- Cole the human or Cole The Source?
- I don't know.

239
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,431
That's for Phoebe to find out.

240
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,476
Cole gave me this the day
he found out I was pregnant.

241
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,110
Look, I'll start packing
his stuff up, okay?

242
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,157
And you pull
your own things together.

243
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,508
Piper! Paige!

244
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,750
I've been waiting for you.

245
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,956
Get away from me!
You can't have him!

246
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,232
I only want what's mine!

247
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,311
I'm losing her!

248
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,356
Let go of me!

249
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,390
Here's your tissue sample.

250
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,471
Okay, I'm gonna
bring this to Phoebe,

251
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,428
and you stay here. I don't want you
provoking her baby anymore.

252
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,559
- Provoking him? Like it's my fault?
- Oh, you know what I mean.

253
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,197
What are you doing?

254
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,670
I'm playing Mozart for the baby
to bring out his peaceful nature.

255
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,839
Studies show that babies can hear
and remember songs from the womb.

256
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,673
That's lovely.
How about you eat something,

257
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,195
since you haven't had
anything to eat all day.

258
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,352
- No, I've been nauseous all day.
- You've been a little fresh all day.

259
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,949
I'm thinking about trying acupuncture.
I hear that helps.

260
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,992
Phoebe, don't!

261
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,234
I'm gonna puke.

262
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,237
Maybe your baby
would prefer to listen to Ozzy.

263
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,112
The Elders believe the Seer's making
a sudden play for The Source's throne.

264
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,759
But she needs Phoebe's baby
to do it.

265
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,871
The Seer wants to be The Source?

266
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,156
What could that possibly
have to do with my baby?

267
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,918
He's not due
for another seven months.

268
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,753
It doesn't matter, because next time
we will be ready for her.

269
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,314
- Next time?
- Yes.

270
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,670
The Seer tried to steal Phoebe
from the penthouse.

271
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,351
How's that potion coming?

272
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,715
It's done. It just needs
to cool a little bit.

273
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,950
That baby needs a serious time-out.

274
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,111
Go, go, go into the kitchen.

275
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,271
So much for the vanquishing potion.

276
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,192
How come your baby
only attacks me?

277
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,316
I don't know, Paige.
He must resent you.

278
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,152
You know,
you never really liked his father.

279
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,839
With good reason.

280
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,673
Maybe you resent me, and the baby's
just modelling after Mom.

281
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,989
Paige, how can you say that?

282
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,549
All right, enough. The two of you
will not address each other.

283
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,271
You'll not set foot into the same room
until further notice, got it?

284
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,432
You, you got enough ear left
to make another batch of that potion?

285
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,073
- Yes.
- Then do it.

286
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,551
You, you're gonna hit
the Book of Shadows,

287
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,075
and you'll figure out a way
to control Chucky there.

288
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,313
I can't. I told Morris I'd meet him
at Missing Persons in a half an hour.

289
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,275
I would strongly advise
against that. Your baby--

290
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,556
Is fine, just as long as
he doesn't feel threatened

291
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,837
and doesn't meet anyone
with unresolved issues with his father!

292
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,316
I heard that!

293
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,030
Phoebe, how can you say that? How
can you risk going out in public with--?

294
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,474
In your condition.

295
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,639
Because if I don't report
Cole missing, someone will.

296
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,394
And the police
will be knocking on our door.

297
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,791
Besides, Morris put himself
on the line. I can't let him down.

298
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,838
All right, but Leo is going with you,
in case of any trouble.

299
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,911
And I will hit the Book
and figure out

300
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,356
how to deal with demonic foetuses.

301
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,078
I have an offer for you.

302
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,277
Nobody comes down
The Source's dungeon

303
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,718
unless they are dead,
damned or desperate.

304
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,313
Which are you?

305
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,833
Desperate.

306
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,718
I need your power.

307
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,758
I have a power?

308
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,040
Yes, I almost forgot.

309
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,589
I haven't used it in centuries.

310
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,118
I have been sentenced to spend
eternity alone in this cage.

311
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,796
It's a fine cage.

312
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,191
The Source had it forged
from unbreakable magic.

313
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,078
Nothing can escape it.

314
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,959
Yes, I know.
It was some of my best work.

315
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,793
That's right, I built your prison,

316
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,918
and my magic, alone,
has the power to free you.

317
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,117
- The Source would never allow it.
- The Source is dead.

318
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,156
I can give you freedom and a chance
to earn favour with the new Source

319
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,276
in exchange for your help.

320
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,839
What kind of help?

321
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,668
I need you to do what every demon
before you has failed to do, even me.

322
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,559
Capture and contain
a Charmed One.

323
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,871
- A charmed what?
- A powerful witch.

324
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,190
I need you to bring her down
to the underworld.

325
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,396
It is the only way
that my magic can work.

326
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,755
That shouldn't be hard for you,
a demon who has swallowed worlds.

327
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,911
Interested?

328
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,356
Get me out.

329
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,354
Remember, my magic
put you in this cage.

330
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,910
Betray me, and you'll go right back.

331
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,070
Please be good, and I promise
I'll eat a huge tri-tip tonight.

332
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,873
You're gonna meet lnspector Miles.
He's trained to spot a liar.

333
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,873
So just answer his questions
as honestly as you can, okay?

334
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,553
Morris tells me that you think
your husband might have left town?

335
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,991
I don't know what to think.

336
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,354
Last Wednesday,

337
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,153
we had a huge battle,
and he just never came back.

338
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,548
Did he leave anything?

339
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,270
Nothing, I checked
the penthouse myself.

340
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,874
Clothing, personal belongings, gone.

341
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,110
- What was the fight about?
- My sisters.

342
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,192
I have two sisters, and they
didn't approve of me marrying Cole.

343
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,590
- Why not?
- They're just different.

344
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,239
Oil and water, you know.

345
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,231
- Fire and ice, heaven and--
- Hell.

346
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,354
Bingo.

347
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,358
So you'd say that your husband
has a dark side, then?

348
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,558
Yes.

349
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,751
Has he ever hurt you?

350
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,555
- You okay?
- Here, let me help.

351
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,234
You stop that right now.

352
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,111
Inspector, I know it doesn't seem
like my husband's a great guy,

353
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,880
but I would advise you not to say
anything negative about him now.

354
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,837
Listen, ma'am,
I gotta call them as I see them.

355
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,315
You turn up pregnant,
and he takes off.

356
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,118
Your husband fits
the classic profile of a deadbeat dad.

357
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,829
- Make it go out.
- I can't make it go out!

358
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,036
Phoebe? I mean, fire!

359
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,191
Move away, move away, move away.

360
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,674
- Why are you doing this to me?
- It's not my fault.

361
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,389
It's just the baby doesn't like
when anybody talks bad about Cole.

362
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,078
- What's wrong?
- My stomach.

363
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,800
It's like something is tearing.

364
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,712
Come on, let's get you out of here.

365
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,631
Yeah, I'm okay.

366
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,236
Yeah, I'm sure.

367
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,479
I'll call back later to schedule
that appointment.

368
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,758
Okay, thanks.

369
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,793
You are just in time.
One bottle of Seer-vanquishing potion.

370
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,589
What about you? Anything in the Book
about how to control demon spawn?

371
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,512
I thought about binding his powers,

372
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,750
but then that would leave
Phoebe without hers.

373
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,990
Yeah, well, you might want
to keep that option open.

374
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,833
There's something
seriously wrong with that baby.

375
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,355
Yeah, I know. But it doesn't matter.

376
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,034
He's part of us, part of our family.

377
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,679
And who knows, he may be
the only baby in the Halliwell family.

378
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,598
Okay...

379
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,757
...what's going on? Spill.

380
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,117
That was Dr. Harris on the phone.

381
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,351
I got the results
from my fertility tests.

382
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,113
And?

383
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,235
There are some problems.

384
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,955
He said something about...

385
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,033
...scarring or scar tissue.

386
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,074
Something
about blunt-trauma injury.

387
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,395
Oh, honey.

388
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,116
He asked me if I had suffered
any serious blows to the abdomen.

389
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,831
He seems to think

390
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,150
it would be difficult...

391
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,875
...if not impossible,
for me to conceive.

392
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,273
- I'm so sorry.
- This is-- It's weird.

393
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,909
Because when I went to the future,
I met that little girl.

394
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,072
I saw my little girl.

395
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,433
And I saw what she...

396
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,355
...Iooked like
and what she sounded like.

397
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,748
The sound of her laugh.

398
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,318
I just...

399
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,910
I can't imagine not knowing her.

400
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,711
You still might.

401
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,759
I might not.

402
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,838
I just...

403
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,674
I don't know what to tell Leo.

404
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,598
He's so excited about having a baby.

405
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,555
- You should have seen him.
- Piper!

406
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,874
She's getting worse.

407
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,315
- Can't you do something?
- I tried to heal her, I can't.

408
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,630
Stand back, stand back!

409
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,239
You stay out of her sight
for your own safety. Go.

410
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,595
Make it stop! Make it stop!

411
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,876
Leo, go get some ice water
or something.

412
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,795
It's okay. It's okay.
Just try to breathe through it.

413
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,871
Breathe.

414
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,878
Breathe.

415
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,118
Piper, look out!

416
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,993
- Get up. Get up. Come on.
- Whatever you do, don't touch him.

417
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,873
You can't run from me.

418
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,792
I'll always find you.

419
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,355
Phoebe, I'll orb you out of here.

420
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,511
It wasn't me.

421
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,309
It was the baby.
I couldn't control him.

422
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,794
- Did you sense her?
- No.

423
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,190
If she's in the underworld,
I can't get a read on her.

424
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,838
If anything happens to Paige,
I will never forgive myself.

425
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,149
- Anything on that demon?
- I think so. Come look.

426
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,275
"Oral tradition tells of a giant
whose body served

427
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,670
as a portal to other dimensions.

428
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,832
Because he was imprisoned
centuries ago,

429
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,275
nobody knows
what this demon's name is

430
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,795
- or if he even exists."
- It gets worse.

431
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,913
"There's no known vanquish for him.
The Source was so threatened,

432
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,992
he condemned the giant
to spend eternity in a cage."

433
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,310
The Seer must have set him free
to capture Phoebe.

434
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,671
But he got Paige instead,
thanks to me.

435
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,598
No, that had nothing to do with you.

436
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,435
- How are you feeling?
- Better. I think the baby's resting.

437
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,115
It's when he's active
and using magic that it hurts the most.

438
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,749
Well, here, have some iced tea.
It will cool you off.

439
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,152
What the hell?
I can't even enjoy some iced tea?

440
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,513
It wasn't iced tea.

441
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,238
It was a binding potion.

442
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,597
Paige suggested it
to help control the baby.

443
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,194
I couldn't tell you, because if I did,
he would've stopped you--

444
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,399
He stopped me anyway.
He knows things that I don't know.

445
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,319
He's trying to take control of me.

446
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,074
You can't let that happen.
If he takes control, he'll never let go.

447
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,832
I know.

448
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,432
It's not me.

449
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,556
And it's not Cole.

450
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,433
It's The Source.

451
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,959
So, what, are you into some kind
of dominatrix thing now?

452
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,588
You are not the sister I expected,

453
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,273
but you will do.

454
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,755
Sorry I can't stick around,

455
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,751
but you're creeping me out anyway.

456
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,435
You're not going anywhere.

457
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,716
So, what was your plan,
trap Phoebe in this cage

458
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,598
and fatten her up
until she gives birth?

459
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,718
Even I don't have
that kind of patience.

460
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,156
Well, whatever your plan was,
I'm happy to spoil it.

461
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,878
You didn't spoil anything.

462
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,195
Phoebe will come to me

463
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,150
- as soon as she gets my message.
- What message?

464
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,232
I saw the Seer.
She was killing Paige.

465
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,391
How can you get a premonition
without touching anything?

466
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,790
I don't know,
maybe the Seer sent it to me?

467
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,798
That is not all she sent.

468
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,913
Come with me now,
or your sister dies.

469
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,957
You've already seen how.

470
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,917
- No, Phoebe, don't.
- It's a trap.

471
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,469
It doesn't matter.
I have to save Paige.

472
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,153
- It's the only chance left.
- No.

473
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,353
- You're letting the baby control you.
- That wasn't the baby.

474
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,919
That was me.

475
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,957
I got Paige into this mess,
I'm gonna get her out.

476
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,680
No, you're not,
not if I kill the Seer first.

477
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,752
Damn it!

478
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,313
Did that come from you?

479
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,630
I'm sorry, Piper,
I can't let you take the fall for me.

480
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,119
Well, why not?

481
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,872
You can't use
the baby's powers like that.

482
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,230
Come here, witch!

483
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,508
Phoebe, don't!

484
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,953
Phoebe, nobody's ever been able
to vanquish that demon.

485
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,712
Do you realize what you just did?

486
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,992
Stay away.

487
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,834
That's not Phoebe anymore.

488
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,155
Come to me, child.

489
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,596
Phoebe, snap out of it. Please.

490
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,115
Let the little children come to me,

491
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,078
for the kingdom belongs
to such as these.

492
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,956
The rose circle represents nature...

493
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,830
...desire, fertility.

494
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,917
Kneel.

495
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,759
Phoebe, it's your body,
take control. Fight it.

496
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,310
Give me strength and give me might

497
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,790
- To steal a child in still of night
- Phoebe!

498
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,748
Darkest forces
Let it be

499
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,279
Hear my plea
Bring life to me

500
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,312
My baby.

501
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,079
He was never yours, or Cole's.

502
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,876
From the moment of conception,
this baby was mine.

503
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,073
The deadline's past. She's not here.

504
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,958
The throne belongs to me.

505
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,839
- We can wait one more--
- Give me the oath! I want my power!

506
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,238
You promised to bring
The Source's heir.

507
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,913
So...

508
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,390
-...where is he?
- lnside me.

509
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,470
The council has chosen.

510
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,269
- The Seer will be our new Source.
- No. It's a trick.

511
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,670
I have brought the council a gift.

512
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,877
Charmed Ones.

513
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,235
How dare you bring them
into our sanctuary!

514
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,990
The witches are locked in a cage
from which no magic can escape.

515
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,029
- You can't be sure of that.
- So much negative energy.

516
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,354
Am I to presume these witches

517
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,876
are the human sacrifice required
to seal your coronation?

518
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,478
Human sacrifice? I didn't know
that was part of the plan, did you?

519
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,719
To be your Source,

520
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,474
to start a new evil order,

521
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,351
to kill the Charmed Ones,

522
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,512
this was my vision
from the beginning.

523
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,752
Every council leader here
will reap the rewards with--

524
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,597
- What is it?
- Just start the ceremony.

525
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,432
Doesn't look like she's having
any more luck

526
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,874
with that thing than you were.

527
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,031
May the world's evil flow
through your soul.

528
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,316
I'm sorry, that was insensitive.

529
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,789
It's okay. The baby wasn't mine.

530
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,351
- What do you mean?
- The baby was never mine.

531
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,399
From the moment it took over,
it just felt like this black hole of evil.

532
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,551
Totally soulless.

533
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,953
- Phoebe?
- Yeah.

534
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,198
Told you so.

535
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,516
- I'm really sorry.
- I know you are, honey.

536
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,159
- I know you are.
- Seer,

537
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,357
are you prepared to accept
the power and position of The Source

538
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,829
before all these leaders
of the underworld?

539
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,718
- I am.
- Okay, so now what?

540
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,996
We'd have a fighting chance
had we the power of three,

541
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,357
but we can't get to Piper.
This cage is magic-proof.

542
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,353
Okay, so the cage is built
to make sure magic wouldn't get out.

543
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,229
But in the premonition I had,
I saw the Seer kill you with her power.

544
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,551
So the cage lets magic in. Do you
remember the spell to call a lost witch?

545
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,188
Piper and I just used it
to try to find you.

546
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,273
Powers of the witches rise
Course unseen across the skies

547
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,079
There's nothing left.
We've tried everything.

548
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,516
There's gotta be something missing,
something we haven't thought of.

549
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,432
You know,
maybe if we summon a demon,

550
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,592
someone who knows
the way to the Seer's lair,

551
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,673
he can lead us
to Phoebe and Paige.

552
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,754
Thank God it worked.

553
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,311
- Oh, my. Where are we?
- Trapped in a cage.

554
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,313
- Okay, so let's bust out.
- No!

555
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,712
You can't use your magic in here.
It'll just bounce off and probably kill us.

556
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,350
- Repeat the oath after me.
- What's going on out there?

557
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,114
The Seer is being coronated
as the new Source.

558
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,518
Yeah, then she's gonna sacrifice us.

559
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,838
Let me get this straight.
You guys summoned me to a cage

560
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,310
where my powers don't work
so we could all die together?

561
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,711
Well, the plan has some flaws,
admittedly.

562
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,190
We have to stay positive.
We have the power of three here.

563
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,157
There is nothing stronger
than that, right?

564
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,792
Are you sure there's nothing stronger
than the power of three?

565
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,269
What an unexpected surprise.

566
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,556
You've just made my--

567
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,355
- I don't know what just happened.
- What happening?

568
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,159
It's the baby.
He has too much power for her.

569
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,869
That's how I felt.
I felt like I was gonna explode.

570
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,071
- What are we gonna do?
- We need to make her tap

571
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,471
- into the baby's power, all of it.
- How the hell are we gonna do that?

572
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,272
I command all in attendance
to witness the power of The Source

573
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,159
- Power-of-three spell?
- and the death of the Charmed Ones!

574
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,108
The power of three will set us free
The power of three will set us free

575
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,269
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong!

576
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,078
- It's working.
- Keep going.

577
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,231
Where'd everybody go?

578
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,520
The blast took everyone out,
the Seer, the council leaders.

579
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,637
Well, I'd say that the scales
of good and evil

580
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,473
just dramatically tipped in our favour.

581
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,554
Look, the Grimoire, still untouched.

582
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,030
It's time we get rid of that book
once and for all.

583
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,639
Well, the Grimoire has a new home

584
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,031
in a mountain of rock
in the west Andes.

585
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,509
- Thanks, honey.
- Sure.

586
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,028
How many times have
we vanquished The Source now?

587
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,716
- Three, but who's counting?
- Did we get him?

588
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,117
I think that would be safe to say,
based on how the Elders are reacting.

589
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,590
It's like a holiday up there.
They still can't believe you did it.

590
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,469
Yeah, well, let's not forget the cost.

591
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,910
Well, I gotta say, after all this,

592
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,198
I'm still looking forward to having
a good baby in this house.

593
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,519
Yeah, I haven't had a chance
to talk to you about that yet.

594
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,875
I heard from Dr. Harris today.

595
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,550
- And?
- And we're in for a rough road.

596
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,473
Rough road?

597
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,312
What does that mean?
What did he say?

598
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,634
It's okay. It doesn't mean
that we're giving in or giving up.

599
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,116
There are a lot of options
in the world. Don't worry.

600
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,634
Don't worry, Leo.

601
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,439
I'm sure the charmed line
isn't supposed to end with us.

602
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,238
Phoebe...

603
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,115
...I found this in Cole's safe.

604
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,838
It's for you.

605
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:21,033
If I'm dead right now,
I know it was at your hand.

606
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,232
No one else in heaven or hell
had power over me.

607
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,159
Please don't cry.

608
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,152
I was dead before I met you.

609
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,590
I was born the day you loved me.

610
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,394
And my love for you
will keep me alive...

611
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,152
... forever.

612
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,196
Help me.

613
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,759
Phoebe.

614
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,119
Cole?
