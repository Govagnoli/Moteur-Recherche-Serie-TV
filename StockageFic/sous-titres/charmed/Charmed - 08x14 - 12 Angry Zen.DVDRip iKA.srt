1
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,682
Enough, stop.

2
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,065
Each year, you try.
Each year, you fail.

3
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,902
Wresting the staff from sacred hands
is the goal of a fool, Novak.

4
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,446
And we will always protect
the eternal cycle.

5
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,156
You should know that by now.

6
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:34,201
Except to do that,
you have to be lucky every year.

7
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:38,789
To get it,
I only have to be lucky once.

8
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,976
Did you give this to me last year,
or did I give this to you?

9
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,435
I can't remember.

10
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,525
Hello. Earth to Piper.

11
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,530
Hey, that's my TiVo.
You can't take that.

12
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,157
No, I'm not taking. I'm asking.

13
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,035
And are you sure it's yours, because
it has all my season passes on it.

14
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,162
Whatever, just take it.

15
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:23,834
I don't have time to watch anything
anyway, except for "SpongeBob. "

16
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,461
Where are my
beautiful nephews anyway?

17
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,881
Dad is taking them to Marine Land.

18
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,924
Really? Oh, that's great. Cool.

19
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,218
No, it's not. I should be
taking them to Marine Land.

20
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,678
You know, their mother.

21
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:35,888
Well, why aren't you?

22
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,307
Because I have to
defrost my husband somehow.

23
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,351
Right. Any leads?

24
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,521
No, but I'm hoping to find some
by magically divining for them,

25
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,565
but it's not working.

26
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:47,858
What is it supposed to do?

27
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,861
It's supposed to give me
some sort of sign, you know,

28
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,488
pick up some magical chatter
about what we're up against.

29
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,698
Sounds like a stretch.

30
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,533
Well, you know,
you work with what you got.

31
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,327
You know,
maybe if you took a little break.

32
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,536
No, I don't need a break.

33
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,539
I need to find out who we're up against
so we're prepared.

34
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,666
Okay, then I should help you.

35
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,211
No, no, no, I don't wanna
drag you back into this.

36
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:11,048
I want you to go to your new place
and enjoy it and enjoy your new life.

37
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,674
- Yeah, but, Piper, I'm not...
- No buts.

38
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,843
Look, I gave the same speech
to Paige.

39
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,888
This is not your burden to bear,
it's mine.

40
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,723
Yeah, but you can't do it by yourself.

41
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,933
No, you're right, I can't.

42
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,311
And when the battle to end all battles
happens, I will call you.

43
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,438
Now, this goes in your car.

44
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,733
Piper, wait.

45
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,851
Coming.

46
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:52,941
- Hi.
- Housewarming gift.

47
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,068
Oh, Billie,
you're such a sweetie, thanks.

48
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,989
Oh, look at you, styling in the city.
Can you believe it?

49
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,160
Actually, I can't. It's so amazing.

50
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:06,580
I keep knocking on the bathroom door,
just out of habit.

51
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,373
Yeah, but you must love it.

52
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,294
I haven't been really been in here
long enough to love it, but I will.

53
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,672
Even though I'm gonna miss
my sisters and my nephews.

54
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,049
Yeah, but not the demons.

55
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,760
They will find me here, trust me.

56
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,512
Speaking of which,
how's the search going?

57
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,263
Oh, it's not really going.

58
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,558
I had a little bit of a brain freeze,
so I just wanted to let it go for a bit.

59
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,519
Do you wanna go to the movies?

60
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,897
You know what, I would love to,
but I think I just need to stay here,

61
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:36,693
you know, settle in, unpack,
maybe meet the neighbours,

62
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,030
just get used to being alone.

63
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,866
Yeah, I know what you mean.

64
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:46,078
Okay. Hey, do you know anything
about magically divining?

65
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,996
Are you kidding? Tons. Why?

66
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,583
Well, Piper is trying to do it,
but it hasn't been successful for her

67
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,627
and she thinks it's the key
to finding Leo.

68
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,921
So I don't know,
maybe you can help her?

69
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,340
Oh, yeah, totally, I could help her.

70
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,719
Now?

71
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,597
- Oh, yeah, okay.
- Great.

72
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,850
All right, that's so sweet,
she'll really appreciate it.

73
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,101
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

74
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,435
- Thanks for the plant.
- Bye.

75
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,771
Stop by anytime.

76
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,861
Paige, you scared me.

77
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,405
Well, you told me
I could stop by anytime.

78
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:25,075
Yeah, I meant like a normal person.
You know, knock first.

79
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,455
Oh, Paige, don't be like that.

80
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,422
- Is that better?
- Much. Thank you.

81
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,217
Okay, here's my thing, all right?

82
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,761
I'm just completely freaking out
about this whole magic thing.

83
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,388
Freaking out, how?

84
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,182
I told him
about the whole big secret thing,

85
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,850
thinking it would bring us closer,

86
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,311
and it's kind of pushing us
farther apart.

87
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,396
Well, he's probably
just overwhelmed, you know.

88
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,148
Yeah, I'm sure he is.

89
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,941
He keeps asking me
all these questions,

90
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,318
and they're valid questions.

91
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,195
You know,
why aren't we using our powers

92
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,949
to bring about world peace,
or end poverty, end famine?

93
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,452
He's just not getting
that it's not that easy.

94
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,662
Well, just be patient with him.

95
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,957
And maybe try not to explain it
from a magical perspective.

96
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,627
You know, try to use terms
that he understands.

97
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,003
You know, keep it simple.

98
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,508
I think I might do that. Thank you.

99
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,261
- Can I orb?
- Yes, please.

100
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,143
Free at last.

101
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,189
Now what?

102
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:42,528
Hi, I just wanted to RSVP
for the housewarming party?

103
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,931
It's time.

104
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,070
- Where am I?
- Magic School.

105
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,197
Demons control it now.

106
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,950
Much has changed in a year, Novak.

107
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,452
- When's the ceremony?
- Tonight.

108
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,957
But after decades of trying,
this time, I think you'll finally be able

109
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,335
to wrest control of the staff
from the Zodiacs.

110
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,545
I better.

111
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:45,757
I tire of conserving my strength
for this one chance every year.

112
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,136
- Are you tracking Rooster?
- No.

113
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,929
Lo Pan.

114
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,599
You're supposed to be following
the Zodiac before he hands it off,

115
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,975
not some lowly servant.

116
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,854
But that servant is responsible
for where the handoff occurs.

117
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,732
He alone knows the location
of the sacred garden.

118
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,151
Rooster will be the first to arrive.

119
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:08,655
And when he does,
we'll be waiting for him.

120
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,454
Billie, what are you doing up here?

121
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,289
Oh, just helping you out.
Phoebe sent me.

122
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,750
I went over to her new place
and she just wanted to be alone,

123
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,461
and I was just getting all in there,
putting my feet on everything,

124
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,171
wanting to hang out,
but she sent me here.

125
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,256
Whoa, tangent.

126
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,133
Don't you have your own demons
to slay?

127
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,052
Yeah, but I'm kind of tired
of my obsession,

128
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,095
so I thought I would join in on yours.

129
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,389
You know, misery loves company.

130
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,309
So, what are you doing?

131
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,270
I'm grinding up payatha root. You know,
I don't think you used enough.

132
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,064
Divinations can be very,
very temperamental.

133
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:45,651
You have to use just the right amount
if you wanna catch any cosmic signals.

134
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,695
You know,
you're getting pretty good at this.

135
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,113
Well, I had good teachers.

136
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,950
All right, let's see
if you missed any signs.

137
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,160
Stand back.

138
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,505
Bingo.

139
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,848
Are you sure this is right?

140
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,850
Yeah, I backtracked the sign
all the way to here.

141
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,435
But I gotta say, I was thinking more
of a Buddhist temple,

142
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,521
not some same-day laundry.

143
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,106
Well, maybe we should just forget it.

144
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,816
No, we were brought here.

145
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:29,027
Come on, Piper.
The sign brought us here for a reason.

146
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:33,407
Listen, I'm supposed to be the mature
and wise one, so knock it off.

147
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,368
May I help you?

148
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,912
You here for pick-up?

149
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,417
No, actually, we were just admiring
your sign out front.

150
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:44,918
The eternal cycle.

151
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,338
It represents a sacred chain of life.

152
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,841
Have you seen it before?

153
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,051
That's why we're here.

154
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:57,598
I see. So you have
an interest in signs, do you?

155
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,226
Yeah. Gemini, Libra, Leo.

156
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:07,357
Are you sure you don't mean Monkey,
Rooster or Tiger, like your friend here?

157
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,361
- Excuse me?
- Chinese zodiac, right?

158
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,907
You've answered my call,
and not a moment too soon.

159
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,618
No, I think we've got
our wires crossed somehow,

160
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,578
because I'm just looking
to save a husband.

161
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:22,706
And now you're here
to help save us all.

162
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,084
But you must hurry now,
or all will be lost.

163
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,260
Whoa, what was that?

164
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,930
Forget it, Jenkins, it's Chinatown.

165
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,776
Don't let him get the staff.

166
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,655
Your turn.

167
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,966
This has never happened before,
a Zodiac dying.

168
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,302
It's now on you to protect the staff.

169
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,152
Look, really, mister, no offence,

170
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,155
but I'm just trying to save my husband,
not some stick.

171
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:41,285
This is not a stick.
It is Buddha's mystical staff.

172
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,872
And it must be passed
to the next Zodiac at the new year,

173
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,040
or the eternal cycle ends.

174
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,459
All right,
before we hit Exposition City here,

175
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,628
what's with the laundry
on the outside,

176
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:55,591
and then this crazy green place
on the inside?

177
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,469
This sacred garden has served
for centuries

178
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,723
as a sanctuary for
the ceremonial passing of the staff.

179
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,518
It has been my family's honour to
find a place for its existence

180
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:07,895
each and every year.

181
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,148
So it's just my luck that
a demon tries to take it this year?

182
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,441
Not just this year.

183
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:16,278
He's been trying for many years,
when it is vulnerable, as it is now.

184
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:21,074
That is why I sent out the call for help,
and that is why you came.

185
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:25,913
No, really, seriously, I was looking
for something totally different.

186
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,165
You must be a Buffalo.

187
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:33,253
- Excuse me?
- I think he's talking about your sign.

188
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,465
Hang on a second. She gets a tiger
and I'm some stinking buffalo?

189
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:41,386
If you know of the Zodiacs, you know
we do not choose who we are born to.

190
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:45,891
Each influences us with different gifts
to keep the eternal cycle alive.

191
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:51,980
But if a demon steals the staff before
it is passed, then the cycle ends.

192
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:56,735
And it won't be the Zodiacs
who influence, but evil instead.

193
00:12:56,902 --> 00:13:00,280
Not a world your husband
would want to be saved for, I trust?

194
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,951
All right,
what would you like us to do?

195
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,120
Protect the staff until it is passed
to the new Zodiac.

196
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,248
But you must be of clear mind,

197
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:13,961
so as not to unduly influence those
around you with your personality.

198
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,340
I'm sorry, I'm just imagining
a lot of obsessing.

199
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:19,967
That's cute. That's very cute.

200
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,844
You must leave now
before they come back.

201
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,763
Use all of your power to protect it,
if you have to.

202
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,640
Maybe you should call
Paige and Phoebe.

203
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,684
You better believe it.

204
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,477
Do you know anything
about this demon?

205
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,605
No, but I have kept a record
of his past attacks.

206
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,483
Well, I could take a look at them,
maybe I'll figure something out.

207
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,945
Perhaps you'll find out something
about yourself along the way, Billie.

208
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,154
How do you know my name?

209
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,073
This is a magical place,

210
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,201
one where questions
will have answers.

211
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,580
If you are open to it, you'll see.

212
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,545
- So when does this ceremony begin?
- At midnight.

213
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,966
Naturally.

214
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,515
<i>The staff is lost.</i>

215
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,976
We have no choice
but to wait another year.

216
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,603
We're not waiting.

217
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,898
- Why should we?
- Because the witches...

218
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,775
Merely delayed the inevitable.

219
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:24,239
After all, progress has been made.
Unprecedented progress.

220
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:28,619
A Zodiac is dead, which means they,
as a whole, are weakened.

221
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,872
And the staff is out of sacred hands
for the first time ever.

222
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,916
Still, now they know we're coming.

223
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,250
They always know we're coming.

224
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,963
You underestimated Lo Pan,
do not underestimate me.

225
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:47,095
With all due respect, the servant won't
keep the staff in the garden now.

226
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,514
Not until the handoff.

227
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,891
- We'll never find it in time.
- We won't have to.

228
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,727
The Zodiacs will find it for us.

229
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:59,107
We'll let it be known what's happened,
what Lo Pan's done.

230
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:04,905
They'll come out of hiding to get
their precious staff back. Trust me.

231
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,699
So then all we have to do
is track them.

232
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:12,538
See? Progress.

233
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:18,669
Henry, I have to say,
I've been doing some thinking.

234
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,379
About what?

235
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:24,299
Well, here's the deal.
I have a plan, you know, for us.

236
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,051
I thought we were doing pretty well.

237
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:30,514
Yeah, definitely, except for, you know,
when the M word kind of comes up,

238
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,350
- things start getting a little bit...
- Weird.

239
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:37,187
Yeah, exactly, but everything else
is obviously going well.

240
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,815
You're even finishing my sentences.

241
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,401
But...

242
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,281
Okay. Step into my office,
have a seat.

243
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,575
- On this?
- Yes.

244
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:53,912
- You can fit, I'm pretty sure.
- Barely.

245
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,708
Okay. Stay with me here.

246
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:05,799
You deal with criminals, okay,
drug dealers, burglars, murderers.

247
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,594
Me, I deal with demons.

248
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,515
Kazis, Creepers, Grimlocks,
I could go on and on.

249
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:19,438
But the point is, they're very similar.
Criminals bad, demons bad.

250
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:22,441
- Is it snack time yet, Miss Matthews?
- Henry.

251
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,276
Look, I know what you're trying
to say, okay?

252
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,778
But what I don't understand is,
if you have all these powers,

253
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,281
- why you don't use them.
- I do use them.

254
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,617
No, no, no, not on demons,
I'm talking about hunger.

255
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:36,914
I'm talking about poor, the homeless,
my criminals, my bad guys.

256
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,833
It's really actually not that simple.

257
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,668
But why, who says?

258
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,838
I mean, I'm not trying
to make you feel bad, okay?

259
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,799
But I just don't understand,
if there's magic in the world,

260
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:51,053
why you don't use it
to just save the world.

261
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,973
Oh, this is a sick one,
I have to take this.

262
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,975
We'll figure it out later.

263
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,272
- Well, that went swimmingly.
- Yeah, it's Henry.

264
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:06,193
Paige, great, you're here.
What's this?

265
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,200
The answer to my problems.

266
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,662
Well, we have bigger problems,
trust me.

267
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:20,374
Buddha's staff. The demons want it.
We need the "Book. "

268
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,377
Sorry, no can do.
I have to help Henry.

269
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,087
No, no, no,
hang on a second, whoa.

270
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:27,172
I thought the words
"Buddha" and "demons"

271
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,091
would give you the hint
that I need your help?

272
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,844
No, not really.

273
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,178
Bye, I have to help Henry now.

274
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,097
But, wha...?

275
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,686
What are you looking at?

276
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,022
Any luck?

277
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,692
Are you kidding?
I can't make sense of any of this stuff.

278
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:50,487
That's because you're using your eyes,
and not your powers.

279
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:52,364
Well, how can telekinesis help me?

280
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:56,326
I'm talking about your other power,
the one you have yet to master.

281
00:17:56,952 --> 00:18:00,205
The one you need to master
if you truly want answers.

282
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,457
Answers. You mean,
to help me find the demon.

283
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,793
And to finding your sister.

284
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,422
I told you this place was magical.

285
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,340
Yeah, and a little creepy.

286
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:14,094
We are all led
to where we need to be, Billie.

287
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,096
And so you have been led here.

288
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:21,643
But before you can help the
eternal cycle, you must help yourself.

289
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,730
Okay. So, what can you tell me
about Christy?

290
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:25,981
I can tell you nothing.

291
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,692
Only Christy can tell you
about Christy.

292
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,904
And only you have the power
to seek those answers.

293
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,947
But I can't even control
my projection power.

294
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,074
I haven't even used it
since I knew I had it.

295
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,243
The sisters think
it's way too dangerous.

296
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,662
When used out of control, yes.

297
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,706
So can you help me control it?

298
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,083
Come.

299
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,633
That penjing tree is
a simple living creature

300
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,218
within the world surrounding us.

301
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:58,430
And like all things, it follows a cycle,
and it's nearing its end.

302
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:03,936
But you have the power to see
its cycle at the beginning again,

303
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:07,272
to project what you will upon it.

304
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,983
Focus on the tree, Billie.

305
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,654
Reach within yourself
to your power.

306
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,909
See what you want to see.

307
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:31,004
- Look.
- I did that?

308
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:35,175
And you can do more than that.
You can see your sister.

309
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,853
Hello?

310
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,984
The staff belongs to us.

311
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,779
And you would be?

312
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,323
We are the Zodiacs.

313
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,534
We?

314
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,501
The staff for your life.

315
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,845
- The staff.
- Okay, look.

316
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:23,599
Now, there's nothing I'd love better
than to get rid of this thing, but...

317
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,521
Kill her!

318
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,861
Yeah, that's ugly.

319
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,323
Okay, hang on.

320
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,824
There's no need to fight.

321
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,535
How would you guys like
your staff in pieces?

322
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,370
One for each of you?

323
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:54,296
Maybe we should just
talk about this.

324
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,381
Talk fast.

325
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,142
Can't I just sit in a chair?

326
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:12,105
Stop resisting. Just relax.

327
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:17,528
Now, what happened the first time you
tried to use this new power of yours?

328
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,531
Well, I turned my parents
into assassins.

329
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:25,786
I see. All the more reason
to focus completely

330
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:29,957
on what you wish to project this time,
what you truly wish to find.

331
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,835
Well, after 15 years,
I wanna find my big sister.

332
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:37,673
That's practical, not emotional.
That's not how your power works.

333
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,925
Think.

334
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:45,430
Deep down,
what is it that you truly want?

335
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,100
Well, I wanna see Christy.

336
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:50,519
I wanna know what she's been
going through all these years.

337
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:55,440
All right. Then concentrate on that.

338
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,279
Allow the world that surrounds you
to disappear.

339
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:04,950
Allow time to be nothing but an idea.

340
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:08,745
Don't bend the spoon,
imagine there is no spoon?

341
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:10,998
Sorry.

342
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:15,794
Think of only Christy,
of seeing her again,

343
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:19,965
of where she went,
of understanding.

344
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:25,220
Let your power take you
where you need to go. Now.

345
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:39,902
Lo Pan?

346
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:42,988
Where are you?

347
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,283
What is going on?

348
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,668
Lo Pan?

349
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,671
Who's there?

350
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,355
Christy, is that you?

351
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:20,025
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

352
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:25,781
Unbelievable.

353
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,370
We do not wish to harm you.

354
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:34,873
We thought you had stolen
the sacred staff.

355
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:37,835
Don't you guys talk to each other?

356
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,047
Lo Pan, the guy
that gave me this to protect?

357
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:45,926
Lo Pan is just a servant.
He only speaks when spoken to.

358
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,220
Well, maybe you should
speak to him more often,

359
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:50,889
considering he seems to know
more about this than you do.

360
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:54,017
He should've hidden the sacred garden
better from the demons.

361
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,895
Maybe so,
but if he hadn't anticipated the attack,

362
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,231
I wouldn't be holding this right now,
now, would I?

363
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:01,817
Point taken.

364
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:05,237
So I take it you guys
heard about Chicken.

365
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:08,907
Rooster. And yes, we sensed it.

366
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:12,244
That's why we were so afraid
the staff had been stolen.

367
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:16,373
The moment it was out of his hands,
we began tracking it to you.

368
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:18,834
Okay, well, would you like it back?

369
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:22,671
No, it is forbidden until
the New Year.

370
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,716
I am Dog,
the next in line for the staff.

371
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:29,678
Okay, so can't one of your other
Zodiacs hold it for you until then?

372
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:35,142
No, it would upset the eternal cycle,
change the balance of all things.

373
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:37,895
Great. Well, what would you like me
to do with it?

374
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,563
I'll take it.

375
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,401
Oh, no, you again.

376
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,945
Yup, me again.

377
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:56,788
Go, you must protect the staff.

378
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,123
What about my house?

379
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,917
Only the staff matters. Go!

380
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,671
Paige!

381
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:10,928
Well, last stop on our orbing world tour.
Golden Gate Bridge.

382
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,472
Bet you've never seen it
from this angle, huh?

383
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,140
Are you nuts?

384
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,976
What are we doing here now?

385
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,686
Well, you have some questions

386
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:22,648
and I am just trying
to facilitate some answers.

387
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:26,026
- How?
- I told you about the Elders, right?

388
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,819
And if I call them down here,

389
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,948
they can maybe explain this whole thing
a little bit more in depth.

390
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:34,201
Just slow down a little, okay,
because my head's still spinning.

391
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,578
I'm just trying
to help you understand me

392
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:40,707
and the whole shebang that kind of
goes along with me, right?

393
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:44,044
And I just figured, what better way
than to orb you all around the world

394
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:46,129
to really see things firsthand?

395
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:47,923
I don't know what's gotten into you.

396
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,425
Oh, hold that thought. Hello?

397
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:53,679
<i>Paige, where are you?
I need your help.</i>

398
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,306
Well, at the moment,
Henry needs my help a little bit more.

399
00:25:56,849 --> 00:26:00,018
Would you forget about Henry
for one second? This is bad.

400
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:03,105
- Really? How bad?
- Things-stop-spinning bad.

401
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:07,234
If the demon gets this staff,
the eternal cycle ends or something

402
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:10,362
and the world turns evil.
I don't know.

403
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,117
World turning evil
or my relationship ending.

404
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:17,369
I gotta say,
that's kind of a tough choice.

405
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:20,706
Tough choice?
What the hell is the matter with you?

406
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:24,209
Well, nothing is the matter with me.
I'm just really focused on Henry.

407
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:27,296
<i>When did you become so obsessive?
That is my deal.</i>

408
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,716
I guess it is, but maybe I learned
from the best, big sis.

409
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,136
Oh, my goodness,
Henry just fell off the bridge.

410
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:36,221
<i>- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- No, no, no...</i>

411
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:41,393
Great, that's great, great.

412
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,353
Don't make me come back there!

413
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:48,567
You okay?

414
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:49,985
Where were we?

415
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:53,363
Such a great view,
you should really try enjoying it more.

416
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:01,413
Anyone need a refill?

417
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,415
You okay? Enjoying yourselves?

418
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,627
Oh, I hear laughter, that's good.

419
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,338
Laughter means happy people.

420
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:11,048
There you go.

421
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:15,469
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

422
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:17,763
It's nice of you to put
this thing together for everyone.

423
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,474
Yeah, well, I just wanted
to meet all my neighbours.

424
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,976
I am so happy to be living here,
you have no idea.

425
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,603
Really, it's like I'm free.

426
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,104
I can tell.

427
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:28,106
Well, I'm glad you're living here too.

428
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,029
Excuse me.

429
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:40,244
Hi, Piper. I wasn't expecting
to see you here. What...?

430
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,621
Hey, how are you all doing?
Be right back.

431
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:44,331
Listen, we have a problem,

432
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:47,042
one you're going to help me with
whether you like it or not.

433
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:50,420
Wait, no, Piper, I can't.
I have to focus on my party.

434
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:51,630
Are you kidding me?

435
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:55,008
Listen, I am tired of babysitting
this thing by myself. It is your turn.

436
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,139
- What just happened?
- What am I doing here?

437
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:04,810
I should be at Marine World
with my kids.

438
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:07,396
Wait, Piper, what would you like me
to do with this?

439
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:10,065
Screw it, I'm free.

440
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:12,651
Party time, everybody.

441
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:24,913
Piper? What the?

442
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,017
Paige?

443
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,186
Hell, yeah.

444
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,939
Honey, are you okay?
What happened?

445
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:53,066
Well, I don't understand.

446
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,818
Why don't the demons
just move in here,

447
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:56,445
since they're here
all the time anyway?

448
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:57,863
Where's Piper?

449
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,072
I don't know.

450
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,867
I came here looking for her
and I got knocked down.

451
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:03,368
Did you see what they look like?

452
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:06,121
Just your average
tackily dressed demons.

453
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:09,374
There were some other guys with
these kind of red gown, robe-y things.

454
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:10,876
They must be after the staff.

455
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:13,378
- Buddha's staff.
- No, don't touch it.

456
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:16,173
It's covered for a reason.
I think it has a crazy effect on people.

457
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:20,302
Maybe that's what was making me
so crazy and so obsessed with Henry.

458
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:22,763
Well, yeah, but the question is
why aren't you now?

459
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:26,266
Maybe it wore off, maybe those guys
knocked it out of me.

460
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,061
We have to find Piper.

461
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:38,487
I hear them outside, whispering.

462
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:41,365
But I don't understand
what they're saying.

463
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:43,784
I never understand
what they're saying.

464
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:49,706
Then they stop for a while,
sometimes for a long time.

465
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:51,583
But then they start again.

466
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:54,253
I don't know what they want.

467
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,088
Okay, it's okay, look,
I'm here now, okay?

468
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:58,048
I still don't understand how.

469
00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:00,926
Yeah, that makes two of us.

470
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:03,262
All I know is I'm supposed to
be with you now,

471
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,806
and try to figure this out
so I can get you out of here.

472
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:08,767
No, they won't let us,
they won't let us.

473
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:10,561
Have you tried using your powers?

474
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:14,606
Powers? What do you mean?

475
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:17,943
You know, your powers. Magic?

476
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:22,281
Christy, you're a witch, just like me.

477
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:25,450
You must have some powers that...

478
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:29,288
Wait. Powers. That must be
what they want from you.

479
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:36,795
- Where did you get this?
- They gave it to me.

480
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:38,297
They all wear it.

481
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,133
It's the symbol from your diary.

482
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:48,223
It's them.

483
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:52,102
I wanna go home.
Please, take me home.

484
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:54,563
Lo Pan.

485
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:04,323
Lo Pan? Get us out of here now!

486
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,660
- Lo Pan?
- I'm right here.

487
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,331
Well, where is she?
Where's Christy?

488
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:14,666
- She was right there.
- Where?

489
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,669
Locked away alone in a cave.
Why couldn't I save her?

490
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,755
You didn't go there
to save her, Billie.

491
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:22,007
You went there to see her,
to understand.

492
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:24,092
But I don't understand,
I don't understand at all.

493
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:27,513
I mean, she was a kid,
barely older than when she was taken.

494
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,223
She was vulnerable and open to you.

495
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:33,810
That's why your power took you
to that time, before she changed.

496
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,898
Surely you received something
from that journey, did you not?

497
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:40,859
Well, they're after her powers.

498
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:42,694
Power she doesn't even know
she has yet.

499
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:49,701
You can't save her from her past,
Billie. No one can.

500
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:54,581
But perhaps, you can save her now,
after you help save us.

501
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:05,384
No, sweetie, Mommy's okay.
She just got a flat tire, okay?

502
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:07,219
I'll be there as soon as I can.

503
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:09,555
No, no, no, wait for me.

504
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,515
I wanna see the penguins
with you, really, okay?

505
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,767
- I'll be there in, like, 30 minutes.
- I doubt that.

506
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:27,197
Okay, Dad said she just called.

507
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:28,532
So she's all right.

508
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:30,576
Not necessarily.
The phone went dead.

509
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,578
Maybe it's just bad reception?

510
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:35,289
I think we should try
the to-call-a-lost-witch spell.

511
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,666
It's not gonna work
unless she's actually lost.

512
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,585
She could be just spending time
with the boys,

513
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,503
which would be a good thing, right?

514
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:45,299
- Until the world turns evil.
- Which you're about to help me with.

515
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:58,937
Now, let's go and do something
you'll regret later.

516
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:09,615
Well, this just might be worth
all those years of waiting.

517
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:12,951
The Charmed Ones, under my rule.

518
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:15,162
Imagine the possibilities.

519
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:21,710
Maybe I'll keep you around for a while
after you complete the task at hand.

520
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:25,339
- Kill Dog?
- No, no, no.

521
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:29,051
I don't want to destroy just one Zodiac,
I want to destroy them all,

522
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,054
so that they can never take this
away from me again.

523
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:33,514
What do you want us to do?

524
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:35,682
Eager to please, I like that.

525
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:38,310
You're gonna kill Lo Pan.

526
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:40,312
Lo Pan? The servant?

527
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,105
Oh, he's much more than just that.

528
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:43,649
Though the Zodiacs
all but dismiss him,

529
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,901
he's much more important
than they give him credit for.

530
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:50,656
In fact, he's the key
to continuing the eternal cycle.

531
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:55,452
He protects the sacred garden.
Without it, they're nothing.

532
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:56,662
Then what?

533
00:33:56,829 --> 00:34:00,415
Then the year of evil begins.

534
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:10,175
- Where is he?
- He should be here.

535
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:14,346
- Hey, what are you guys doing here?
- Looking for him.

536
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,349
Lo Pan, why?
The demons are coming, we have to...

537
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:19,685
Hey, where's the staff?

538
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:23,188
What are you guys doing?

539
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:25,315
Making our New Year's resolutions.

540
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:28,443
Get down.

541
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:31,155
You missed.

542
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:34,700
Evil influences them.
That means the demon has the staff.

543
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,493
Oh, that's just great.
Well, what do we do?

544
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,955
We do nothing. You learned
to control your power for this moment.

545
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:41,790
Are you crazy?
I'm not going up against them.

546
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,834
You have to,
if you want to save your sister.

547
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,879
Focus, project what you wish.

548
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:53,468
Billie, we don't wanna hurt you.

549
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:55,262
Sure, we do.

550
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,139
Boulder.

551
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:02,477
Kill her.

552
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:10,819
What just happened?

553
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:14,698
What are we doing here?

554
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:16,867
Oh, no big deal,
you guys were just trying to kill me.

555
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:19,286
But I changed your minds.

556
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:29,129
I don't like it. We should have
killed Lo Pan ourselves.

557
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:34,301
Too many years of failed attempts
have turned you cynical, my friend.

558
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,970
You've got to learn
to think more positively,

559
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:40,516
now that evil's finally
taken over the world.

560
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:44,895
Sad, really. Now what do we do?

561
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:54,029
Well, I wish I had a pithy retort,
but you're really not worth it.

562
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,949
- What...?
- You were saying?

563
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:58,158
Now.

564
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:09,670
Quick, cover it up.

565
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:18,095
Do me a favour
and be careful what you wish for,

566
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:20,472
especially around the boys.

567
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,475
Yeah, well, I haven't exactly
mastered it anyway, so...

568
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:25,561
I think that would be her point.

569
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:27,688
Well, it's almost midnight,

570
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:30,148
so we should get this thing back
before it's too late.

571
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:33,193
Oh, I really can't, I have to go
apologize to my boyfriend.

572
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,279
And I have to explain some things
to the neighbours.

573
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,531
Yeah, and I have a sister to scry for.

574
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,510
What's going on?
What happened to you?

575
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:02,639
It seems that I have been elevated.

576
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:04,725
I am now Rooster.

577
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:08,478
- The staff, if you please.
- Oh, gladly.

578
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:12,858
You received the sign
for a reason, Piper.

579
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:14,985
And not just to help
perpetuate the cycle,

580
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:16,737
but to help the both of us as well.

581
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:19,114
How exactly was I helped?

582
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:24,328
You have shown that patience
can be rewarded, for me and for you.

583
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:28,790
Leo will come back
only if he's meant to.

584
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:32,586
And only when it is time, not before.

585
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,539
Funny, I figured, after last time,

586
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:11,416
this would be the last place
you'd wanna come back to.

587
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,253
Yeah, I did have to think about it.

588
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:18,757
I mean, not about us, but the magic.

589
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:20,509
And?

590
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,430
And after everything
that you did today...

591
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:30,811
I mean, not just this,
but the whole eternal-cycle deal.

592
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,145
I get it.

593
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:37,025
This isn't freaking you out?
You're not mad at me?

594
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:39,778
I was never mad at you, Paige,
or freaked out. I was...

595
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:41,446
Well, I got a little freaked out

596
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,991
when those wild pygmies
were chasing us back then, but...

597
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:45,784
Sorry, it was an accidental orb.

598
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:47,161
It's okay.

599
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:49,246
It helped me see the bigger picture.

600
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:56,879
You use your powers
to make the world a better place.

601
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:59,381
How could I have
a problem with that?

602
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:01,341
I think it's amazing.

603
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:03,343
You do?

604
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:07,723
And I think I'm falling in love
with you.

605
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:17,274
I think I'm falling in love
with you too.

606
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:45,177
Christy?
