1
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,923
So here we are.

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,299
Front porch.

3
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:10,594
Yeah, where all good dates end.

4
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:11,803
What about great dates?

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:15,140
Oh, no. Great dates never end
on the front porch.

6
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:19,019
So that only leaves one question:
Was this a good date or a great date?

7
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,939
I'll tell you in a second.

8
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,860
Head's up. Pregnant lady
coming through with groceries.

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,153
Here we go, people.

10
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,989
What's wrong with Piper?

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,451
They gave us paper
instead of plastic.

12
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,249
- What was that about?
- Tell me about it.

13
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,335
I practically needed a crowbar
to pry them apart.

14
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,963
- I meant with you.
- Me?

15
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,923
Phoebe's the one with
the puppy-Iove eyes.

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,217
- Doesn't that bother you?
- No, it doesn't.

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,928
- Should it?
- Yes. Miles is not her type.

18
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,430
And she would see that
if she wasn't on the rebound.

19
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,558
Okay, I don't think so.
I think he's a nice guy.

20
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,227
- He just got divorced.
- So did she.

21
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,895
He's wearing cologne.

22
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,106
And that's a bad thing?

23
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,316
And he's a computer programmer.

24
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,571
He works with numbers all day.
You know how Phoebe is with math.

25
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,156
They have absolutely nothing
in common.

26
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,326
You're right. You know,
we should just vanquish him.

27
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:20,038
All I'm saying is she needs
to slow down or she's gonna get hurt.

28
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,333
Hey, a little quiet here.

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,252
What is this, a brothel?

30
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,921
You didn't mention that.

31
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,799
I'm a little short on cash.

32
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,144
Oh, no, they're going upstairs.
Should I stop them?

33
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,104
No.

34
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,607
Only if you want to make
a total ass of yourself.

35
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,609
But that's up to you.

36
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,362
I'm telling you,
after the demon-divorce heartbreak

37
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,449
and now this mismatched relationship,
she's gonna get hurt bigtime.

38
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,160
Okay, well, you're gonna get hurt
bigtime if you go upstairs

39
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,371
and try and get in between
of whatever is going on.

40
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,591
Are you sure you're ready?

41
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,176
- I mean, we don't have to...
- I know.

42
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,511
- We could just...
- Why?

43
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,596
I'm glad you feel that way.

44
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,934
Get down on the ground.

45
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,652
Where did you go? Are you okay?

46
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,381
So how come we've never met
your couch buddy before?

47
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,634
He's more than a couch buddy.

48
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,385
His name is Max,

49
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,222
and I think he might
actually have some potential.

50
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,140
Define potential.

51
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,643
Okay, Mr. Leo, I will.

52
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,438
He is wickedly smart,
perversely funny,

53
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,858
and has just the right touch
of weird style for me.

54
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,071
- Hi.
- Look who's coming to breakfast.

55
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,823
Good morning.
Everybody, this is Miles.

56
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,869
Did you guys have a nice night
and morning?

57
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,788
Actually, yes.

58
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,331
Well, at least he's honest.

59
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,376
Why don't you take something
for the road.

60
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,378
And don't forget about
our lunch date.

61
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,421
Do you want to meet
at the bistro or at my work?

62
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,466
Oh, definitely at work.
And then we'll just walk there.

63
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,386
Okay. Don't worry, I'll let myself out.

64
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,270
Okay, go.

65
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,397
Nice meeting you.

66
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,651
Okay, something really freaky
happened last night

67
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,319
when I was with Miles.

68
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:23,073
- You guys are already getting freaky?
- No, I had a premonition.

69
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,742
He got caught up
in a police shootout,

70
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,244
and he died.

71
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,496
A shootout? That's so Wild West.

72
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,623
And besides, don't you
normally have premonitions

73
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,292
about the evil, nasty people?

74
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,877
Yeah, usually, but not always.

75
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,837
Your powers are growing.
It doesn't surprise me

76
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,464
that you're able to detect
natural threats as easily.

77
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,842
Natural or supernatural,
it doesn't really matter.

78
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,970
I would appreciate if one of you could
come to lunch with me to back me up.

79
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:49,141
Because if something happened to
Miles, I just... I would be devastated.

80
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,020
Phoebe, well, this sort of sounds like
Miles is an innocent

81
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,147
we're maybe supposed to protect.

82
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,107
And you're not to fall in love
with innocents.

83
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,693
Besides, you've only
known him three weeks.

84
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,279
Okay, I think that's a little insensitive.

85
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,739
Okey-dokey.
And then there's this:

86
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:07,701
"A rebound romance burns fast
and hot like a shooting star

87
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,038
and leaves the rebounder blind
to the flameout ahead."

88
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,915
Who wrote that psychobabble?

89
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:17,294
That would be from the "Ask Phoebe"
column to "Rebounding in Rockport."

90
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,966
Look, the point is,
Miles makes me feel...

91
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,178
He just makes me feel.

92
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,139
And it's really beautiful.

93
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,434
So could you please
just be happy for me?

94
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,603
Toots, I'm happy for you.

95
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,313
And if you want,
I've got a lunch date,

96
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,981
but I'll cancel to go with you.

97
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,859
Actually, I think we have
a better chance of protecting Miles

98
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,319
with Piper's freezing power.

99
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,079
I should have brought Paige,
at least she could orb.

100
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,164
Wasn't my fault we got stuck
behind an accident.

101
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,376
Okay, 1:15.
I'll run in, you try his cell phone.

102
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,920
I hope he's still here.

103
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,303
The customer you are trying
to reach is unavailable or outside...

104
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,307
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

105
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,227
- You're blocking me in.
- You're parked in a loading zone, lady.

106
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,063
I am not parked. I'm sitting here
with the engine running.

107
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,649
If you just move up,
I'll get out of your way.

108
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,693
Too late. Already stepped
outside of my vehicle.

109
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,320
Well, get your butt back inside
your vehicle and move it.

110
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,198
- I need to get out.
- Don't worry, I'll be back in a minute.

111
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,076
I don't think you understand.
This is an emergency.

112
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,744
Not mine.

113
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,080
He's gone.

114
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,708
Oh, no.

115
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,085
This idiot is blocking me in.

116
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,962
It's only two blocks, let's run.

117
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,473
Okay, this is the street.
Right or left?

118
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,267
You're asking me?

119
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,060
What do we do? I don't remember.

120
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,021
- Pick one. Left.
- Okay.

121
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,195
Get down on the ground.

122
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,324
- S.F.P.D., drop your weapon!
- Do it now!

123
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,950
Piper!

124
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,788
Hurry, move fast.

125
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,626
Hot, hot, hot.

126
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,586
Hot.

127
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,725
- Unfreeze it.
- How are you gonna explain...?

128
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:40,437
I don't know, I'll figure something out.
And thanks, I owe you one.

129
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,570
Okay, okay. I give up.

130
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,156
Down on the ground.
Get down on the ground.

131
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,908
Now!

132
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:56,119
Put your hands behind your back.
Grab the weapon.

133
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,376
Where did you come from?

134
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,671
I wanted to surprise you for lunch.
Surprise.

135
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,175
- You saved my life.
- Oh, it was nothing.

136
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,469
- It was my life.
- Yeah.

137
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,056
- I should be dead right now.
- Yeah, but you're alive. That's good.

138
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,307
You saved my life.

139
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,310
- I think we've been over that part.
- Did I thank you?

140
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,146
No. But you can tonight.

141
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,191
What do you say
to a candlelit dinner?

142
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,985
I'll kick my sisters out of the house.

143
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,087
You okay?

144
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,424
No, I'm not, actually.

145
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,843
Come on, let's go get some coffee.

146
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,077
- Who the hell are you?
- Name's Bacarra.

147
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,787
I was sent here from the future.

148
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,333
Well, can't say I've heard
that one before.

149
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,586
Allow me to offer proof.

150
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,131
Recognize this?

151
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,114
Where did you get
my wedding band?

152
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,285
You gave it to me
when you sent me with a message.

153
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,037
Phoebe's in danger.

154
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,543
What kind of danger?

155
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,922
She saved a man's life today.

156
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,675
The problem is
he was destined to die.

157
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,636
Somehow she got a premonition
she wasn't supposed to get.

158
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,931
Angel of Death
never gives up a claim.

159
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:24,268
Of course not. And that's why Death
keeps coming for this mortal.

160
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,022
But your ex-wife
falls in love with him and...

161
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,526
She falls in love?

162
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,444
Sorry to break the news.

163
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,697
For the next six months,

164
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,032
she tries to save him
over and over,

165
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,368
until she loses her own life
in the process.

166
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:46,498
And that's when you sent me
back in time to tell you to kill this man.

167
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,336
You see, I'd never get her back
if I killed an innocent,

168
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,797
especially one that she loved.

169
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,592
He's not an innocent.
He's meant to die.

170
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,052
You'd only be giving Death a...

171
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:01,972
A helping hand.

172
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:06,768
And saving yourself
a lot of future pain.

173
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,607
A warlock who wants
to save me pain?

174
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,776
Who are you?

175
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:19,072
I'd never send a warlock
with a message this important.

176
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,532
You had no choice.

177
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,202
If you left your throne, it wouldn't
be there when you got back.

178
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,494
Your rivals would steal it.

179
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,165
What rivals? What throne?

180
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,585
In the future,

181
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,630
sooner than you might think,

182
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,757
you're gonna rule
the underworld again.

183
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,176
I'm your advisor.

184
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:42,221
Of course, I advised you
against this, but...

185
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:46,600
I'd never turn back to evil.
It won't happen.

186
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,935
It does happen.

187
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,853
You unite demons and warlocks

188
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,232
to lift the underworld
to its greatest power in history.

189
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,568
You're the future of evil, man.

190
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,493
You said you'd react that way.

191
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,496
Well, guess it's up to me
to get the job done.

192
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,874
Wish me luck.

193
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:19,591
A dozen, dozen roses.

194
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,343
How many roses is that?

195
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,803
A hundred and forty-four.

196
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,930
What do you think he's trying to say?

197
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:26,515
Okay, so based on what I saw,

198
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,350
a demon attacks tonight
with an athame.

199
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,562
So if we want to figure out a vanquish,
we have to find out what it is.

200
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,856
Well, what do your premonitions
have in common?

201
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,274
How do they fit together?

202
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,235
Well, they don't necessarily
have to fit together.

203
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:42,322
Based on my experience,
one's a premonition, two is a pattern.

204
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,366
Or just really bad luck.

205
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,703
Miles stumbled into a police
shootout today,

206
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,496
and a demonic shootout tonight.

207
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,582
So you think the demon is after us?

208
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,375
Wouldn't be the first time.

209
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,669
I don't know. I think there's
something after Miles.

210
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:00,090
Okay, well, we could explore
that theory later.

211
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,758
Why are you trying
to minimize this?

212
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:05,053
And why is everyone else trying to
make a bigger deal out of it than it is?

213
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:08,932
Probably because we're following
our instincts and not our hormones.

214
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,311
Until we know for sure,

215
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,771
I think we should take steps
to protect Miles.

216
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,232
Okay, well, I'm already
all over Miles.

217
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,027
I mean with, you know,
the protection stuff.

218
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,070
I even cancelled our dinner
for tonight.

219
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,489
Think that's such a good idea?
If something's after him,

220
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,451
our best chance to find out what
is if you go through with your plans.

221
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:31,413
She's right, we can surround him
with the family for protection.

222
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:34,708
You mean like a family dinner?

223
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,755
- Really?
- Yeah.

224
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,257
- Are you cooking?
- Probably.

225
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,593
Then I better get ready.

226
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,223
Yay, more flowers.

227
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,850
I know, lacks originality.

228
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,811
But they're a lot easier to carry
than what I really wanted to give you.

229
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,106
- Oh, yeah? What was that?
- Beachfront property.

230
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:01,109
Hey, you saved my life.

231
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,154
You know, we can always eat later.

232
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,740
I'm not really that hungry...

233
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,575
...for dinner.

234
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,750
What happened to the candles
and the romance?

235
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,879
Well, unfortunately,
our plans have changed.

236
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,257
I just really wanted you
to get to know my family.

237
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,550
I hope you don't mind.

238
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,968
Phoebe's said so much about you.

239
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,095
We just wanted to get
to know you a little better.

240
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:29,638
Yeah, yeah.

241
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,974
Although probably not as much
as we just did.

242
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,727
Okay, okay, let's eat.

243
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:37,855
Sit here next to Leo.

244
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,441
- More flowers.
- Yay, more flowers.

245
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,486
Well, I'm starving.

246
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,490
You should've seen Phoebe
dive out of nowhere.

247
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,158
She could have easily been killed.

248
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,743
I would do it all again.

249
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,663
Yeah, that's Phoebe. Friend to all.

250
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,915
Would risk her life
to save a stray dog.

251
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,504
So she says that you have
a cabin in Tahoe?

252
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,256
Near Heavenly.

253
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,925
He's gonna take me there
next weekend.

254
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,303
- So you're a big skier?
- He used to ski competitively.

255
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,180
You should see
the pictures on his wall.

256
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,140
Excuse me.

257
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,519
- Is Phoebe okay?
- Oh, no, you don't.

258
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:21,023
She's having dinner with a guy.
She's fine.

259
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,482
Well, listen to me.

260
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:26,653
I got a visit from a warlock,
and he is after her guy.

261
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,781
Okay, well, thanks for the tip.
We'll handle it.

262
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,409
Well, I'll stay here
on stakeout to help.

263
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:33,744
No, you can't.

264
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,747
Look, warlocks we can handle.
Demonic ex-husbands we cannot.

265
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,790
You have to get out of here
before she sees you.

266
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,834
Wait, did she get
a premonition today?

267
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,544
Did she save some guy's life?

268
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,673
- Okay.
- Hurry, she's coming. Go!

269
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,008
Looking forward to dessert.

270
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,844
Hey, look,

271
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,222
I know you think Miles and I
have nothing in common but...

272
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,682
Later for that.
Look, there's a warlock after Miles.

273
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,685
I just found out, don't ask me how,
but you need to get back in there.

274
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,146
Here, take these. What?

275
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,398
Miles was killed
while we were serving dessert.

276
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,361
Look out!

277
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:16,787
- He won't freeze.
- Blow him up.

278
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,794
Piper!

279
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,339
- Paige, the athame.
- Athame.

280
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,818
This warlock is not
in here anywhere.

281
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,444
Miles is still out cold.

282
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,196
You sure you don't want me
to heal him?

283
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,991
No, he's just got a bump
on the head. He'll be okay.

284
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,325
Well, he's lucky to be alive.

285
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,244
That was one powerful guy
that attacked him.

286
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,956
I just don't understand how a warlock
this strong cannot be in this book.

287
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,417
Well, I didn't have a chance
to tell you guys yet.

288
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:06,879
Cole dropped by right before
the attack. He knew it was coming.

289
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,881
It figures he's involved in this.

290
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,550
No, I'm not so sure.
He was trying to warn us.

291
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,760
We need to find out
what else he knows.

292
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,638
I wanna check with the Elders, see
what they know about our innocent.

293
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,016
Clearly he was the target
of the attack tonight.

294
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:20,934
Hurry back.

295
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,439
Should we tell Phoebe about Cole?

296
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,900
No.

297
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,444
She's got enough
to worry about tonight.

298
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,203
- Hi.
- Hi.

299
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,205
How you doing?

300
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:45,083
Okay, I think.
What...? What happened?

301
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,252
What do you think happened?

302
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:53,008
I don't know. I remember you
jumping over the table and then...

303
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,928
I don't know.

304
00:18:56,553 --> 00:19:00,933
What happened was mouldy plaster
and a really heavy chandelier.

305
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:10,275
Are you trying to tell me
you saved my life again?

306
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:11,818
Yeah.

307
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,323
Okay, I'm having
a really bad day here.

308
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,326
Or a really good day,
depending on how you look at it.

309
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,912
You escaped disaster twice.

310
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,665
That's two more times than most
people could say in a lifetime.

311
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,877
I'm starting to think that you should
stay by my side until my luck changes.

312
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:31,713
Maybe you're right.

313
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,154
Your kisses kill me.

314
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,534
Right back at you.

315
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,963
Come out, witch!

316
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,260
I know you're here.

317
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,560
Calm down,
you're embarrassing me.

318
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,021
- Who are you?
- You.

319
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,941
I remember being here.

320
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:37,738
Let's see now, the witch you're
looking for has the power of...

321
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,448
...invisibility, right?

322
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,625
How did you do that?

323
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,635
I'm not here to hurt you.

324
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,054
I need you.

325
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,474
We're taking over the underworld.

326
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,436
- What did you just say?
- You heard me.

327
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,730
I came from the future
on a different mission,

328
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,483
but this is a much better plan.

329
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:23,826
- Look, even if you are me, we can't...
- I am, and we can.

330
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,662
Do you know what I just did?

331
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:29,456
I faced all three Charmed Ones.

332
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:33,752
I was only expecting one,
but there they were.

333
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,713
And here I am, still alive.

334
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,507
- Yeah, so?
- So

335
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:41,093
with my knowledge in magic,
I realize we can take them out.

336
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,304
Of course, we'll need to steal
their Book of Shadows first, but...

337
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:47,015
That's crazy.
Evil can't touch that book.

338
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:51,061
Sure it can, with a little blood from
their line and a spell from the future.

339
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:55,732
- What spell?
- To cloak ourselves in goodness.

340
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:59,319
And don't worry, it wears off.

341
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:00,863
The Book of Shadows.

342
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:04,741
If we got that,
we'd be revered as lords.

343
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,953
Now that's the spirit.

344
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:11,081
Let's get to work on this spell.

345
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:16,378
You could have told us
he was a Jedi-master warlock.

346
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:19,006
- I didn't know.
- Well, what do you know?

347
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:22,676
His name is Bacarra. He claims to be
a future associate of mine.

348
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:23,969
How does he know that?

349
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,388
- Because he was there.
- In the future?

350
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,765
He came to tell me that
Phoebe dies in six months

351
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,685
from trying to save her boyfriend
from the Angel of Death.

352
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:34,354
Oh, no. We're screwed.

353
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:37,649
No, it's not all bad. Now that we know
what's after Miles, we can vanquish it.

354
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,526
No, you can't fight Death.

355
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:42,905
If it's Miles' time to go,
there's nothing we can do.

356
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,073
I told Phoebe rebounds never work.

357
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:52,039
Bacarra told me I could save
Phoebe's life by taking out this Miles.

358
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:54,166
I refused.

359
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:58,086
That must be why he attacked
at the manor, to do the job himself.

360
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:01,507
Wait a second. Why is a warlock
helping you in the future?

361
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,051
It really doesn't matter.

362
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,553
I'll help you find Bacarra
before he kills anyone.

363
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:10,516
Well, that's not such a bad idea,
considering you sent him here.

364
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,434
Or will send him here or whatever.

365
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:16,730
Just keep your guard up.
Bacarra knows things that we don't.

366
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:20,192
And do whatever you can with Phoebe.
She needs to let Miles die.

367
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,278
It's the only way to save her life.

368
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,619
Why are you so nervous?
I'm the one with all the bad luck.

369
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:34,289
No, I just think I'm still a little tense.

370
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:38,377
When I'm feeling tense,
that's where I go to relax.

371
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,171
That old rusty balcony?

372
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:46,468
Yeah. I sit out there,
I look at the stars...

373
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:47,761
What do you say?

374
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,429
No, are you kidding me?

375
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:53,892
I'm keeping you away from high places
and sharp objects and loose wiring.

376
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:57,729
You're restricted, mister,
to a soft mattress and fluffy pillows.

377
00:23:57,896 --> 00:23:58,939
Hey...

378
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:01,650
So the Elders wouldn't confirm
or deny that Death wants Miles.

379
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:03,569
So I basically took that
as a confirmation.

380
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,279
Still, why would Phoebe
get premonitions

381
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,155
off a guy that she's
not meant to save?

382
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:08,740
Well, Miles just isn't just any guy.

383
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:11,618
I mean, they have an intense
connection, physically and emotionally.

384
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,162
So you think their love connection

385
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:15,164
opened up some sort
of psychic connection?

386
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,667
Either that,
or a damn-the-world attitude.

387
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,670
Okay, Leo, we can take it from here.

388
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:30,637
- Hey.
- Hi.

389
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:34,808
Sorry to interrupt. Is Phoebe here?
It's kind of a family emergency.

390
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:37,811
Yeah, okay, sure.

391
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:45,402
Hey, what's the emergency?

392
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:49,740
We have a strong reason
to believe that it's...

393
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:54,286
It might sort of be Miles' time...

394
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,163
...to die.

395
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:58,749
Yeah.

396
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:12,054
Cole said he sent the warlock
back from the future

397
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,057
because you're gonna die trying
to save Miles from the Angel of Death.

398
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:17,726
So you want me to let this guy
that I really care about die

399
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,394
because Cole says so?

400
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,522
Phoebe, this has nothing
to do with Cole.

401
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:24,525
You know just as well as I do
that you can't stop Death.

402
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,985
This has everything to do with Cole.

403
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:28,612
It's not just Cole saying it.

404
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:32,115
Leo thinks that, you know,
it might also be Miles' time to die.

405
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:35,786
Leo thinks? He thinks?
That's the best you got?

406
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:38,580
That's the airtight case
you came here to present to me?

407
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:42,751
Phoebe, we are just trying to save you
from a hell of a lot of heartbreak.

408
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:44,169
I know, sweetie.

409
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:47,548
And I appreciate it
and I love you both for it,

410
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:49,800
but I am really happy.
Miles makes me really happy.

411
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,427
And I'm gonna do whatever
I have to do to try to protect him.

412
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:53,720
But you can't.

413
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,889
You gotta let him go.
He's gotta move on.

414
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:57,349
You know the Angel of Death...

415
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,643
Okay, enough about
the Angel of Death.

416
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,146
A warlock wants Miles.
You saw him and I saw him.

417
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:06,942
So now let's vanquish him.
Come on. Please, come on.

418
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:08,443
- Okay, we're going
- Be careful.

419
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,195
- Go, go, go.
- We're going!

420
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:18,954
Help. Somebody help!

421
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:21,665
Phoebe, help me! Phoebe!

422
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:22,916
Miles?

423
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:26,962
- Phoebe! Phoebe!
- Miles.

424
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:28,338
Pull me up.

425
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:30,799
Okay, hang on.

426
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,022
Stay away from me.

427
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:48,317
- What? Why?
- Something's wrong with me.

428
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,569
Or after me.

429
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,487
You're gonna get hurt.

430
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:56,158
- No, it's...
- I'm serious, Phoebe.

431
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,285
You have to go.

432
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,915
Okay, look, Miles,

433
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,542
whatever you're going through,
whatever is...

434
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,338
Whatever's happening
to you right now,

435
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,591
we're gonna
get through this together.

436
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,219
I'm...

437
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,095
I'm scared.

438
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:19,681
I know.

439
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:33,987
Not again.

440
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:37,950
Phoebe is never
gonna let Miles die voluntarily.

441
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:39,326
Well, I can't say I blame her.

442
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:41,119
Me neither, but we gotta
do something fast

443
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,831
before she really
falls in love with that guy.

444
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,750
Then there's our other problem.

445
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:50,254
- Blow him up.
- And get knocked on my ass again?

446
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:57,719
Piper!

447
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:00,973
Piper.

448
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,061
There's two of them.

449
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,573
What's he doing?

450
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,091
Don't worry.

451
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:37,759
We'll take good care of the Book.

452
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:47,561
I don't know how he did it.
He just took it.

453
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,730
He drank some weird potion
with my blood in it.

454
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,940
Maybe it's some weird future magic.

455
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:53,150
It's impossible.

456
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:55,861
One warlock does not have the power
to steal the Book of Shadows.

457
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:58,238
No, there was two of them,
but they were the same guy.

458
00:28:58,405 --> 00:28:59,531
They tag-teamed us.

459
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,618
Who cares how they did it, you guys.
They stole the Book of Shadows.

460
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:05,245
It's gone, and I'm not
entirely sure what could be worse.

461
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:06,455
We could be dead.

462
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:08,290
Yeah, well, we're gonna be
soon without it.

463
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:10,083
It's okay. We're gonna
get the Book back.

464
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,920
We just need to stay calm
and stay together.

465
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:42,616
Okay, I know you're here,
so you might as well just come out.

466
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,329
I realize this doesn't look good.

467
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,876
Cole, you've sunk low in the past.

468
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:57,089
But I never dreamed
that you would murder my boyfriend.

469
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,758
I'm not here for Miles.
I'm here for Bacarra.

470
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,302
He's out of control,
and I'm not gonna let him hurt you.

471
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:05,389
- Oh, so you're here to protect me?
- That's right.

472
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,140
Okay, well, stop with the protecting.

473
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,059
I am overprotected.

474
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:10,602
You have to let me live my life.

475
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,813
You're not gonna
have a life with Miles.

476
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,898
Death wants him.
Death is gonna get him.

477
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:16,942
Says you.

478
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:19,903
Why are you holding on
to him so tight?

479
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:24,783
You lost your right to ask me
that kind of question a long time ago.

480
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,043
- Hey.
- Hey, Phoebe.

481
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,378
Demon attack, we need you.

482
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:38,797
Meet me out front of Miles' apartment.
I'll orb you out.

483
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:40,257
Well, I can't leave Miles alone.

484
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:43,010
No, a warlock stole
the Book of Shadows, Phoebe.

485
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:45,846
- He's not just after Miles, he's after us.
- Oh, my God.

486
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,348
Okay, well, I'll wake Miles up
and bring him with me.

487
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:51,268
You don't have to do that.
I'll take care of him.

488
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,353
Hold on. Are you kidding me?

489
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,523
- If I kill him, you'll never trust me.
- Phoebe.

490
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:59,151
Are you out there, Phoebe?

491
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:01,904
- Hello?
- Phoebe?

492
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:04,448
Phoebe, where are you?

493
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,703
Hello? What's going on?

494
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:12,331
Did I hear you talking to someone?

495
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,125
Meet me outside.

496
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,129
I have to go.
There's a family emergency.

497
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:20,547
Is everything okay?

498
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,052
Yeah, I hope so.
I'm taking a really big risk here.

499
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:28,931
I don't know. What if my life
needs saving while you're gone?

500
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:33,060
I think you'll be safe tonight.

501
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:45,030
I knew their magic was good,
but I had no idea.

502
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:46,740
Careful with that.

503
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:49,785
There's a vanquishing spell in here
for every demon we've ever met.

504
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:52,746
Nobody is gonna challenge us.
Not even Cole.

505
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:55,707
Only one spell in there
matters to us now.

506
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,918
"To disempower a witch."

507
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,672
I'm almost done mixing the ingredients
that will infuse the magic.

508
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,465
Wait a second.

509
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:05,634
It says here
you need a fresh human heart.

510
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:09,304
Not a problem.

511
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,444
Do we know how
Bacarra even got here?

512
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:26,488
The Elders think
that he used a time ripple.

513
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:29,700
Whenever something stops
a destined event from occurring,

514
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:31,368
it sends a ripple through time.

515
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,163
And a powerful warlock like Bacarra
could have used it

516
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:37,499
if he knew the place
where destiny was cheated.

517
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:40,252
Well, that would be
where Phoebe and I saved Miles.

518
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:42,629
I can't believe we're still on this.

519
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:45,132
Death isn't after Miles, Bacarra is.

520
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,508
And look, I'm not crazy.

521
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,594
I just caught Cole staking out
Miles' apartment

522
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:50,095
to try and intercept him.

523
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,306
Yeah, Bacarra didn't pull
the trigger in the alley.

524
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,599
But how do we know?

525
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:56,268
Maybe mind control
is one of his future powers.

526
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:58,145
Okay, let's not argue
about how he got here.

527
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:00,189
He's here and he's got our Book.

528
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:02,608
Okay, that book holds
a century's worth of magic

529
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:04,693
that he can use against us.
Great.

530
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,112
Too many spells and potions
to remember,

531
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,031
let alone defend against.

532
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:10,866
We're dead.

533
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,951
- Again.
- And again.

534
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:19,082
Ladies, death cannot be feared.

535
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,628
For death, in time,
comes to all witches.

536
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:28,008
You know, the witch who says
she's not scared in battle is a liar.

537
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:30,177
The real witch is the one who fights.

538
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:32,429
- Honey.
- Yeah?

539
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,848
- Zip it.
- Okay.

540
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,684
I thought it was worth a shot.

541
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,103
I actually think Leo's right.

542
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:42,189
We've been through this before.

543
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:45,609
We can't get scared just because
Bacarra has the Book of Shadows.

544
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:48,487
In fact, maybe the Book
has been holding us back.

545
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:51,156
Bacarra knows exactly
what we're gonna do

546
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,534
because he knows
exactly how we're gonna fight.

547
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:57,204
Okay, so if we're gonna
vanquish him, and we will,

548
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:58,664
we need to change our tactics.

549
00:33:58,831 --> 00:34:01,625
We need new potions, new spells.
Stuff that he's never seen before.

550
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:04,461
- Let's go. Break.
- All right.

551
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:12,553
That's what I was trying to say.

552
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,639
Okay, the obscuring fog spell
is done.

553
00:34:15,848 --> 00:34:19,101
We could use this if we need
to fog up the joint for cover.

554
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:22,771
So that makes nine defensive
and 14 offensive spells.

555
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:25,357
Okay, we've almost got all
the new potions bottled.

556
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:29,820
Before the passing of this hour
Take away all their powers

557
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,196
Huh? What does that mean?

558
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:34,616
I don't know, but I don't like
the smug look on their faces.

559
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:36,702
Okay, that didn't go so well.

560
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,203
Okay, well, how about this:

561
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,456
We call upon Medusa's bones
Turn their flesh into stone

562
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:45,419
No. Okay, Piper, blow up something.

563
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:50,090
- I got nothing.
- I can't orb.

564
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:56,180
Leo?

565
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,319
Oh, my God.

566
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:12,196
And then there were none.

567
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:30,714
Leo, why are we here?

568
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:34,259
Do you realize that I think
I just watched my sisters die?

569
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:36,261
This is the alley
where you saved Miles.

570
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:39,681
Just try and stay calm.
We still have a chance.

571
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:41,141
A chance?

572
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,519
I just saw my sisters
get incinerated, Leo.

573
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:45,521
You can't heal ashes.

574
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:49,233
I don't want to heal them.
I want to set destiny back on track.

575
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,026
What?

576
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:54,446
It's already happened.
There's nothing we can do.

577
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:58,200
Not necessarily. The time ripple
Bacarra opened is gonna stay open

578
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:01,036
until he goes back through it
and returns to his time.

579
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,167
What are you looking for?

580
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:09,294
A hidden door.
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

581
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:14,049
If we can find it, we can travel back
and rewrite history like Bacarra did.

582
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:16,969
Make it so none of this
has ever happened.

583
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,850
The underworld belongs to us.

584
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:25,978
Which one of us?

585
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:28,981
Still distrustful.

586
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,527
Well, don't lose that quality.
It will help us go far.

587
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:35,946
Now, call a meeting
of the demonic leaders

588
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:37,614
and demand your rightful position.

589
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:38,949
Don't wait another second.

590
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:40,200
And what are you gonna do?

591
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:44,371
Return to the future where I belong.

592
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:46,623
You can catch up with me
in about six months.

593
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:51,336
If we could find the ripple,
it should send us back.

594
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,255
It's an infinite slipstream
through time.

595
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:55,215
Well, what if it carries us forward?

596
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:57,009
It won't.
Bacarra used it to get here,

597
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,720
so it'll keep flowing backwards
until he enters it to reverse it.

598
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:03,599
Okay, so we're going back.
What if it takes us too far back?

599
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:05,893
Well, we could wind up with tails.

600
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,145
What time did Phoebe
save Miles yesterday?

601
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:11,023
A little after 1.

602
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,900
Okay, well, use your watch.

603
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:25,454
Found it.

604
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:36,006
Go, now!

605
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:38,717
No!

606
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:30,185
The mobile customer you are trying
to reach is unavailable or outside...

607
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:35,357
Don't panic, I'm not a demon.

608
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:38,152
Okay? I'm you, obviously,
from the future.

609
00:38:38,527 --> 00:38:41,864
Apparently not very far in the future.
I just bought that top.

610
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:46,702
Listen to me. Miles has gotta die.
It's his time. It's his destiny.

611
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:48,078
And if Phoebe saves him today,

612
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:50,414
she'll be killed by a warlock,
along with Paige.

613
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:52,958
Wait a minute, slow down.
Why would a warlock...?

614
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,793
Because Phoebe
falls in love with Miles,

615
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,004
and she just keeps
saving him until...

616
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:58,672
Look, don't argue with me, okay?

617
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,049
We don't have time for this.
Just let Miles die.

618
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:07,431
Look, I don't know who you are
or what you are, but how do...?

619
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:09,391
What did you do that for?

620
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:15,355
When Phoebe asks left or right,
go to the right.

621
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,649
- What are you talking about?
- Just remember right.

622
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:18,984
And when this is all over,

623
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:21,653
make sure Phoebe knows
it was just meant to be, okay?

624
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,656
Oh, and by the way,
the next time she falls for a guy,

625
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:28,160
do not stand in her way, okay?

626
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,997
I'm not standing in her way.

627
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,416
He's gone.

628
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,127
Oh, no.

629
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:41,590
- This idiot is blocking me in.
- It's only two blocks, let's run.

630
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:53,894
- Okay, this is the street. Right or left?
- Good question.

631
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:56,104
What do we do? I don't remember.

632
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:58,899
I don't know, Phoebe.
I don't know here.

633
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,692
Piper, come on.

634
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:03,695
Right, go right.

635
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:05,948
Oh, God, forgive me.

636
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,996
We're going the wrong way,
it's behind us.

637
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:31,473
S.F.P.D. Drop your weapon!

638
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,809
On the ground, now!

639
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:38,188
Put your hands behind your back!

640
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:57,518
Phoebe, can we?

641
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:06,652
Okay.

642
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:08,529
How long have you guys
been standing there?

643
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:11,782
Long enough to know you've got
some serious '80s dance moves.

644
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,827
I guess you don't need comfort food.

645
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:19,998
- What you doing?
- A little laundry.

646
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,544
- Yeah, you don't do laundry.
- Yeah.

647
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:26,296
- Are you okay?
- No.

648
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:30,259
Are those chocolate chip?

649
00:42:32,928 --> 00:42:35,013
I'm never gonna be okay
losing an innocent.

650
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:37,266
You know, and I just...

651
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:40,394
I'm having a really hard time
accepting the fact

652
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:43,355
that I wasn't supposed to save him.

653
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:47,317
Wasn't Miles a little bit more
than just an innocent to you?

654
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:52,281
I think I wanted him to be.

655
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:54,491
For all the reasons Piper said.

656
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,662
But I just have to concentrate
on me right now.

657
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:02,332
You know, and not be afraid
that I may never find love again.

658
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:08,589
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.
You will definitely find love again.

659
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:12,092
You think?

660
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:14,052
Actually, I know.

661
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:18,015
And I, for one, can guarantee you
that when it does happen for you,

662
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:20,726
I will not be holding you back at all.

663
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:22,978
Thanks, I think.

664
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:27,357
Piper, is there something
you know that we don't know?

665
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:32,404
Well, let's just say I had
a little premonition of my own.

666
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:36,909
- Hey.
- Piper, hey.
