1
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,714
Oh, I can't find my keys.

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:06,924
Oh, that's okay.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,468
Because it's only an hour or so
before I leave for my honeymoon.

4
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,845
Sorry, Mrs. Mitchell.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,723
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm keeping my own last name.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,934
Really? You're not even gonna
hyphenate it?

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,645
Matthews-Mitchell?
I'm thinking it sounds like a law firm.

8
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,898
- Yeah.
- Yeah. So how's Cupid?

9
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,567
You mean Coop?
He's fine, but don't ask.

10
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,319
What? I thought you said
he was cute.

11
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,155
He is cute,
but he's also a magical pain in the...

12
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,158
- Wow, look at this spread.
- It is something.

13
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:37,120
Oh, it's nothing. It's just kind of
to wish Paige bon voyage.

14
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,664
It has been like this all week.

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,832
Besides, it's nice having
company again, you know,

16
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,418
considering everybody in my life
is moving on or moving out.

17
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,588
I'm thinking she means us.

18
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,549
Waffle, sweetie?

19
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,717
<i>When will you rescue me from this?</i>

20
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,386
- Christy.
- Hey.

21
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,763
- No telepathy at the table.
- Sorry.

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,682
Have you guys checked into
these rumours

23
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,684
about students being attacked
at Magic School?

24
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,186
- If you need any help, I can stay.
- Paige.

25
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,692
I'm just saying. Fine.

26
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,528
I am just a jingle away
if you need me.

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,072
I'll be in Bora Bora,
which is two hours behind,

28
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,740
so don't wake me unless you have to.

29
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,701
But it's okay if you have to.
It's okay.

30
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,828
All right, stop it. It's time for gifts.

31
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,706
Oh, yeah. Happy honeymoon
from all of us.

32
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,546
There's nothing in here.

33
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,340
Exactly, nothing. As in no demons.

34
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,885
And no warlocks, no complications.

35
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,054
A honeymoon that is completely
free of distractions.

36
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,598
Except Henry.

37
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,558
And before you say anything,
don't worry.

38
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,186
Phoebe, Billie and I have things
completely under control.

39
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,062
You know,
Christy's doing just fine too.

40
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,939
- You think?
- Oh, yeah. Are you kidding?

41
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,900
All the progress you've made.

42
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,952
What are you doing here?

43
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,414
Your purpose is to lure your sister
away from the Charmed Ones,

44
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,917
not become enmeshed yourself.

45
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,253
I don't need you
to tell me how to do my job.

46
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,463
Now go.

47
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,090
Now.

48
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,099
You're practically one of us.

49
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,536
Are you sure you need this much stuff
for Tahiti?

50
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:27,958
Well, you know, it's kind of more
for me staying over at Henry's forever.

51
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,835
Well, I hope he's got a big closet.

52
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,504
Although that does leave more room
for your stuff.

53
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,174
Oh, I don't have any stuff.

54
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,092
You will have stuff.
Every girl needs stuff.

55
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,011
We've got tons.
You can have some of ours.

56
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,679
You gotta wear something.

57
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,014
<i>Help.</i>

58
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,559
I guess I'd better go.
Don't wanna miss my honeymoon.

59
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,145
Are you sure you're gonna be okay
without me?

60
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,105
Well, we won't know
until you're gone.

61
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,567
I'm just kidding.

62
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,528
Look, go. Have a good time.
Don't worry.

63
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,240
Okay. I'll go. I'll have fun.
I'll wear my sun block.

64
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,034
Bye, guys.

65
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,539
- She's gonna drive Henry crazy.
- Yeah.

66
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,791
Oh, excuse me.

67
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,256
Are you okay?

68
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,259
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm fine.

69
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,013
I just kind of feel like, you know,
that that should be us.

70
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,390
Yeah, moving out
and finding our own place.

71
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,519
What? Why? This place is great.
We have the "Book of Shadows,"

72
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,647
- we have potion ingredients...
- And Piper.

73
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,108
Look, she's great, okay? Really.

74
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,946
But part of me feels like
she's using us.

75
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:43,033
And I'm gonna explode
if she feeds me any more food.

76
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,119
- She's just trying to help.
- I know, but she's not our mom.

77
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,580
Speaking of which,
Mom and Dad are in town right now.

78
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,083
They want to see you.
They've already come out here twice.

79
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,417
- Billie.
- Come on.

80
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,586
Can't you just, like,
meet them for lunch today?

81
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,172
Their plane leaves tonight.
Start to get to know them.

82
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,132
- I can't.
- Why not?

83
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,261
Because I'm still angry at them.

84
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,764
I know it doesn't
make any sense, but...

85
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:12,312
A part of me feels like
they abandoned me.

86
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,691
I'm just not ready
to see them right now, okay?

87
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,820
Little guy is hungry.
Hey, how about lunch?

88
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,613
I can't, I'm meeting my parents.

89
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,782
Oh, okay.
Christy, what about you?

90
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,373
<i>I swear to God,
I think she's trying to kill me.</i>

91
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,501
It's like death by dinner.

92
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,505
Do you know how hard it is to smile
when you're nauseous?

93
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,467
Then leave.
And take your sister with you.

94
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,052
It's not that simple.

95
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,139
I have to draw Billie out
without her knowing it.

96
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,308
Or letting yourself be drawn in.

97
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,642
And the longer you take,

98
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,520
the greater the chance you'll be
distracted from our ultimate goal.

99
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,815
That's not gonna happen.
Piper's mothering will see to that.

100
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,826
The shoe's on the other foot now,
isn't it?

101
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,582
- How does it feel, witch?
- What the hell is going on?

102
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,667
No one is to be here.

103
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,169
Back off, old man.

104
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,634
I am Candor, a Triad,

105
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,055
and I will not be disparaged
by the likes of you.

106
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,194
- Stop him.
- Let him go.

107
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,240
Don't you know we're trying
to change the world here?

108
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,991
Your witch is nothing
compared to that.

109
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,161
That witch spent a year torturing us.

110
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,205
We deserve our revenge.

111
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,207
And you shall have it.

112
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,584
But not here and not now.

113
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,465
Now, then, back to your sister.

114
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,970
Why wouldn't she want to see us?

115
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,681
I just don't understand.

116
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,308
I know, Mom. You know,
she's just been through a lot.

117
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,144
Well, it's obvious to me
she still blames us.

118
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,605
Then why can't she talk to us
and tell us that, then?

119
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,486
Wait.
Billie, is she still hearing voices?

120
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,946
No, no.

121
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,157
But you know, Piper was just saying
how much progress she's made.

122
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,951
I don't know.
When it comes to you guys,

123
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,786
there's just something
holding her back.

124
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,371
You think there's a chance

125
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,415
she might get over that something
by tonight?

126
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:40,252
You can tell her we'll meet her
anywhere for however long. I just...

127
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,962
I would just talk to her on the phone.

128
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,089
We just want some kind of contact.

129
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,301
I know, I know.
And I've tried talking to her.

130
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,013
Let me just see what I can do.

131
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,849
Thank you, honey.

132
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,101
You're welcome.

133
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,647
Billie, look. I need you
to tell Christy something for me, okay?

134
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:05,194
Tell her we love her, we do,

135
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,946
but that I won't keep
putting your mother through this.

136
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,033
I can't. If she won't see us now,

137
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,535
we're not flying out here again.

138
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,802
- Oh, no, not you again.
- Yeah, me again.

139
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,721
Can't run from love, Phoebe.
You know that.

140
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,848
Oh, does it look like I'm running?

141
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,976
Because I'm not running,
I'm walking.

142
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,443
All right, so answer me this:

143
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,071
When was the last time
you had a date?

144
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,325
I have dates all the time,
thank you very much.

145
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,160
Come on. I mean a real date.

146
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,162
You know,
one that takes your breath away,

147
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,248
where it's the first thing
you think about

148
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:03,085
- when you wake up in the morning.
- Actually, it hasn't been that long.

149
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,170
Yeah? How long?

150
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,550
Well, it's...

151
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,474
Okay, you know what?
Maybe it has, but so what?

152
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,268
Because it's not natural.

153
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,519
Especially not for you.

154
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,771
I mean, you're all about love.
You always have been.

155
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,274
Only now you're resisting
and don't even realise it.

156
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,359
Okay. You just have it all figured out.

157
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,363
It's my job. It's what I do.

158
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,991
You know,
it's not your fault, Phoebe.

159
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,159
You made a lot of sacrifices
for the greater good

160
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,870
and they've taken their toll.

161
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,957
But that's why the Elders
sent me to help.

162
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,756
Okay, what is that?

163
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,800
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

164
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,803
It's what you're doing.
It's coming from your heart.

165
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,391
Have some kind of an energy field
on you, a block.

166
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,186
It's preventing you
from even being open to love.

167
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,398
- Well, any idea what's causing it?
- No, I didn't even know I had it.

168
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,067
Well, all the more reason
to get going.

169
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,111
Get going where?
Where are we going?

170
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,489
Gonna figure out
what's causing the block. Ready?

171
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,076
<i>Well, it's that time of year again.</i>

172
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,663
<i>The historic Golden Gate Bridge
is getting a makeover.</i>

173
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,416
<i>- And if it seems like only yesterday...
- Are we in the past?</i>

174
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,085
We don't want to disrupt him.
It could change the future.

175
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,005
<i>With its signature red-orange paint...</i>

176
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,305
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, sure.

177
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,725
Oh, if you're looking for Julie,
she's not here.

178
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,395
Well, that's not entirely true.

179
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,314
Sorry?

180
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:52,611
I wish that there was an easy way
to explain this to you,

181
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,488
to lessen the blow,

182
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,783
but there isn't.

183
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:04,414
So I'm just gonna show you.

184
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,958
Show me what?

185
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,627
Forgive me.

186
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,603
I guess mortals and magic
don't always mix, huh?

187
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,772
Gee, you think?

188
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,401
I mean, still,
it's just one little incident.

189
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,736
Not enough to cause a block
like the one you have.

190
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,155
Oh, believe me,
this is just the latest one.

191
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,700
There are many, many more.

192
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,535
Really?

193
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,204
Show me.

194
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:58,719
- Oh, hey, look at you.
- Yeah, look at me.

195
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,180
Oh, that dress looks great.

196
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,765
No, it doesn't.

197
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:06,894
It's Piper's, she altered it for me.

198
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,980
- That's so sweet.
- No, it's not sweet.

199
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,524
I mean, okay. Yeah, it's sweet,

200
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,360
but it's just weird, you know?

201
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:19,072
I mean, we're not her sisters.
You and I are sisters.

202
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,074
Oh, she's just overcompensating,
you know.

203
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,951
It's that whole empty-nest thing.

204
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,370
Besides, Mom and Dad
would really like to see you in it.

205
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,123
- Again with Mom and Dad?
- Yes, and you know why?

206
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,876
Dad said if you don't see them tonight,
they're not coming back.

207
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:33,587
From what you said, Billie,
that sounds like Dad being Dad.

208
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,882
No, it's not. Look, they don't know
what's going on with you.

209
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,091
Neither do I.

210
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,385
But, Billie, I told you
what was going on with me.

211
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,764
Yeah, but you keep talking about
this whole family-bond thing.

212
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,266
Without our parents,
we're only half of what we should be.

213
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:52,397
Coming. Doesn't she look great?

214
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,693
All right, already.

215
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,862
We need to see Leo. Fast.

216
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,783
- Hello. Who are you?
- Leo's students from Magic School.

217
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,284
Demons are trying to kill us.

218
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,122
Oh, okay. Well, take it easy.
Let's go this way.

219
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,834
Easy, easy.

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,669
Oh, easy.

221
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:23,178
Maybe we should call Paige
so she can heal him.

222
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,305
No, I'm fine. Really.

223
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,933
You're not fine, Ryan.
They nearly killed you.

224
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,060
- Who's "they"?
- The Noxon demons.

225
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,438
- Leo knows all about them.
- Okay, well, humour me for a second.

226
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,357
He trapped them in Magic School

227
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,068
so he could use them
for our Advanced Combat class.

228
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,947
- Didn't he tell you?
- You are Piper Halliwell, aren't you?

229
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,950
Well, yeah, of course I am.

230
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:48,287
But you know, he didn't...
He doesn't always tell me everything.

231
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,122
Okay, why are they after you?

232
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,333
To get even with us.
With the whole class.

233
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,086
Somehow, they got out
and now they're hunting us down.

234
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,130
By hunting, you mean?

235
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:00,716
There were five of us in the class.

236
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:04,136
- But only Jen and I are left.
- Barely.

237
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,889
Leo said if we ever ran into trouble
to come here.

238
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,432
So where is he?

239
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,311
Well, he's not here right now

240
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,688
and he probably won't be home
for some time.

241
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,315
Can't you call him?

242
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,317
He doesn't have
his cell phone on him.

243
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:19,860
But you know what? That's okay.

244
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,237
I can handle this.
Don't panic, don't worry.

245
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,948
Why don't you and Christy
go check the "Book. "

246
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,241
Okay.

247
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,826
But you don't understand.

248
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,454
They can't be vanquished.
At least not permanently.

249
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,207
What does that mean?
What do you mean by that, exactly?

250
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,002
Other demons experimented on them,
made them unvanquishable.

251
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:40,255
That's why Leo wanted them.
So he could keep practising on them.

252
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,841
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait.

253
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,718
You can't go anywhere,
you can barely walk.

254
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:48,722
Look, if we don't keep moving,
we're dead.

255
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,725
Leo was the only one who knew
how to stop them and he's not here.

256
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,852
Okay, well, what am I, chopped liver?

257
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,897
Listen, Leo is my husband
and if he sent you here for help,

258
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,482
then help is what you're gonna get.

259
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,694
Christy, come on,
Piper and those kids need help.

260
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,656
I just... I can't be near any more
demons anymore, okay?

261
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,366
Not after everything
I've been through.

262
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:08,742
Okay, I understand,

263
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,078
but they're not after you,
so you don't have to worry.

264
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,247
Nothing is gonna happen to you,
I promise.

265
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,498
You said that last time.

266
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,125
Well, I know, but this time I mean it.

267
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,045
Look, Christy, you can
use your powers to help people now.

268
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,256
We can do it together.
It's a great thing.

269
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,216
It can make up for a lot of bad stuff.

270
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,887
Now, can we just go back out there
and help Piper, please?

271
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,472
I can't.

272
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,767
Because then we'll miss
Mom and Dad.

273
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,645
- What?
- You said they were leaving, right?

274
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,063
We don't wanna miss them.

275
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,191
Piper can take care of them.
Come on, let's go.

276
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,780
- It's not as bad as it seems.
- No?

277
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,242
The Triad sent us off
like a pair of low-level demons.

278
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,161
We are low-level demons.

279
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,371
He made us lose the witch,

280
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:57,791
stood between us and revenge.

281
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,587
Still, we will make them pay.

282
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:06,925
Rondok, that was a Triad.

283
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:10,012
If we anger him again
he won't just banish us,

284
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,306
he'll send us to a fate
worse than death.

285
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:17,895
Have you forgotten how we've been
made to suffer already, brother?

286
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,440
Trapped, used, hammered with spells,

287
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,984
splattered with potions,
vanquished over and over

288
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,778
without a care for the humiliation
we had to endure.

289
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:28,614
No.

290
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,116
No one could forget that.

291
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:36,455
We only have two witches left to catch
and make suffer.

292
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:40,417
We will find them. We must.

293
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,713
<i>Now where are we?</i>

294
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:48,550
This is your past.
I'm just following your heart.

295
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,230
Man.

296
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,774
I've been looking all over for you.

297
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,656
- Nice.
- Yeah.

298
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,534
You went back too far.
This isn't my past, this is my past life.

299
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,953
Still, your past life
can inform your present one.

300
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,080
All right? This can be telling.

301
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,999
Oh, this is very, very telling.

302
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:44,398
Why must you tease me, Anton?

303
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,528
Oh, that was very intimate.

304
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,822
Why didn't that one work out?

305
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:55,534
My sisters had to vanquish him
because he was a demon.

306
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,499
Yeah, that would ruin a relationship.

307
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,502
That was the only demon
you dated, though, wasn't it?

308
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,047
Hardly.

309
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,430
I couldn't think of a better day to die.

310
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:18,515
Sorry.

311
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,853
I also helped you find love, didn't I?

312
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,314
Come on, I did, didn't I?
I did, sure I did.

313
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,691
- You did.
- Close one.

314
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:30,611
If that doesn't get me into heaven,
I don't know what will.

315
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:35,157
- You liked him, didn't you?
- Yeah.

316
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:39,203
Too bad he only had a year to live
and this was his last day.

317
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,246
Yeah, that is too bad.

318
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,583
I guess I fell for the right guy
this time.

319
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,462
Alas, pumpkin time.

320
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,175
I don't need you
watching my messy demise.

321
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,489
Think of me when you dance.

322
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,624
I'll miss you.

323
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,216
I think I'm beginning to understand.

324
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,600
Well, you know, love wouldn't be love
without a few heartbreaks.

325
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:46,061
It's like a mating dance, you know?

326
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,813
Helps you find
what you're looking for.

327
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,274
Yeah, but I've had more
than just a few heartbreaks.

328
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,318
I mean, it's been like this
for the last seven and a half years.

329
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,153
I'm just... I'm tired of it.

330
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,364
Oh, come on.
It couldn't have been that bad.

331
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,992
You must have had some successes
over that time, right?

332
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:02,327
What was the longest relationship
you ever had?

333
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,624
Cole.

334
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,130
Okay, so the next time
the Noxons attack,

335
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,465
we'll be ready for them.

336
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,718
What about the whole
"unvanquishable" thing?

337
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,804
You know, Magic School rules
don't always apply to the outside world.

338
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,014
It's kind of like Vegas.

339
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:25,225
Listen, really, if Leo was concerned,

340
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,311
he would have
mentioned something to me before.

341
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,022
- Are you sure? Because...
- Positive. Just...

342
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:32,357
When they show up,
just stand back and watch out.

343
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,862
- You sure you don't want us to help?
- We can, you know. Leo taught us...

344
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:39,531
Yeah, but that was school.
And this is kind of real.

345
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:40,866
So, you know, look,

346
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,535
you came here for protection,
so let me protect you. Okay?

347
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,162
That's that.

348
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,541
Get down.

349
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:03,847
He's coming back!

350
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:16,235
Okay, so I may have underestimated
this unvanquishable stuff

351
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,736
just a little bit.

352
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:29,832
Hey, there they are.

353
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,962
Wait.
What if I'm not what they expect?

354
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,172
What if I'm not what they want?

355
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,299
- Tell them I got sick.
- No.

356
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:40,926
Billie...

357
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,928
You were held captive by demons
for 15 years.

358
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,013
You can handle 15 minutes
with Mom and Dad.

359
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,433
Come on.

360
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,067
Baby.

361
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,740
I am so glad to see you.

362
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,577
Yeah, you too.

363
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,956
Oh, thank God.

364
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,917
Okay, come sit.

365
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:16,128
I just wanna look at you
for a minute.

366
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,548
You're so beautiful.

367
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:24,720
Really, you'd never know
anything ever happened.

368
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:27,639
Well, so how are you feeling? Okay?

369
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:30,017
Yeah, I'm okay.

370
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,643
Yeah?

371
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:34,021
Billie's taking good care of me.

372
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,064
Well, yes, and the sisters.

373
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,735
I'm not surprised.
You two were always so close.

374
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:41,361
Oh, it's Piper.

375
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,031
Sorry, I gotta take this.

376
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:47,659
<i>Don't leave me here.</i>

377
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:49,161
Relax, you're doing fine.

378
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,123
<i>- Hello?
- Billie?</i>

379
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,374
I need you.

380
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,251
<i>Piper, I can't really talk right now.</i>

381
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,086
I'm in the middle
of something important.

382
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:01,215
I know, and I'm really sorry,
but the Noxons just attacked here.

383
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,050
<i>- And?
- Honestly?</i>

384
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,219
I have no idea
how to vanquish them.

385
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,764
Okay, I'm coming over. Bye.

386
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,308
You guys, I'm sorry.
I really have to go. Piper needs me.

387
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:14,520
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, just one of many crises.

388
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:18,148
All right, I'll meet you guys
back at the hotel, okay?

389
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,567
<i>I hate you.</i>

390
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:24,696
So...

391
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,199
Can I ask you a question?

392
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:28,700
Of course you can, honey.

393
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:31,203
You can ask us anything.

394
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,289
How hard did you look for me?

395
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,876
Oh, baby.

396
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:40,379
We tried everything
we could think of, honey.

397
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:44,049
We tracked down
every lead we could find.

398
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:46,134
But even with all that,
you were just...

399
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:49,096
You were someplace we couldn't go.

400
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:51,056
That's why this is such a miracle.

401
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,728
Yeah, it is.

402
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:59,064
<i>What are you doing?</i>

403
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:00,816
Leave me alone.

404
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:03,068
Christy, are you all right?

405
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:05,737
<i>Do not go down this path.</i>

406
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,155
Show yourself.

407
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,417
- How dare you interrupt me.
- You gave me no choice.

408
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,502
Every step you take
toward your mortal family

409
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,254
is a step away
from our ultimate goal.

410
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,006
I had to come see them.

411
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:25,966
Otherwise Billie
would've gotten suspicious.

412
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,468
Perhaps. But they're swaying you
and you know it.

413
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:31,138
Don't make me take matters
into my own hands.

414
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:33,348
Don't you threaten me.

415
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,482
You don't have the power
to destroy me,

416
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:47,487
and you won't either,
until you're free of the ties that bind.

417
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,120
- Christy.
- Baby.

418
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,289
What happened?

419
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:01,126
<i>What can I say? Desperate times
call for desperate measures.</i>

420
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,755
Look, Leo's just seriously indisposed
at the moment.

421
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:06,840
We can't call him,
we can't ask him anything.

422
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,634
Then what do we do?

423
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,636
We batten down the hatches
with the crystals

424
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,804
- and come up with a new plan.
- And us?

425
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:15,807
You guys stay up here where
you're protected, I'll deal with the rest.

426
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,434
We could help. Leo would want us...

427
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,978
Look, Leo is gone, okay?
I'm all you got.

428
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,648
Deal with it. I do.

429
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:28,445
Hey, listen. I gotta get back,
so, what's the plan?

430
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,906
I know. Here, take a crystal,
we're covering the house.

431
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:33,909
- That's it?
- Yes. Apparently, Leo is the only one

432
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:35,744
who knew how to vanquish
these demons

433
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,788
and he didn't leave me instructions.

434
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:39,748
Well, maybe we should call Paige
and Phoebe.

435
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:42,668
No, Paige hasn't even
been on her honeymoon 24 hours yet.

436
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:44,711
I already called Phoebe.
She's not answering.

437
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:48,048
- That's not good.
- No, she's fine. She's with Cupid.

438
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:50,551
Only God knows what they're doing.

439
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,723
So where's this?

440
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,685
Where Cole and I first met.

441
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:11,572
- Cole.
- Hi. How's it going?

442
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,742
The cute meet.

443
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,244
Yeah, he was just setting me up.

444
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:20,539
Wow, is this embarrassing. L...

445
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,374
It's okay, I'm okay.

446
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,962
- Nice calf.
- Oh, thanks.

447
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,632
- Can I have it back?
- Sure. Sure.

448
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,925
Okay.

449
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,219
Still, I can tell
you were attracted to him.

450
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:35,596
And him to you.

451
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,139
Just another demon.

452
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:40,434
Come on, he couldn't have been just
another demon. You married the guy.

453
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:43,395
You had to have at least loved him.

454
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:45,898
I did.

455
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:47,816
So, what happened?

456
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:51,445
Same thing that always happens.

457
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:59,244
Phoebe, are you crazy?
Throw it before he shimmers out.

458
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:00,454
There, go.

459
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:02,956
She's not gonna throw it, are you?

460
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:04,917
Throw the potion.

461
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:06,919
We've been through
so much together.

462
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:09,087
Haven't we?

463
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:14,009
Our love's so strong,
nothing can destroy it. Not even this.

464
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:17,971
We're meant to be together.

465
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,601
I don't think so.

466
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:23,977
No!

467
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,192
No!

468
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,200
Seen enough?

469
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,245
To understand the block, yeah.

470
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,455
But now I need to show you
why they say

471
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:47,626
that it's better to have loved and lost
than to have never have loved at all.

472
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:55,634
I just knew something terrible like this
was going to happen.

473
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:58,846
Well, you know, I don't think Leo knew
the demons would escape.

474
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,598
I feel like there was so much
about his life that I didn't know.

475
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,767
His past life, this life.
And it's bad enough

476
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:06,770
- my kids don't have a dad to play with.
- It's gonna be okay.

477
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:09,648
Come on, you have powers,
I have powers, the boys are safe.

478
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:11,733
We can handle this, don't worry.

479
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,655
Hello. Oh, don't worry. It's virgin.

480
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:20,159
Paige, what are you doing here?

481
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:22,661
You know, I just had some time
in my spa schedule

482
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:24,997
and I thought I'd kind of come by
and check on things

483
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:27,541
because I missed you guys
a little bit, maybe.

484
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:32,045
Why are there crystals
kind of all around?

485
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:34,548
Crystals?

486
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:37,718
You know, it's nothing. It's just to
make sure we don't have any trouble.

487
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:39,928
Are you expecting trouble?

488
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,930
- Nope, not at all.
- No.

489
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:44,808
No, it's just precaution, you know,
while you're on your honeymoon.

490
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:47,978
- Hey, how's that going?
- It's fantastic.

491
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:49,938
Good, good, good.
You should get back to it.

492
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,441
- Go, you know. Go see your husband.
- Golly.

493
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:55,402
"Husband," that sounds weird.
You're right.

494
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,487
Bye, guys.

495
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,534
Back to our demons.

496
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,038
I know we can do this, Pator.

497
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:08,582
Just like I knew the students
would lead us to Leo.

498
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:10,876
But to go back so soon...

499
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:13,295
His wife's a Charmed One,

500
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,339
and the vanquishes are excruciating.

501
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:19,384
Still, even she can't make them last,
otherwise she would have.

502
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:21,929
Attacking again
is the only way to draw Leo out

503
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,764
for our ultimate revenge.

504
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:27,643
Unfortunately, it is a revenge
beyond your reach.

505
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:32,814
You don't have the power to destroy
a Charmed One. Not without my help.

506
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,651
So now you're willing to help us.

507
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:39,404
If you first help me
remove a small obstacle to my goals.

508
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:42,991
One that even you can handle,
I assure you.

509
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:44,993
Then we'll all get what we want.

510
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:47,996
Interested?

511
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,759
- You all right?
- Yeah.

512
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:02,344
I figure if we can't vanquish them,

513
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:04,513
might as well give them something
to think about.

514
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,265
Unless maybe you found something.

515
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:10,227
No, just Magic School memos,
course studies,

516
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:12,896
field trips Leo was planning.

517
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:16,108
I guess I should have asked him
how his day was more often.

518
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,110
Well, you guys had busy lives.

519
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:20,445
Yeah, but at least
if we had talked a bit more,

520
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:22,614
I might be closer to finding
a solution for this.

521
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,534
- We've got a solution.
- To what?

522
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,953
Vanquishing the Noxons
once and for all.

523
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,913
We use the astral plane.

524
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,541
- Wait, the astral what?
- Astral plane.

525
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:35,919
According to Leo,
in the astral plane, time stops.

526
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:39,923
Which means anyone transported
there can't move forward in time.

527
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,467
What does that have to do
with the Noxons?

528
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:44,803
If we vanquish them
and send them to the astral plane

529
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,724
before they can regenerate,
they'll be trapped there forever.

530
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:50,809
In perpetual vanquish.

531
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:53,478
Okay, but we can't even
get close enough to them

532
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:54,980
to send them anywhere.

533
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:57,065
We could if they were distracted.

534
00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:59,276
- By what?
- By what they've been after.

535
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:03,280
You guys want to
use yourselves as bait?

536
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:05,157
Leo always said
to use our powers for good.

537
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:07,743
Well, we want to use them
to stop these demons.

538
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,204
Look, I understand the enthusiasm,
really, I do.

539
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,914
- But I can't risk it.
- Why not?

540
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,332
We're willing to take the risk.

541
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,459
I don't think Leo
would want you to do that.

542
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,503
- I think he would.
- You don't know that.

543
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:19,171
And you do?

544
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:25,219
You know what?
I don't want to do this anymore.

545
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,970
- Wait, there's something else.
- What?

546
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:28,847
The way all your relationships
have ended,

547
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:31,016
I'm surprised your block's
not as big as a house.

548
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:33,352
Exactly. That's what
I'm talking about, thank you.

549
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,479
Well, what about
the way they all started?

550
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,439
- What?
- Oh, come on.

551
00:31:37,606 --> 00:31:39,525
The way that love begins.

552
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:42,903
You know, when your eyes meet
from across the room for the first time

553
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,364
and you see each other.
Everything is just right.

554
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:49,368
You know, there's that moment,
there's the spark.

555
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:51,203
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

556
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,121
Yeah, I know, that's my point.

557
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,082
With everything
that's happened to you,

558
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:57,876
that is what you've forgotten.

559
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:02,881
And that is what
you need to remember.

560
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:09,388
<i>You are looking at 6 pounds,
8 ounces.</i>

561
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:11,390
<i>- How old is he?
- Three weeks today.</i>

562
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:14,560
<i>You look pretty good for a woman
who had a baby three weeks ago.</i>

563
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:15,811
<i>Jason Dean.</i>

564
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,397
The spark.

565
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:21,567
<i>You've got me, Jason Dean.
I'm yours.</i>

566
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,743
Remember that one?

567
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:33,912
<i>I better call you back.</i>

568
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:37,666
<i>Hi. I hope it's okay.
I just wanted to get started.</i>

569
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,501
<i>- Leslie?
- Surprise.</i>

570
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:40,919
<i>You can call me Les.</i>

571
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,922
<i>Oh, not again.</i>

572
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:57,644
Okay, enough, enough.

573
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:01,773
Don't you see?

574
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,277
Phoebe, it's about the way
love begins.

575
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:10,949
When it's uncensored, unmatched.
When it's pure.

576
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:13,535
And that's what you need
to believe in.

577
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:30,636
- Is it gone?
- Oh, yeah. You're ready.

578
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,264
- For what?
- To begin again.

579
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:40,687
Well, it looks like you've
done a lot for yourself, huh, Dad?

580
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:45,984
Yeah, but I would have traded it all
for you in a second.

581
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:47,861
Know that, honey.

582
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:49,613
I know.

583
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:54,117
Well, I better go down
and settle the bill.

584
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:55,953
I'll be right back.

585
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:08,340
Oh, I just don't want this to end.

586
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:14,847
You know, maybe next time, you
and Billie can come back home, huh?

587
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:16,682
Yeah, maybe.

588
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:20,394
There's just a few things
we have to deal with first.

589
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:21,728
But it would be nice.

590
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,357
Honey, are you sure
everything's okay?

591
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,610
After what happened
in the park, I'm...

592
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:30,487
Yeah, everything is fine.

593
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:34,366
There's just some things
that I have to shake from my past.

594
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,243
But I will.

595
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,871
Yes, you will.

596
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:48,547
<i>- Hello?
- Christy, it's Piper.</i>

597
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,257
<i>Billie needs you right away.</i>

598
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,718
<i>- Why, what's wrong?
- I'll explain when you get here.</i>

599
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:54,386
<i>Hurry.</i>

600
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:56,722
Is everything okay?

601
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:58,807
I don't know. I gotta go.

602
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:00,559
Wait.

603
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:02,477
- Christy...
- I gotta go.

604
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:04,313
Wait...

605
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:08,066
I love you.

606
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:23,749
Leo, what am I supposed to do?

607
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:29,463
I can't let these kids risk their lives,
but I'm running out of options.

608
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,882
And if I do let them do this,

609
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:34,426
how am I supposed to know
if it's gonna work anyway?

610
00:35:34,593 --> 00:35:37,012
Let them try.

611
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,767
Daddy would.

612
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:56,448
Okay, we do it your way.

613
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:00,619
I got it. I got it.

614
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:06,124
- Billie, are you okay?
- Yeah, what are you doing here?

615
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,127
Piper called me.
You said that you needed me.

616
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:11,088
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

617
00:36:11,255 --> 00:36:13,298
You called me on the phone,
you told me that you...

618
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:16,301
Christy, what's going on?

619
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:20,889
Oh, my God. Mom and Dad.
Come on, let's go.

620
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:28,480
Okay, we're all set.

621
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:40,117
Mom, Dad.

622
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:42,452
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

623
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:44,121
Oh, no.

624
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:45,914
No.

625
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,791
Who would do...? Who did this?

626
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,501
Who would do something like this?

627
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:52,004
- Billie, come on.
- No.

628
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,547
Billie, we gotta get out of here.

629
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:58,844
Billie, come on. Come on, come on.

630
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,306
We have to do something,
we have to call the police.

631
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:04,516
No, you have to go to your dorm
and wait for me.

632
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:06,018
- What?
- Listen to me.

633
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:08,353
The manor is being targeted
by demons,

634
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,147
and I can't risk losing you too.

635
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:11,481
- But I...
- No.

636
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:13,817
I know what I'm talking about, okay?
Trust me.

637
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:16,236
- Just go.
- But where are you gonna go?

638
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:19,031
I'm gonna figure out who did this.

639
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:26,830
- Let it go, brother.
- I can't.

640
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:29,541
Why not? We served the Triad.

641
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,377
When evil reclaims the world,
we'll be rewarded.

642
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,255
Then let the reward be
killing Leo and his students now.

643
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:38,175
No. It's over.

644
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:40,928
- The Triad...
- Forget the Triad.

645
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,514
How can you just walk away?

646
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,934
Because it's the only thing to do.

647
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:53,065
Maybe for you
but I will have my revenge.

648
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,282
You guys are sure
you're ready for this?

649
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:05,077
- We won't know until we try.
- Leo taught us well.

650
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:07,788
Okay. Here's hoping.

651
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:12,876
Let's do this.

652
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:22,302
There he is!

653
00:38:38,402 --> 00:38:41,655
<i>- Now!
- Demon of fire, demon of pain</i>

654
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:44,283
<i>We banish you to the astral plane</i>

655
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:45,909
No!

656
00:38:58,046 --> 00:38:59,464
- Piper.
- Are you okay?

657
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:02,634
Oh, yeah. I've been worse,
I've been worse. It's all right.

658
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:05,429
Guess that was a pretty good plan
after all.

659
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:07,139
Yeah? You think so?

660
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:10,142
I do. I think Leo would too.

661
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:12,936
All right. Oh, jeez.

662
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:33,957
Okay, since when does healing hurt?

663
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:35,334
Since you lied to me.

664
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:36,585
Well, because I did,

665
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:40,339
you had a demon-free honeymoon
for at least one day.

666
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:44,176
Thank you. But even still,
you should not have done that alone.

667
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:46,053
I wasn't alone. I had Billie,

668
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,806
and I had some students
that weren't too shabby and I had Leo.

669
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:53,352
- I'm sorry, did you just say Leo?
- It's a long story.

670
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,605
Henry's off scuba diving, you know.
He's got a full tank of oxygen.

671
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:58,357
I've got time.

672
00:39:58,524 --> 00:40:02,236
It's nothing, really.
I just felt his presence a little, that's all.

673
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:03,487
It's nothing.

674
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:05,697
Hello.

675
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:10,118
Hey, found your keys.

676
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:11,912
Yeah. Actually, that's not all I found.

677
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,956
Let me guess: Cupid's arrow.

678
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:16,500
Sort of. Yeah.

679
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,378
Hey, what happened in here?

680
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,713
Why are you back?
What did I miss?

681
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,687
Piper didn't call me.

682
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:39,857
It was you, wasn't it?

683
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,402
I did what was necessary.

684
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:46,113
They were my parents!

685
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:52,911
They were distracting you
from taking the final step.

686
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:56,957
Now, thanks to me,
they no longer are.

687
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,918
Bastard!

688
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:08,719
Congratulations.

689
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:14,600
You just passed the final test.
