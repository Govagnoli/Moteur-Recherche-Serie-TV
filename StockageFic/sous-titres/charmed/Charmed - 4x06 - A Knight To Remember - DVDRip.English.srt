1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,273
Once upon a time,
there lived a handsome prince,

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,874
who was about to marry
a beautiful maiden.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,076
But an evil enchantress
with dark powers

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,719
wanted the prince for herself,

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,077
so she could become queen
and rule the entire kingdom.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,313
I hate her.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,710
Really? I always kind of
related to her.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,430
Like I said, I love her.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,159
Then what happened?

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,995
Well, in order to pull off
that kind of magic,

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,957
the evil enchantress
had to wait for a sign

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,792
that her powers
were at their darkest.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,832
A sign?

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,868
See in the stars?

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,799
See the prince?

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,949
His sword?

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,759
And the three stars
that form his crown?

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,036
Well, once the evil
enchantress saw the sign,

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,316
she locked away
the beautiful maiden

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,438
and cast a spell
on the unsuspecting prince.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,074
Bring together my prince and me
Let him fall on bended knee

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,992
I summon--

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,398
I summon--

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,116
I can never remember the end of it.

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,671
Let me guess. The prince
defeats the evil enchantress.

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,116
He married the beautiful maiden
and they lived happily ever after, right?

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,197
Actually, the evil
enchantress bore an heir,

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,636
killed the prince
and ruled the kingdom forever.

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,711
Well, what kind of fairy tale is that?

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,398
It's just one that's kind of stayed with
me for as long as I can remember.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,519
- I told you I was a weird kid.
- I need to get you out more, Paige.

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,475
It'd be easier if you were
around more, Glen.

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,517
I'm around now.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,638
What's the meaning of this?
How dare you summon me.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,390
Forgive me for inconveniencing you
at this late hour, Lady Julia.

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,588
Alas, I had no other choice.
The stars have aligned.

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,751
You don't frighten me, enchantress.

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,388
The stars are on the side
of good, not evil.

39
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,073
Tomorrow my prince
and I will marry

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,629
and there is nothing that
you can do to stop that.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,950
He loves me, not you.

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,874
Dark magic can change that.

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,759
Why are you doing this?

44
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,873
Because this is my destiny,
not yours.

45
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,153
Look at me.

46
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,312
I look like a drowned rat.
I need my blow dryer.

47
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,471
- Pretend you're camping.
- I hate camping.

48
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,632
Well, I hate instant coffee,
but I'm drinking it, aren't l?

49
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,156
We can't keep living
with no electricity. It's medieval.

50
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,833
At least we're conserving energy.

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,558
This is ridiculous.
We have to figure out

52
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,870
when the shocker demon's
gonna attack next and fast.

53
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,349
But we still need the
power of three to vanquish him.

54
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,990
And unfortunately,
number three lives across town.

55
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,437
- I am going to call her.
- Not the cordless.

56
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,109
- You okay?
- No, I am not okay.

57
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,071
This is so crazy.

58
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,912
We have to call Paige
and set up a time

59
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,275
where she can come over, and--

60
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,159
Phoebe, we can't schedule
vanquishes, okay?

61
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,596
Demon attacks don't
usually fit into the day planners.

62
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,558
Okay, then what do you suggest?

63
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,752
I suggest that maybe Paige
move in with us.

64
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,632
Wait.

65
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,951
What did you just say to me?

66
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,193
Well, she's gonna have to
sooner or later, isn't she?

67
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,510
I never really thought about it.

68
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,399
And I can't believe you of all people
are actually suggesting it.

69
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,552
I am just trying to be practical.

70
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,269
Besides, I am sick and tired of Leo
watching over her day and night,

71
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,556
protecting her from various demons.

72
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,112
You know, I would actually
like to see my husband again.

73
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,918
And I can understand that.

74
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,118
But still, that's a huge decision.

75
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,833
- Do you think we're ready for that?
- All I know is that every demon

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,195
who is out to impress
The Source is attacking us.

77
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,875
Which means we all
need to be under one roof.

78
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,553
Otherwise, we're too vulnerable.

79
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,673
I didn't mean,
"Are we ready as witches?"

80
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,272
I meant, "Are we ready as sisters?"

81
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,637
- I mean, what if we don't get along?
- We didn't always get along with Prue.

82
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,519
Yeah, but that's different.
We grew up with her.

83
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,558
Eventually, we had to get along.

84
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,078
I still half expect to see her
walk through the door.

85
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,550
Maybe it's just too soon.

86
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,639
And there's only one way
to find out.

87
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,190
Oh, my God, it's 9:00.
I'm so screwed.

88
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,231
Can't you just be a little late?

89
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,516
I'm already a little late.

90
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,319
Can't you be a lot late,

91
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,436
especially seeing...

92
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,600
...as how I'm leaving tomorrow?

93
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,150
You're always leaving tomorrow,
Glen. That's what you do.

94
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,669
What?

95
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,478
Nine-to-five isn't you, Paige.

96
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,550
You've always had too adventurous
a spirit to be pinned down.

97
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,071
Oh, yeah. Just drop by between
K2 and the Great Barrier Reef,

98
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,595
and you know this about me,
do you?

99
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,196
Your life could be a fairy tale,
and it doesn't have to end badly.

100
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,238
Who says it's going to?

101
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,552
Come to Australia with me, Paige,
just for the hell of it. Why not?

102
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,157
Because I've got too many
responsibilities, that's why not.

103
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,629
You're 25-years-old.

104
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,031
You've got the rest of your life
ahead of you for that kind of crap.

105
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,918
Just go for it. Dump your job.

106
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,752
Come have fun with me.

107
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,869
As tempting as that sounds, I actually
have things called responsibilities.

108
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,112
It's not just my job.

109
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,515
I've got sisters now,
and I just got stuff we've gotta do.

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,752
What stuff?

111
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,118
Stuff that keeps me pinned down.

112
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,794
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

113
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,030
I'm not sure yet.

114
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,789
- Hi.
- Sorry.

115
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,552
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up?

116
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,438
How about a kiss for your
long lost wife, huh?

117
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,830
- Oh, right.
- Oh, how sweet.

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,468
- Hi.
- Well...

119
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,198
...bye.

120
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,873
What do you mean "bye"?
We just got here.

121
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,840
Right. Well, you know, I don't
wanna leave Paige unprotected.

122
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,991
- Is she home?
- Yeah, she's home.

123
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,073
She's just a little indisposed
at the moment.

124
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,749
Wait. Wait, wait. You watch?

125
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,188
- What are you, like a peeping angel?
- I didn't see anything.

126
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,875
Well, all right, just a little. But how else
am I supposed to protect her?

127
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,871
Sorry to interrupt. Can't see a thing.

128
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,553
- Phoebe.
- What--?

129
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,676
Piper, Leo, what the hell
is going on?

130
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,196
I know this looks bad,
but it's very important, believe me.

131
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,919
Who are they?

132
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,275
The soon to be ex-sisters
I was telling you about.

133
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,991
Okay, we're sorry. But, you know,
we didn't know "witch" way to turn,

134
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,673
if you know what I mean.

135
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,990
Maybe I should go.

136
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,430
- Here.
- Thanks.

137
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,838
I'm sorry about this, Glen.
This is horribly embarrassing.

138
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,198
No worries. You've obviously
got some responsibilities.

139
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,192
My plane leaves tomorrow.

140
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,909
Plane? What plane?

141
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,073
- Never mind. This better be important.
- I can't use my blow dryer.

142
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,629
So have you been attacked
by the shocker demon yet?

143
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,950
- No, she hasn't.
- How would you know?

144
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,509
Well, because he's been
watching you for the last week or so.

145
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,716
- For your own protection.
- You've been watching me?

146
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,110
- I didn't see anything.
- At least nothing very interesting.

147
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,874
- Right.
- That's it. Out!

148
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,554
But we need to talk to you
about the shocker demon because--

149
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,517
We can't vanquish them
without the power of three.

150
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,557
- And you're not at the manor, so--
- Out!

151
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,359
I think that went fairly well.

152
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,632
Unbelievable.

153
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,955
Where is she? What have
you done to my beloved?

154
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,272
You mean, I'm not
your beloved? I'm crushed.

155
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,109
Your dark magic
doesn't scare me, enchantress.

156
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,558
Tell me where she is
and I just might spare your life.

157
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,517
Very well.

158
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,388
Your beloved is right here,
my prince,

159
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,198
right before your very eyes.

160
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,119
Bring together my prince and me
Let him fall on bended knee

161
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,716
I summon him to my side

162
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,953
That he may take me to be
His destined bride.

163
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,352
My love.

164
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,709
I am forever yours.

165
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,236
As will be your kingdom,
once I conceive an heir.

166
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,760
All right, calm down.

167
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,156
At least I knocked.

168
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,675
- Hey, Paige.
- I'm not here to talk to either of you.

169
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,831
I'm just here to look
at the Book of Shadows.

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,719
- Hey. Hey, we said we were sorry.
- Yeah, right.

171
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,269
What do you think
about moving in with us?

172
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,475
Excuse me?

173
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,676
Well, that's what we came
to talk to you about.

174
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,876
We're tired of getting
attacked by demons here

175
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,837
and not being able
to do anything about it.

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,150
But we could do something
about it if we were together.

177
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,029
You know, if we lived together because
that's when we're the strongest.

178
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,749
What do you say?

179
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,515
Are you two out of your
freaking minds?

180
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,632
Don't people usually storm out
of the house when they're angry?

181
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,150
So you're not even gonna
consider this?

182
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,038
- Nope.
- Why not?

183
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,270
Because if it was that easy
for you to barge into my room

184
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,237
all the way across town,
imagine how easy it'd be

185
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,753
if I actually lived here.

186
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,588
Okay, could you just stop looking
at the book for a second?

187
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,591
No. It's my book too.

188
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,275
If you lived here,
you could look at it all the time.

189
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,990
I understand why you guys
are asking me.

190
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,550
I really, really do.

191
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,473
It's just, I don't want being
a witch to take over my life.

192
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,473
It's just too much responsibility.

193
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,353
I know it is, Paige.

194
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,715
And believe me, I freaked out
in the beginning too.

195
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,758
But I didn't have a choice,
and neither do you.

196
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,354
Why not? Aren't you the one
who told me I should fight like hell

197
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,794
to keep my life separate
from magic?

198
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,428
Unfortunately, it doesn't
always work out that way.

199
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,955
Well, maybe it would
if I didn't live here.

200
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,874
If you're looking for the shocker
demon spell, we already found it.

201
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,832
I'm not. I'm looking
for something else.

202
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,078
What?

203
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,992
Look, you may not
wanna share a bathroom,

204
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,277
but when it comes to that book,
it concerns all of us.

205
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,793
Besides that, maybe we can help.

206
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,758
Okay, I know it sounds stupid,

207
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,753
but when I was little, I invented
this horrible little fairy tale,

208
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,118
and it just always
seemed really real to me.

209
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,919
I don't know, I just-- Oh, my God.

210
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,360
- "The evil enchantress"?
- That's it.

211
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,715
That's the evil witch,
the one who kills the prince

212
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,917
- after he gets her pregnant, of course.
- Of course.

213
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,319
Wow, I can't believe it.

214
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,472
Bring together my prince and me
Let him fall on bended knee

215
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,993
I summon him to my side

216
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,152
That he may take me to be
His destined bride

217
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,799
I finally got to finish it.

218
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,032
No!

219
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,757
My love.

220
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,710
- Why do you run from me?
- Why are you chasing me?

221
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,199
Because we are meant
to be together.

222
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,033
That is not true. Does this look like
King Arthur's court in front of you?

223
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,078
It doesn't matter. We are meant
to conceive an heir, my love.

224
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,037
- Stop saying that.
- You guys want some privacy?

225
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,395
This is not funny.

226
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,393
Plate.

227
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,794
- I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
- You could never hurt me, my love.

228
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,119
- Piper, do that thing you do.
- I don't want to blow him up.

229
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,914
Well, risk it. He's using his tongue.

230
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,910
Thank God chivalry is dead.
He is getting on my last nerve.

231
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,036
Okay, well, he must be under
some kind of spell.

232
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,394
Gee, you think?

233
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,710
It's the evil enchantress.
She cast a love spell on him.

234
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,269
So why is Sir Lust-A-Lot
lusting after you?

235
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,000
- How should I know?
- Because it's your damn fairy tale,

236
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,276
and it's alive and frozen
in our kitchen.

237
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,679
- Where are you going?
- I can't handle this.

238
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,036
Wait. Paige, you can't just leave.

239
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,873
Yes, I can. I don't live here.

240
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,350
- Paige.
- What?

241
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,431
Look, you can't keep
running away from these things.

242
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,831
That's what we were trying to tell you.
Being a witch is not a part-time job.

243
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,389
Well, if I don't leave now,
I'm not gonna have a full-time job.

244
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,074
Paige, the Charmed Ones
come first.

245
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,275
The Charmed Ones come first?

246
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,034
- It always worked when Prue said it.
- The home also features

247
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,509
a spacious kitchen,
complete with granite countertops

248
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,910
and state of the art
convection oven.

249
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,674
The walk-in pantry
provides ample space for all--

250
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,195
The VCR. Who set it to record?

251
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,239
- Phoebe.
- I'm okay, I think.

252
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,470
We've gotta convince Paige
to move in with us soon,

253
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,392
before there's nobody left
to move in with.

254
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,791
I guess we need a new TV.

255
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,991
- The prince.
- The prince.

256
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,795
He's gone?

257
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,030
What? Did he go back
to fairy-tale land?

258
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,597
No such luck.
The back door is wide open.

259
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,036
So he probably went after Paige.

260
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,359
He left?

261
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,511
So he's just wandering
around in chain mail.

262
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,273
It's San Francisco.
Nobody will notice.

263
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,476
Well, sooner or later,
someone's gonna notice.

264
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,518
And the medieval trail
is gonna lead them right back to us.

265
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,353
All right, you try scrying for him,
and if that doesn't work,

266
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,638
I'll have Leo orb Paige back here,
and hopefully the prince will follow.

267
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,392
Maybe we should try
a different approach.

268
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,312
She's not gonna
come back here voluntarily.

269
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,913
No, I mean about
getting her to move in.

270
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,957
Maybe it's too soon for her too.

271
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,315
Hey, moron! What are you doing?

272
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,635
What problem you got, huh?
All right buddy, come on.

273
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,711
On your way.
I don't have time for this.

274
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,991
Swallow, and you'll not speak again.

275
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,752
And what is this metallic beast?
How do you harness its power?

276
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,798
What?

277
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,996
You will use it to take me
to my beloved,

278
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,390
where I feel her heart's pull.

279
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,709
Questions?

280
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,552
I have one.

281
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,950
If good magic rescued my
prince from you,

282
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,153
- what makes you think he'll return?
- I don't.

283
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,313
That's why I plan on following
his footsteps and bringing him back,

284
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,677
after I destroy the good magic
that intervened, of course.

285
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,434
And what makes you think
that you can?

286
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,352
Oh, I don't know.

287
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,991
Because I'm petty
and evil and vindictive.

288
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,072
But most of all, I'm determined.

289
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,276
I am the object of his true love.
Your spell only appropriated it.

290
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,109
Kill me and you break the spell.

291
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,595
I know. I know.

292
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,158
That's why I needed this
for my potion to work.

293
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,110
You cannot do this.

294
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,999
One thing you need to know
about me, Lady Julia.

295
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,912
Nobody tells me what to do.

296
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,553
Nobody tells me what to do, Leo.

297
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,673
And besides, I'm still mad at you
for watching over me.

298
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,115
I deserve better than that,
especially from you.

299
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,271
Well, I'm a guardian, Paige.
It's what I do,

300
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,318
especially during times like this when
it's dangerous for you to be alone.

301
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,392
It's a fairy tale, not a horror movie.

302
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,832
I was talking about
the shocker demon.

303
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,399
Well, yeah, he's not half as scary

304
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,391
as Prince Charming
coming after me though.

305
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,279
All the more reason why you should
be staying with Phoebe and Piper.

306
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,429
What if I don't want to?

307
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,956
What if I wanna climb a mountain
or go dive the Great Barrier Reef, huh?

308
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,880
- What?
- Look, I've had a blast being a witch.

309
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,749
I like the spells, like the potions.
I'm even getting used to orbing.

310
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,638
But God, I've just had enough.

311
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,998
Well, there is no enough, Paige.
This is who you are. You know that.

312
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,354
Why are you running from it?

313
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,397
Oh, gee, I don't know.
Being hunted by The Source,

314
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,313
ducking the Furies and
being shrunk by a psycho demon,

315
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,513
not to mention being chased after
by my bedtime stories.

316
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,070
I don't know why I wouldn't want
the rest of my life to be just like that.

317
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,197
You're not alone anymore.
You have sisters now.

318
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,397
Who are pressuring me to move in
with them for all the wrong reasons.

319
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,591
What is that supposed to mean?

320
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,429
Nothing.

321
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,272
Forget about it.

322
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,955
Look, it's just sometimes I feel like
they want me to be Prue, super witch.

323
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,839
And I can't. I don't know how.

324
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,553
Yeah, I don't think they think that.

325
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,109
Oh, yeah? Have you checked out
her room? It's a shrine.

326
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,032
Doesn't seem to me
like they're ready yet.

327
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,794
And it's a pretty tough act to follow.

328
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,836
Don't make me go back there, Leo.

329
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,834
Not just yet. Okay?
I just need some time.

330
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,188
I'll call you if I need you.

331
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,830
Darryl. Darryl. Darryl!

332
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,310
Slow down, okay?
Carjackings happen all the time.

333
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,471
Why are you calling us?

334
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,031
A garbage truck?

335
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,077
At swordpoint.

336
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,911
We'll get back to you.

337
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,756
Please don't tell me
that the police found him.

338
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,275
Not yet. How about you?

339
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,479
Nothing. I mean, he's not a witch,
and he's not a demon, so...

340
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,710
All right. Le--

341
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,713
- Hi.
- Hi.

342
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,554
- Where's Paige?
- Paige.

343
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,990
She didn't want to come.

344
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,876
She what? Did you explain
the situation to her?

345
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,349
- Yes.
- And she still refused to come?

346
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,037
Leo, we are up to our pointy
little hats in demonic problems here.

347
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,758
- We need her.
- She knows that.

348
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,911
I don't understand.
We're her sisters.

349
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,150
Yeah, but that's not
the reason you need her.

350
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,680
Is there more to that or are you just
gonna leave us hanging?

351
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,558
I don't want to get
in the middle of this.

352
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,756
This is between you guys.

353
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,878
But I will tell you that just wanting
her to battle demons with you

354
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,996
isn't enough of a reason
to get her to move in.

355
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,196
It's a pressing reason.

356
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,871
But it's not a sisterly one.

357
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,953
Look, in the meantime, you need to
find the prince before he exposes you.

358
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,951
So I suggest you check
with the Book of Shadows,

359
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,872
and get up to speed on
Paige's fairy tale.

360
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,237
And I will check with the Elders
and see what they know.

361
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,589
Hey!

362
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,153
Who's that?

363
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,631
At last, I found you.

364
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,755
- How?
- I followed your heart, my love.

365
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,671
You can't be here. You need to leave
right now before security comes.

366
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,637
I will not leave until you
are with child.

367
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,555
Okay, A, I always use protection,
and B, you're a fairy tale.

368
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,515
I won't harm you.

369
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,877
Just keep that sword
of yours sheathed, pal.

370
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,032
Fear not, I've slain the beast,
my love.

371
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,511
You most certainly have.

372
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,399
Hey, Paige.
Paige, you all right in there?

373
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,236
I will stay forever by your side.

374
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,753
Every moment of every day,

375
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,152
you would know you are
protected, desired, loved.

376
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,479
That's so sweet.

377
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,959
Paige. Paige!

378
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,277
Paige, what the hell is going on?
Who is this guy?

379
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,995
Renaissance Fair.

380
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,470
Yeah, we're trying to score tickets
for the orphanage. See you.

381
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,553
I don't see what the big deal is.
You'd think she'd wanna move in here

382
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,473
- considering the dump she lives in.
- Piper.

383
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,392
Just wait till the shocker demon
attacks her.

384
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,518
Then she might not be
so resistant to the idea.

385
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,592
Defiant, clever and independent.

386
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,751
That kind of describes Paige,
don't you think?

387
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,549
Yeah, along with stubborn,
stubborn, and more stubborn.

388
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,711
All right, listen to this.

389
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,351
"A powerful witch
who came to the craft late,

390
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,431
but learned to use it quickly."

391
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,353
- I'm telling you, this is Paige.
- What are you getting at?

392
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,114
Well, don't you think it's a huge
coincidence that Paige's fairy tale

393
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,838
just happens to be
in the Book of Shadows?

394
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,390
And that this prince just happens
to show up in the 21 st century,

395
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,791
- head over heels in love with her?
- Connect the dots, will you?

396
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,269
Okay, what if it's not a fairy tale?

397
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,118
What if it's a memory?

398
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,999
Paige's memory from a past life.

399
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,910
- Now you're reaching.
- No, I don't think so.

400
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,310
I mean, my past life
came back to bite me on the butt.

401
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,469
Why can't Paige's?

402
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,838
Think about it. What if Paige
was the evil enchantress

403
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,479
once upon a time?

404
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,829
But the enchantress' power
was to conjure up the elements.

405
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,758
Paige can't do that.

406
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,476
This doesn't look good.

407
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,994
- Paige?
- Where is the prince?

408
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,549
- Still think I'm reaching?
- I don't believe this.

409
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,636
I got it!

410
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,119
Living room's clear.

411
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,077
So is the kitchen.

412
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,071
Why do you think she left
so suddenly?

413
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,960
What? Did trashing our house
become too boring for her?

414
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,873
She probably realized
we don't have the prince.

415
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,508
Great. It's not like we're having
enough problems with Paige.

416
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,433
We have to deal with her
past life too?

417
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,355
Okay, I found out about the prince.

418
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,478
- What the hell happened here?
- Paige's past life almost killed us.

419
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,232
- That's what happened here.
- What?

420
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,188
Yeah. Paige, the evil enchantress.
Same soul, different lifetimes.

421
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,113
She came through some magical
portal looking for Prince Carjack.

422
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,510
Okay, well you have to stop her.
You can't let her find him.

423
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,148
According to the Elders,
if she conceives his heir,

424
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,117
dark magic will rule
his kingdom forever.

425
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,032
History will be rewritten.
Your future--

426
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,272
Will be screwed.
The world will plunge into darkness.

427
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,079
Okay, that's not helping.
So if we vanquish past Paige,

428
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,152
don't we risk vanquishing
our Paige too?

429
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,114
- Possibly.
- Well, then fine.

430
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,840
We won't vanquish her.
We'll bind her powers

431
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,434
and send her back in time,
hopefully a virgin.

432
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,353
Okay, let's get some candles.
We have a potion to concoct.

433
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,192
What lures you to this time,
my prince?

434
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,271
Who beckons thee?

435
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,597
Paige?

436
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,193
What are you still doing here so late?
I thought you left already.

437
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,035
What name did you call me?

438
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,475
Don't tell me you're in the fair too.

439
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,316
Don't forget to lock up.

440
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,398
See you in the morning.

441
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,472
On time would be nice for once.

442
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,070
Looking forward to meeting you...

443
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,629
...Paige.

444
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,912
I still can't believe that you exist,
that you're actually real.

445
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,316
I always wanted to save you
from the evil enchantress,

446
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,109
- so you could live happily ever after.
- Be with me and I shall.

447
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,192
Come with me.
Live in my castle as my princess.

448
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,195
What is it with everyone
wanting me to move in with them?

449
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,510
I can give you all the riches
you desire.

450
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,352
I can take you away from all this.

451
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,871
As tempting as that is,
I know it's just the spell talking.

452
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,431
But isn't that what true love is?
Falling under someone's spell.

453
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,991
Just tell me what you want
and I'll give it to you, I swear.

454
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,036
Can you make me as good
as Prue was?

455
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,915
Never mind.
You wouldn't understand.

456
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,197
Try me.

457
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,271
Hey.

458
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,317
What is going on with this
barging in thing.

459
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,754
This is getting ridiculous.

460
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,070
Sorry, thought he was attacking you.

461
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,676
He was kissing me. It's called kissing.
And what are you doing here anyway?

462
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,513
- I told you I'd call if I needed to.
- Well, something's come up,

463
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,159
something you're not gonna like.

464
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,358
- Something worse than this?
- The evil enchantress is here.

465
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,508
In our world. She nearly
killed us trying to get to him.

466
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,399
- Oh, my God.
- Actually, that's not the worst part.

467
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,518
Remember how we were wondering
how she cast a spell on him,

468
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,830
- but he fell for you?
- Yeah.

469
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,319
Well, that's because you're her.

470
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,712
- Well, I mean, she's you.
- Her.

471
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,677
- Yeah, help.
- Look, what she means

472
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,799
is that you were the evil enchantress
in one of your past lives.

473
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,317
So when you read the spell
in the Book of Shadows, he came.

474
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,996
And that's also why you remember
the fairy tale so well.

475
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,357
It's because you've
actually lived it once before.

476
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,835
Okay, I can deal with this. Yeah.

477
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,469
No wonder I related to her the most.

478
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,153
- Does this mean I'm evil?
- Yeah.

479
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,389
- No.
- No.

480
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,838
No, not you, just your past self.
You've grown and evolved.

481
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,513
Believe me, we all have.

482
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,432
- That's what we do.
- Right.

483
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,038
So the plan is to bind the enchantress'
powers with this little potion.

484
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,839
- I'll do it.
- All right, then we'll--

485
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,069
No.

486
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,152
I mean, by myself.
I put you guys in danger.

487
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,709
I'll get you out of it.
It's my story.

488
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,832
I have to end it once and for all.

489
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,558
You don't know how to find
the enchantress.

490
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,837
Well, she's after the prince, right?
I'll just backtrack and surprise her.

491
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,877
There's no reason
for you to do this alone.

492
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,715
It's not just your story anymore.
You've got sisters now.

493
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,792
But if you want to do it by yourself,

494
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,394
- then go for it.
- I do.

495
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,439
Yeah, if that's what you want,
we'll be here with the prince.

496
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,153
Why did you let her go?

497
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,039
Because it's time we realized
we can't make her do something

498
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,430
she doesn't wanna do.

499
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,157
Don't tell me I've
become good in the future.

500
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,912
Damn good.

501
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,952
And here I was so looking
forward to meeting myself.

502
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,794
What is it?

503
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,871
Something's wrong.
Paige is in trouble.

504
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,190
Well, go, go, go!

505
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,829
Remember me?

506
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,599
What happened?

507
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,996
The evil enchantress.

508
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,993
Oh, no.

509
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,920
Come to me, my prince.

510
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,279
We can't just let them get away!

511
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,431
What are we supposed to do?
Go back to the Middle Ages,

512
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,556
the Dark Ages,
or whatever hell ages those are?

513
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,154
If we don't, good magic
will be gone forever.

514
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,518
No.

515
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,511
What have I done?

516
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,912
This is all my fault. Piper
and Phoebe were crazy to trust me.

517
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,399
Why didn't I listen to them?

518
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,757
Now is not the time to lose it, Paige.
We need to get them back.

519
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,832
Get them back? What do we do?
Hop on a bus to medieval times?

520
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,752
Paige, concentrate.

521
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,990
You're a powerful witch,
whether you like it or not.

522
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,993
Yeah, well I wasn't powerful enough
to take out the enchantress, was l?

523
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,038
One thing your past life should tell you
is that you've always been powerful.

524
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,274
You still have that power inside of you.
Don't be afraid to tap into it now.

525
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,638
- Okay, this is my fairy tale, right?
- Yes.

526
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,756
This started with a spell
that brought the prince here,

527
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,435
so maybe if I rearranged it a little?

528
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,959
What if instead of bringing the prince
to me, I bring myself to him?

529
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,509
Creating your own portal?

530
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,155
It's worth a shot.

531
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,673
Bring together my prince and me
Kingdom now I wish to see

532
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,628
Crossing history to his side
From myself I will not hide

533
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,069
Oh, my God, I did it. It worked.

534
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,919
Come on,
I'm not doing this by myself.

535
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,838
So are you still glad you told
Paige to go for it?

536
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,072
Hey, you were the one that wanted us
to be more sisterly towards her.

537
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,993
Yes, but not at the expense
of being trapped in the Dark Ages,

538
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,559
where our powers are useless.

539
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,030
You know, I still
don't understand who you are.

540
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,430
What land did you come from?

541
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,839
- Disneyland. Future world.
- Phoebe. We're witches.

542
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,673
And we have the potion
that will stop the enchantress.

543
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,034
Yeah, let's go get her.

544
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,113
We can't because
we're chained to a wall.

545
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,471
Okay, find Phoebe and Piper.
I'll try to hold her off until they get here.

546
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,154
How? Your powers
don't work in the past.

547
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,151
Yeah, but if we really are
one and the same,

548
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,110
I should be able to tap into hers.
Hurry, go get my sisters.

549
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,590
- Piper, Phoebe.
- Leo.

550
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,709
- Easy, easy.
- Behind you!

551
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,112
Hi, I hate to interrupt myself
at a time like this.

552
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,439
How did you get here?

553
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,714
- I'm charmed.
- Not for long.

554
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,429
Nice!

555
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,033
Leo?

556
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,873
- I thought you were a pacifist.
- I didn't kill him, did l?

557
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,392
I have to tell you,
I find this side of you very sexy.

558
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,473
- Really?
- Yeah.

559
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,074
You've been holding out on us.

560
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,759
What's that sound?

561
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,388
Paige. Potion, potion, potion.

562
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,596
Don't hurt her.

563
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,353
Throw the potion.

564
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,274
Now.

565
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,797
- What have you done to me?
- We bound your powers, enchantress.

566
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,349
- No more "kingdom come" for you.
- Not for you.

567
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,751
How could you do this
to me? To us?

568
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,309
I didn't do it. We did it.

569
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,516
I'm well, my love.

570
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,999
My love?

571
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,072
Looks like it takes the kiss
of true love to break the spell.

572
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,151
It's in every fairy tale.

573
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,076
All right, super witch,
get us out of here.

574
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,317
Okay, so I won't be getting
my security deposit back.

575
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,268
Yeah. Too bad you don't
have any other place to stay.

576
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,030
It's no pressure.
It's totally up to you.

577
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,239
- Whenever you're ready.
- Yeah, who needs electricity anyway?

578
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,956
I wouldn't have to stay
in the basement, would l?

579
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,870
No, of course not.
I think we have a room for you.

580
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,316
- What do you think?
- Wow. It's definitely different.

581
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,152
It's definitely you.

582
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,869
- Is that a good thing?
- Of course it's a good thing.

583
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,553
Good, because
I was actually thinking

584
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,439
the living room could use
a little spicing up.

585
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,397
Don't push it.

586
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,954
Oh, I hope that's not another
one of your past lives.

587
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,190
No, it's just Glen.
I asked him to drop by.

588
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,476
Oh, the cute guy from
the apartment? He's yummy.

589
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,791
Yeah, he is, but he's gonna
have to be yummy in Australia.

590
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,188
He's leaving.

591
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,399
He asked me to go with,
but I decided to pass.

592
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,390
Oh, you're disappointed?

593
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,712
A little, but it's not like
I'll be lacking in adventures here.

594
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,716
Speaking of which.

595
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,711
- Shall we?
- Hit it.

596
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,430
Vanquish, we three witches cry
One final shock and then you die

597
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,119
Okay.

598
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,952
Piece of cake. Gotta go.

599
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,669
And don't forget,
if you need me, please knock.

600
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,389
And they lived happily ever after.

601
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,594
- Yeah, right.
- Right.
