1
00:00:07,329 --> 00:00:12,449
Painting of a Gothic castle,
artist unknown, circa 1920s.

2
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:18,008
Oil on canvas, 20-by-28. Miss Franklin,
where did you say you got this?

3
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:23,687
I inherited it a few months ago. But
it's been in my family for generations.

4
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:27,206
The composition is so unusual.

5
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:30,122
The artist used pure colour straight
from the tube and then varnished

6
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:34,043
- each layer over and...
- I'm sorry for interrupting.

7
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:36,046
But do I really need to be here?

8
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:40,566
No, of course not. It's just that most
people prefer to be at an appraisal,

9
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:42,640
especially when they plan
on selling the piece.

10
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,085
- It's just that I'm kind of in a hurry.
- Say no more.

11
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:49,321
Just sign at the bottom,
and you are free to go.

12
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:53,402
Thank you. So how long
do you think it'll take to sell it?

13
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:56,681
Well, I'll need to see ownership
records before I can do anything.

14
00:00:56,849 --> 00:01:00,125
I'll send you everything I have.
So is that all then?

15
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:02,120
No, since you definitely wanna sell
the piece,

16
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:05,201
I'll need to confirm its authenticity,
its physical condition.

17
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,200
So if you'll just sign at the bottom,

18
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,206
that will let us go ahead
and x-ray the piece.

19
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:11,800
Done.

20
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:14,803
Anything else?

21
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:18,998
Well, yes, Miss Franklin. I would really
like the time to research this.

22
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,086
That way I can get you the best price.

23
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:26,243
Look, I appreciate
your professionalism. I really do.

24
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:28,969
But I'm not interested in getting
the best price.

25
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:33,884
I just want you to sell that painting
as soon as you can, all right?

26
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:37,198
- Good night, Miss Halliwell.
- Good night.

27
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:50,881
Piper, it was an accident.
It's not like I borrowed Prue's car

28
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:53,728
- so I could drive it into a pole.
- How bad's the damage?

29
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:56,687
Not bad, but maybe expensive,
which is why I need a favour.

30
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,488
If you're calling to borrow money,
I don't have any.

31
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,201
No, it's not about money.
It's just... I don't want you to tell Prue.

32
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:07,566
She's been so supportive,
and I don't wanna lose her trust again.

33
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,165
- You mean you haven't told her?
- Well, not yet, but I have a plan.

34
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:12,557
Phoebe, you have to tell her.

35
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:15,004
It's her car, and you don't have
the money to fix it.

36
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,808
But I will have the money to fix it.
I'm at this company called

37
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:20,961
Web San Francisco. It's
an interactive network on the Internet.

38
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:22,727
And I faxed them my résumé
this morning,

39
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:24,447
and they wanna meet
with me tonight.

40
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:26,918
I've gotta go, but I don't wanna
be in the middle of this.

41
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:30,126
- Just tell her, okay?
- If I don't get the job, I will tell her.

42
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,047
Hello, I'm Phoebe Halliwell.
I have an appointment.

43
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:56,488
Thanks.

44
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:00,280
All these people, they're here
for the interview too, aren't they?

45
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:03,083
Well, you won't have any trouble
with this if you figured that out.

46
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:06,207
It's an aptitude test.
You can finish it at home.

47
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:08,121
Great. Great.

48
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,407
So you won a fellowship from
the National Science Foundation?

49
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,685
When I was at Harvard, yeah.
How'd you know?

50
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:20,961
I saw it on your résumé.
I was cum laude also.

51
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:22,881
Except I was
a Ford Foundation scholar.

52
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,438
So then you must have gone
to Stanford?

53
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:27,441
Stanford? I went to Stanford.

54
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:30,801
Intimidating, isn't it?

55
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,399
The Good Will Huntings
or this aptitude test?

56
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:37,238
Oh, who cares about linear algebra or
differential? And that test is a snap.

57
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:39,240
I mean, in this day and age,
who can't write

58
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:42,128
in the HTML and numeric
languages, right?

59
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,608
Right.

60
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:49,882
Yeah, that's... That's for you.

61
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,680
What?

62
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:45,205
At first I just thought that it was a
reflection off of something in the room.

63
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:48,168
But then when I moved closer,
I saw a man

64
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:50,638
inside the painting, in the castle.

65
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:55,007
Right, but the moment I saw him,
he backed away from the window.

66
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:58,485
And then there was this strange glow
that went past the window again.

67
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,640
It was just so...

68
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:03,927
- Piper?
- What?

69
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:08,558
- We were talking?
- I know, about a man in a painting.

70
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:12,159
Listen to this one. "Hallway
near club entrance too narrow."

71
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,479
I thought that we had discussed
your code violations.

72
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,002
Well, I keep finding more.

73
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,558
The plumbing, the electrical,
the heating.

74
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,879
- It... None of it is up to code.
- Stop.

75
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:24,489
- You're obsessing.
- Well, it runs in the family.

76
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:26,727
I don't obsess.

77
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:32,398
I think intensely.
Anyway, I can't really help it.

78
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:35,601
I mean, we've seen so many bizarre
things, why not a man in a painting?

79
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,521
At least he's safe
from building inspectors.

80
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:40,158
I can't imagine
that castle's up to code.

81
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:43,605
I'm sorry, but I couldn't find anything
in the Book of Shadows about people

82
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:47,000
who may be trapped inside paintings.
I looked everywhere.

83
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:51,926
Hey, you were asleep by the time
I got home. How did your interview go?

84
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:55,801
It went fine.

85
00:06:56,049 --> 00:07:00,122
Actually, it's still going. I have
to finish this take-home aptitude test,

86
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:02,723
which I actually think
I will start right now.

87
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,198
So I will see you guys later.

88
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:06,762
- Phoebe?
- What?

89
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:09,602
Aren't you forgetting something?
My car keys?

90
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:15,917
They'd be with your car...

91
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:20,444
...which is at the body shop,
having an estimate.

92
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:25,958
- An estimate?
- Yeah, I bumped...

93
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:30,647
No, actually I backed your car
into a pole last night.

94
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:33,207
A pole?

95
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:35,597
You hit a pole?

96
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:38,363
Yeah, you don't even have to say it.
I know what you're thinking.

97
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:41,885
How could I be so irresponsible?
How could I be so stupid?

98
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:46,567
Okay, irresponsible, yes. Stupid,
no way. Where is that coming from?

99
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,879
It's coming from the fact
that I'm the youngest sister,

100
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:52,007
the one who always makes mistakes,
the one who always causes problems.

101
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,842
I mean, if anybody were gonna back
your car into a pole

102
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:57,079
and not tell you right away,
it'd be me, right?

103
00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:00,807
- I think I'll just be going now.
- See? Even the middle sister,

104
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:03,961
the one that's supposed to stay neutral
when it comes to family problems,

105
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:06,848
- checks out on this one.
- Yes, you're right. You're on your own.

106
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:09,477
Well, leave me out of it too.
I don't wanna argue with you.

107
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:13,005
- I just wanna find a cab.
- Well, whatever it costs,

108
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:15,729
I will pay for the damages.
And whatever the cab costs,

109
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:17,641
I will pay for that too.

110
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:23,926
- What just happened here?
- I don't know anything about anything.

111
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,199
- I'm gonna go see Dan.
- Piper!

112
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:29,884
Just forget about the car.
What about the man in the painting?

113
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:34,401
Well, unless he's real and screaming
for help, forget about him.

114
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:37,402
We shouldn't go looking for trouble.
We have enough around here.

115
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:40,159
I'm going next door.

116
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,720
- Dan.
- Good morning.

117
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:53,841
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- No, you're not bothering me, unless

118
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:57,599
- you refuse to hand over my paper.
- Oh, all yours.

119
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:02,001
- Thanks. You wanna come in?
- No, no, really,

120
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,281
I just stopped by to ask a quick favour.
My club received a visit

121
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:07,804
- from the DBI last night...
- And you got code violations.

122
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:10,728
I have the War and Peace
of code violations.

123
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:14,524
And you were thinking what?
Neighbour Dan, he's in construction,

124
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,080
- maybe he could help, huh?
- Of course I'd pay you something.

125
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:21,965
- Uncle Dan, I'm late. Oh, hey, Piper.
- Hi, Jenny.

126
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:26,566
See you later, Uncle Dan.
And don't forget your promise.

127
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:32,247
Okay, then, I'll tell you what I can do.
I'll check out the code violations,

128
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:35,321
see how serious they really are
if you will help me with the promise

129
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:38,208
- I made Jenny.
- Deal. Wait, what's the promise?

130
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:42,248
She needs help with a paper. It's...
It's for bio class. You know, something

131
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:46,522
- with the human reproductive system.
- Oh, you mean sex.

132
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:50,526
It's just way too awkward for me
to talk to my niece about.

133
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:54,358
Yeah. Sure, not to worry,
I have plenty of experience.

134
00:09:54,929 --> 00:10:00,447
- Really? With sex?
- No, I mean, talking about it.

135
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:04,328
Yeah.

136
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:09,925
So was there a problem
with any

137
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:11,841
of the ownership records
that I sent over?

138
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:13,681
No, everything's in order.

139
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:15,965
Then I'm not sure why you wanted
to meet with me.

140
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:19,599
Look, Miss Franklin, I know that you
don't really wanna be here,

141
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:25,127
so I'll just be perfectly honest. There is
something strange about that painting.

142
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,598
- Have you seen him?
- Him?

143
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:32,639
- That's how it all starts, you know.
- What do you mean?

144
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:36,119
At first, you see him...

145
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:38,848
...the man inside the painting.

146
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:45,088
At least you think you see him,
but he just... He disappears so fast.

147
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:50,000
And you start to think about it, but
it doesn't make any sense. I mean,

148
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:56,084
how could a man be inside a painting?
And then you see him again.

149
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:58,645
This time longer.

150
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:03,401
And now you're sure.

151
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:06,367
So you think that the painting
is haunted by a ghost?

152
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:11,361
Oh, no, no,
I think he's definitely alive.

153
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:14,637
I think he's trapped inside.

154
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:19,639
- Do you know who he is?
- No, I have no idea.

155
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,321
Nobody does.

156
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:27,797
Look, all I know is that
if I don't get rid of that painting,

157
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:30,927
I'm gonna end up just like everybody
else in my family who ever owned it.

158
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:33,120
- I'm gonna be completely insane.
- Miss Franklin...

159
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:35,245
No, you've only seen the beginning,
Miss Halliwell.

160
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:39,761
Just trust me when I tell you
it's only gonna get worse.

161
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:55,164
Spirits send the words from all...

162
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,327
It's me. Can I come in?

163
00:11:57,489 --> 00:11:59,844
Piper, I really just wanna be alone
right now.

164
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:02,682
I won't stay long, promise.

165
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:05,679
All right, just give me a sec.

166
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:11,443
Okay, you can come in now.

167
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:20,047
I just wanted to tell you
the body shop called.

168
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,400
Yeah, I know, I heard the message,
1,200 bucks.

169
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:25,925
- Did you tell Prue?
- I didn't have to. She already knew.

170
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:27,522
She called the body shop herself.

171
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,600
That's why I have got
to get this job, Piper.

172
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:31,845
It's the only way that I could pay
for the damages.

173
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,607
The only way I can make
things right.

174
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:35,720
All the more reason
you just should've told her.

175
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,323
Okay, well, maybe a smarter person
would've figured that out.

176
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:42,085
Then again, a smart person wouldn't
have backed the car into a pole.

177
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,321
A smart person would've realized
that it was a $1,200 pole.

178
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:49,886
That's because smart people don't do
stupid things, only stupid people do.

179
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:52,768
- Phoebe, I didn't mean to upset you.
- I know.

180
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:56,326
- Maybe we should just talk later.
- Okay.

181
00:12:57,609 --> 00:13:00,726
- You sure you're gonna be okay?
- Yeah. Why?

182
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:03,528
Phoebe, I know you think getting
this job is the answer, but please,

183
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:06,487
- just don't do anything...
- What, stupid?

184
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:09,721
No, just don't do
anything I wouldn't do.

185
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,726
Don't worry, I won't.

186
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:19,718
You would never cast a smart spell.

187
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:22,004
Okay.

188
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:27,805
For 24 hours, from 7 to 7,
I will understand all meaning

189
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:33,766
of the words from here to heaven.

190
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:45,880
Spirits, send the words
From all across the land

191
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:49,439
Allow me to absorb them
Through the touch of either hand

192
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,679
For 24 hours, from 7 to 7

193
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:56,400
I will understand all meaning
Of the words from here to heaven

194
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:59,557
Oh, and P.S., there will be
no personal gain.

195
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:20,366
Abaca, strong fibre obtained
from a banana leaf.

196
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:24,522
Zygote, a cell formed
by the union of two gametes.

197
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:28,721
Cool.

198
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:36,479
- Hey, Joe, that was fast.
- No line at the x-ray machine.

199
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,805
So did the x-ray confirm
its authenticity?

200
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:41,403
It did a lot more than that.
Check out the x-ray.

201
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:43,764
It's got definitive underwriting
on the canvas.

202
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:47,082
- It has a pentimento?
- Yeah, I couldn't believe it either.

203
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:50,685
But you can see it on the x-ray.
The text is in Latin.

204
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:53,357
I've never seen
anything like it before.

205
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:57,921
"Absolvo, amitto, amplus, brevis."

206
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:03,443
- To free what is lost say these words.
- Wow, you speak Latin?

207
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:08,088
- Yes. Good night, Joe.
- Okay.

208
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:10,644
Well, why don't I just return
the painting to the vault,

209
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,083
say, tomorrow.

210
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,166
- Good idea.
- Okay.

211
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:26,968
"Help."

212
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:33,606
Okay.

213
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:41,007
"Semper mea." Mine forever.

214
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:48,079
Absolvo amitto amplus brevis.
Semper mea.

215
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,082
Oh, no.

216
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:18,886
Who's there?

217
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:22,884
- Quick, follow me!
- What?

218
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:25,125
This way. Ladies first.

219
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:28,967
I see you read Latin too.

220
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:30,728
Okay, what has happened?
Where am I?

221
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,402
- You're in the castle.
- Where is that?

222
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:35,481
- Inside a painting.
- I'm trapped inside a painting?

223
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:38,157
Yes, and if you don't get to
that bookcase, you're dead.

224
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:40,402
Who are you?

225
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:43,447
My name's Malcolm, and you were
supposed to help me, not join me.

226
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:44,843
Who are you anyway?

227
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:46,522
My name is Prue,
and I was helping you.

228
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:49,886
- You were supposed to come out.
- Great, now we're both trapped. Hurry!

229
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,999
What the hell? What are you?
How'd you do that?

230
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:57,928
Oh, okay, never mind. We're gonna
get killed. Will you hurry up?

231
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:07,005
Hi, Phoebe.
You're up early. What's up?

232
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:10,923
Oh, the Dow Jones, housing prices
and the space shuttle Discovery.

233
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,081
Read the paper.

234
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:19,165
- Have you seen Prue this morning?
- Not yet.

235
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,008
Oh, Dan just called, said he'd
meet you at the club at noon.

236
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,683
Okay.

237
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:26,403
- Did you hear her come in last night?
- Nope.

238
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,204
This is really strange.

239
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:33,678
Cat hasn't been fed,
no coffee's been made.

240
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:37,361
And Prue definitely
didn't pack a lunch.

241
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:39,287
Well, maybe she's still asleep.

242
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:42,486
No, I checked her room.
Her bed hasn't been slept in.

243
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:45,599
Maybe she didn't come home
from the office last night.

244
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:47,725
No, it's her voice mail.

245
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,121
What if Prue is right
about the painting?

246
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:53,120
What if something's happened?

247
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,928
First off, 63 percent of all adults

248
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:58,557
believed to be missing show up
within 24 hours.

249
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:00,919
An auto accident is unlikely,
1.2 percent.

250
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:03,364
Even less likely
for work-related accidents.

251
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:07,727
Factor in her good health,
a life expectancy of 78.5 years,

252
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,244
add her defensive powers
of telekinesis,

253
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:14,561
and we are looking at the odds of...

254
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:18,848
...less than 4.1 percent. No, actually,
make that less than 3.3 percent.

255
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:21,279
I forgot that the Book of Shadows
had zip on evil artwork.

256
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:25,123
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

257
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:29,284
No, you are like
Ask-Rain-Man. Com.

258
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:31,360
You haven't been
in the Book of Shadows, have you?

259
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:35,926
- No. Why would I do that?
- All right, I don't have time for this.

260
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:37,124
I'm gonna go to Buckland's.

261
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:39,678
Well, what about Dan? You're
supposed to meet him at the club.

262
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:43,319
- Damn it.
- Do you like him?

263
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:46,724
Is that the vibe that I am getting
right now?

264
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:49,562
No, don't be ridiculous.

265
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:52,840
Do me a favour and go in my place.

266
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:55,284
And then you can give me
all the details later.

267
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:59,445
- Like what he was wearing?
- No.

268
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:03,802
You can't just stand there another
12 hours and not let me help you.

269
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,443
- You're hurt.
- Stay where you are. I hate witches.

270
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:09,322
How many times do I have to tell you
that I'm a good witch?

271
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:12,242
Although, if you make me say
that again, I just may hurt you.

272
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:17,007
- Look, I was trying to save you.
- Well, you did a great job.

273
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:19,888
The last thing that I expected
was to get stuck here.

274
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:22,688
So I guess your powers can't get us
out then, huh?

275
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:26,643
No, I can't just lift us
from another world.

276
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:30,965
So if we're gonna get out,
we're gonna have to work together.

277
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:34,088
Just let me help you.

278
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:37,607
I won't turn you into a toad.
I promise.

279
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:40,328
Thank you.

280
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:43,002
May I?

281
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:48,601
Doesn't look too bad.

282
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:50,367
At least the bleeding has...

283
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:54,077
So why do you hate witches so much?

284
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:58,119
It's how I got trapped in here.
The artist that painted this was a witch.

285
00:19:58,289 --> 00:19:59,438
She was my girlfriend.

286
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:02,077
- You dated a witch?
- What, you've never dated a mortal?

287
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,047
I wonder.

288
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:05,882
Oh, sorry.

289
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:08,080
- Go on.
- Fine.

290
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:12,717
Nell and I, we broke up,
and she wrote a curse in Latin.

291
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:13,958
To free what is lost.

292
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,326
Right, and she painted the castle
over it, made sure I got the painting.

293
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:19,764
It was the only way she could
trick me and trap me inside.

294
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:22,609
- It worked.
- So how did you see the underwriting?

295
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:25,567
- Same way as you probably.
- An x-ray.

296
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,759
Well, you must have really
pissed Nell off.

297
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:32,478
Well, that would explain why I haven't
aged since I got here and the fireballs.

298
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,719
How long have you been running
from them?

299
00:20:34,889 --> 00:20:36,800
- What year is it?
- 1999.

300
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:41,280
It's been 70 years.

301
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:46,964
Wait a second. You've been stuck
here trying to get out for 70 years?

302
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:50,358
It's not the typical life
of an art historian, is it?

303
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:51,888
Well, I won't be here that long.

304
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:54,244
I mean, I have two sisters,
and we all have powers.

305
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:56,445
If anybody can find a way out, it's us.

306
00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:03,798
- Dan, sorry to keep you waiting.
- I didn't realize you were late.

307
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:09,760
Oh, 11 minutes, 23.4 seconds,
to be exact. Those the code violations?

308
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:12,841
That and the DBI's codebook
of minimum safety requirements.

309
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:17,241
Okay, then we're all set. I think you'll
find me pretty knowledgeable

310
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,286
about all areas of construction.

311
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:22,204
- What about Piper?
- Oh, something came up.

312
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:25,406
She can't be here. Sorry, buddy.

313
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:32,528
Prue?

314
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:53,920
"Absolvo, amitto, amplus, brevis."

315
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:55,488
Oh, hey, Piper.

316
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,563
Joe Lyons? We met at a wine
auction a few months ago?

317
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:00,088
Prue around?

318
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:02,760
She's... She's somewhere.

319
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:05,727
Well, I won't get in your way.
Just need to pick up the painting.

320
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:08,847
- Oh, forgive me, Joe.
- For what?

321
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,688
For that.

322
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:15,002
That's your plan? Are you crazy?

323
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,803
My sisters will realize I'm missing
soon. I have to let them know

324
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,880
- where I am and warn them.
- You'll die.

325
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:22,643
I don't have any other choice.
Otherwise, my sisters could make

326
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,767
the same mistake I did and get sucked
into this painting. Okay, corner, now.

327
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:31,204
- And how will seeing your name...?
- And the name Nell.

328
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:32,961
Yes, written on the window
prevent that?

329
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:34,881
Okay, my sisters
will think that it's a clue.

330
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,119
They'll look up the name Nell
in our Book of Shadows,

331
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,519
and hopefully, they'll find a solution.
Are you ready? Go.

332
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:43,528
Okay, tell me how you write "help"
on the window

333
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:45,407
without getting creamed
by a fireball.

334
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:47,645
- You don't know how to do it?
- You're the expert.

335
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:50,409
Are you crazy? It took me years
to get those messages written.

336
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,799
And I have the scars to prove it.
What about your powers?

337
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:56,968
All right, fine. I'll deflect fireballs,
you write the names.

338
00:22:58,089 --> 00:22:59,522
Be careful near the window.

339
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:01,408
Why?
What's wrong with the window?

340
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:06,639
Okay, okay, what is happening?

341
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:09,687
The painting, it's being moved.
And it's moving fast.

342
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:20,887
- Get back to the chamber.
- No way, I'm going to that window.

343
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:24,479
It's too dangerous.
We gotta get out of here.

344
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:26,401
Hold the elevator, please.

345
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:37,359
I really wanted to get my name
and Nell's on that window.

346
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:40,441
And you can as soon as the painting's
stopped moving. Just stay low.

347
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:47,807
- What?
- Nothing, I was just... Never mind.

348
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,442
- No, what?
- Well, I always hoped

349
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,679
someone would get my SOS. I just...

350
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,158
I just never thought
it would be a woman.

351
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:55,603
What, a woman can't rescue a man?

352
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:58,363
- I'm still waiting.
- Yeah, well, keep waiting, pal.

353
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:00,208
Bookcase!

354
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:07,799
Hello, this is Phoebe Halliwell,
and I'd like to set up an appointment

355
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:12,764
to return my aptitude test.
By 5 tomorrow? Great. Bye.

356
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,246
Oh, Piper, good news.

357
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:17,843
I spoke to Dan. He will have
your estimate ready by tomorrow.

358
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:20,324
We got bigger problems
than code violations.

359
00:24:20,489 --> 00:24:22,241
- Prue wasn't at Buckland's?
- No.

360
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:25,128
But it was clearly the last place
she was before she disappeared.

361
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:28,804
- I take it you haven't heard from her?
- Not a word. Okay, now I'm worried.

362
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:31,523
Check out this x-ray I found
in her office.

363
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:34,408
I think it may have something to do
with her disappearing.

364
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:37,681
And we don't have a lot of time either.
It won't be long before everyone

365
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:40,278
at Buckland's realizes she is gone
and the painting is gone.

366
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:42,087
Oh, the final match.

367
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:43,768
- Primarily concerned
with blood and...?

368
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:45,487
- Haematology.
- Haematology.

369
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:47,480
Yes. Oona Chaplin,
the wife of Charlie Chaplin,

370
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:48,968
was the daughter of what famous...?

371
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:50,887
- Eugene O'Neill.
- O'Neill.

372
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:54,843
Yes. What country now occupies the
peninsula once known as Asia Minor?

373
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:56,283
- Turkey.
- Turkey.

374
00:24:56,449 --> 00:24:58,883
Yes. Basketball player turned poli...

375
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:01,247
How is it that you know
all the answers?

376
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:04,164
What? I could know about medicine,
American playwrights

377
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,246
and that Asia Minor
is now called Turkey.

378
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:08,559
No, you couldn't.

379
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:11,198
You have cast a spell, haven't you?

380
00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:13,440
I wanted to be able
to get Prue's car fixed.

381
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:15,719
And this job was the only way
that I could do it.

382
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,766
Phoebe, what kind of spell?

383
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:22,286
All I had to do was ace an aptitude test,
which, by the way, I'm sure I have.

384
00:25:22,449 --> 00:25:24,121
- Phoebe!
- Okay.

385
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:28,798
It's a smart spell. And before
you freak out, it's only temporary.

386
00:25:28,969 --> 00:25:29,958
It'll be over by 7:00 tonight.

387
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:33,202
It doesn't matter when it ends.
We're not allowed to cast

388
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:35,081
personal-gain spells. You know that.

389
00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:37,922
Yeah, I do know that, but it's not.

390
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:40,205
I even put that in myself,
no personal gain.

391
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:42,564
There will be consequences.
There always are.

392
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:44,640
I don't care. It's worth it.

393
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:46,721
Piper, you weren't
at that job interview,

394
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:49,403
surrounded
by all those college graduates.

395
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:52,442
You don't know how good it feels
to be really smart.

396
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:54,281
Smart people are respected,

397
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:58,681
taken seriously. And really smart
women, forget about it.

398
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,164
Then again, you probably
do know what I'm talking about.

399
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:05,325
- You have a four-year degree.
- So what?

400
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:10,040
Phoebe, I will never have the kind of
smarts you have, no matter what I do.

401
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:12,285
But, you, you can go back to college.

402
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:15,361
Say you did get this job.
What would happen to it the moment

403
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:17,087
your smart spell ended?

404
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,645
I thought I'd worry about that later.

405
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:25,204
Wait. What does this mean?

406
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:29,203
"Absolvo, amitto, amplus, brevis.
Semper mea"?

407
00:26:30,249 --> 00:26:31,523
Phoebe, help!

408
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,648
- Piper, no!
- Phoebe!

409
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:42,722
Piper?

410
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:46,163
Piper?

411
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:51,485
What the hell is happening?
Where are we?

412
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:54,038
All right, hurry, just get
to the bookcase fast.

413
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:56,638
Watch out!

414
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,679
Don't tell me she's the sister witch
who was gonna save us.

415
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:16,524
I don't wanna live forever
and spend the rest of my life

416
00:27:16,689 --> 00:27:19,442
trapped in a painting hanging
on some wall wearing a broken shoe.

417
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:22,169
Well, neither do I,
but there is a solution.

418
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:24,638
You call that a solution,
braving endless fireballs

419
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:25,918
to get a message to Phoebe?

420
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:29,082
Okay, so it doesn't take
a rocket scientist to figure out

421
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:30,967
that this situation is pretty bad.

422
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:36,522
No, but it may just take a rocket
scientist to get us out of here: Phoebe.

423
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:39,249
- Another witch sister?
- Not just any witch, a super witch.

424
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,838
- She's a genius.
- Piper, I don't really think

425
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:43,647
that you're helping the situation.

426
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:47,358
No, I mean it. She's a walking
brain trust. An Einstein with cleavage.

427
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:49,485
She cast a spell on herself, Prue,
a smart spell.

428
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:51,128
- What?
- Can she save us?

429
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:53,047
Forget the details, Prue.
Just know that

430
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:55,006
if anybody can get us out of here,
it's Phoebe.

431
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:56,682
We need to get back
to that living room,

432
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:59,283
- get Nell's name on that window...
- Piper, wait.

433
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:03,198
No, we can't wait. It's only temporary.
The spell ends at 7 tonight.

434
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:16,807
Come on, come on,
there's got to be something.

435
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,199
- Who is it?
- It's Jenny.

436
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:25,284
Unless it's a huge 911, sweetie,
you're gonna have to come back later.

437
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,723
If we get out of here alive,
you owe me a new pair of shoes.

438
00:28:32,969 --> 00:28:36,245
If we get out of here alive, I'll buy you
the purse to match. Piper, left!

439
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:40,640
Look, forget the shoes. The next time
you get a supernatural SOS...

440
00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:42,686
I'll take your advice and just ignore it.

441
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:45,568
- Be careful near the window!
- What's wrong with the window?

442
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:50,317
Blades.

443
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:54,237
- Are you okay?
- For now.

444
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:58,920
But I can't reach the window, because
if I lean forward, I am slice and diced.

445
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:00,608
Okay.

446
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:06,041
Piper, hurry.

447
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:08,122
Don't forget to write her name
backward

448
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,120
so Phoebe can read it
from the outside.

449
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:16,598
Come on.

450
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:21,726
Good thing she had a short name.

451
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,448
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

452
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:29,644
The human reproductive system?
Wait. And your uncle wanted

453
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,447
Piper to help you out with this?

454
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:35,079
Yeah, but I was too embarrassed to tell
him that I already know about sex.

455
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:38,446
So I figured we could just hang out
and watch some television.

456
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:41,240
Hey, what's that?

457
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:45,808
Jenny, will you go in there
and grab me a pen, please?

458
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:56,999
- Nell?
- Is something wrong?

459
00:29:57,209 --> 00:30:02,044
I'm not sure. Okay.

460
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:05,202
The 23 chromosomes that make up

461
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:08,685
the human genome system
within the cell...

462
00:30:10,729 --> 00:30:14,085
It's too complicated. Okay.

463
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:21,366
- Okey-dokey, you're all set.
- But...

464
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,440
Bye, Jenny.

465
00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:51,202
Nell, Nell, find me Nell

466
00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:02,887
Whoa, I am one super-smart witch.
Okay, what do we have here?

467
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:05,922
Latin. "In the 1920s,
a witch named Nell

468
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:09,081
tricked a powerful warlock
into a painting

469
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:14,488
with a hidden spell that only his power
of x-ray vision could see."

470
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:20,161
Okay, I'm getting tired of talking
to myself. How do I get my sisters out?

471
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:25,842
"Verva omnes liberant."
Words free us all.

472
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:30,122
"These words will free anyone trapped
inside the painting."

473
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:35,042
Okay, but how do I get the words
inside without getting trapped

474
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:37,319
inside the painting myself?

475
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:44,805
No, I couldn't.

476
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:49,637
So maybe we should take shifts

477
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:51,640
waiting for Phoebe
outside the bookcase.

478
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,481
I mean, we've been
pretty safe there so far.

479
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:58,600
- I'll take the first shift.
- I had a feeling you would.

480
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:01,238
What? What is it? What's wrong?

481
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:05,567
I've been thinking about that witch
who cursed Malcolm into the painting.

482
00:32:05,969 --> 00:32:10,087
I mean, it takes a lot of time and a high
level of magic to create this world.

483
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:13,918
Seems like an awfully big spell
just to get revenge over a bad breakup.

484
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:16,842
- I agree.
- And it was almost impossible for us,

485
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:19,443
the Charmed Ones no less,
to get that message on the window.

486
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:23,198
Yet Malcolm, an art historian
with absolutely no powers,

487
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,206
was able to escape fireballs
and those blades

488
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:29,643
to get his message on the window.
I mean, I don't know, Piper, it just...

489
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:32,238
Something weird about all of this.

490
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:41,925
Here, kitty, kitty.

491
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,164
Here, kitty, kitty.

492
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:49,564
What do we have here?

493
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:54,927
- It is Kit.
- What is she doing here?

494
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:58,968
- Prue, look.
- Verva omnes...

495
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:00,682
Piper, freeze him.

496
00:33:01,129 --> 00:33:04,758
You're too late. But you were right,
your sister Phoebe is one smart witch.

497
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:09,081
Blinking allows me to be one place
one moment and another the next.

498
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:10,688
Piper, look out.

499
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:14,399
Liberant!

500
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,959
I thought he was an innocent.
I thought he needed help.

501
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:22,120
I'm not talking to you, forever.

502
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:34,037
Thanks for freeing me, witch.
Seventy years is a long time.

503
00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:36,240
Seventy years?

504
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:40,119
- You're a warlock, aren't you?
- Your sisters were right.

505
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:42,918
You are a smart witch.

506
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:46,967
- Where are they?
- With the cat.

507
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:50,282
The one with no collar.
That was interesting.

508
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:54,084
That was smart.
Too smart for your own good.

509
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,806
So that woman who brought Prue
the painting, she's a warlock too?

510
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:02,519
Jane's my lover. She's been trying
to get me out for years.

511
00:34:02,729 --> 00:34:05,368
She needed to find
the Charmed Ones, you.

512
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:10,127
- It took her 70 years to do that.
- We haven't been around that long.

513
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:17,479
I read a Jeet Kune Do manual
earlier today.

514
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,759
I think that makes me a black belt.

515
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:28,757
Actually, make that a seventh-degree
black belt. I'm a master.

516
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,521
Not for long you're not.

517
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:33,767
We'll see how powerful you are,
how smart you are

518
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:36,722
- when your spell ends at 7.
- How do you know about that?

519
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:39,609
Tick-tock, Phoebe. Tick-tock.

520
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:44,563
- Malcolm.
- Jane.

521
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:54,362
I thought I'd never seen you again.
Come on, let's get out of here.

522
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:57,925
Not yet, not yet. I have
a little present for you.

523
00:34:58,089 --> 00:35:00,080
Oh, you do? Where is it?

524
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:03,480
It's inside the house.
Something you've always wanted.

525
00:35:04,049 --> 00:35:07,121
- And what would that be?
- The power of premonition.

526
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:12,205
- And what would you get?
- Revenge and two more powers.

527
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:24,524
Even if Phoebe is alive,
she may not be for long.

528
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:28,445
Maybe she can figure out a way
to save herself before he finds her.

529
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:31,527
Yeah, well, she better do it quick.
It's almost 7.

530
00:35:32,169 --> 00:35:35,161
Although, if anybody can do it,
Phoebe can.

531
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,564
Yeah, even without the smart spell.

532
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:40,368
I mean, putting that message
on Kit's collar,

533
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,801
that's very Phoebe.
I would have never thought of it.

534
00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:47,766
Neither would I. It was a great plan.

535
00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:50,847
If we get out of here, I'm gonna buy
her a new pair of shoes.

536
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:53,239
I'll buy her the purse to match.

537
00:35:55,009 --> 00:35:56,727
Now, the spell,

538
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:01,407
it was three words in Latin.
Question is, which three?

539
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:11,448
Oh, no. Come on, come on.
Okay, it's on the tip of my tongue.

540
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:16,398
Verva omnes... Something.

541
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:21,729
Verva omnes... Liber... Liber...
Liberace!

542
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:23,846
No, it can't be Liberace.

543
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:32,244
Oh, no.

544
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:36,522
It's in Latin. The spell is over,

545
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:39,647
and I don't understand
Latin anymore.

546
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:41,887
I told you I'd be back.

547
00:36:46,249 --> 00:36:48,001
Hello, Phoebe.

548
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:55,884
- Say goodbye to your family.
- No!

549
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:04,285
"Absolvo, amitto, amplus, brevis.
Semper mea."

550
00:37:05,169 --> 00:37:07,160
No!

551
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:16,558
- The house is on fire?
- No, not the house, the painting.

552
00:37:16,729 --> 00:37:19,448
It's gotta be Malcolm's doing.
He must be at the manor.

553
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:25,440
- Phoebe, you're alive.
- Yeah. Let's keep it that way.

554
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:30,040
Malcolm?

555
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,160
- And Jane.
- She's a warlock.

556
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:34,445
You stupid witch.
Now you and your sisters

557
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:36,520
are gonna end up burning to death.

558
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:40,246
Looking for this?

559
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:43,288
Freeze them.

560
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,567
Where's Kit?

561
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:47,287
There she is, there she is.

562
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:49,605
Okay. Oh, I can't believe
we almost forgot her.

563
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,727
Verva omnes liberant!

564
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:05,406
You know, I didn't want them to die.

565
00:38:05,649 --> 00:38:08,004
I just wanted them trapped
in that house forever.

566
00:38:08,169 --> 00:38:10,603
Bright side, you won't have
to worry about any complaints

567
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:13,363
- from the owner of the painting.
- And you'll never have to worry

568
00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:15,997
about anyone else getting
a supernatural mayday from it.

569
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:19,002
Yeah, well, thanks for getting ours,
Phoebe.

570
00:38:19,169 --> 00:38:20,682
How did you get the collar
from Malcolm?

571
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:25,081
Oh, I used a very complex,
very different kind of smarts.

572
00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:27,160
- You picked his pocket.
- I picked his pocket.

573
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:30,600
- Phoebe.
- What? He was a warlock.

574
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,078
Smartest thing I've ever done.

575
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:40,884
A new heating and cooling system,

576
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:45,958
retrofitting, imported pre-stressed
l-beams, architectural flooring.

577
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:51,085
Your estimate requires a quarter
of a million dollars and a crew of 75.

578
00:38:51,689 --> 00:38:53,327
I tell you,
I'm not feeling real guilty

579
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:55,002
about not helping Jenny
with that paper.

580
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:57,842
Well, actually,
those were Phoebe's suggestions.

581
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:03,039
Phoebe. Can you fix it cheap
and fix it quick?

582
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:04,358
In a couple of days, sure.

583
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:06,958
Great, you're hired.
You can take that with you.

584
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:11,045
- Hey, Prue.
- Hey.

585
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:12,528
- Phoebe.
- Hey.

586
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:14,685
- You got a minute?
- Yeah.

587
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:22,081
- Is it about Piper?
- No, it's actually about Jenny's paper.

588
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:29,402
You know, I wasn't really myself
that day. Is there a problem?

589
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:33,323
No, it's not due till Friday,
but I really appreciate your help.

590
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:35,844
- I think...
- Yeah, okay.

591
00:39:37,129 --> 00:39:40,485
I'd really appreciate if Jenny could do
her own work, in her handwriting,

592
00:39:40,689 --> 00:39:42,919
using her own smarts,
if you know what I mean.

593
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:47,117
L... I certainly do. All right.

594
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:51,445
You don't wanna know.

595
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:55,238
You know, this whole smart spell thing,
it really just made me realize

596
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:57,525
that there's a lot of cool information
out there.

597
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,003
- I agree.
- And who knows,

598
00:39:59,169 --> 00:40:02,400
maybe I will go back to college,
take some night classes.

599
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:05,688
- I'm a smart girl, I'll figure it out.
- Yes, you will.

600
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:09,677
Just don't lose that common sense.
We may need it to save the day again.

601
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:15,160
- What are we talking about?
- Right now, the job

602
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:17,599
- that I will not be getting.
- Smart move, Pheebs.

603
00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:20,079
- Now open your present.
- Okay.

604
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:32,282
Wait, you guys got me shoes
and a purse?

605
00:40:32,449 --> 00:40:34,599
Very smart-looking,
wouldn't you say, Piper?

606
00:40:35,209 --> 00:40:38,121
- Pure genius, Prue.
- Enough with that already.

607
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:39,517
Okay, you wanna explain this?

608
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:44,760
Okay, well, that's Piper,
and that's Dan.

609
00:40:44,969 --> 00:40:46,641
I see.
