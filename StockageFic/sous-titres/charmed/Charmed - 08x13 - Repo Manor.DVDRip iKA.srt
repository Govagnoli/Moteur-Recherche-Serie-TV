1
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:09,760
Energy ball.

2
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,149
Nice teamwork.

3
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,026
You mean, nice sister work.

4
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,028
We are definitely
getting better at this.

5
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,405
Well, we should be,
we've been doing it long enough.

6
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,116
- I think we're ready.
- So do I.

7
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,326
I don't.

8
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,913
- Something is still missing.
- What do you mean?

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,915
How many more demons
do we have to vanquish?

10
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,334
We've been training for this
for, like, eight years.

11
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,669
Five for me.

12
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,505
But still,
we've mastered their powers.

13
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,257
Their individual powers, yes.

14
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,260
But you're still missing
their collective power.

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,011
The power of three.

16
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,930
And until you get it,

17
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,766
you will never truly replace
the Charmed Ones.

18
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,118
Anyone down here?

19
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,204
Big box and high heels.

20
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,080
Need some help.

21
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,249
Just a sec.

22
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,919
Sorry. Do you need help?

23
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,545
Well, I did.

24
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:09,880
Now I just need a sec.

25
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,758
Okay, well, since I have you...

26
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,384
Piper, I'm kind of running late.

27
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,761
I have to go sign the loan docs

28
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,305
and I want to stop by the condo
before work.

29
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,265
Loan docs?

30
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,769
Wow, I didn't realise
this was moving along so quickly.

31
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,523
But, you know, I've been so focussed
on getting Leo back.

32
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,982
Yeah, I know.

33
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,110
But I have made a list of seers
and oracles

34
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,071
and anyone that might be able
to foresee

35
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,615
who we'll have to fight
in order to get him back.

36
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,825
Great. Okay, well, call me
if you find anything.

37
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,120
Well, I was thinking...

38
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,998
I was thinking that maybe
you should take my Jeep

39
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,418
because my car holds so much more
than yours does.

40
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,838
- Doesn't it?
- Right.

41
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,299
Piper, are you sure
you're okay with me moving out?

42
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,343
Yeah, of course I am.

43
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,096
I mean, we can't be
roommates forever.

44
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:00,472
That's just weird.

45
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,017
Okay. Well, here I go.

46
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,563
What am I gonna do?

47
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,357
I'm supposed to have a date
with Henry tonight

48
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,401
and he is in the worst mood.

49
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,820
He's lost his car keys,
he's lost his wallet,

50
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,738
he's locked himself
out of his apartment,

51
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,742
and I need him to be in a good mood
for what I want to do tonight.

52
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,744
We aren't talking about sex, are we?

53
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,914
No, we're not talking about sex.

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,836
I finally screwed up my courage
to tell him, you know, that I'm a witch

55
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:34,214
and I feel like I have to do it tonight,
otherwise I might wuss out.

56
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,512
I really need to know
if he's okay with who I am.

57
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,849
You've been through this a lot,
Pheebs. Got any advice?

58
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,186
Well, hope he doesn't faint.

59
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,021
No, I don't know.

60
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:52,399
I mean, I haven't had any success
with these things.

61
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,943
Just ease into it, you know,
try to lessen the blow.

62
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,528
Okay, how?

63
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,363
Maybe call in
some reinforcements?

64
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,657
Maybe ask some of your
magical friends

65
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,202
to help him have a better day
so you could have a better night?

66
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,620
Like fairies or something?

67
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,289
Sure, fairies, leprechauns,
whatever.

68
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,790
Good luck.

69
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,210
Pheebs?

70
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,754
I was actually hoping that maybe

71
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,132
you could help me narrow down
the list a little bit before you go.

72
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,967
Oh, Piper, I'm really late.

73
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:22,054
Oh, okay.
Well, you know, it's just Leo.

74
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,098
Really, come on.
All I need is one little premonition.

75
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,476
- How hard can it be?
- Okay.

76
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,647
What more do we have to do
to convince you?

77
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,273
Convincing me is irrelevant.

78
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,943
We'll only get one shot
at freeing our brethren.

79
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,152
We know that, Savard.

80
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,071
We also know that there's a reason

81
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:42,574
why our kind has been enslaved
for centuries.

82
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,994
The Slave King
is no ordinary demon.

83
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,746
We escaped.

84
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,039
Yes.

85
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,292
So we could return
with enough power to destroy him,

86
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,294
a power I'm not sure we've got yet.

87
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,422
But we've spent the last eight years
replicating the greatest power there is.

88
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,632
Charmed power.

89
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,426
And we've not only studied
every aspect of what they know

90
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,636
and who they are.

91
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,097
We've infused our blood
with their magical blood,

92
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,975
so that their power is our power.

93
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,020
Which means we may already have
the power of three.

94
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,106
But you haven't showed it yet!

95
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:15,983
In any test or trial.

96
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,527
Which means you don't have it.

97
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,321
And you need to get it

98
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,157
if we have any hopes
of destroying the Slave King.

99
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,619
There must be a way.

100
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,204
Think back.

101
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,291
Tap into your knowledge
of the witches.

102
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,630
Phoebe was stuck
in a genie's bottle once.

103
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,800
If we could trap her in it again,

104
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:45,137
maybe we could command her,
master to genie, to tell us how.

105
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,638
Forget it.

106
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:47,973
Leo got rid of the bottle.

107
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,642
What about using the sword,
Excalibur?

108
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,020
No, only Wyatt can wield it.

109
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,772
Okay, maybe I could pose as Paige,

110
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,482
trick the Elders into helping us.

111
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,359
Right, like that's gonna work.

112
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,819
Look, do you have any ideas?

113
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,654
Or are you just gonna shoot down
all of ours?

114
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,489
At least I don't come up
with stupid ideas.

115
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,783
- Stupid?
- Hey!

116
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,327
Knock it off.

117
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,331
At least you've got
the sibling rivalry down pat.

118
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,376
Wait. The dollhouse.

119
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,216
It's a magical replica
of the real house, isn't it?

120
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,385
Which is believed to be magical
in and of itself.

121
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,805
The house is
the witches' power base,

122
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,224
has been for generations.

123
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,808
So?

124
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,896
So if we could trap all of them
inside the dollhouse...

125
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,190
Like Piper was trapped
once before...

126
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,275
Then we've got
the power of three contained.

127
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,861
And if we're in the real manor
while they're in the dollhouse...

128
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:46,698
We might be able to channel
the power of three into us.

129
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,705
It just might work.

130
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,724
Anybody up there?

131
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,231
Hello?

132
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,085
Billie, what are you doing?

133
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,171
What else?
Still trying to find my sister.

134
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,756
Trying to figure out what
this symbol means or where it leads.

135
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,758
I figure it has to be demonic, right?

136
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,428
- No, I mean...
- I mean, if it's in her diary,

137
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,306
you'd think I'd be able to find
something about it in this book, but I...

138
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,308
Billie, what are you doing
in Phoebe's room?

139
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,144
Oh, well, she said
I could hang out in here

140
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,354
because she's not gonna be using it.

141
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,606
Is that okay?

142
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,275
Oh, yeah. Sure.

143
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,278
I mean, you know, if she's not
gonna be using it anymore.

144
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,865
Maybe I should just take this stuff
to my dorm.

145
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,575
Oh, no, no, no. Don't be ridiculous.

146
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:15,078
I just, you know, I wish she would have
said something, that's all.

147
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,705
Is that her spirit board?

148
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:21,960
Yeah, she said I could borrow it
to try and contact Christy.

149
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,462
Can I?

150
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,130
Yeah, you know.

151
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,299
Sure, if you want to start
paying rent.

152
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,719
Just kidding.

153
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,472
Can I borrow the "Book?"

154
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,183
Hey, where did it go?

155
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,484
Hey, there. Okay, here's the thing.

156
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,820
My sort of hopefully-
he'Il-become-my boyfriend, Henry,

157
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,989
he's having a bit of a problem
losing things,

158
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,116
like a wallet, his keys, you know,
stuff like that.

159
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,745
And, not to cast any aspersions
on your character,

160
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,832
you guys are known
for the kind of sticky-finger problem.

161
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:03,085
So I was wondering
if you could go back to your people

162
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,170
and tell them
to put everything back.

163
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,588
That would help me so much

164
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:11,009
because I really, really, really need
his undivided attention tonight.

165
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,096
Thank you.

166
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,063
Paige, what are you doing?

167
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,899
Just taking Phoebe's advice.

168
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,910
Really, it's the most amazing thing.

169
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,912
I mean,
first my keys turn up in the laundry,

170
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,206
then one of my parolees
finds my wallet.

171
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:44,042
- Still has everything in it.
- That's great.

172
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,045
My 49ers hat, I lost it in high school,
my letterman's jacket.

173
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,464
It's like everything is turning up,
it's crazy.

174
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,757
Very subtle.

175
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,718
I mean, very...

176
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:55,554
Very lucky.
Some would say magical.

177
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,431
Yeah, I don't know, but I'll take it.

178
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,600
So, good. We still on for dinner?

179
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,435
What's so important
you can't tell me now?

180
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,854
You're just gonna have to wait

181
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,480
and hear all about it tonight.

182
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,690
Seven o'clock okay?

183
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,819
Look, Paige, five of my parolees
have job interviews tomorrow.

184
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,906
They all asked me to write letters
of recommendations for them tonight.

185
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,657
Okay, write them.

186
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,453
Yeah, well, that's a little easier said
than done.

187
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,787
I'm not a writer, Paige.

188
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,916
But look, please don't think that
I don't wanna go out with you, okay?

189
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,751
I do. I have all this work.

190
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:28,086
I don't want to let these guys down.

191
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,255
Who knows? Maybe I'll get inspired.

192
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,467
I think you should count on that.

193
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,262
I'll see you at 7, Henry.

194
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,814
<i>Being of creativity
Show yourself to me</i>

195
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,610
Hey, Muse, right?

196
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:55,280
Could you do me a huge favour
and inspire my friend Henry in there?

197
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,282
I'd really appreciate it.

198
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,784
Thank you.

199
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,462
<i>Phoebe, Piper is on line 2-5.</i>

200
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,799
Okay, got it.

201
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,384
Hey, what's up?

202
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:17,803
<i>Have you ever heard of a wizard
named Zakal?</i>

203
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,012
No, why?

204
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,931
Well, he's been around for ages

205
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,016
and supposedly
he's very well-connected.

206
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,310
He worked for the Source
back in the day.

207
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,898
Are you typing?

208
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,693
No. No, I'm not writing,
of course I'm not writing.

209
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,319
<i>Phoebe, this is important.</i>

210
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,155
- This guy could know who's after us.
- Or not.

211
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,283
<i>Look, sweetie, bringing Leo home</i>

212
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,410
<i>is the most important thing
in the world.</i>

213
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,537
To all of us.

214
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,330
But it's not gonna happen overnight.

215
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,583
It's also not gonna happen
if we don't try.

216
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,751
Yeah, but we have been trying.

217
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,504
And we can't just stop living our lives,
you know?

218
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:53,839
<i>I mean, you said so yourself.</i>

219
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:55,174
Yeah, well, I didn't mean it.

220
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,343
Look, I just don't want to lose
this lead, okay?

221
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,595
He could know something.

222
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,972
All right, look,
I haven't signed the loan docs yet,

223
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,766
<i>- so why don't I swing by after work...
- Well, you have my car.</i>

224
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,185
And the car seats are in my car.

225
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,313
Well, I have to drop the kids off
at Dad's, don't I?

226
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,522
<i>Okay, you know what?</i>

227
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,483
I'm beginning to think
that you're sabotaging me moving out.

228
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,445
Are you kidding me? Please,
I've already rented out your room.

229
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,655
Oh, by the way,
could you do me a favour

230
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,866
and pick up some mandrake root
on your way home?

231
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,951
<i>If this guy Zakal
doesn't wanna be cooperative,</i>

232
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,661
we may need a vanquishing potion.

233
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,455
Okay? Thanks.

234
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,212
Hi.

235
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,130
Hello.

236
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,224
I've always admired
her sense of fashion.

237
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:47,809
Keys are in the pocket.

238
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,353
Remember,

239
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,397
get the sisters to use
the power of three as soon as possible

240
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,399
so we can see
if it's going to work or not.

241
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,944
But we have no idea
what's going on in their lives right now.

242
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,570
Just wing it.

243
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,280
Be yourself.

244
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,574
Or rather, be Phoebe.

245
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,576
Just don't get too eager.

246
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,662
You'll tip the sisters off.

247
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,849
Piper?

248
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,768
Paige?

249
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,145
First time's a foot.

250
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,189
Next time,

251
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,357
a fireball.

252
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,739
Hey, good, you're back.

253
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,032
How'd it go with Henry?

254
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,366
Oh, not so hot.

255
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,160
I had to summon a muse.

256
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:29,620
Oh, fairy wasn't cutting it?

257
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:34,458
No. I cannot believe how hard it is
just to tell somebody about magic.

258
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,585
Just wait till you have to explain
demons to him.

259
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:37,794
Which, by the way,

260
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,172
we will be going after one
if Phoebe ever gets home.

261
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,257
- It's a big adjustment, huh?
- No.

262
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,051
I mean, she's moved out before.

263
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,720
Right. Are you okay with it?

264
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,680
Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

265
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,933
Oh, I don't know.
Because you guys have lived together

266
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,851
since the age of zero?

267
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,103
Believe me, I'm fine. Really.

268
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,233
Really. I just need her to help me
with this wizard and that's all.

269
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,819
Oh, hello.

270
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,781
- Hey, there.
- Can I come in?

271
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,699
Of course you can come in,
don't be ridiculous.

272
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:11,203
- Thank you for coming.
- Well, great.

273
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,288
- Whatever you need.
- Thank you.

274
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,873
You're welcome.

275
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,584
So what do you need?

276
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,253
The mandrake root?

277
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:24,132
Oh, right, the mandrake root.

278
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,427
Where exactly
do we keep that again?

279
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,556
You were supposed to get some
on your way home.

280
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,767
You know,
for the whole wizard situation.

281
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,311
Oh, yeah, that's right.

282
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,733
Are we gonna need the power of three,
by any chance, for this?

283
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,653
You know we will.
What's the matter with you?

284
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,865
Oh, you know, it's just...

285
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,324
Oh, it's probably just the move.

286
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:52,161
Yeah. Yeah.

287
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:57,791
Okay, so let's see
where I put that mandrake root.

288
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,419
Oh, yeah, here it is.

289
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:03,213
Now, let's go get those demons,
shall we?

290
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,760
How'd that feel?

291
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,596
Last time.

292
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:14,308
Have you or have you not foreseen
any threats against us?

293
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:19,229
I'm old. I'm afraid my visions
haven't been very reliable lately.

294
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,107
- Oh, bull. Let's just vanquish him.
- Wait.

295
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,650
You don't have to do this so quickly.

296
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,485
We could probably
get some stuff out of him.

297
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,779
Help us and we'll spare you.

298
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,114
All I'll tell you is,

299
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:32,826
that by the time you figure out
which demon is after you,

300
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,077
it'll be too late!

301
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,539
- All right, you know what? Forget this.
- Phoebe, no, no, no!

302
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,501
I did it.

303
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,377
Yeah, you did it. Why?

304
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,129
What do you mean? He's a demon.

305
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,507
We vanquish demons.
I mean, that's what we do, right?

306
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,010
Yeah, actually,
but we could have made him talk first.

307
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,803
No, not Zakal.

308
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,225
I mean, you know,
it's not like he was gonna say anything.

309
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,185
Well, he's certainly
not gonna say anything now.

310
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,103
What the hell were you thinking?

311
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,030
- Well?
- It worked.

312
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,407
She blasted Zakal
right out of his robe.

313
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,909
Using the power of three?

314
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,454
- Definitely.
- All right.

315
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,666
It's time to switch one more sister.

316
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,584
Wait, one more?

317
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,253
Why not both of us?

318
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,421
I mean, we know we can channel
the power of three now,

319
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,131
so let's just go vanquish
the Slave King.

320
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,218
We cannot vanquish him
without the potion, which means

321
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,720
we need a witch to find it for us
in the "Book of Shadows. "

322
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,849
So why don't we go look for it?

323
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,101
Because you might be able to fool
the sisters,

324
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:41,603
but you cannot fool the "Book. "

325
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,981
It senses evil.

326
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,024
He's right.

327
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,110
You'll go.

328
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,866
Play on Piper's desire
to get Leo back.

329
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,660
Make it look like the Slave King
is behind it all.

330
00:17:56,827 --> 00:18:00,998
She will do anything
to get her husband back.

331
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,085
Wait a second,
I'm still talking to you.

332
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:08,046
Well, I said I was sorry.
What more would you like me to say?

333
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:11,216
I want you to tell me why you did that,
why you didn't wait for my cue.

334
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,552
Well, because I was afraid
we were gonna be attacked.

335
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,512
Yeah, well, I'm afraid of losing Leo.

336
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,682
Okay, don't use the guilt card with me
like you did with Cole.

337
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,017
Cole?

338
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:23,228
Can you think of perhaps
a maybe more recent example?

339
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,064
Well, yeah, I can
but I can't right now,

340
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,442
- because I'm a little flustered.
- Guys.

341
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:31,028
I cannot believe that you care more

342
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,822
about getting back
to your new condo than Leo.

343
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,407
How can you even say that?

344
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,201
Well, do you have
another explanation?

345
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,578
Well, yes. I do.

346
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,875
But I'm not gonna tell you.

347
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:56,512
Phoebe?

348
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,388
Billie.

349
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,807
Hey, what are you doing here?

350
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,727
Well, you told me
I could use your room, right?

351
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,772
Oh, yeah. Right.

352
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:10,192
I just meant
I didn't know you were still here.

353
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,112
- Do you want me to leave?
- No.

354
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,698
No, don't be silly.

355
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:27,960
So why don't you tell me about
how your search for Chrissie is going.

356
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,629
You mean Christy?

357
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,006
Yeah. Yeah, you know what I mean.
Whatever.

358
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,052
First, all she cares about
is her stupid condo,

359
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,470
then she comes back here to help,

360
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,389
and now she's suddenly
trigger-happy?

361
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:42,182
She's all over the map.

362
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,434
I'm sure there's some
perfectly good reason.

363
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,478
Oh, yeah?
Well, I am still waiting for it.

364
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,564
- Maybe she was just flustered.
- Flustered?

365
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,732
If anybody has the right
to be flustered around here,

366
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,234
it would be the newly single mom.

367
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:53,694
You're right.

368
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,363
Now I have to go find
another damn wizard.

369
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:58,699
Where is the "Book?"

370
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,826
I guess it's still in the attic.

371
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,333
Hey, mister.

372
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,587
<i>- You better not be cancelling on me.
- I'm not.</i>

373
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,131
Unless you're breaking up with me,
then maybe I should.

374
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:15,716
Oh, got you scared, huh?

375
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,176
A little bit, little bit.

376
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,427
I finished those letters.

377
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,804
<i>And wrote you a love letter.</i>

378
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,557
<i>- Got inspired.
- I can't wait to hear it.</i>

379
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:26,393
Assuming you still want
to read it to me.

380
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,603
<i>Why wouldn't I?</i>

381
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,688
<i>Henry, they need you
down at the station. Now.</i>

382
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,940
Hang on a second, Paige.
What's going on?

383
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:34,276
<i>GPS went down
on your parolees' transmitters.</i>

384
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:36,236
<i>- Sergeant needs you to find them.
- Great.</i>

385
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,488
- Well, what does that mean?
- It means I gotta go.

386
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,200
What about dinner?

387
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,369
Sorry, Paige, bad luck.

388
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,167
I'm not on call, you know.

389
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,377
Look, I'm not in the mood, okay?

390
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,630
Really, really, I'm not.
And besides, you guys owe me.

391
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:58,008
Oh, remember a little somebody
named Shamus?

392
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,219
So now it's blackmail, is it?

393
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,013
No, it's not blackmail.

394
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,767
Look, I just need my boyfriend Henry
to have a little bit of luck,

395
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,060
which is why I need your help.

396
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:11,563
So just please, go meet me
at the police station in an hour

397
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,149
and I will explain
everything to you, okay?

398
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,318
All right, but don't be late.

399
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,445
I'm a busy leprechaun, you know.

400
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:28,705
Don't you just hate leprechauns?

401
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,339
You know what to do.

402
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,513
Yes.

403
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,765
I think I do.

404
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,021
Welcome to the dollhouse.

405
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,607
We're trapped,
and even worse than that,

406
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:58,485
we're really, really small.

407
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,153
Okay.

408
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,448
Are you saying that that means
there's no way out of this place?

409
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:06,118
Well, unless
you wanna get squished.

410
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,996
This can't be. I have a date tonight.
Sorry, can't miss it.

411
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:10,998
Give me your hand.
We're orbing out of here.

412
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:12,791
Yeah, but...

413
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,628
Why didn't that work?
What is wrong with my powers?

414
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,255
See, that's what
I'm trying to tell you.

415
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:21,216
I think our powers
were downsized as well.

416
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,142
Rock.

417
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,439
Who's he?

418
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:37,983
He's the demon that replaced us
with look-alikes,

419
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,111
which, by the way, I can't even believe
that you didn't notice that wasn't me.

420
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,906
Well, sorry.
You only vanquished a wizard with us.

421
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,700
I mean, she van... She... Her...

422
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,535
The not you...

423
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,537
Whatever.

424
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,540
Wait a second.
We used the power of three.

425
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,459
Yeah, I think that's part of their plan.

426
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,628
They keep us here
and then use the power of three

427
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,923
to vanquish some guy
named the Slave King

428
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,424
and unfortunately, us.

429
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:05,010
Well, we have to get to Piper somehow
before they do.

430
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:08,013
Yeah, but how?

431
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:12,643
So then I tried to match the symbol
with the council

432
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,479
but it wasn't a direct match,
it just didn't work.

433
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,856
I don't understand.

434
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:20,901
Yeah, you know what?
That's just a really boring story.

435
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:23,862
- Boring?
- Yeah.

436
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,280
I think you should just give up.

437
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:29,201
I mean, it's not like
you're gonna really find her anyway.

438
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,925
Paige, don't start with me, okay?

439
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:47,177
- I have a headache.
- Forget it, lady.

440
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:48,887
I'm on to you.

441
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:50,681
What do you mean?

442
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,142
Relax. It's just me, Patra.

443
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,562
Oh, thank God.

444
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,272
This sister stuff is taxing.

445
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,233
Don't worry, it'll all be over soon.

446
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:09,658
There you are.

447
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:13,245
If you two are up here
to gang up on me, forget it.

448
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:15,747
No, of course not.

449
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:18,834
Phoebe has come to apologise,
haven't you, Phoebe?

450
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,712
Really?

451
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,755
Okay.

452
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:25,632
I'm listening.

453
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,260
Well, Piper, I just wanted to say

454
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:33,056
that I'm sorry
for not being myself lately.

455
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:38,187
And if it seems that I don't care
about what you're going through,

456
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,106
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

457
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:42,774
I'm sorry too.

458
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,319
Well, great.
Now that that's taken care of,

459
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,529
- I've got a lead.
- What? How?

460
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:49,823
Whitelighter grapevine.

461
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:53,243
Turns out there's a fast-rising demon
in the underworld

462
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,995
known as the Slave King.

463
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,623
Oh, the Slave King.
Yeah, I've heard of him.

464
00:24:58,123 --> 00:24:59,458
Really? I haven't.

465
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,419
Well, the Elders have.

466
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:05,964
What do you say we track him down
and see if we can find anything?

467
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:09,510
I don't know. I think we should focus
on this demonic seer I found.

468
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:10,802
No, no.

469
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:12,763
The Elders say he's pretty evil.

470
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,058
He's enslaved an entire demonic race
for centuries now.

471
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:18,644
Well, that actually sounds
like a good thing.

472
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,853
No, it's not.

473
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,897
He's forcing them
to do his demonic bidding.

474
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,652
It's just something
we should check on, that's all.

475
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:30,489
- What have we got to lose?
- Yeah.

476
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,325
You two seem awfully gung ho
about this.

477
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:35,494
Well, anything to find Leo, hon.

478
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:38,664
Should we look at the "Book?"

479
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:16,618
I can't believe I'm being stood up

480
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,704
by a witch.

481
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,876
- So you see anything?
- Not yet.

482
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:28,881
Why didn't you meet me
like you said?

483
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,717
Oh, I'm sorry. You are?

484
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:36,013
Someone who's got better things to do
than chasing the whims of a witch.

485
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,891
No matter how good you've been
to the little people.

486
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,226
Well, I've just been busy
helping my sister.

487
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:44,688
Well, I was just trying to give
your boyfriend a little luck.

488
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:46,565
That is what you want, isn't it?

489
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:49,193
That sounds just swell.

490
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,320
So how about you go give that guy
some luck?

491
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,530
Scamper off, skedaddle.

492
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:55,032
Go with God.

493
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:59,077
Fine. But after this, we're even.

494
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:13,383
Now, where were we?

495
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,957
Hey, Henry, you're in luck.

496
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,876
- Look who I found.
- Jamison, where did you find him?

497
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,711
I was just walking in
and there he was.

498
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:52,047
Walked right up to me
and turned himself in.

499
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:53,757
Henry.

500
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:55,759
I got two more for you.

501
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:57,386
Caught them
just before they left town.

502
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:00,055
Where'd you find them?
I've been looking for them for weeks.

503
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:01,974
Yeah, it's Mitchell.

504
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,809
What?

505
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,686
I just won 10 thou...?

506
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:07,813
I just won 10,000 dol...

507
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,731
I just won $10,000!

508
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,698
What is going on today?

509
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:22,077
Well, he's powerful
but he's no seer.

510
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:24,246
I don't know why he would know
who's after us.

511
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:27,166
Maybe the Elders don't know
what they're talking about.

512
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,294
Well, who are we to question them?

513
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,088
We question them all the time.

514
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:37,092
Right. Maybe this time
they just know something we don't.

515
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,887
Okay, can we get on with this?
I have to get to work.

516
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,558
Any vanquishing potion in there?

517
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:45,767
No.

518
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,519
Okay, well, we can make one, right?

519
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,354
There should be one
in the back of the "Book,"

520
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:51,190
just flip to the back of the "Book. "

521
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,525
I know, thank you.

522
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:56,445
What was that?

523
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:58,572
Did you see that?

524
00:28:58,739 --> 00:28:59,781
See what?

525
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:01,700
You didn't see that?

526
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:06,705
That was weird. I felt like somebody
was calling me or something.

527
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:09,374
That is odd.

528
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:11,627
Is that the potion?

529
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,087
All right,
what is the matter with you two?

530
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,547
This:

531
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:18,467
Cave.

532
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:22,971
It's about time.

533
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,854
Okay, we're gonna need
some henbane,

534
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:33,065
gypsy's blood and hemlock root.

535
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:40,572
Together again.

536
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,087
Oh, Piper, are you okay?

537
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:56,839
No, you punched me.

538
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,131
I did not punch you.

539
00:29:58,298 --> 00:29:59,716
It was her demonic double.

540
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:01,885
What? What are you talking about?

541
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:05,097
We've been replaced.

542
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:08,100
Oh, no, no, no.

543
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:11,186
Don't tell me
we're stuck in the dollhouse.

544
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:13,438
Well, it seems to be an annual event
for you.

545
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:16,191
Oh, I should have known
they were demons.

546
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:17,526
Speaking of demons,

547
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:19,361
did they mention
the Slave King to you?

548
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:22,239
Yes, right before I showed them
the vanquishing potion.

549
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:23,448
Oh, great.

550
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:26,118
Okay, well, there's nothing
you could have done.

551
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:29,288
Maybe if I'd
been around more lately.

552
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:32,791
No, forget about it, Phoebe,
it wasn't your fault.

553
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,918
The question is,
how do we get out of here?

554
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:37,045
We couldn't even call you
with the lost-witch spell.

555
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:39,506
Oh, that was you.
I thought I felt something.

556
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:42,009
- Maybe it'll work on Billie?
- How?

557
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,803
We don't even have enough power
to cast a spell.

558
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,182
No, but maybe we have enough
to get through to the spirit board.

559
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:53,103
Do you think Grams
made a replica of that?

560
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,362
Christy?

561
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:07,784
D- O-L-L

562
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:12,289
H- O-U-S-E.

563
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,626
Dollhouse?

564
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:19,379
You guys,
the weirdest thing just happened.

565
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,673
- Not now.
- Mustard seed.

566
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,009
No, but you don't understand.
The spirit board, it worked.

567
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:25,844
I actually got a message.

568
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,346
What kind of message?

569
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:29,389
Well, it spelled out "dollhouse"

570
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:32,851
and I don't think that was from Christy,
but you guys have a dollhouse, right?

571
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:35,896
- Actually, we got rid of it.
- Keep stirring.

572
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:38,357
But I thought I saw Wyatt
playing with it a few days ago.

573
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:40,526
We'll look for it later.
We have a demon to vanquish.

574
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,569
Don't you think
this means something?

575
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:47,282
I do believe that my sister
just asked you to leave.

576
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,701
- Excuse me?
- Are you dense?

577
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,787
We really don't have time
for your crap right now.

578
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:54,456
This is a joke, right?
You guys have to be joking.

579
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:56,124
Do we look like we're joking?

580
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:00,546
Did anybody ever tell you
what a giant pain in the ass you are?

581
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:01,755
What?

582
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:06,718
I don't know
why we keep you around.

583
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:08,303
- But...
- Get rid of her.

584
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,555
Gladly.

585
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,640
Front porch.

586
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:14,726
That was fun.

587
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:16,979
You think we were too hard on her?

588
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:19,731
- I would hate to have blown our cover.
- Doesn't matter.

589
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:23,235
We don't have to look
like the Charmed Ones anymore.

590
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:25,529
We've got the power of three.

591
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,159
It's time to free our kind.

592
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:48,760
How dare you escape me?

593
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,180
And how dare you return!

594
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,266
Come closer.

595
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:57,060
Come closer.

596
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,773
You would have been wise to have
taken your own lives on the outside

597
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,776
rather than suffer through how
I'm going to take them for you.

598
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:08,489
Where's the other? Savard.

599
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,616
He's waiting for us
to bring him the good news.

600
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,035
Good news? What good news?

601
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:14,620
Of your demise.

602
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,040
- Kill them.
- Now.

603
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:28,133
It worked.

604
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,052
We did it.

605
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:32,638
I don't believe it.

606
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:40,062
Just out of curiosity,
if this doesn't work, what's plan B?

607
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:41,313
This is plan B.

608
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,731
Billie was plan A.

609
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:45,734
Well, remind me to evict her
if we get out of this.

610
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:47,569
You sure this is gonna work?

611
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:50,697
Well, I hope so. It's your plan.

612
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:52,282
You have a point there.

613
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:55,994
Okay,

614
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:57,830
do it now.

615
00:33:58,288 --> 00:33:59,998
Pointy thing.

616
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,460
Oh, it only moved a little.

617
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,337
Well, maybe that's because
I am little.

618
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:07,798
Okay, well, try again. Keep trying.

619
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,174
Pointy thing.

620
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,137
Better. Better.

621
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:15,514
Okay, Piper, you're up.

622
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,933
Hey.

623
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:22,104
Hello? We'd like to have a little chat
down here.

624
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:29,361
Okay, a little to the left.

625
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:31,572
Pointy thing.

626
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,365
- Perfect.
- What do you want?

627
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:34,825
You.

628
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:42,541
Let's get out of here.

629
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:47,296
- Where's Savard?
- Savard?

630
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:50,132
Oh, I think
they have a height advantage.

631
00:34:57,848 --> 00:35:00,642
Our kind is finally free,
but now Savard will never see it.

632
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:03,812
I don't understand.
How could they have killed him?

633
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:06,231
I don't know, but they did.

634
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:10,903
Okay, if Billie doesn't show up
in, like, two seconds, we're doll parts.

635
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,821
Hang on,
there might be another way.

636
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:14,072
Talk fast.

637
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:16,492
Well, our individual powers
are diminished,

638
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:17,701
but not the power of three.

639
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:19,745
- Obviously, they're using it.
- Talk faster.

640
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:22,831
Well, if we can get them
to stop channelling us

641
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,291
and use their demonic powers,

642
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,627
then we can get
the power of three back, you know?

643
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:27,961
Theoretically speaking, right?

644
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,588
All we got are theories.

645
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:32,424
This is for Savard.

646
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:34,134
Hey, hang on a second,
what are you doing?

647
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,136
What, you're gonna kill me
with my own power?

648
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:37,346
What are you, kidding me?

649
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:39,431
How insulting. Let alone boring.

650
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:42,351
Yeah, show some pride,
you know what I mean? Be original.

651
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:45,395
You guys must suffer from really low
self-esteem, near as I can figure.

652
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:47,773
Which is clearly why
they had to steal our powers.

653
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,442
That must be very humiliating.

654
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:04,373
Oh, thank God.

655
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,458
I knew you guys wouldn't really be
that mean to me.

656
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,460
I know I can be
a huge pain in the ass sometimes...

657
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:10,337
Billie, zip it! Go get the "Book. "

658
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:12,005
Oh, the "Book," right.

659
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:14,258
Find the power-switching spell.

660
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:15,467
Switch...

661
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:19,680
Switch bodies with powers
and then, you know, improvise.

662
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:20,889
Okay, who are we switching?

663
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:22,808
Them.

664
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,520
I thought we booted your ass out.

665
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:29,064
You did, but they didn't.

666
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,818
<i>What's theirs is yours
What's yours is theirs</i>

667
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:38,490
<i>I offer up this gift to share
Switch the bodies through the air</i>

668
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:45,747
Well, you wanted to live like us,
now I guess you get to die like us.

669
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:46,957
Oh, crap.

670
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:58,427
Well, they say imitation
is the greatest form of flattery.

671
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:01,180
Well, they do.

672
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:11,023
Hey, Henry.

673
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:13,567
Yeah.

674
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:16,153
- Guess what?
- What?

675
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,281
I like you.

676
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:22,784
Hey, Paige.

677
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:26,455
- Guess what?
- What?

678
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:28,165
I like you too.

679
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:38,217
I tell you, this day is getting a lot better
than how it started.

680
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:40,969
Yeah, so far.

681
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:42,596
Why do you keep
saying things like that?

682
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:45,432
What do you have to tell me?
Come on, it can't be that bad.

683
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,769
Rooftop picnic, starlight, candles.

684
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:50,938
Wait, wait. I want to guess first,
actually. Hold on.

685
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:54,900
Let me see.
You used to be a man before.

686
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:56,568
No, that's not true, right?

687
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:57,820
Good.

688
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,573
Come on, tell me, what is it?

689
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:04,284
I don't think you're gonna like it.

690
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:06,245
You try me.

691
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:11,583
Have you ever wondered
about the kind of strange things

692
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,754
that happen with me and
kind of since you've known me?

693
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:20,717
Like why was I there,
trying to help your parolee?

694
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:25,097
How did I find that baby's father
so quickly?

695
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:28,600
How did you get that guy
to tell the truth?

696
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:31,812
How did you get shot
and miraculously survive?

697
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:34,606
And even little things like today.

698
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,651
Finding your keys and your wallet,

699
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:40,320
and then there's
that winning the $10,000 thing,

700
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:42,614
which you should probably give
to charity, because that...

701
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:44,575
- You know...
- Okay. Okay.

702
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:46,368
What are you trying
to tell me, Paige?

703
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:49,037
Do you believe in magic?

704
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:53,625
I don't know.
I don't think about it much. Why?

705
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:56,211
I think it's time that you did.

706
00:38:57,796 --> 00:38:59,464
Lights.

707
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:06,221
I'm doing that right now.

708
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,806
How?

709
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:10,726
I'm a witch. I have powers.

710
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,854
I can make
these kinds of things happen.

711
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:16,190
I'm not the kind of witch
that rides around on broomsticks

712
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:19,485
or the hat or with the little black cat,
that sort of thing.

713
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:24,406
I use my powers for good.

714
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,533
I help people.

715
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:28,285
And this is not going well

716
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:32,664
and I can see how completely
scared off you are from me.

717
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:36,168
The door's right there
and it won't hurt my feelings.

718
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:40,756
Paige.

719
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:43,258
- What?
- Look at me.

720
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:47,262
I'm not afraid.

721
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:12,955
Hang on. There's just one more.

722
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:14,873
Really?
I thought I grabbed all the boxes.

723
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,043
Well, this one
I kind of put together for you,

724
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,797
just in case you need more herbs
or potion vials or crystals,

725
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:24,466
or, you know, CliffsNotes
of the "Book of Shadows," just in case.

726
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,593
Just in case a demon attacks.

727
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,679
Yeah, don't laugh. It's gonna happen

728
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:30,472
and you know it.
And when it does, you know,

729
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,225
you're gonna be alone.

730
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:37,145
Piper, I'm just moving into town,
you know, it's not that far away.

731
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:38,397
Yeah,

732
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:40,232
but it's not down the hall.

733
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,484
That's true.

734
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:47,614
You know,
if you don't want me to go...

735
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:49,074
No.

736
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:50,325
You've gotta go.

737
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:53,287
You know, there's some blonde chick
asleep in your room.

738
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:57,124
I'm just a little sad.

739
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,625
But I can be a little sad.

740
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,003
Absolutely.

741
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:03,589
I'm sad too.

742
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,845
It's just, you know,

743
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:12,598
it's been a lot of change.

744
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:16,101
You know this will always
be my home, right?

745
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,479
And that will never change.

746
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:21,315
I mean, this is family.

747
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:25,235
Yeah.

748
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:27,529
Okay, you gotta go.

749
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:35,037
See you.
