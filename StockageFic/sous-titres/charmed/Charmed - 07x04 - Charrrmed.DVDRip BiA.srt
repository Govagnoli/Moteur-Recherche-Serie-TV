1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,719
All set. The kids are asleep.

2
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,930
What about Phoebe and Paige?

3
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,890
You want me to put them to bed too?

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,395
Paige is at school,
and Phoebe went to the movies.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,481
Really? On a date?

6
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,901
- No, with a friend.
- That's good.

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,905
She's taking advantage of not
having to be at work in the morning.

8
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,782
That's... That's good.

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,867
You're stalling.

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,078
Don't make it a bigger deal than it is.

11
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,248
You're one Elder calling another
to see if you can help.

12
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,708
But what if they found out?

13
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,253
They haven't.
We already talked about this.

14
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:48,090
You're not gonna be able to move on
if you don't let go of the past.

15
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,968
That's the reason
you're doing this, remember?

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,345
- What?
- You'll think I'm crazy.

17
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,264
I already think you're crazy.

18
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,519
- What is it?
- It's just...

19
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,107
I've been seeing things lately.

20
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:09,236
Hearing voices that
make me feel like I can't come back.

21
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,822
I don't know if they're
real or not, but they...

22
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,949
...seem like they are.

23
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,618
That's probably just
self-doubt, ignore it.

24
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,330
- Or a guilty conscience.
- You have nothing to feel guilty about.

25
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:24,543
What happened was out of your control.
All that matters is what's next.

26
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,421
So go play nice
with the other Elders.

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,603
Please let him get through this.

28
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,817
Hello, Leo.

29
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,778
Hey. Thanks for coming.

30
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,824
- How have you been?
- Good. Great.

31
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,453
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

32
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,623
We can't let you back up there,
if that's what you want.

33
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,417
No. I understand.

34
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,879
So...

35
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,590
...any word on who killed Zola yet?

36
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:15,677
No. But we'll
find who did it. We have to.

37
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,557
So, what can I help you with?

38
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:24,061
Well, actually,
I was hoping to help you.

39
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,104
I mean, you know, as an Elder.

40
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:30,025
- I don't quite follow.
- I want to do what I used to do...

41
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,818
...before Gideon.

42
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,613
I'm just trying to find my way again.

43
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:40,202
A couple of Whitelighters have
lost track of their charges recently.

44
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,329
Two in the last three nights.

45
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,122
- May be nothing...
- Charges.

46
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,043
- Whitelighters-to-be or witches?
- Witches. Just practitioners.

47
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,046
- Not powerful, but...
- I'll get the sisters on it.

48
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,674
Good. Keep me posted.

49
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,136
He lies, Leo. He lies.

50
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,848
You can't trust him.

51
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,892
You can't trust yourself.

52
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,763
Hello?

53
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:19,510
Anybody tell you
not to walk alone at night, witch?

54
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,553
Help!

55
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,764
Help!

56
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,133
This should be so easy.

57
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,635
I don't understand
why I can't find them.

58
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,888
I tried sensing them,
summoning them.

59
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,433
I tried scrying for them.
I gotta be overlooking something.

60
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,145
Or maybe there's nothing to overlook.

61
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:56,607
I mean, let's face it,
the Elder said this could be nothing.

62
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,860
- They're still missing.
- Maybe you're trying too hard.

63
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,988
He wants me to do this.
He wouldn't have given this to me

64
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:07,576
- unless it was something.
- Okay, so, what do we know so far?

65
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,828
What are the common denominators?

66
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,331
Besides the fact that they're witches,

67
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,666
fog rolled in before they disappeared.

68
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,003
Of course the fog rolled in.
It's San Francisco.

69
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,716
- What?
- Nothing, it's just I miss this.

70
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,011
Sleepless nights
and endless exposition? Not me.

71
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,141
Do I look like a ma'am to you?

72
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,851
Morning, sunshine.

73
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:37,439
I was just at Magic School taking Wyatt
to the nursery... He's fine I might add.

74
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,526
...and a student bumped into me
and said, "Excuse me..."

75
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,153
A kid with manners?
Alert the authorities!

76
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,947
You didn't let me finish!

77
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,617
He said, "Excuse me... ma'am."

78
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:52,329
- Do I look like a ma'am?
- He was being respectful.

79
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,123
Something happened
since I took over Magic School.

80
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,252
- You're obsessing.
- You're damn right I'm obsessing!

81
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,005
- I am far too young to be old.
- Okay, obsess about this instead.

82
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,884
Young women disappearing
around the city when the fog rolls in.

83
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,430
- That's what you got?
- That's all the Elders know.

84
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,058
We haven't been able
to find out much else.

85
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:17,312
- You spoke to the Elders?
- Yes. And I promised we'd help.

86
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,606
Good for you. You know,

87
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:25,028
this actually sounds like a job
for the young, kick-ass Charmed Ones.

88
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,073
Where are you going?
Come with me.

89
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,411
- I'm gonna scry for 'em.
- We tried. Didn't work.

90
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,330
Too much time's passed
since the last disappeared.

91
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,959
Why don't we try to find out
if anyone has disappeared recently?

92
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:43,463
- I'm sure the Elders would've told me.
- Not if they don't know about it yet.

93
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,842
What about Morris?
I'm sure he could ask Missing Persons.

94
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,928
Yeah, go ahead, you can go ask him.

95
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,473
He's outside.

96
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,952
They're watching us?

97
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,623
- Staking us out.
- Is that legal?

98
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,958
Apparently Sheridan wants us real bad.

99
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:24,254
Which means you can't run around
the city looking for missing witches.

100
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,840
Unless there's a distraction.

101
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,884
Phoebe still at home?

102
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,140
I don't understand. I sent
the blood sample three weeks ago.

103
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,518
What do you mean,
you can't find it?

104
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,729
- You know they can see us, right?
- I want them to see us.

105
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:44,525
Sheridan, Inspector Sheridan,
SFPD, the Halliwell case.

106
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,944
No, it's not a murder investigation.

107
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,949
I don't know what it is. That's why
I need the damn blood results!

108
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,867
I hate Feds!

109
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,869
Where did you get the sample from?

110
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,206
From Piper's bedroom...
when I was curiously knocked out.

111
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:03,126
- What do you think the blood'll show?
- What's really going on.

112
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:09,216
- You might wanna put on a happy face.
- Good morning, inspector.

113
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,761
You must be hungry. Breakfast,
most important meal of the day.

114
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:17,474
- If you think this will get me...
- Yeah. Okay, wow. That's better.

115
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,893
Are you out of your mind?
Unfreeze her now!

116
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,271
Sorry, can't. We need to talk.

117
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,190
Listen, I've got nothing to say.
I made that clear.

118
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,067
Yeah, so I've heard.

119
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,779
About the missing women that
you're not telling the press about?

120
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,324
- How'd you find out?
- They're witches. We need to find them.

121
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,743
Any reported missing
in the last 24 hours?

122
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,997
Piper, listen.
You know I can't help you.

123
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:44,293
If you want to help Sheridan hang us
out to dry, that's your business.

124
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,546
This is not about that.
This is about people in trouble.

125
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,381
So are you gonna help us or not?

126
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,846
Listen, there was one on
the missing report this morning.

127
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,891
Brenda Castillo, 22.
She lives in the Heights.

128
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,059
Roommate says
she never came home,

129
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,605
- but until she's missing 24...
- We'll find her in 12. Thanks.

130
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,108
You're welcome. Now,
will you hurry up and unfreeze her?

131
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,946
...get me off your tail.

132
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,033
Now, inspector,
why would I wanna do that?

133
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,001
- Nice try.
- Whoa!

134
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,755
It's all right.
I'll clean this up!

135
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:36,553
Okay, Paige, you're on.
Brenda Castillo, the Heights.

136
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,326
Don't bother screaming, love.
No one can hear you.

137
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:03,080
- What? What do you want from me?
- We don't want nothing.

138
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,874
However, our captain
would like a word with you.

139
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,424
- Oh, my...
- God? 'Fraid not.

140
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,928
You'll have to settle for
Captain Black Jack Cutting.

141
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,557
- Aye, aye, captain!
- Don't you just love clichés?

142
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,102
Don't just stand there, you fool.
Bring it closer!

143
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,984
The stench of witch.

144
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,694
I'd know that anywhere.

145
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,738
- What do you want?
- I want you to die...

146
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,782
...but not too fast.

147
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:47,416
One of your kind cursed me
with this a very long time ago.

148
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,711
Of course, then I used it
to cut her heart out.

149
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,007
Take it away!

150
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:59,469
- What about the Charmed Ones?
- All good things to those who wait.

151
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,389
Do as I say,
or I'll have you in irons!

152
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,068
Knock, knock.

153
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,614
Phoebe! Hey,
what are you doing here?

154
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,658
I'm just returning your phone call.

155
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,077
Wow, returning my call.

156
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,999
Most people return phone calls
with... I don't know, phone calls.

157
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,169
Yeah, well, I kinda
needed to get out of the house.

158
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,713
We're experiencing
a bit of a pest problem.

159
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,591
- Is it serious?
- Too soon to tell.

160
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,929
- What did you call about?
- Well, it was a little timely.

161
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,680
I had to make a decision, but...

162
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,933
You did give me free reign, didn't you?

163
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,101
Yes, absolutely.

164
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,230
How else would I be
enjoying my sabbatical, right?

165
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,565
Exactly.

166
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,697
So that's it? Nothing else
you needed to talk to me about?

167
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:04,201
- Nope, I can't think of anything.
- Ask me? Nothing?

168
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,078
Nah.

169
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:07,830
Okay.

170
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,875
Wait, there was one thing, actually.

171
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,295
I was... I was looking through
your notes and ideas last week,

172
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,800
- and I found something about a contest.
- The Win a Date With Phoebe contest.

173
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,053
- That was Elise's idea.
- I think it's a great idea.

174
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,556
Readers love to be
talked to and not down to.

175
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,810
A date gives you a chance to make them
feel like you're part of their lives.

176
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,187
- Really?
- You know, it's a great PR move.

177
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,397
I mean, I really...

178
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,984
I'd love to leave you with
more readers than you had when I came.

179
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,528
That's really sweet, Leslie.

180
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:43,949
But I think I'm taking a break
from the dating world, as well.

181
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:47,536
Besides, you never know
who's gonna win a contest like that.

182
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:48,954
Well, I would win it.

183
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,332
I mean, just to protect you, of course.

184
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,670
- Are you asking me out on a date?
- Strictly professional.

185
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,464
How about we go tonight,
we get it over with.

186
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:00,924
"Get it over with"?

187
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,594
So we don't infringe
on your life away from here

188
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,014
- any more than we already have.
- Okay, call me stupid,

189
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:11,560
but shouldn't you run the contest in
the paper before you decide who wins?

190
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:15,272
Details. I'll... I'll hold the copy
on the date and print it after.

191
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,150
So, what do you say.
Maxine's, 8.00?

192
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,863
All right, 8.00.

193
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,047
Can I help you?

194
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:43,759
Hi, I'm Paige Matthews.
I'm here about Brenda Castillo.

195
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,427
Are you from the police?

196
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:49,181
No, I'm just somebody
who's concerned about her.

197
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:51,016
- I'm sorry.
- No, please...

198
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,894
Is Brenda a witch, by any chance?

199
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,522
Because if she is,
I think I can help find her.

200
00:14:58,899 --> 00:14:59,942
Come in.

201
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,986
Thanks.

202
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,406
Are you one too?

203
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,661
- A witch, I mean.
- Yeah. You?

204
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:14,206
Oh, no.
No, that's Brenda's thing.

205
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,416
You don't believe in witchcraft?

206
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,335
I will if it'll help find her.

207
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,671
She wouldn't just not come home.

208
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,005
She never has.

209
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,383
But the police,
they won't do a thing.

210
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,719
Yeah, it's the whole
24 hour deal, right?

211
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,349
You guys seem close.
Are you sisters, roommates?

212
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,186
No... partners.

213
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:39,606
That's another reason
the police won't do anything.

214
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:45,320
They think it's a lover's quarrel,
or something. Like it's a big joke.

215
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:49,157
I know it's not a joke.
Look, if I'm gonna find her,

216
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:52,077
I'm gonna need something,
anything to go off of.

217
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,288
Maybe this'll help.

218
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,292
I found it on the floor
when I got home.

219
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,877
I'd never seen it before.

220
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,424
What do you think it means?

221
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,811
Brenda!

222
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,856
Brenda.

223
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,986
Brenda.

224
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,578
Go away. Hurry.

225
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,216
Took you long enough, dearie.

226
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,468
We've been waiting for you.

227
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:59,228
You wouldn't orb out and leave
an innocent stranded, would you, witch?

228
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,397
You look like you've been
out to sea for quite some time.

229
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,107
Nearly 300 years,

230
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,735
in a place beyond time and space.

231
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:10,239
Only when the mystical fog rolls in,
do we get a chance

232
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,534
to come and play
in fair port cities like your own.

233
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,663
- See, I would have chosen London.
- I did. They didn't have what I want.

234
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,250
- And what's that?
- You and your sisters.

235
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,254
Only you can get me
the treasure I so desire.

236
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,966
- I guess I forgot where I buried it.
- You're quick with the tongue.

237
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,511
Let me ask you, when the
gathering storm arrives here,

238
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:34,388
will you be making jokes then?

239
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,306
"Gathering storm"?

240
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,101
I'm so sorry.
I don't speak pirate, matey.

241
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:43,689
This is not pirate lore. This is
something very real, very dangerous.

242
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:47,150
And I don't intend to be
stuck here when it arrives.

243
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,612
Sword!

244
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:00,455
Excuse me. Would you mind?

245
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,961
Okay, you're supposed to be...

246
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:09,173
Dead. He wishes.

247
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,801
That's gonna leave a mark.

248
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:15,762
You let her escape!

249
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:16,972
I let her go.

250
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,141
- She's no good alone.
- Her sisters...

251
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:21,894
Will come when they
realise they've no choice.

252
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,939
Are you questioning me, first mate?
Remember your oath?

253
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,067
You do as I say when I say it.
Understand?

254
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:33,405
You all will, or this hell
we're in will never end.

255
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:37,075
What about the golden chalice?

256
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:42,247
We've had trouble procuring it, sir.

257
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:46,293
There may be another way.
For now, make yourselves scarce.

258
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,797
We want the witches
to rescue her, remember!

259
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,966
- Aye.
- Aye.

260
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,018
All right, you need
to slow down and relax.

261
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:06,605
Okay, I can't because
we need to find Brenda.

262
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,983
Look, whatever their angle is,
whatever the reason is,

263
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,238
we can't go in there blind like you did,
which, I may add, was dangerous.

264
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:17,199
All I did was scry for her
with the coin. Is that so bad?

265
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:19,409
Look where it got you.
If you go back in,

266
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,787
- you could be walking the plank.
- Cute.

267
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,249
Strangely, there's
nothing in here about pirates.

268
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:29,503
- Do you know anything?
- Pirates? A little before my time.

269
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,797
Are you sure there's nothing in here?

270
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,882
You need glasses there, ma'am?

271
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,260
No! I'm just a little woozy.

272
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,846
We need to know
what we're up against.

273
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:42,850
We need to go to Magic School since
they're obviously not of this time.

274
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:46,144
- Who's not?
- Just, you know, pirates.

275
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,647
Pirates? Like hot,
Johnny Depp pirates?

276
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,525
- Yeah, probably not.
- Tell her, Paige.

277
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,736
Tell her what? Why we
left an innocent stranded?

278
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,947
No, why we almost lost a sister.

279
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,783
If they'd wanted to kill me,
they would have.

280
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,494
They're obviously after something else.

281
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,080
Yeah, like wanting to kill all of us.

282
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:09,168
- Okay, what's going on, you two?
- We'll catch you up on the way.

283
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,171
Right now, we need to go
brush up on our pirate lore.

284
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,631
- Can you watch the kids?
- Yeah, but...

285
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,675
You did your part. Let us do ours.

286
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:21,138
Okay, what if we don't find anything?
Pirates aren't known to be magical.

287
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:25,559
- Do you have a better idea?
- Actually, yes. I might.

288
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:29,521
- You wanna know about pirate movies?
- Tell me everything.

289
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:33,692
- I thought you were on sabbatical.
- It's not for my column. It's personal.

290
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:38,363
Well, I guess Mutiny on the Bounty
is the very best pirate movie.

291
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,825
- The Clark Gable version.
- Wait, that's not a pirate movie.

292
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:45,162
That's a swashbuckler.
There's a big difference.

293
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:49,124
- Sorry, couldn't help but overhear.
- Have your doctorate in pirates?

294
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,753
I grew up watching pirate movies
with my dad. Hey, I got this.

295
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,963
Captain Blood and Cutthroat Island.

296
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,633
Blackbeard's Ghost.
I mean, I've seen 'em all.

297
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,927
Even Yellowbeard.
It's a great spoof.

298
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,764
- You're full of surprises, aren't you?
- Yeah, wait until tonight.

299
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,807
We're still on, aren't we?

300
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,352
You wouldn't wanna
break the pirate's oath.

301
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,896
- The pirate's oath, what's that?
- Oh, yeah.

302
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:14,983
The captain gives his word to crew,
he's gotta hold to it or face mutiny.

303
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:19,112
And would I be the captain
or the crew in that analogy?

304
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,322
It is your column.

305
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:23,617
Yeah, I wouldn't want
to disappoint my readers.

306
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,870
So, what else do you
wanna know about pirates?

307
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,206
Tell me this isn't happening.

308
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,917
I can't believe he's gonna
pull us off this case.

309
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:35,963
- Truth is, we don't have much to go on.
- We've got plenty to go on.

310
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,173
We'd have a lot more
if you came clean.

311
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,551
You think I know more than what I do.

312
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,553
Look, don't insult me, okay?

313
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,097
We both know
that you're covering for them.

314
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:47,224
So don't pretend like you're not.

315
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:53,897
All I know is, the Halliwells
are really good people.

316
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,315
They do good things.

317
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,610
Like send us on a wild-goose chase
so that they can do

318
00:21:58,777 --> 00:21:59,945
God only knows what.

319
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,323
Six years of unsolved crimes,
of all types,

320
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,617
all mysteriously connected to them.

321
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,580
I don't care what you say, Morris.
That's not good people.

322
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:16,128
- Who're you calling?
- Captain wants proof.

323
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:17,546
I'm calling the Feds.

324
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:21,008
See what happened with that
blood sample, once and for all.

325
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,889
You want the Feds?

326
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,725
You got 'em.

327
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:41,820
I think I found something.

328
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:47,284
I said, I think I found something.
What, are you deaf now too?

329
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:51,371
Well, you're gonna go deaf first.
Don't forget, you're the older sister.

330
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,999
Yeah, I love you too. Okay, so...

331
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,460
Black Jack Cutting sound familiar?

332
00:22:56,627 --> 00:23:00,047
No, we weren't formally introduced.

333
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:03,342
He tricked a witch into
falling for him in the 18th century

334
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:05,260
so she'd give him immortality.

335
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:08,096
- Quite a spell.
- Yeah, it didn't help her much.

336
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:12,601
He cut her heart out with
the same athame she used to curse him.

337
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:15,103
- Who?
- What do you mean? The captain,

338
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,398
- the guy we're talking about.
- Right. Right, right.

339
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,192
Wait, what was the question?

340
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,778
Are you all right?
You don't look so good.

341
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,738
I look fine. And yeah,

342
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:28,367
I'm just concerned with Brenda,
I guess. I don't know.

343
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:32,746
Okay, let's see. He did say something
about a storm, a gathering storm.

344
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:35,791
There's nothing about a storm,
just the curse.

345
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,128
I guess I'd better make
these potions a little stronger.

346
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,173
Yo-ho, hello!

347
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,134
Did you just call me a ho?
How'd you get here?

348
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,887
A pirate never betrays
his vow of secrecy.

349
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,265
Leo orbed me.

350
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:55,269
Ask me anything you wanna know
about buccaneers. I know everything.

351
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:58,355
You see a movie critic,
and suddenly you're an expert.

352
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:02,025
No, I ran into Leslie, and he
taught me everything he knows.

353
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,152
I bet.

354
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,363
Looking forward to your date tonight?

355
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,782
No, I'm not.
It's just a publicity stunt.

356
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,742
Right.

357
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,286
Oops!

358
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,538
Paige, what...?

359
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:17,583
What happened, honey?
What's wrong with your hand?

360
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,004
I don't know.

361
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:25,007
I think that athame
did more damage than we thought.

362
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:28,468
I'm gonna just go
sit on the couch. Okay?

363
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:31,013
Maybe you guys
concentrate on Brenda and...

364
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,308
...making more potions.

365
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:48,655
Are you sure we're talking
about the same man?

366
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,574
All right, thank you.

367
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,786
Okay, Agent Brody,

368
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,539
you check out, for now.

369
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:00,876
Great.
Now, can we get to work?

370
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,171
What agency
did they say he was from?

371
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:06,548
Homeland Security.

372
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:09,426
- What division?
- The classified one.

373
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:14,515
You're pretty protective
of the sisters, aren't you?

374
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:17,726
- I've known them a long time.
- Six and a half years.

375
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:19,895
I do my homework.

376
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:22,481
What are you doing here?
What do you want?

377
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:24,900
I wanna know
where you got that blood from.

378
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,487
- Why?
- 'Cause whatever it is, it's not human.

379
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:32,616
DNA showed a triple helix.
We've only got two.

380
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:35,702
Plus plasma, platelets,
Rh factors, all incredible.

381
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,164
Somebody messed up. You were
not supposed to find that blood.

382
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:40,833
I don't understand.

383
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,710
You wanna explain it to her?

384
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,421
Explain what?

385
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,966
What kind of being
that sample came from.

386
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,635
Being? How would I know?

387
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:57,099
Don't worry, lieutenant,
I'm not after you.

388
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:58,725
I'm after the Halliwells.

389
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,814
The recent rash of missing women
that you've been ignoring

390
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,441
matches a pattern
that goes back for decades.

391
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:10,529
Barbados, Panama, Newfoundland,
New Orleans and now here.

392
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:14,199
Except they aren't missing women.

393
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:18,162
- They're missing witches.
- Witches?

394
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:23,083
Like the three sisters. If I'm right,
then one will lead us to the other.

395
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,378
So you're saying that
the Halliwells are not human?

396
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,422
No, they're human all right.

397
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:31,508
But the sample,
it just came from something... else.

398
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:36,305
So if I were you,
I'd watch my step.

399
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:40,225
People tend to disappear
around these girls, especially cops.

400
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:45,189
Now, I have been looking
for a long time to prove my theories.

401
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,442
Now all I gotta do
is catch 'em in the act.

402
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,237
- But how?
- Got any golden chalices lying around?

403
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:10,339
Maybe Paige scared them away.

404
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,382
It's possible.

405
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:15,719
Pirates don't run from fights.
They lure you into them.

406
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,394
Piper, come here!
Grab that lantern.

407
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,155
You must leave.

408
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:37,282
Who did this to you?

409
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:38,992
Pirates.

410
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:42,412
He cut me with the athame.

411
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,416
Wait a minute. Who are you?
What's your name?

412
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,210
Brenda.

413
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:51,630
Save your sister.

414
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:00,180
We gotta go get Paige.

415
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:06,144
Paige! Are you okay?

416
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:10,774
Paige?

417
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:13,402
Well...

418
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:15,821
Now I'm a ma'am.

419
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,207
Easy, easy, easy. We gotcha.

420
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,835
It took a little more
out of me than I thought.

421
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:32,171
- Yeah.
- Here... Couch, couch.

422
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:34,006
Leo, get up here!

423
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:36,258
Are you two back together?

424
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:38,343
Oh, I forget.

425
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,012
Leo!

426
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:42,723
What's the matter?
What happened?

427
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,350
Just heal this... now.

428
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,852
Heal... heal what?

429
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:49,271
It's Paige! It's just Paige.
She's just...

430
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:52,191
- Don't ask. Just fix her.
- Fix? What happened?

431
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:56,403
Well, she got cut by
a cursed athame, and she's aging.

432
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,405
Aging? Well, I can't fix aging.

433
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:01,033
I can't find a reversal
for the curse in here.

434
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,242
Naturally.

435
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:06,163
Captain Cutting must be banking
on us finding a reversal to the curse

436
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,998
so that we could save them both.

437
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:09,833
I should check with the Elders.

438
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,337
No, we don't have time.
She's gaining years by the hour.

439
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:16,423
Forget about me.
You have to save Brenda first.

440
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,928
- Sweetie, we lost her already.
- Yeah, but we're not gonna lose you.

441
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:23,597
Shiver me britches.

442
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,058
Shiver me britches.

443
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:28,560
You've got to be kidding me.

444
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:30,229
No, don't blow him up!

445
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:32,523
Fine!

446
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,069
Obviously, he was sent here
for a reason.

447
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:43,575
What's it say?

448
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:48,205
"Captain Black Jack Cutting cordially
invites you to Treasure Island."

449
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:57,047
- We were invited.
- Invited? Or were you... tricked?

450
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:00,926
You wouldn't wanna be
violating parley, would you?

451
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:04,847
Phoebe, now is not the time
for stupid pirate facts.

452
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:06,807
How would you know about parley?

453
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:10,477
Actually, I know everything
about parley. Everyone does.

454
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:14,189
It's the sacredness of the
captain's word, right, Piper?

455
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:18,777
- Remember, Pirates of the Caribbean?
- Okay, so?

456
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:22,531
So... it's what keeps
the crew from mutiny.

457
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:26,910
Yeah. It's the oath
of the pirates, right?

458
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:32,833
As long as the captain keeps his word,
you're bound to him forever.

459
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,586
Yeah, and what's it to you?

460
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:39,506
Well, quite honestly,
it just doesn't seem fair.

461
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:42,968
I mean, he's the one
that's cursed, not you, right?

462
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:47,222
I mean, how are you ever
supposed to move on?

463
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:53,687
What are you jabbering about
over there? Bring 'em closer!

464
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:55,731
Whoa! Easy!

465
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,484
Come to save your sister, have you?

466
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:02,321
How noble of you.

467
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:05,574
You're wasting your time.
We can't reverse the curse.

468
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:06,783
You don't have to.

469
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:10,204
Just need to call forth
the Fountain of Youth.

470
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,791
That's a myth.

471
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:19,379
So are 300-year-old pirates who sail
the high seas searching for revenge!

472
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:23,467
Take it from me,
the Fountain of Youth is very real.

473
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:26,553
Only Ponce de León had it wrong.
I've got it right.

474
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,100
And finding it is the only way
to save your precious sister's life.

475
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,565
He wants you to do what?

476
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:41,610
- Break into a museum.
- To find the Fountain of Youth.

477
00:31:41,777 --> 00:31:45,572
No, to steal a golden chalice
that turns on the Fountain.

478
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:47,991
- You can't do this.
- I don't have a choice.

479
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:50,410
Without the chalice,
I can't cast a spell.

480
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,704
Without the spell,
I can't save Paige.

481
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:55,791
What if you get caught?
This is what Sheridan wants.

482
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,876
Forget her.
This is about family.

483
00:31:58,043 --> 00:32:00,337
A family you have to
be able to take care of

484
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:02,506
- if anything happens to us.
- Piper...

485
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:06,260
I mean it. You need to promise me
you'll be able to take care of them.

486
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:09,847
- I can't believe you're saying this.
- Well, believe it.

487
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:12,808
Ignore the voices, and you'll be fine.

488
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:14,309
You have to be.

489
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:26,947
- So far, so good.
- Oh, yeah?

490
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:30,784
Wow.

491
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:33,370
If we pull this off,
Paige owes me Prada.

492
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:36,540
And babysitting for a year.

493
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:47,718
You're getting a call now?

494
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:50,554
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Piper, it's Leslie.

495
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:53,849
- I forgot our date.
- Don't you mean your publicity stunt?

496
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,058
What do you want?

497
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,477
- I want you to admit that you like him.
- No.

498
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:00,272
- You gonna answer it?
- No, we're busy right now.

499
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:03,025
What am I gonna tell him,
we're robbing a museum?

500
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:19,791
Okay, deep breath.
Clear your mind.

501
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,586
Think positive, think positive.
Ready? Ready?

502
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:24,922
Okay, after you.

503
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:39,186
Easy.

504
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:48,028
Careful!

505
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,510
Okay.

506
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:13,679
Now what?

507
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,477
Nicely done.

508
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,497
This is bad. This is bad!

509
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,335
- How'd you know they'd be here?
- What're you doing?

510
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:48,213
- I'm gonna bust 'em.
- Not with that you're not.

511
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,925
I don't wanna catch 'em stealing.
I wanna catch 'em using magic.

512
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:11,862
- Welcome back, ladies.
- Stow it!

513
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:14,364
- Here's your chalice.
- What's your hurry?

514
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:29,546
Now, the spell, if you will.

515
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:34,760
With these offerings, I call on thee
the goddess of fertility

516
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:36,929
Rise now, show us the truth

517
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:39,515
Give us the gift of eternal youth

518
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:43,310
Look!

519
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:02,371
He's young again!

520
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:05,499
Mother of God.

521
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:10,712
Now my sister.

522
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:14,049
What about her?

523
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,219
- Run them through!
- Aye.

524
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:19,680
Whoa! He just broke his oath.

525
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:23,892
- He promised not to hurt us, remember?
- Kill them! What're you waiting for!

526
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:28,981
He doesn't care about his oath or
parley. All he cares about is himself.

527
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:30,691
He promised you treasures?

528
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:33,402
He promised you freedom,
but where is it?

529
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:34,903
He lied.

530
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,573
He broke his oath.
Now you can too.

531
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:39,241
Yeah, he did break his oath.

532
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:43,078
I'll have you drawn and quartered, sir.

533
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:47,708
Raised from the highest yardarm
until the sun rots your skin!

534
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,335
Then I'll feed you to the sharks!

535
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,215
Looks like mutiny to me.

536
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:58,760
You'll die too, you know.
You're only alive because of me.

537
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:02,806
It's a fate worse than death,
I can assure you!

538
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,946
Thank you.

539
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:29,708
Nice speech.

540
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:33,003
There's still some left.
We gotta get it to Paige.

541
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:36,673
Wait! We don't want this
happening anytime again.

542
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,053
Hold it right there!

543
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:44,223
I don't know how you did that,
but just don't move.

544
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:47,309
- Darryl, do something.
- I can't.

545
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:49,853
Face down, on the ground. Now!

546
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,735
Dart gun.

547
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:05,077
I told you, Morris,
I wasn't after you.

548
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:10,165
She'll be all right. Gonna
wake up with a hell of a headache.

549
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:12,626
- Who are you?
- Someone you owe now.

550
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:15,712
Go on, get out of here.

551
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:18,590
We'll take care of her.
Got a sister to save, right?

552
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:29,101
Think you can
give me a hand with her?

553
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:33,188
Seriously, I think
I'm gonna need some help.

554
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:52,416
Hey.

555
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:55,627
Hey. How you feeling?

556
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:58,589
I feel young.
I feel grateful.

557
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:00,549
You're not gonna hear me complain

558
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:03,093
about getting old again
till I'm at least 75.

559
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,013
The good news is,
you'll be there before I am.

560
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,222
You're right.

561
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:10,726
Hey, what did that Agent Brody want?

562
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:13,896
I don't know.
But that's tomorrow's problem.

563
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,364
- He did a good job.
- Yeah, he did.

564
00:39:26,283 --> 00:39:27,826
Think it'll stay that way?

565
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:29,828
I hope so.

566
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:32,789
All right. Good night, sweetie.

567
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:35,417
Good night... ma'am.

568
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:43,675
It's not over yet, you know.

569
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:47,763
His wounds won't easily heal.

570
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,723
They may never.

571
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,141
I know.

572
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:52,809
Just don't give up on him.

573
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:55,395
We're all going to need him back...

574
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:57,981
...before the gathering storm.

575
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:18,752
Knock, knock.

576
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,222
You're really mad, aren't you?

577
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:32,307
No, no.
I get stood up all the time.

578
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:35,143
I'm sure that's not true. Listen...

579
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:39,064
...I would have called you, but I...
- But what? Why didn't you?

580
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:42,359
- Know what? It's complicated.
- You use that excuse a lot.

581
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:45,863
Is it something you're not telling me,
or you think I'm stupid?

582
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:49,158
- No, I don't think you're stupid.
- What are you afraid of?

583
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:51,326
Who says I'm afraid of anything?

584
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:53,954
- You're afraid of commitment.
- Commitment?

585
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:57,583
What're you talking about?
I thought this was a publicity stunt.

586
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:59,209
The hell you did.

587
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,461
Why can't you
just admit you like me?

588
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:04,673
- What is the big deal?
- You're one to talk, mister.

589
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,010
You're the one that had
to orchestrate this whole contest.

590
00:41:08,177 --> 00:41:10,971
- You're too afraid to ask me out.
- That's not true.

591
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:12,306
- No?
- It's not true.

592
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:13,849
Oh, really? Okay.

593
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:16,518
Then how come
you didn't tell me about it

594
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:18,645
until after you already printed it?

595
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:21,690
Until after you "won" the contest?

596
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:24,151
Yeah, that's right,
I knew the whole time.

597
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:26,778
- You didn't say anything.
- No, you didn't.

598
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,490
- You never called me back!
- That's lame!

599
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:32,242
If you knew, why agree
to go through with it?

600
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:34,828
- Well, because I...
- Because of what? Come on!

601
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:37,247
Honestly,
you wanna know the truth?

602
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:39,625
I didn't want to embarrass you.

603
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,002
- Wrong answer.
- You don't know me!

604
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:44,296
- You won't let me know you.
- Not true!

605
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:46,381
You're afraid of getting involved.

606
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:50,344
- You're afraid of getting hurt.
- Save the advice for your readers.

607
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:51,887
You read me.
