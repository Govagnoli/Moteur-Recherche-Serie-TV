1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,550
Hey, where is everyone?

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,148
Surprise.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,874
You look beautiful.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,512
Thank you. I sent everyone away
so we could celebrate.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,751
What are we celebrating?

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,952
Cole, you're finally fully human.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,033
No more demon half means no more
obstacles for our relationship.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,758
Yay, us.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,588
That was a toast,

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,797
and usually after the
clinking part, you take a little sip.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,437
I don't know if sending your sisters
away was a good idea.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,717
I don't have powers anymore.
I can't protect you if there's an attack.

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,910
Well, my sisters are in calling range.

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,914
And more importantly,
I am in kissing range.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,472
Phoebe, you don't seem to understand
that with The Source injured,

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,790
you might be in more danger
than ever before.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,313
Well, you don't seem to understand

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,357
that sometimes
a girl needs a night off.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,439
Now please, is there anything
that I can do...

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,992
...to help you relax?

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,832
That helps a little.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,560
Maybe you should
just keep doing that.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,995
It's just that without a strong leader,
there's anarchy in the underworld.

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,718
Oh, wow, you're a sweet-talker.

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,233
Demons who would
normally compete,

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,595
- for The Source's favour--
- Will start banding together

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,352
to try to take out The Source.

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,319
- Honey, you told me this part already.
- Well, I'm not sure you get it.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,356
Demons hoping to replace The Source
will gather factions of followers.

30
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,432
And what better way
to gain support for your faction

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,352
than to kill the infamous
Charmed Ones?

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,388
Oh, I'll get that.

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,268
Damn it!

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,596
Is it bad? I could call for Leo.

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,557
No, it's fine.

36
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,679
I used to be able to hold fire
in the palm of my hands.

37
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,194
We vanquished half of you.

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,793
It's a huge adjustment.

39
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,633
But I promise you'll figure it out.

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,757
We'll figure it out together.

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,758
I'm serious about the factions,
Phoebe.

42
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,958
If demons join forces...

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,028
I promise you,

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,272
I will worry about the factions
first thing in the morning.

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,475
But for now...

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,597
I want us to join forces.

47
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,191
We must join forces with those
we've considered our enemies

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,430
if we are to defeat...

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,839
We must join forces...

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,798
Damn.

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,115
Joining forces
with our friends is simple.

52
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,712
Only by working with those
we have considered our enemies

53
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,348
will we achieve our greater goals.

54
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,354
In the coming days, we must rise
above our differences

55
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,034
if we're to reach the level
of our convictions.

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,349
I think I can use that.

57
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,110
How did you get in here?
What do you want?

58
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,429
Well, as you know, congressman,

59
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,433
gathering a following
requires inspiration.

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,511
I want your muse.

61
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,273
You can see me?

62
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,073
My what?

63
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,437
The Ring of lnspiration.
But how did you get it?

64
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,115
I think a more important question is,
how will you get out of it?

65
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,431
Who the hell are you talking to?

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,311
- Please.
- Come now.

67
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,277
I'm doing you a favour, really.

68
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,917
There's nothing worse
than an uninspired politician.

69
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,478
Okay, Bev,

70
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,074
if that's what you really want.

71
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,358
Bev, take yes for an answer.

72
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,112
I'll get back to you.

73
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,998
That was the last of the coffee.

74
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,674
I've had coffee, this is not coffee.

75
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,353
Have you seen Cole?

76
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,513
He went out.
He said he had some errands to run.

77
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,749
What kind of errands?

78
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,513
He didn't say.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,592
How was the big date?

80
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,352
Great.

81
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,033
Fine.

82
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,918
It was okay. He kept talking

83
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,071
about demonic factions
the whole time.

84
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,231
Well, that's probably
because it's easier for him

85
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,595
to talk about demons
than what's really on his mind.

86
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,795
Which is?

87
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,632
Whether or not you're going
to reconsider

88
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,268
his marriage proposal now
that he's just a human.

89
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,591
We talked about that
and he's totally fine with it, he gets it.

90
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,874
- Why, did he say something to you?
- No.

91
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,959
But he doesn't have to,
it's written all over his face.

92
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,511
And truth be told,

93
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,549
it's rare for a relationship
to survive a rejected proposal.

94
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,156
But it wasn't rejected.
It was just postponed.

95
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,508
Piper, I'm not ready. You know that.

96
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,394
I do. But it's not my heart
that's involved.

97
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,993
Or my ego for that matter.

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,791
You should talk to him, again.

99
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,634
Where are you going?

100
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,799
P3.

101
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,710
At 9 in the morning?
Don't club kids sleep in?

102
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,713
Corporate party, big money,
total nightmare.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,319
What if there's an attack?

104
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,596
At 9 a.m.?
Don't demons sleep in?

105
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,035
Piper, Cole thinks that the demons
are gonna start

106
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,077
banding together
to take out The Source.

107
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,312
Great. Well, I say the only
good Source is a dead Source.

108
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,029
Right, but he also seems to think
that the best way for a faction leader

109
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,192
to gain the support of the demonic
masses would be to kill us.

110
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,112
- Who's going to kill us?
- No one.

111
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,395
That's new.

112
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,718
So I was thinking,
since you're the potions master,

113
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,472
isn't there something
you could whip up,

114
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,871
some kind of protection
potion maybe?

115
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,793
Pheebs, if there was such a thing
as a protection potion,

116
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,678
we'd be mixing it
in our morning coffee.

117
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,070
I know, but there's gotta be
something that we can do.

118
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,753
And by "we," I mean you.

119
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,673
Well, I say we just wait
until we're attacked,

120
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,274
Iike we usually do.
And then deal with it then.

121
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,078
- Who's attacking us?
- No one.

122
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,470
Right on. I get the weekend off.

123
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,912
See, now that is the spirit.

124
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,308
Piper, if Cole is right,

125
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,869
we have no idea how many
of them we're gonna be up against.

126
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,395
Suddenly I'm beginning
to miss The Source.

127
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,437
And even if you don't think
we need the protection,

128
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,589
just think about Cole.

129
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,320
He is a human being
with no magical powers

130
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,358
Iiving in a house that's constantly
under demonic attack.

131
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,399
Well, I guess
I can make something...

132
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,152
Yay, yay, yay. I love you.

133
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,992
After I go to the club.

134
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,754
We cannot afford to lose
the income and I've got this client

135
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,990
who's insisting
on a last-minute theme,

136
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,798
and, man, do I hate themes.

137
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,552
Oh, I am so good at themes.

138
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,798
My prom theme, "Almost Paradise,"
totally my idea.

139
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,155
And this is supposed
to impress me how?

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,673
- Are you moving out?
- No, just cleaning out.

141
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,514
Your art supplies?

142
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,193
Well, between witch work
and "work" work,

143
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,430
I just don't have any time anymore.

144
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,428
This is perfect. We need a theme.
You're an artistic, creative type.

145
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,155
- A theme?
- Yeah, I'll explain on the way.

146
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,072
Us theme. You potion.

147
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,630
Me peeved. You annoying.

148
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,552
You see how well this worked out?

149
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,833
Back off. We're on the same side.

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,389
Whoa. We almost killed a demon.

151
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,235
- The Source would have our heads.
- Man, I love that glamouring power.

152
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,119
- You know, I fall for it every time.
- If you warlock scum don't mind,

153
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,315
I've got work to do.

154
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,393
Oh, but so do we.

155
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,549
And we're gonna need
to borrow that little trick of yours.

156
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,436
Nicely done.

157
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,160
Now, use your new power
to kill the Charmed Ones

158
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,072
- and bring me back theirs.
- Hey.

159
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,196
I thought we were taking out
the witches together.

160
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,476
I have a faction to build.
And time is of the essence.

161
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,234
There's recruiting to do,
powers to gather...

162
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,994
So I'm supposed to risk my life
so you can become The Source?

163
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,720
Aren't you tired of living
under demonic rule?

164
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,519
Of being a second-class citizen,
my friend?

165
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,469
In the coming days,
we must rise above our differences

166
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,473
if we are to reach the level
of our convictions.

167
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,518
Well, what do I get out of it?

168
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,756
A little inspiration.

169
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,397
Now get to work.

170
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,075
Bev, I'm telling you,
"'40s Night" is perfect.

171
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,789
Think about it. The zoot suits,
the saddle shoes, the patriotism,

172
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,359
what more could you ask for?

173
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,272
Oh, I just don't know.

174
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,113
I mean, weren't the '50s
a little bit more flashy?

175
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,629
Yeah, if you want something
that's been done a million times.

176
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,233
Excuse me?

177
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,278
Honestly, Bev...

178
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,715
... I think the '40s is your era.

179
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,156
I mean, you already have this kind
of Veronica Lake thing going on.

180
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,873
- I do?
- Oh, yeah.

181
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,031
Peekaboo hairdo,
some nice pearl earrings...

182
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,432
You're a dead ringer.

183
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,911
Well, then...

184
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,516
Looks like someone
has some shopping to do.

185
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,592
Yep, here is the number
for the costume place,

186
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,753
and tell all your friends
to dress there or be square.

187
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,353
Thanks, girls.

188
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,515
If it isn't Mr. Sneak-Out-Of-Bed.

189
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,358
Yeah, I had some stuff to do.

190
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,397
Yeah, what kind of stuff?

191
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,278
- Well...
- What--?

192
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,114
What's that?

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,389
- What are you doing with that?
- Get that thing out of here.

194
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,471
Oh, come on, you guys
see worse than this every day.

195
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,632
No, we see demons every day.
There is a huge difference.

196
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,552
- There is? How?
- Well, for one thing,

197
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,836
we're not likely to accidentally
vanquish ourselves.

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,399
Where did you get it?

199
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,835
Well, I may not be
a demon anymore,

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,036
but I still know
where to find the bad guys.

201
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,435
Well, why don't you go
find the bad guys

202
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,715
and give it back to them?

203
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,155
Look, I have to have a way
to protect myself and the one I love.

204
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,511
Okay. Cole, I am not living
in a house with a gun.

205
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,631
It makes things
more dangerous, not less.

206
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,548
- Hey.
- Hi. Piper's at home.

207
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,199
I talked to her.
I came here to find you.

208
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,749
- Was there an attack?
- In a way...

209
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,195
Muses have been disappearing
and the Elders are very concerned.

210
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,476
Muses?
The ones who inspire creativity?

211
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,119
- They're real?
- Yes.

212
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,157
And they are in a very real danger.

213
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,675
It would be a powerful evil
to find a way to hurt a muse.

214
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,154
Factions.

215
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,955
- We better get back.
- What about '40s Night?

216
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,951
I'll call the decorator from the car.

217
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,795
All right, I'll meet you guys at home.
I'm gonna see what else I can find out.

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,752
Oh, Leo, before you go...

219
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,829
Wait.

220
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,435
- Come on.
- Can you orb this to Darryl, please?

221
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,999
I won't even ask.

222
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,751
Hey, how's the protection potion?

223
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,235
Nonexistent.

224
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,118
Hey, we kept up our end of the deal.

225
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,635
I know, Bev called and she's thrilled
and I thank you,

226
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,109
but I thought we should move
on to the muses.

227
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,269
Muses?

228
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,351
Which are, "Beings of pure light

229
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,035
whose sole purpose is to inspire
people's passion and creativity.

230
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,988
Like angels that guide us
with an unseen hand of inspiration."

231
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,993
Wait, how can evil hurt
someone who's invisible?

232
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,195
I have no idea.

233
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,516
A good place to start
would be to ask a muse

234
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,272
but I can't figure out
how to summon one.

235
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,679
Do you guys feel that?

236
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,554
What?

237
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,438
I don't know, it's like a...

238
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,715
It's like a feeling...

239
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,198
Honey, what you looking for?

240
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,635
I think there's a muse
somewhere in this room.

241
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,112
Being of creativity
Show yourself now to me

242
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,671
Your light which shines upon our face
Let our vision now embrace

243
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,837
I was hoping I could inspire you
to do that.

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,672
I'm Melody.

245
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,870
- I'm Phoebe, and this is--
- I know who you girls are.

246
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,270
I've been inspiring you
your whole lives.

247
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,158
Now I was hoping
you can help me.

248
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,193
So you know what's been happening
to the muses?

249
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,157
Yes, we were inspiring a symphony,

250
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,198
and a friend of mine,
a fellow muse, was captured.

251
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,833
I was lucky to get away.

252
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,069
Get away from what?

253
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,678
A warlock claimed
the Ring of lnspiration.

254
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,793
- The what?
- It's a ring

255
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,032
that enables the wearer
to see and capture muses.

256
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,077
I mean, it was created
by good magic,

257
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,231
to channel inspiration
in times of great need.

258
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,036
A warlock, is that like a demon?

259
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,952
- Pretty much, yeah.
- That's nice.

260
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,829
Hi. I thought you were orbing.

261
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,035
What?

262
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,271
Melody, Leo. Whitelighter, muse.

263
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,237
- Nice to meet you.
- We go way back.

264
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,155
Right, good to see you again.

265
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,431
Have you ever heard
of the Ring of lnspiration?

266
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,915
I think so. Red jewel?

267
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,117
Isn't that something you would have
normally mentioned earlier?

268
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,469
Right.

269
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,159
Yeah.

270
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,396
- Leo!
- What?

271
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,159
He's behind you!

272
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,631
You okay?

273
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,994
- What was that?
- That was a warlock.

274
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,951
Was that the warlock
that captured your friend?

275
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,953
No.

276
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,639
They must be working together.

277
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,315
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is what you call a faction.

278
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,308
Piper, where are you going?
We have to make a plan.

279
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,549
I have a plan.

280
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,869
- Which is?
- To cook.

281
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,393
Now that I know
what we're up against,

282
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,834
I can practically taste the potion.

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,911
I don't know what it does,
but it tastes pretty good.

284
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,071
I can't believe
I almost threw away my paints.

285
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,913
I'm gonna write a vanquishing spell.

286
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,591
Actually, I have to write
a vanquishing spell.

287
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,877
I keep hearing rhyming in my head.
Are you doing that?

288
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,759
Oh, no, you're doing that.
I'm just helping it come out.

289
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,629
Yes, you do, without a doubt.

290
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,991
I think I should probably leave.

291
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,878
I'm not meant to stay
in one place for too long.

292
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,675
The inspiration gets a little intense.

293
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,989
Okay, but that's good.

294
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,674
If the warlocks are enslaving
other muses to inspire them,

295
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,398
then we need all the help
we can get.

296
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,437
- I think I know how to get the ring.
- You do?

297
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,631
Can you describe
the warlock to me?

298
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,358
I think so.

299
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,274
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm going to draw him.

300
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,031
I think Leo should orb me
underground.

301
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,874
- What?
- I could find out

302
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,553
who the faction leader is.

303
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,109
I may not have my powers anymore,
but I still know the terrain.

304
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,840
Yeah, and you may just find yourself
in everlasting pain.

305
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,237
- That's a rhyme.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, now's not the time.

306
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,234
Cole, if you go underground,
you will be a sitting duck

307
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,392
- without your powers.
- I'm a sitting duck up here as well.

308
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,314
At least this way, I can be useful.

309
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,872
Cole, you are useful. Alive.

310
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,350
It's just now you have to be
the brains behind the operation,

311
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,994
not the brawn.

312
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,196
Well, is there some rule
that says I have to choose?

313
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,191
Well, I could make one up

314
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,554
but it would just be a ruse.

315
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,754
- But maybe I should point out that--
- I think Cole has a point.

316
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,195
- Excuse me?
- Well, he is a demon, right?

317
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,715
- Was a demon.
- Before you get any more--

318
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,757
No, he was a half demon,

319
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,797
that's probably lived
for about a century,

320
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,474
so that means he knows his way
around "down there" pretty well.

321
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,358
And we can use
all the help we can get.

322
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,193
- Leo?
- I think what Melody is trying to say--

323
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,271
No, the point is bounty hunters
haven't been attacking

324
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,835
because they think he's dead.
If he goes down to the underworld--

325
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,468
- I'm still here!
- Cole, if you go underground,

326
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,598
and anyone sees you, you will
be back on the demonic radar.

327
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,479
Only this time you will not have
anything to protect yourself.

328
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,915
It's starting to seem like you have
some kind of death wish.

329
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,593
And it seems to me like
you won't be happy

330
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,398
until I don an apron
and become your houseboy.

331
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,949
Hey! Here is the thing, guys,

332
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,476
every time there is a muse around,
passions tend to run a little higher.

333
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,959
A lot higher.

334
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,269
So let's keep that in mind

335
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,192
in our communications
with each other, okay?

336
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,192
Phoebe, go write your spell.

337
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,238
Paige, do whatever it is
you were going to do,

338
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,231
Cole, please join me in the kitchen

339
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,118
and tell me everything
you know about warlocks

340
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,508
so that I can make my potion.

341
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,719
We'll talk about this later.

342
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,234
Alligator.

343
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,308
Cole!

344
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,868
What I don't understand is why
a warlock would even want that ring.

345
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,075
Are you kidding?

346
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,191
Evil never gets to feel
a muse's inspiration.

347
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,555
I can tell you, I've never felt
anything like it in my life.

348
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,518
- What does it feel like?
- It was like a power surge,

349
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,875
an overdose of adrenaline.
I can tell you, these warlocks

350
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,508
must be sucking it up, so whatever
you're doing, please do it fast.

351
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,477
Because I promise they'll be back.

352
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,278
Look, I'm making this up
as I go along.

353
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,670
So power surge or no,
you're going to have to be patient,

354
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,957
Iike you're gonna have to be patient
with Phoebe on the marriage front.

355
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,516
I don't think that's any
of your business.

356
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,432
You don't know sisters
very well, do you?

357
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,511
Cole, you're struggling, right?

358
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,636
Trying to figure out
how to be this new person?

359
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,476
I thought we were here
to talk about warlocks.

360
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,629
No.

361
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,917
What you don't get is that Phoebe
is trying to do the exact same thing.

362
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,150
She's always been
the youngest sister,

363
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,357
the eternal child,
carefree, fun-loving...

364
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,670
- And?
- And in a minute, she lost Prue,

365
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,751
discovered Paige
and became the middle sister.

366
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,229
And to top it all off, you propose.

367
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,198
The idea of marriage, being
that much of a grownup,

368
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,713
is terrifying to Phoebe.

369
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,757
- Did she say that?
- No, but she doesn't have to.

370
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,990
I'm her big sister,
I've known her only, oh,

371
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,275
her whole life.

372
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,313
- Could I have a word?
- Yeah.

373
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,674
See what a little patience
will get you.

374
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,512
I'm asking a favour, Leo.

375
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,193
Man to man.

376
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,034
You want me to talk to Phoebe?

377
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,913
I want you to orb me underground.

378
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,791
- Cole, that's the inspiration talking.
- Maybe so, but think about it, Leo.

379
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,837
Their big plan right now
is to draw the warlock.

380
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,589
They're the Charmed Ones. I trust
that they know what they're doing.

381
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,557
Just listen. I can't be certain,
but I think

382
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,153
that warlock used demonic powers.

383
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,471
Which means he killed
a demon to get them?

384
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,515
- Aren't there laws against that?
- It's punishable by death.

385
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,110
Now, I know where the demons
will convene to discuss this treason.

386
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,396
They probably know by now
which warlock is behind it.

387
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,755
All we have to do...

388
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,348
...is listen.

389
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,509
And not be seen.

390
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,716
We can go now and be back
before anybody notices.

391
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,598
Oh, they're gonna notice.

392
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,878
And then they're gonna kill me.

393
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,874
A warlock is a funny thing
He blinks from place to place

394
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,556
And when we say these words to him
His face they will erase

395
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,235
Sounds more like
a limerick than a spell.

396
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,833
Damn.

397
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,880
I think his nose
is a little longer than that.

398
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,072
Your work is wonderful.

399
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,514
Thanks to you.

400
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,830
No, Paige, I have nothing
to do with product.

401
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,831
Only the inspiration to create it.

402
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,432
- I could use a little of that over here.
- Okay.

403
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,274
Close your eyes and concentrate.

404
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,553
Thank you.

405
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,913
So how come you stopped painting?

406
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,958
How come you stopped
inspiring me to paint?

407
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,630
I also have no control
over the world, Paige.

408
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,792
You stopped painting because
you stopped caring about your art.

409
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,871
No, I didn't stop caring about my art.

410
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,189
I just...

411
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,273
I don't know, I guess
I'm a perfectionist.

412
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,871
And once I stopped
having enough time to practice,

413
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,235
well, I just kind of threw in the towel.

414
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,836
Art isn't about perfection.
It's about expression.

415
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,710
The key is simply to love it.
That's the call I answer.

416
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,872
I got potions. Who's got a spell?

417
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,197
Evil is a faithful foe
But good does battle best

418
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,480
We witches will, with these words
Waste the warlock's evil zest

419
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,674
Wonderful. Witty, but wordy.

420
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,429
You just take one.

421
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,472
- And you.
- Thank you.

422
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,830
- Is that him?
- Precisely.

423
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,319
Now that I have something
to focus on,

424
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,710
- I think I can call for the ring.
- Oh, that's brilliant.

425
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,791
The ring will orb to you
and then if he wants it back,

426
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,155
- he'll have to follow it.
- Which is when we hit him

427
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,231
- with the potion.
- And make a huge commotion.

428
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,510
Right, the potion
will flash in his eyes,

429
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,910
which are very sensitive,
this should keep him from blinking

430
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,719
Iong enough for us to vanquish him
with your spell.

431
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,634
- Blinking?
- That's how the warlocks get around.

432
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,359
Well, why don't you just,
I don't know,

433
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,953
freeze him, or blow him up
or something?

434
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,998
Well, sometimes warlocks
don't freeze or blow up.

435
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,230
The power of three spell
is the only guarantee.

436
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,755
- Fabulous.
- God, we're good.

437
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,795
Oh, no, wait.
I think we should tell the guys.

438
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,433
But why?

439
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,358
Cole?

440
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,873
Cole?

441
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,598
What is this place, Cole?

442
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,110
High council meeting quarters.

443
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,111
We listen long enough,

444
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,713
we'll hear plenty.

445
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,153
You two lost?

446
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,629
- Rake.
- Belthazor?

447
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,754
Sorry, man,
thought you were a warlock.

448
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,833
Didn't I hear you were dead?

449
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,518
Yeah. And unfortunately
I have to stay that way.

450
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,154
He seemed like a friend.

451
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,198
In my old life he was.

452
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,754
Feels different, doesn't it?

453
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,473
Killing, now that you're human?

454
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,276
Just keep an eye out,
would you?

455
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,988
Leo?

456
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,594
- Leo!
- Cole is nowhere to be found.

457
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,270
And Leo still isn't answering.

458
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,714
I can't believe they'd do this.

459
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,272
Do what, exactly?

460
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,756
The only reason Leo
wouldn't hear us calling

461
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,592
is if he went underground with Cole.

462
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,637
I'd rather do battle with warlocks
than do battle with the two of you.

463
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,915
Call for the ring.

464
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,997
Well, shouldn't we wait
for Leo in case we get hurt?

465
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,639
Just call for the ring.

466
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,873
Ring!

467
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,792
Breathe and focus.

468
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,198
That ring packs a serious punch.

469
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,475
What power did you get?

470
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,353
It worked.

471
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,839
Let all the muses out.

472
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,514
Your ring, where did it go?

473
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,113
The Charmed Ones.

474
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,633
Well, let's go get it back.

475
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,870
No way, they just vanquished
the last sucker you sent in.

476
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,553
He didn't have
your newly acquired power.

477
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,995
You wanna live in the shadow
of demons your whole life?

478
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,309
Forget it, Devlin, it's suicide.

479
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,630
They're expecting me,
but not the two of us.

480
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,711
We can take them, come on.

481
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,279
We'll share their powers

482
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,476
and together we'll rule
the underworld.

483
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,312
We're gonna have so much fun.

484
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,989
Evil is a faithful foe
But good does battle best

485
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,914
We witches will, with these words
Waste the warlock's evil zest

486
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,831
What just happened?

487
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,279
Oh, my God!

488
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,193
No!

489
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,793
Piper, blow him up!

490
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,393
No! You'll blow up Melody too.

491
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,152
I know you're...

492
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,276
I know you're mad,
but before you say anything,

493
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,752
we found out that the faction leader
is a warlock named Devlin.

494
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,870
He looked more like a Joe to me.

495
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,109
- Where's Melody?
- Oh, she's gone.

496
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,269
Gone?

497
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,034
"Gone," as in she left?

498
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,556
"Gone" as in, she got sucked
into a big red ring

499
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,233
by a warlock named--
What was it?

500
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,158
- Devlin.
- Right, Devlin.

501
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,320
Okay, so what exactly
are you doing now?

502
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,875
Basking in the brilliance
of our failure.

503
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,559
What happened?

504
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,950
Oh, well, I called for the ring,

505
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,839
it came to me,
and we set the muses free.

506
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,436
Which was useless, because Devlin
came and took it right back

507
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,999
so he could capture them all again.

508
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,639
And he took our own muse.

509
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,712
And he's gonna use
her inspiration to kill us.

510
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,071
- Ah, the irony.
- Okay.

511
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,959
I understand that you guys have
been on an inspiration binge

512
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,078
and that you are wiped out.
But now is not the time to give up.

513
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,670
He's right. Devlin will be back soon,
and stronger than before.

514
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,353
We have no inspiration to fight him.

515
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,669
But you don't need it.

516
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,832
All right, Melody just inspired your
own passion, creativity and talent.

517
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,992
What you have to do now
is find another way to tap into it.

518
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,957
I say we head for the hills.

519
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,878
Great idea, rhymes with kills.

520
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,239
You think that's funny?

521
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,072
If you'd done what I asked
and stayed here,

522
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,434
you might have been able to help.

523
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,273
How? The minute Devlin arrived,
you would've sent me to my room.

524
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,950
Cole, I wasn't just being
a nagging girlfriend.

525
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,793
I actually had good reasons
for asking you not to go.

526
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,234
Which were what, exactly?

527
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,958
I don't know, to try to keep you alive?

528
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,872
Why, because I'm not capable
of defending myself?

529
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,429
If that's the way you think, no wonder
you don't wanna marry me.

530
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,999
I can't believe that's what you think.

531
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,991
- Is that what you think?
- What should I think?

532
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,469
You're supposed to know
that I love you, and that l--

533
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,551
And what? I have a hard time
believing that any woman

534
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,995
who's truly in love would really
turn down a marriage proposal.

535
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,469
Well, that's how little
you know about women.

536
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,474
Cole, there's still so much
that we don't know about each other.

537
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,193
I mean, we don't know
the new rules,

538
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,635
we don't know what it means
for you to be human.

539
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,155
- And I don't know--
- That you truly love me.

540
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,433
No, Cole.

541
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,837
That's the one thing that I do know.

542
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,831
Well, then, what is the problem?

543
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,792
I don't know how to be a wife.

544
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,389
But I can't live without you in my life.

545
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,793
Did she rhyme?
I think she just rhymed.

546
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,272
This is what I'm talking about.

547
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,115
Phoebe's passion for Cole
is a natural way to access inspiration.

548
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,233
Okay, you guys,

549
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,119
we have a warlock to catch.
And I know we're beaten,

550
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,475
and I know we're tired.
But that does not mean

551
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,959
we can just lay down and play dead.

552
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,111
I don't think
we're gonna have to play.

553
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,829
Piper, Leo said we could tap into our
own inspiration and I'm feeling it.

554
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,514
Now you have to do whatever
you have to do to feel it too.

555
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,996
I don't know, I kind of agree
with running for the hills.

556
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,153
You can't run.

557
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,912
Not while Devlin has that ring.

558
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,039
You know, this isn't just about saving
our own lives, or even Melody's.

559
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,555
It's about good versus evil,
and wrong versus right,

560
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,029
and our job as witches,
to fight the good fight.

561
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,799
Dr. Seuss, is that you?

562
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,515
What if we didn't wait
for Devlin to come to us?

563
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,954
What if we went to him?

564
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,429
See, now that's the spirit.
We're gonna need a new spell.

565
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,512
Piper, we're gonna need
some more of your potion.

566
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,352
I have no idea what I put in it.

567
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,756
All right, Cole and I were there,
maybe we can help.

568
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,639
Leo, please. There were, like,
1 5,000 herbs on that counter.

569
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,030
Okay, so just start cooking
and let that inspire you.

570
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,349
Now she's Martha Stewart.

571
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,715
You're pretty young, Piper.
Are you really ready to die?

572
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,070
Look, if you can't do it
to save Melody,

573
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,073
then get inspired to save
your own life, for Leo.

574
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,152
For me. For Paige.
I don't care how you do it.

575
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,916
Just do it, because I guarantee you
that Devlin's not sitting on his butt

576
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,911
waiting for inspiration to strike.

577
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,158
We have proven with the loss
of our fallen comrades

578
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,550
that we can't take on
the witches as individuals.

579
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,553
But there is power in numbers,
my friends.

580
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,508
And our plan is inspired.
Now, are you with me?

581
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,955
Yes.

582
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,553
- Yes.
- Yes.

583
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,759
Yes.

584
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,509
It's time.

585
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,154
Prepare yourselves.

586
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,232
And don't be late.

587
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,398
This doesn't feel right.

588
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,915
Well, if anyone has a better idea,
we're open to it.

589
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,957
You could try calling for it again.

590
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,394
Oh, no, that wouldn't work.

591
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,313
He's probably figured out a way
to protect the ring by now.

592
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,516
All right, let me just think
for a minute.

593
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,716
We don't have a minute.
We need the ring back now.

594
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,992
She's right. With all the muses
afraid to come out of hiding,

595
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,798
the world is going uninspired.

596
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,077
- Which is okay except that--
- Evil is inspired.

597
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,475
Right.

598
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,039
Which could throw off
the whole balance,

599
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,758
giving evil the upper hand.

600
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,957
I get that, but they've never been
to the underworld

601
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,439
without me there to protect them.

602
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,352
We have a potion,
we have the vanquishing spell,

603
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,239
we have the power of three,
and we have the element of surprise.

604
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,311
But what you don't have
is any idea where Melody is.

605
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,239
She's in the ring.

606
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,789
Which is on the finger of a warlock
who could be anywhere,

607
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,871
doing anything, with any number
of demonic powers.

608
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,473
I'm telling you, it doesn't feel right.

609
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,194
I know.

610
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,789
Then don't go.

611
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,594
Baby, every time
you went to the underworld,

612
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,751
every time you shimmered out
of here and I had to wonder

613
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,114
if I'd ever see you again...

614
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,239
...it didn't feel right.
But you had to go, didn't you?

615
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,275
Be careful.

616
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,072
Being of creativity

617
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,392
We call ourselves now to thee

618
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,551
Your light now darkened in a ring

619
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,678
Shall feel
The power of three we bring

620
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,393
Oh, no.

621
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,631
Did we get sent back in time again?

622
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,317
No, Phoebe, we're at P3. I think.

623
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,873
Oh my God,
'40s Night looks amazing.

624
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,314
Okay, sisters, focus.

625
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,550
We cast a spell to find our muse

626
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,280
and it landed us
not in the underworld, but in my club.

627
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,919
So then the spell didn't work?

628
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,479
No, the spell definitely worked.

629
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,034
Then Melody's here?

630
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,679
And so is Devlin.

631
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,916
And probably his entire faction.

632
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,151
I don't know how you do it.

633
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,550
How do you sit by and do nothing

634
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,280
while your wife's life is in danger?

635
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,668
Cole...

636
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,792
I get that this is hard for you.

637
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,235
But I need you to do me
a favour and shut up.

638
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,399
- Excuse me?
- I need to concentrate.

639
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,834
On the floorboards?

640
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,911
No, I am listening
for a call from the girls

641
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,150
so I can be there
in case they need me.

642
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,391
- It's a trap.
- What?

643
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,278
I knew this didn't feel right.

644
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,670
Why didn't the warlocks attack again
after they got the muse?

645
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,831
Evil isn't exactly known
for its patience.

646
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,236
It's because they already
failed twice.

647
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,992
So Devlin knew
he needed numbers.

648
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,151
Not too many warlocks are stupid

649
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,311
or brave enough to attack
right here in the manor.

650
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,072
But plenty can be convinced
to lay in ambush.

651
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,515
Hang on.

652
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,195
That's strange.

653
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,279
- What?
- The girls aren't underground.

654
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,839
They're at P3.

655
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,150
- They can't use their powers in public.
- I promised--

656
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,912
You only promised
not to orb me underground.

657
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,715
Okay, looking for them
this way is not gonna work.

658
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,199
Oh, Piper!

659
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,793
Love the fireworks!

660
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,629
Fireworks.

661
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,479
Yes, fireworks.

662
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,710
I just wanted to tell you,
I think the club looks great.

663
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,076
Bev, you're a genius.

664
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,549
Genius.

665
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,156
How exactly is she a genius?

666
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,709
The strobe lights.

667
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,235
They'll work like the potion,
but on a grand scale.

668
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,152
It'll keep the warlocks
from blinking.

669
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,471
I'll freeze all the innocents,
anyone you see still moving,

670
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,312
feel free to vanquish them.

671
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,634
All right, here goes nothing.

672
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,999
Energy ball!

673
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,912
- Help me!
- Come on!

674
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,958
- Phoebe!
- Melody.

675
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,639
Phoebe, help me!

676
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,995
Paige.

677
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,878
You stay here,
I'll go get Melody.

678
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,109
Phoebe!

679
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,949
Piper?

680
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,918
Are you okay?
Come on.

681
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,438
Okay, so who here
doesn't want to die?

682
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,758
Come on, let's get out of here.

683
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,358
We still don't have the ring.

684
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,909
That's okay, we have Melody.
We'll get the ring next.

685
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,595
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- They're still frozen, aren't they? Yes.

686
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,591
- How are you? Are you okay?
- I am now.

687
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,989
Are you okay?

688
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,795
Blow him up. Blow him up.

689
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,637
I'm too strong for you, witch.

690
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,472
Well, good thing
I brought reinforcements.

691
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,999
Evil is a faithful foe
But good does battle best

692
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,516
We witches will, with these words
Waste this warlock's evil zest

693
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,233
Thank you for coming.

694
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,958
Thank you for having me.

695
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,632
Now, that was inspired.

696
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,989
Here, I think you need
to give this back to the good guys.

697
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,313
I think it's time I should be going.

698
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,314
- Don't be a stranger.
- I wouldn't dream of it.

699
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,358
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

700
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,074
Okay, should we go back
into the party?

701
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,310
Actually, I think I'm inspired
to spend an evening at home.

702
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,713
Aren't you guys forgetting
a little something?

703
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,594
Let's see...

704
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,352
Being of creativity

705
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,272
Hide yourself now from me

706
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,590
Your light that shines upon our face

707
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,959
From our vision now erase
