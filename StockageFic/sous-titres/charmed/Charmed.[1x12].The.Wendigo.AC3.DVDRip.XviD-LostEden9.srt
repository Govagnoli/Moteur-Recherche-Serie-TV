1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,884
Of course I know
what a jack is, Phoebe.

2
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,385
I just don't know how to use it.

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:14,389
It's not like I've ever got a flat tire before.
This doesn't happen to me every day.

4
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,394
Piper, relax. I used to date a mechanic,
I will walk you through it.

5
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,273
Okay, you put the jack under the jeep
and then put the handle in the base

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,942
and ratchet it up and down, okay?
It's very easy.

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,570
Handle. Handle.

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,739
I don't think I got a handle.

9
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,575
Wait, there's a long wooden spoon
in the back.

10
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:37,204
That's not gonna work. She's looking
for a long wooden spoon.

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,414
Our table's ready.

12
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,418
Okay. Okay.

13
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,636
- It didn't work.
- Stay there and we'll come get you.

14
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,139
No, I can do it. I can figure it out.

15
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,267
Piper, you're stranded and you're
all alone, and the only thing you have

16
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,770
to protect yourself with
is a wooden spoon that's broken.

17
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:05,440
And I have the power to freeze.
I'm fine. It's better than Mace.

18
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,902
Okay, I gotta go before my battery
dies. I gotta call the Auto Club.

19
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,573
<i>- I'll meet you there in a little bit.
- Piper, wait. Hello?</i>

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,283
She is out of her mind.

21
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,746
All right, we'll give her 15 minutes
and call back. Okay.

22
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,625
<i>Directory assistance.
What city please?</i>

23
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,836
San Francisco. Auto Club, please.

24
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,881
So back to what we were
talking about.

25
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,466
What do you think?

26
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:34,969
- Well, I think it's a good idea.
- Great.

27
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:39,015
- And I think it's a bad idea.
- How? How is it a bad idea?

28
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,477
You need extra help for the auction,
and I need a job.

29
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:46,022
Well, not only are we family,
but we live together.

30
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,692
And I don't think that my wardrobe can
take the assault of your daily needs.

31
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,987
Okay, I'm great with phones, better
with people and very computer-friendly.

32
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:57,199
And with a paycheck, I could purchase
new clothes. So by hiring me,

33
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,453
you'd actually be expanding
your wardrobe, not decreasing it.

34
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,705
And I'd be eternally grateful.

35
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,791
You really want to work
at Buckland's with me?

36
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,961
When opportunity knocks,
I answer the door.

37
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,006
The job is very demanding.
Auctions can be stressful.

38
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:14,508
- I love a challenge.
- We work pretty long hours.

39
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,303
Overtime is my friend.

40
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,555
Plus, I just thought of something else.

41
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,225
With my premonitions, I might just
be able to get you the straight dope

42
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:25,561
without a trip to the office
water cooler.

43
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:27,188
Don't push it.

44
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,356
Right.

45
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,817
So, what do you think?

46
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,528
Can you start tomorrow?

47
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,780
Yes.

48
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:39,658
Hey, can you give me a ride?

49
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:43,245
Hello?

50
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:45,205
Oh, great.

51
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:57,092
No problem,

52
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:01,722
for I bear the power of one.

53
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:37,233
Everything's gonna be okay.

54
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:25,173
- Piper Halliwell?
- Prue. Phoebe.

55
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,176
- Andy, thanks for calling us.
- Please, she's like my sister too.

56
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:30,429
She's in here.

57
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,101
Oh, my God, that's a lot of blood.

58
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:40,730
- Hey, sweetie.
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?

59
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:43,608
Yeah, I'm fine.

60
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:46,862
If I pass out and I need a transfusion,
I'm AB negative.

61
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,197
It's very rare. It could be a problem.

62
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:52,450
Try not to look at it. And just
so you know, I'm AB neg. Too.

63
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:55,036
Plus, I love good food. Perfect donor.

64
00:06:56,955 --> 00:07:00,083
- So no stitches?
- No. It's not that deep.

65
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:05,088
Follow up with your doctor
in the morning, though. Keep it dry,

66
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:07,257
a little aspirin for the pain.
You'll be fine.

67
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:10,635
- Easy for you to say.
- You're all set. Just sign this.

68
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,262
Oh, I got it.

69
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:18,393
Come here, baby. I don't understand.
Why didn't you just freeze him?

70
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,770
I was trapped in a phone booth.
My power doesn't work

71
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:22,981
- outside the room I'm in, remember?
- Oh, right.

72
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:25,233
- Oh, my God, Billy.
- How are you?

73
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,652
Billy. This is Billy. He saved my life.

74
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:30,905
- I'm just glad I got there in time.
- I'd like to talk to you about that.

75
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:33,616
Along with that flare gun you
just happened to show up with.

76
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:39,455
I don't think that you can smoke
in here.

77
00:07:39,622 --> 00:07:43,668
Oh, right. Look, it's no coincidence
I was there, inspector.

78
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:46,003
I heard about the murder last night.
The creature...

79
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:47,922
- The creature?
- Yeah, that's right.

80
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:52,093
- Yes, creature. Absolutely.
- Describe it.

81
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:56,139
- Billy, what are you doing here?
- Same thing you are.

82
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:59,851
- Hunting that thing.
- Piper, Prue, Phoebe Halliwell,

83
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:02,311
Special Agent Fallon of the FBI.

84
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,565
- FBI. Cool.
- Describe it. Okay.

85
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:07,900
Big, scary, strong,

86
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:11,487
kind of like a cross between
a werewolf and Charles Manson.

87
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:13,030
- Yellow eyes?
- Yes.

88
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:15,491
Talon-like hands?

89
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:17,785
Can I talk to you, inspector?

90
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:27,294
Ms Halliwell's the first one
to survive an attack.

91
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:30,464
Unlike that poor guy we found
last night with his heart ripped out.

92
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:32,758
Just like the killings in Chicago
and New Orleans.

93
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:36,220
- I've sent for the coroner's reports.
- Why?

94
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:39,765
I think it's pretty obvious this case
is out of your jurisdiction, inspector.

95
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:43,727
- On the bright side, you don't want it.
- Why's that?

96
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:46,105
This witness corroborates
every other statement.

97
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:50,985
According to their descriptions, this
perp's not either animal or human.

98
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,738
You didn't blink. I was expecting
a response.

99
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:57,741
- Just tell me what I'm looking for.
- You believe them?

100
00:08:57,908 --> 00:09:00,953
- That it's not human?
- Let's just say recent experiences

101
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,038
have taught me to keep
an open mind.

102
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:06,750
Cosy, aren't they?

103
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:10,003
So, Billy, how did you know
to use a flare gun?

104
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:13,173
- It's afraid of fire.
- How did you figure that out?

105
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:17,970
Because when it attacked us,
me and my fiancée, Laura,

106
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:21,723
we were camping by Lake Michigan
and I grabbed a log from the fire,

107
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:24,601
it freaked, took off.

108
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:26,979
But...

109
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:29,106
...not before it ripped
Laura's heart out.

110
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:33,944
Might as well have taken mine too.

111
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:37,614
I came here to kill it.

112
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:45,956
If that thing last night isn't demonic,
I don't know what is.

113
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:47,791
Yeah, well, it's not your fight, Piper.

114
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,877
Just let Andy and that FBI agent
handle it. Okay?

115
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:54,673
Can't. That thing tried to kill me.
Besides, I was meant to be involved.

116
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,468
I know that. It's no coincidence
I got that flat.

117
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:09,980
- Nice outfit.
- Very corporate.

118
00:10:10,146 --> 00:10:13,274
Yeah, well I have to try to impress
my new boss.

119
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:15,985
- Hey, how's the arm?
- Itches.

120
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:19,823
Piper, you have got to go to the doctor,
okay? It could be infected.

121
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:23,159
- It's not. It's fine.
- Here.

122
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:25,787
Listen, you, while we're at work...

123
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:28,373
Whoa, head rush.

124
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,125
"While we're at work."

125
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:34,754
Don't even think about going after
that thing alone.

126
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,007
Wait, there's no reason to go
after it at all.

127
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:41,594
- The only innocent to protect is Piper.
- I thought I was gonna die last night.

128
00:10:41,803 --> 00:10:43,262
I was totally helpless.

129
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:46,182
All I could think about was I was never
gonna see you guys again.

130
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:51,979
And then suddenly, out of nowhere,
comes Billy. Saved me. Protected me.

131
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:55,233
That thing took away the person he
loved, and he's out there all alone

132
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,945
trying to kill it. I can't just do nothing.

133
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:02,365
Just don't do anything unless
we're together, okay? Promise?

134
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:08,120
- Meet you outside.
- I'll be right there.

135
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:09,664
Okay.

136
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:14,543
- Okay, I'm freaking. I'm freaking.
- Why?

137
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,506
Because I convinced Prue to hire me,
and what if I disappoint her?

138
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:20,800
Or what if I screw up
and make her look bad?

139
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:23,969
There's a reason my résumé
is only three sentences long, Piper.

140
00:11:24,178 --> 00:11:26,972
Stop. You're one
of the smartest people I know.

141
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:28,683
I'm sure you'll do great.

142
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:31,060
- You really mean that?
- Yes, I do.

143
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:35,940
That makes me feel so much better.
Thank you.

144
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:53,165
Lot number 102, one lamp.
Estimated value, $2500.

145
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:55,209
What, it doesn't need light bulbs?

146
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:59,630
- It's a Stickley, an original.
- Ah, right, a Stickley.

147
00:11:59,797 --> 00:12:02,424
I still can't believe none of this stuff
belongs to anyone.

148
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,677
Yeah, well every year, the city
auctions off unclaimed probate items,

149
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:07,304
asset seizures for revenue.

150
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:09,139
What about the stuff that doesn't sell?

151
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:11,934
It gets tossed. What is lot 103?

152
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:15,395
103, gold bracelet.

153
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:20,359
Estimated value, $375.
I will take that if no one wants it.

154
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:23,612
Note that it's inscribed
with the initials T and L.

155
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:26,865
All right, that finishes the first
grouping. I'm gonna go upstairs

156
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:29,243
to Appraisals and make sure
we didn't forget anything.

157
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,954
- Meet you back at my office?
- Your mid-morning coffee

158
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,498
will be ready and waiting.

159
00:12:34,665 --> 00:12:36,708
I think this is really gonna work
with you and me.

160
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,127
Me too.

161
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:51,056
- Prue.
- Yeah?

162
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:54,810
I just had a vision of the past.
It was a terrible car accident.

163
00:12:55,018 --> 00:12:57,896
- And this bracelet...
- What about it?

164
00:12:58,104 --> 00:13:00,023
It was thrown free.

165
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,777
Oh, man. I bet I'm supposed
to figure out who it belongs to.

166
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:06,947
Oh, no, no, no. Not now.

167
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:09,032
- I can't help it.
- Prue?

168
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:12,702
Just wanted to make sure everything's
in order for today's auction.

169
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:14,537
Wait, the auction is today?

170
00:13:14,954 --> 00:13:17,082
Yes, Claire, everything's in order.

171
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,292
Terrific. I'll see you later then.

172
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,466
Ooh, nice. That should sell quickly.

173
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:30,428
What are we gonna do?

174
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:36,726
It's called a what?

175
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:38,895
A Wendigo.

176
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:41,522
Apparently, it looks like a normal
person during the day,

177
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:43,858
but then transforms at night.

178
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:47,695
It survives by feeding
on human hearts.

179
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:49,489
What?

180
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:53,868
According to my information,
the first Wendigo was a mortal who,

181
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:58,373
betrayed by his lover,
cut out her heart and ate it.

182
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:01,542
As soon as he did,
his own heart turned to ice

183
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:05,004
and that's how he became
this monster.

184
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:10,051
So, what, it, like... It takes love away
from others, is that it?

185
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:11,594
Or...

186
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:13,804
Then why did it go after you?

187
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:17,058
Are you... in love?

188
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:20,436
No. Unfortunately, no

189
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:23,064
It must be attracted to something else.

190
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:25,483
Like... maybe beauty?

191
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:29,862
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:30,363 --> 00:14:31,739
It's just...

193
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:36,410
...you remind me a lot of my fiancée.

194
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:44,502
Anyway, from what I gather,
it strikes

195
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:46,462
during the three phases
of the full moon.

196
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:49,924
Which means it may try again tonight.

197
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:51,717
That's what it did before.

198
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:54,762
Amazing, you know I've been tracking
this thing for two months,

199
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:58,057
and in one night you're a Ph.D.
In Wendigo.

200
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:02,144
Yeah. Well, read more about it.

201
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:06,231
I should call Andy. I mean,
Inspector Trudeau and tell him this.

202
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,650
No. Agent Fallon's better.

203
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:13,238
She's been so great to me
ever since Laura...

204
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:18,452
And she's already a believer.

205
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:21,789
I'll tell her, okay?

206
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,627
- Dizzy.
- You okay?

207
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,338
Must have stood up too fast.

208
00:15:30,672 --> 00:15:32,966
Will you call me after you see her?
Please?

209
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,218
Sure.

210
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:39,890
I can help, Billy. I can't tell you
exactly how or why,

211
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:44,019
but I just want you to know I can.
You're not in this alone.

212
00:15:44,686 --> 00:15:46,605
I know.

213
00:15:55,697 --> 00:15:57,449
- Quake.
- Piper, it's Andy.

214
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:59,201
Checking in to see how you're doing.

215
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:03,413
Oh, Andy, that's sweet. I'm fine.
I'm just a little tired.

216
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:05,332
Yeah, well, you should be
at home relaxing.

217
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:08,460
<i>I'm okay. Listen, Billy Waters just left.</i>

218
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:12,839
He's on his way to the Federal Building
to see Agent Fallon.

219
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:14,883
<i>He has a theory on the attacks.</i>

220
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,511
I'll let her know. You rest up, okay?

221
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,014
And stay out of dark, scary places
for a while, will you?

222
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,351
- Okay.
- Take care.

223
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:27,896
Billy's on his way over to your office.
Has some information on the attacks.

224
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,232
Really. I guess I'd better go.

225
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:33,485
You seem pretty familiar
with the witness.

226
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:38,948
- Piper? Yeah, I dated her sister.
- "Dated"? Past tense?

227
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:42,869
- It's a long story. Why?
- Just curious.

228
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,705
Wouldn't want a lovesick cop
on my hands.

229
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:49,208
Especially if that's what
the creature is after.

230
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:51,127
What makes you think it is?

231
00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:54,839
You got a better explanation for why
it rips the heart out of its victims?

232
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:57,508
Maybe. I've just gone over
the coroner's reports

233
00:16:57,675 --> 00:17:00,511
from Chicago, New Orleans,
now local.

234
00:17:00,678 --> 00:17:02,638
Turns out all the victims
were AB negative.

235
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,600
Chosen by blood type,
that's a new one.

236
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:08,853
That, plus they're all killed in threes.
The night before, the night after

237
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,355
and the night of the full moon.

238
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:14,192
Piper would've been the second,
only she got away.

239
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:17,320
Well, if you're right, that means
the creature will try again tonight.

240
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:20,489
I'm not altogether convinced
it's a quote-unquote creature.

241
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:23,659
The blood types, the full moon,
the stolen hearts,

242
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:28,372
that feels like ritual.
And ritual is human.

243
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,502
Could be just one sick mind
behind these crimes.

244
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,381
Maybe we'll have a chance to confirm
your theory tonight.

245
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:41,927
You and me, stakeout at the park.
Interested?

246
00:17:42,303 --> 00:17:44,430
I'll bring my flare gun.

247
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:55,274
Billy. Looking for me?

248
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,235
Yeah. Listen, I think I know
what that creature is.

249
00:17:58,402 --> 00:18:00,446
- Really?
- Yeah. Piper was telling me about it.

250
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,824
- It's called a Wendigo, and it feeds...
- Hold on. Not here.

251
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:06,118
The other agents already
think I'm a little weird.

252
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:09,913
Why don't I walk you to your car,
and we'll talk on the way.

253
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,793
It's like this Wendigo attacks
people in love

254
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,755
or at least people with good hearts.

255
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:19,715
It's sort of like an anti-Cupid.

256
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,967
How does it know that
about its victims?

257
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,470
I don't know. Instinct?

258
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,890
Maybe it just senses something. Look,
I know it can take on human form.

259
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:29,933
Maybe it stalks them first.

260
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,021
Anyway, I know it's gonna
attack tonight. I know it.

261
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:36,899
Probably in the same park
just like the other cities.

262
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:39,359
- Interesting.
- Yeah. Well, we gotta get there,

263
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:42,904
stake it out, we wait for it to show up,
so then we can...

264
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:46,992
...kill it. Son of a bitch.

265
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:12,100
Prue, check it out. I found out
whose car went off the cliff.

266
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:15,604
Franklin Bates. He worked
for a big PI firm in San Jose.

267
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,189
- How did you do that?
- Easy. I recognised the road.

268
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:23,612
Coast Highway by Carmel.
I also recognised the car, '65 Lincoln.

269
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:27,532
My first boyfriend, Jimmy, used
to drive one just like it. Remember?

270
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,452
Anyway, so I got on the Web
and started snooping around,

271
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:34,664
which means that I tied up your phone
lines while you were at Appraisals.

272
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:37,459
<i>- Go on.
- I searched the Chronicle's databases</i>

273
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:42,172
for all articles on car accidents
in the area, and voilà,

274
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:45,800
there it was, February 1989.

275
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:48,428
Unfortunately, it took me a while
to access it

276
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:51,681
and I sort of forgot to tell you
that Claire was looking for you.

277
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:54,809
- Phoebe.
- I'm sorry. But here's the best part.

278
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:57,061
I called the PI firm he worked for,
lied to them,

279
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:58,563
told them I was Andy's partner,

280
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,441
and they told me what the initials
on the bracelet stand for.

281
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:03,985
The T is for "Teri,"
the L is for "Lane."

282
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:06,904
- Should I know the name?
- Teri Lane was a 5-year-old girl

283
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:08,823
kidnapped by her father.

284
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:11,367
It was the case the detective
was working on when he died.

285
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:14,203
- So...
- So I think that that bracelet

286
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:19,375
is proof that he found her. Maybe the
mother never got it, because he died.

287
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:22,503
Which means she never
found her daughter.

288
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:26,299
We can't sell that bracelet, Prue,
not until we know for sure.

289
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,929
So how am I supposed to explain this
to Claire. What, psychic provenance?

290
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:34,682
Psychic what?

291
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:39,395
- Claire, hi.
- I have been looking all over

292
00:20:39,562 --> 00:20:43,566
for this bracelet.
What's it doing up here?

293
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:47,278
- I had it cleaned.
- Fine. I'll return it downstairs.

294
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:50,865
I've already got two buyers interested.

295
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:56,328
We cannot let her sell
that bracelet, Prue.

296
00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:06,672
Piper.

297
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:13,887
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.

298
00:21:14,054 --> 00:21:16,807
Laurence Beck, Health Department.

299
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:20,686
This is a code inspection.
I'd like to start with the kitchen.

300
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:27,359
The counters are scrubbed every
15 minutes. The dishes are washed

301
00:21:27,526 --> 00:21:33,198
at 150 degrees Fahrenheit
with antibacterial dergent... Detergent.

302
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:38,203
- Are you ill?
- No. No, I just... I don't know.

303
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:42,207
Feel free to have a look around. We
have nothing to hide here at Quake.

304
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,042
Thanks.

305
00:22:00,976 --> 00:22:03,061
Excuse me, what are you doing
with that meat?

306
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:05,731
Dying.

307
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:12,779
Oh, right. Chuck that.

308
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,868
You're obviously sick. I think you'd
better go home, miss,

309
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:20,912
before I shut this restaurant down.

310
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:39,472
- Andy.
- What happened?

311
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:42,100
I don't know. I came here to meet him
and found him there.

312
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:44,060
- How did he die?
- Coroner hasn't said,

313
00:22:44,227 --> 00:22:47,230
but it's definitely a homicide.
Although, there's no mutilation,

314
00:22:47,397 --> 00:22:49,649
no other visible wounds.
Doesn't fit our MO.

315
00:22:49,816 --> 00:22:52,485
I suppose it could be random.

316
00:22:52,652 --> 00:22:57,240
Chases off a crazed killer last night,
then succumbs to a mugging today?

317
00:22:57,782 --> 00:22:59,867
I don't buy it.

318
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:02,537
Maybe the creature, or whatever it is,

319
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:05,248
found out Billy had
some information on it.

320
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:08,501
Got to him before he could get to me.

321
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:12,880
He had been stalking him for
two months. Could be the killer knew.

322
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:16,342
Still, if these are ritual murders
as you suggest,

323
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:22,348
all the steps have to be followed or
the killer doesn't get his happy feeling.

324
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:24,517
So why is the heart still intact?

325
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:28,354
Two possibilities.
He's not AB negative,

326
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:32,149
or it was trying to protect itself
from being found out.

327
00:23:32,692 --> 00:23:35,611
I'd go with that theory, personally.

328
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:37,530
Me too.

329
00:23:37,697 --> 00:23:40,950
Let's go talk to Piper, see if he told her
what he wanted to tell you.

330
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:43,953
You read my mind, inspector.

331
00:23:46,998 --> 00:23:51,335
And I have $400 now.
450. 450. 500. 550.

332
00:23:51,502 --> 00:23:56,006
600. 650. That's 650. $700 now.
750, up front.

333
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:59,635
That's 750 now. Say eight. $800.
The gentleman's bid at 800.

334
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:02,763
Anymore at $800? Sold. $800.

335
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,391
Number 143, for the Karastan rug.

336
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:10,312
And the next item is lot 102,
a Stickley lamp. And bidding will begin

337
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:16,360
at $2000. Now say 21. $2300.
2400. $2700. Now 2700.

338
00:24:16,527 --> 00:24:17,903
- Prue, guess what.
- Where've you been?

339
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,240
- The auction's already started.
- I think I found the little girl, Teri Lane.

340
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:25,828
- I think she's living in Oakland.
- Sold. $2900.

341
00:24:26,036 --> 00:24:27,913
I contacted
the detective's old secretary.

342
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,540
She helped me piece it together.

343
00:24:29,707 --> 00:24:33,085
She also told me that it was
the little girl's mother who hired him,

344
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:35,421
because the father had abducted Teri.

345
00:24:35,629 --> 00:24:38,090
And next is lot 103,
a gold charm bracelet.

346
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:41,009
- Bidding will begin at $375.
- Prue, you've gotta do something.

347
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:43,512
That bracelet might be the only way
to convince the mother

348
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,597
- we know where the girl is.
- What am I to do?

349
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:48,559
$375 dollars for it now. 375.

350
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:50,727
$375.

351
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:57,192
375. Anyone at $375?
$375. Anyone at 375?

352
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,697
At $375 now. Anyone at 375?

353
00:25:01,905 --> 00:25:04,866
- Anyone at $375?
- Go, girl.

354
00:25:06,618 --> 00:25:08,954
Very well, $300 then.
Anyone at 300?

355
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:17,420
Three hundred dollars then.
Last call at 300. Anyone at $300?

356
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:21,258
Very well, we'll move on to lot 104,
the pewter flagon.

357
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:24,678
- Thank you, thank you.
- You just better be right.

358
00:25:24,844 --> 00:25:28,431
At $150 now. 150. 175.

359
00:25:37,023 --> 00:25:38,650
- Hi, Andy.
- Hi.

360
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:41,569
- What are you doing here?
- Wanted to see how you're feeling.

361
00:25:41,736 --> 00:25:43,697
I feel great.

362
00:25:43,863 --> 00:25:46,783
Hey, where's your bandage?
How did your wound heal?

363
00:26:11,224 --> 00:26:12,976
- Who is it?
- It's Andy.

364
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:16,688
- Andy. Go away!
- Sorry?

365
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:23,194
- You can't come in. I've got the flu.
- It's okay. I had a flu shot.

366
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:25,822
I gotta talk to you. It's about Billy.

367
00:26:26,406 --> 00:26:29,492
- He's been killed.
- What?

368
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:34,121
That's not possible. He should've
been safe, it's not even night.

369
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:36,165
It might not have been whoever
attacked you.

370
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:40,211
- Who else could it have been?
- Sorry, had to make a call.

371
00:26:42,004 --> 00:26:46,133
- Are you okay?
- No, I don't feel so well.

372
00:26:46,842 --> 00:26:48,469
Maybe we should come back later.

373
00:26:48,636 --> 00:26:51,013
Just a few questions,
if you don't mind.

374
00:26:51,222 --> 00:26:56,227
We were wondering if you knew what
exactly Billy was coming to tell me.

375
00:26:56,811 --> 00:26:59,105
Just that the creature is called
a Wendigo.

376
00:26:59,271 --> 00:27:01,524
And that it attacks during
the full moon.

377
00:27:01,941 --> 00:27:03,400
Yeah, we know that.

378
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:08,322
He also said that it looks like
a normal person during the day.

379
00:27:09,156 --> 00:27:13,744
Really? That's new. Did he have
any idea who it might be?

380
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:18,541
- I don't think so.
- Too bad.

381
00:27:19,124 --> 00:27:21,252
How's the arm?

382
00:27:22,086 --> 00:27:24,338
It's fine. Well, it hurts like hell.

383
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:26,256
May I?

384
00:27:28,008 --> 00:27:30,678
You're the only one to survive
one of these attacks.

385
00:27:30,844 --> 00:27:33,722
Hope you didn't get infected by it.

386
00:27:36,517 --> 00:27:42,106
If you think of anything,
anything at all, call me directly.

387
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:51,365
Try and get some sleep.

388
00:27:51,532 --> 00:27:53,534
I will. Thanks.

389
00:28:34,699 --> 00:28:36,284
Yes?

390
00:28:36,451 --> 00:28:39,287
- Are you Harriet Lane?
- Who are you?

391
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:42,248
We've never met.
I work at an auction house.

392
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:45,210
Actually, I just started today.
My sister got me the job.

393
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:49,255
Well, anyway, I sort of
found something,

394
00:28:49,422 --> 00:28:52,592
and I was wondering if you
might recognise it.

395
00:29:03,436 --> 00:29:06,397
- I've never seen it before.
- Are you sure?

396
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:14,614
Hi. I don't mean to intrude, and I know
that this must be hard for you,

397
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:17,492
but I know that you recognise
this bracelet.

398
00:29:18,326 --> 00:29:20,203
It was your daughter's, wasn't it?

399
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:22,997
Why are you asking me all these
questions?

400
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:24,540
Why are you doing this to me?

401
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:28,586
Your daughter, what's her name?

402
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:30,671
Teri.

403
00:29:31,714 --> 00:29:32,882
Teri Lane.

404
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,552
Do you know where she is?

405
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:44,936
Teri?

406
00:29:46,354 --> 00:29:48,689
Oh, my goodness.

407
00:29:50,816 --> 00:29:54,445
- Teri. Teri, my baby.
- Mama.

408
00:29:54,612 --> 00:29:56,864
Oh, Teri, Teri, Teri.

409
00:29:58,282 --> 00:29:59,992
I never thought I'd see you again.

410
00:30:02,995 --> 00:30:06,624
- It's okay, mama. I'm home now.
- Let me look at you.

411
00:30:09,627 --> 00:30:12,671
I guess that bracelet was worth more
than I thought it was.

412
00:30:12,838 --> 00:30:15,466
Are you kidding? It's priceless.

413
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:18,719
Thank God for my powers.

414
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,098
It wasn't just your powers
that did that, Pheebs.

415
00:30:29,104 --> 00:30:31,023
Hello?

416
00:30:32,191 --> 00:30:34,151
Piper, you sound terrible.
What's wrong?

417
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:39,698
Sure hope Piper's gonna be okay.
She didn't look very well.

418
00:30:39,865 --> 00:30:41,867
I know.

419
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:45,913
Both Piper and the first victim were
attacked at the far end of those trees.

420
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:49,082
Must have hidden in that stretch
of woods, waited to attack.

421
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:51,502
Want to get a closer look?

422
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:54,254
Absolutely.

423
00:30:54,463 --> 00:30:56,215
You better turn your cell phone off too.

424
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:59,092
Wouldn't want it to ring
and scare it away.

425
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:02,721
This is a nice spot.
How did you find this place?

426
00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:05,807
You and Piper's sister
spend some time here?

427
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:08,894
No, Prue runs more to the highbrow.

428
00:31:09,061 --> 00:31:11,271
Her loss.

429
00:31:11,855 --> 00:31:13,982
I take it you're not married.

430
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:17,152
Do you see a ring on my finger?

431
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:22,282
I was engaged once.
He was my world.

432
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:25,660
Totally my world.

433
00:31:26,203 --> 00:31:29,247
Then one day, boom,
the empty dresser.

434
00:31:29,414 --> 00:31:32,334
The one-word note, "Sorry."

435
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:36,254
I started falling. I kept falling.

436
00:31:36,421 --> 00:31:38,757
- Yeah, I know how that is.
- No, you don't.

437
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:43,970
But I took steps.

438
00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:46,556
I did what I needed to make
myself strong.

439
00:31:47,641 --> 00:31:51,728
To make it so no one could ever
hurt me like that again.

440
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:55,106
Love to know how you do that.

441
00:31:57,525 --> 00:31:59,027
Maybe I'll show you,

442
00:31:59,694 --> 00:32:01,780
if you're lucky.

443
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:05,450
But now my life's a lot less
complicated.

444
00:32:05,617 --> 00:32:07,452
All I'm interested in is sex.

445
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,789
Does that shock you?

446
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,709
No.

447
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:17,921
Just wondering where you were
when I was in college, that's all.

448
00:32:27,096 --> 00:32:29,265
Piper?

449
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:36,564
Piper.

450
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:38,274
I'm miserable.

451
00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:43,863
- It's okay, honey. It's okay.
- No. No, it's not.

452
00:32:45,448 --> 00:32:47,200
Prue.

453
00:32:48,743 --> 00:32:50,995
- Okay, can you get up?
- Back off!

454
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:54,040
What do you think, I can't walk now?

455
00:32:55,249 --> 00:33:00,880
- Honey, we're just trying to help you.
- Help me? You can't even hold a job.

456
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:04,300
- Okay, now wait a minute, Piper.
- Oh, save it.

457
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:06,385
Do you always have to be in charge?

458
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:13,476
I'm so sorry.

459
00:33:14,185 --> 00:33:15,853
What's happening to me?

460
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:21,025
It's all right. Okay, we're gonna
take care of you.

461
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:34,663
- What?
- What?

462
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:39,293
I just saw who the Wendigo is.
Agent Fallon.

463
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:42,963
- Her? I thought it had to be a him.
- I guess not.

464
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,926
And even worse, I saw her and Andy
at the park at night. Alone.

465
00:33:48,135 --> 00:33:51,680
Okay, I'm gonna call him
and warn him. You go upstairs

466
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:54,558
<i>to the Book of Shadows and see
if you can find a way to help Piper.</i>

467
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,060
Okay.

468
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:04,610
Nothing. This is just the same crap
I've already seen.

469
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,987
I tried Andy's cell phone, no answer.

470
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:09,656
We can't find anything about reversing
the Wendigo thing.

471
00:34:09,865 --> 00:34:12,701
Well, there's got to be something.

472
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:18,165
Oh, didn't you check this at the bottom
of the page? "c.f. Desiderata."

473
00:34:18,332 --> 00:34:20,417
Yeah, like we're supposed to know
what that means.

474
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:22,711
Well, it means
"conferred desiderata."

475
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:25,922
It's Latin for "look up things
that are yearned for."

476
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:28,175
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're so very smart.

477
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:31,136
- Piper.
- Don't Piper me. Just shut up!

478
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:35,891
No. You are going to listen to me.
This is not you.

479
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:39,102
All right, it's the blood of the Wendigo,
and you have to fight it.

480
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:43,857
It's so strong.

481
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:45,567
You're stronger.

482
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:47,485
Fight it, Piper.

483
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:50,905
I'm okay.

484
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,200
All right.

485
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:57,579
"Things that are yearned for...

486
00:34:57,787 --> 00:35:02,625
Wisdom, balance, unbecoming."

487
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:05,253
That's got to be it.

488
00:35:07,046 --> 00:35:09,924
All right, unbecoming a Wendigo.

489
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:16,890
So we have to kill the Wendigo that
slashed you by melting its heart of ice.

490
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:19,392
- What if you can't find her?
- We'll find her.

491
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:21,394
She's gonna be in the park tonight.

492
00:35:21,603 --> 00:35:24,522
But what if you're wrong? What if
you don't? Then you'll have to...

493
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:28,151
- Then you'll have to kill me.
- Don't be ridiculous. We won't kill you.

494
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,403
We're gonna kill the thing
that did this to you.

495
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:34,532
But we might have to confine you
until we get back.

496
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:38,327
- So tie you down, I guess.
- No! Go to hell!

497
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,705
Do we have any chains?

498
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:44,459
- I actually do think I have something.
- Okay.

499
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:50,173
- Are you back?
- I don't want this to happen to me.

500
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:54,218
Kill Ashley. This is me talking.

501
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:56,262
Okay.

502
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,639
Here.

503
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:01,642
Where did you get the...?

504
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:04,186
- Never mind.
- Let's just do this.

505
00:36:04,353 --> 00:36:06,564
All right. Over here.

506
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,277
We still need to take a trip
to the Army Navy Store.

507
00:36:11,444 --> 00:36:14,071
- Why?
- To get a flare gun.

508
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:16,615
Screw you, bitch!

509
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:22,204
- Okay, I think we need to hurry.
- Yeah, just hang in there, Piper.

510
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,337
What's the matter?

511
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:34,008
I was just thinking how
I'm probably not the best cop

512
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:39,930
to be on this stakeout with,
seeing as how I'm AB negative.

513
00:36:40,472 --> 00:36:42,641
Don't worry.

514
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,769
I'll protect you.

515
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:40,824
- Andy, doing okay?
- Little on edge.

516
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,502
Instinct of the hunt.

517
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:58,091
That's why you're here.
That's why you're a cop.

518
00:37:58,466 --> 00:38:00,552
Does this turn you on or something,
Agent Fallon?

519
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,929
Or something.

520
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,767
Look, you're a gorgeous woman,

521
00:38:07,934 --> 00:38:10,729
but we're on this job together.
Let's just leave it at that.

522
00:38:10,895 --> 00:38:13,148
Let's not.

523
00:38:39,465 --> 00:38:41,467
If the moon is over there,
we should go that way.

524
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:43,386
- I don't see Andy's car.
- We'll find him.

525
00:38:43,553 --> 00:38:45,263
All right, let's hurry.

526
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:54,856
Andy?

527
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:00,570
Andy!

528
00:39:01,195 --> 00:39:04,240
This is definitely the place,
I recognise it from my premonition.

529
00:39:08,286 --> 00:39:09,996
Oh, God.

530
00:39:17,128 --> 00:39:19,213
Okay, give me another one.

531
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:23,926
If that didn't get Andy to come out,
he's dead already.

532
00:39:24,093 --> 00:39:27,430
He's dead when we find a body,
not before.

533
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:41,610
- Okay, how many more do we have?
- Two.

534
00:39:41,777 --> 00:39:45,322
- Two?
- That's all they had.

535
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:48,409
Wait.

536
00:39:49,326 --> 00:39:50,661
I think that's him.

537
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:59,712
Oh, God. All right, he's alive,
but she slashed him.

538
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,132
- He still has his heart?
- We must have driven her off in time.

539
00:40:15,352 --> 00:40:17,563
Last one. My turn.

540
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:21,400
This time we don't fire until I see
slobber on its face.

541
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:24,778
Okay. It's over there.

542
00:40:25,237 --> 00:40:27,656
No, wait. I think it's over here.

543
00:40:27,864 --> 00:40:29,950
No, no, no, it's right here.

544
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,246
Wait, how can it be in two places
at once?

545
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:36,248
It can't. One of them is Piper.

546
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,543
- Shoot.
- I can't, Prue.

547
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:42,003
Just shoot and pray you hit
the right one.

548
00:40:48,343 --> 00:40:51,429
Wait, Piper froze it.

549
00:40:51,638 --> 00:40:53,014
Do something. Do it!

550
00:41:33,513 --> 00:41:35,765
- Are you okay?
- I think so,

551
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:38,059
but I'm naked and freezing.

552
00:41:41,688 --> 00:41:43,773
Andy.

553
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:50,363
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

554
00:41:50,863 --> 00:41:54,534
Prue, what are you doing here?
Where's the Wendigo?

555
00:41:54,742 --> 00:41:59,288
She's gone. Easy. Lie back down.
Just lie back down.

556
00:41:59,455 --> 00:42:03,084
It's all right. I'll explain everything later.

557
00:42:13,511 --> 00:42:16,013
On the house, for saving my hide.

558
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,933
Literally, you Wendigo, you.

559
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,227
Yeah, are you okay to work?

560
00:42:21,394 --> 00:42:24,605
Yeah, I'm fine. It's like nothing
ever happened.

561
00:42:24,772 --> 00:42:26,190
Except for Billy.

562
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:28,943
There was no way that you could've
known about Agent Fallon.

563
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:33,405
I know. It's just I'm not used to losing
an innocent we're supposed to protect.

564
00:42:33,614 --> 00:42:36,158
He wanted to help stop her
so she couldn't hurt anybody else.

565
00:42:36,325 --> 00:42:37,868
And that's exactly what he did.

566
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:40,496
I'm just grateful that you're safe.

567
00:42:40,663 --> 00:42:42,498
And Andy.

568
00:42:42,665 --> 00:42:45,793
By the way, what did you tell him
about why we were all there?

569
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:48,629
- I told him the truth.
- Get out.

570
00:42:48,837 --> 00:42:52,049
I did. I said that what he saw
happened was true.

571
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:54,760
That Agent Fallon really was
the Wendigo.

572
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:56,762
And that had we not vanquished her,

573
00:42:56,929 --> 00:42:59,348
that both he and Piper
would've been killed.

574
00:42:59,515 --> 00:43:01,642
I couldn't think of anything else to say.

575
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:03,644
Well, what did he say?

576
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:06,438
Not much. He was either
too stunned to speak,

577
00:43:06,605 --> 00:43:10,359
or he actually believed me
on some level.

578
00:43:10,526 --> 00:43:13,987
It was the closest that we've ever come
to having an honest conversation.

579
00:43:14,196 --> 00:43:17,282
So maybe Andy's more open to
your being a witch than you think.

580
00:43:18,867 --> 00:43:20,327
All right, back to work?

581
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:25,749
Actually, I need to talk to you about
something. And please don't be mad,

582
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:27,751
- but I quit.
- What?

583
00:43:28,794 --> 00:43:32,255
It's not that I don't appreciate
the opportunity, because I do.

584
00:43:32,422 --> 00:43:35,967
It's just that every time I touch
something at Buckland's,

585
00:43:36,134 --> 00:43:40,097
I risk having a premonition,
and it's just too emotional for me.

586
00:43:40,806 --> 00:43:45,811
Besides, that's your world.
I need to find one of my own.

587
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:47,813
You will.

588
00:43:48,772 --> 00:43:51,525
Just stay out of my world,
or I'll kill you.

589
00:43:57,822 --> 00:44:00,492
Just kidding. It's a joke.
