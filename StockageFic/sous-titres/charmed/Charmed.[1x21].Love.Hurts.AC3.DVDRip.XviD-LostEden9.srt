1
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,025
Ow, damn it!

2
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,444
It's all right, Daisy.

3
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:31,823
Oh, Leo, thank God it's you.
I have been so scared.

4
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,660
Look, you just have to stay strong
a little longer and then you'll be safe.

5
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:39,789
But he's out there, Leo.
He's going to find me.

6
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,751
I've seen what he can do,
his powers.

7
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,803
How did you do that?

8
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,307
- Who are you people?
- You just have to trust me, Daisy.

9
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,518
But why me, Leo?
I still don't understand.

10
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,604
You have a very special future
ahead of you.

11
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,106
That's why I wanted you
to come to San Francisco.

12
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,442
I have powerful friends here
who can help you.

13
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,737
- Leo, what if Alec finds me first?
- He won't be able to.

14
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,865
- I've made you invisible to him.
- Hello, Leo.

15
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,700
Been looking all over for you.

16
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,828
I figured you can only be here
for one reason.

17
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:23,374
Where are you, Daisy?
I know you're close by.

18
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:27,128
It's okay, Daisy, he can't see you.
Don't say a word, just leave quickly.

19
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,380
Don't listen to him, sweetie.
Don't do it.

20
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,303
- She's already gone, Alec.
- I love her, Leo.

21
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,724
Much like you love your little witch.
What's her name? Piper.

22
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,059
Darklighters aren't capable
of love, Alec.

23
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:43,686
This one is.

24
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,607
I love Daisy,
and you are keeping me from her.

25
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,108
It was only a couple of days ago,

26
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,527
all I had to do was think about her,
then bang,

27
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,446
I'd be there with her, right there.

28
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:56,574
Then suddenly she vanishes
from my radar.

29
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,328
Cloaked by a whitelighter.
By you.

30
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:01,996
Well, if you know I cloaked her,

31
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,416
then you also know that you
won't find her as long as I live.

32
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:09,628
Yes. Well, I have a solution for that.

33
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:33,527
I can't believe you're wearing
your bikini on the plane.

34
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:36,697
Timesaver. We have
all of 48 hours in Cabo.

35
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:39,366
The minute we land, I'm on the beach
getting all golden brown.

36
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:41,201
I know, but you're making me
look frumpy.

37
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:43,537
It's like a sign of the apocalypse.

38
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:46,749
I practically had to beg the guy
in Accounting to lend us his condo.

39
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:50,294
There are no warlocks in sight.
Andy finally found out our big secret.

40
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,504
- I'm going to get crazy.
- It's about time.

41
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:55,048
How long have I been after you
to find some new male blood?

42
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:59,803
- Preferably tan and buff.
- With limited verbal skills.

43
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,598
- And no strings attached.
- No strings attached.

44
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:06,059
Stella, we are getting
our groove back.

45
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:11,398
So speaking of which.
Where's Piper?

46
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,943
I think Piper's gonna be in a
groove-free kind of mode for a while.

47
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,072
- Oh, she's not seriously...
- Taking a vacation from men, yep.

48
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:20,907
Afraid of falling in love again,
I think.

49
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:23,660
So while we're partying all weekend,
what is she gonna be doing?

50
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:26,079
I don't know. The last I checked,
she was in the attic

51
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:29,332
searching for a suitcase
to carry her books in.

52
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:30,792
Books? What kind of books?

53
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,420
The kind they make
into Kevin Costner movies.

54
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:36,673
Oh, no!
We've got to stop the insanity.

55
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,175
Maybe we should just let her be.

56
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:41,094
I mean, we're not the ones who
fell in love with a warlock, a ghost,

57
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,054
a geographically undesirable
handyman

58
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:46,641
- and a very dorky grad student.
- Maybe she's just in a slump.

59
00:03:46,808 --> 00:03:47,893
It happens.

60
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:52,606
All right, it happens to Piper a lot,
but celibacy is not the answer.

61
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:55,150
A couple of dates not picking up
the check, that's a slump.

62
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:57,444
This is more like a sucking void.

63
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:01,573
Prue, Phoebe.

64
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,416
Leo?

65
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:11,493
- Be careful.
- I am being careful.

66
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,537
I can't believe you knew.

67
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:16,290
The fact that our handyman,
the man I was dating

68
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:18,500
was supernatural,
just happen to slip your mind?

69
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:22,504
There was no slipping, okay. I told you,
but you didn't wanna believe me.

70
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:25,424
- Piper, I wanted...
- But you didn't.

71
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,551
Okay, we gotta...
We gotta get your legs up.

72
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:29,928
Don't worry about me.
There's someone...

73
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:32,431
- We have to get the arrow out.
- No, don't touch it.

74
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:33,890
It's tipped with poison.

75
00:06:34,057 --> 00:06:37,227
How are we supposed to pull it out
if we can't touch it?

76
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:40,021
You came to the right girl.
Here. You ready?

77
00:06:48,697 --> 00:06:50,740
Okay, I brought everything
that I could find.

78
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:53,451
I just didn't know what to use on a...
What is he again?

79
00:06:53,618 --> 00:06:55,662
- A whitelighter.
- Yeah, they're sort of like...

80
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:58,039
You know how Peter Pan
has Tinker Bell?

81
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:00,917
They're sort of like that.
Only minus the tutu and the wings.

82
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:03,920
- He guides witches.
- And future whitelighters.

83
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:07,257
- That's why I came to you.
- You should have told me.

84
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:09,968
- Well...
- I should have told you.

85
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:15,140
Oh, did that hurt? Good.

86
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:17,684
Look, there's a woman. Daisy.

87
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:19,769
You have to protect her
from the darklighter.

88
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:22,147
- A darklighter, that's what shot you?
- Yeah.

89
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:24,899
They... They seduce innocent women.

90
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:27,527
Their goal is to create evil
through reproduction.

91
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:32,156
- Great, generation 666.
- Only he broke the rules.

92
00:07:32,323 --> 00:07:35,868
He fell in love with one of his victims.
A human.

93
00:07:36,786 --> 00:07:38,454
And she loved him back.

94
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:41,040
Until she found out
who he really was, right?

95
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:43,126
Piper, you have every right
to be mad at me.

96
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:46,003
Thanks for the permission.
I'll get some more gauze.

97
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:49,882
Please, you have to find Daisy
before he does.

98
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:53,052
Otherwise she won't be able to do
the good that she's destined to,

99
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,138
and she won't be able to become
a whitelighter.

100
00:07:55,304 --> 00:07:58,224
- Okay, where is she?
- I don't know.

101
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:01,769
The last time I saw her,
she was at a mini-mart in the Castro,

102
00:08:01,936 --> 00:08:03,688
headed for her rental car.

103
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:05,940
If he finds her first,
he'll never let her go. Ever.

104
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:09,277
Any tips on how to vanquish a
darklighter in case we run into him?

105
00:08:09,443 --> 00:08:13,614
No. Just...
Just don't let him touch you.

106
00:08:13,781 --> 00:08:14,907
His power is in his hands.

107
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:17,326
And when he chooses to,
he has the touch of death.

108
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:20,997
And we have the power of three. All
right, call the airline, cancel our tickets.

109
00:08:21,163 --> 00:08:23,290
I'll call Andy, see if
he can help me locate her.

110
00:08:23,457 --> 00:08:25,042
- And Piper should...
- I'll talk to her.

111
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:28,003
- Someone's gotta stay with Leo.
- Perfect.

112
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,842
- You enjoying this as much as I am?
- What's that?

113
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:35,636
Oh, you know, the silent treatment,
the cold shoulder.

114
00:08:39,348 --> 00:08:41,934
I know. It's been a week since
Internal Affairs has made a move.

115
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:44,353
- What are they waiting for?
- I'm not talking about IA.

116
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,980
I'm talking about you and me.

117
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:48,983
- I got no problems.
- That makes one of us.

118
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:53,570
IA is on our ass, and I still don't know
why, but I'm pretty damn sure you do.

119
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:55,739
You feel like sharing?

120
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:58,992
Homicide, Trudeau.

121
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,452
<i>- Andy, hi. I...
- Hey.</i>

122
00:09:01,328 --> 00:09:04,206
Franklin. How are things
in Forensics?

123
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:05,416
You can't talk.

124
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:10,295
No, actually. Why don't you have it
checked out by the FBI lab?

125
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:14,091
Andy, I really need your help.
It's important. Quake?

126
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:18,887
Okay, I'll be there.

127
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:24,518
Franklin's wife had
a baby girl yesterday.

128
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,562
He took a week off.

129
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:29,648
He call you from the maternity ward?

130
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:41,034
You don't wanna tell me
what's going on, fine.

131
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:43,954
Just don't lie to me, okay, partner?

132
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:02,639
Andy, what's going on?

133
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:08,186
Internal Affairs is looking into
all my unsolved cases.

134
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:10,689
All the ones that involve
the supernatural.

135
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:14,734
All the cases that involve me.

136
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:17,904
Do you think that they
followed you here?

137
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,490
I wouldn't put it past them.

138
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:23,743
Andy, if we...

139
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,623
- If I put you in this situation...
- I put me here, Prue.

140
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,500
Yeah, but you had help.

141
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:36,339
- Can they force you to tell them?
- About you?

142
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:38,299
I won't.

143
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:41,386
But we have to be careful
about being seen together.

144
00:10:41,552 --> 00:10:43,680
It has to look like we're still...

145
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:45,932
...friends.

146
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:49,185
Andy, we are still friends.

147
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:50,728
We always will be.

148
00:10:53,022 --> 00:10:55,775
You sure I'm not just someone
who's keeping your secret, Prue?

149
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,278
You know me better than that.

150
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:05,660
I'm glad I told you.

151
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:07,245
I am.

152
00:11:08,704 --> 00:11:10,581
So am I.

153
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:13,459
Now when you need me,
all you have to do is ask.

154
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:15,836
Well, I am asking.

155
00:11:16,003 --> 00:11:17,630
I need to find someone.

156
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:21,133
She's in danger, and I have
to get to her before he does.

157
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,885
He?

158
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:25,429
You know what?
I don't need to know.

159
00:11:25,596 --> 00:11:28,432
Specifics always get me into trouble.

160
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,518
Where was the last place
she was seen?

161
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:33,270
Headed to her rental car
outside a mini-mart.

162
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:37,858
Well, we can get the security cameras
from the mini-mart

163
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,318
and surrounding businesses.

164
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:41,237
See if we can get
the car's license plates

165
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:43,697
and see if it leads us
to where she's staying.

166
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:46,700
Thanks.

167
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:55,584
Leo, I brought you some food
in case you're... You do eat, right?

168
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:57,753
Yes, Phoebe, I eat.

169
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,090
- How's Piper?
- Oh, you know, she's dealing.

170
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:05,344
I mean, it's not every day that you find
out the guy you're seeing isn't human.

171
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:07,805
Although in Piper's case...

172
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:11,475
I wish she didn't have
to find out about me like this.

173
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:15,771
Being with her broke the rules,
but not being with her breaks my heart.

174
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:21,026
You know, Leo, it's not like we rushed
to tell you that we're witches.

175
00:12:21,193 --> 00:12:25,739
I think Piper understands about those
little secrets that we have to keep.

176
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:30,327
- Any word on Daisy?
- Yes and no.

177
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:34,498
Prue called. Andy thinks he found out
where Daisy's staying.

178
00:12:34,665 --> 00:12:37,000
They're on their way there now.

179
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,088
I'm sorry, I "m sorry.

180
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:49,137
It's okay. I know it's bad.

181
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:53,642
I guess I need to work
on my poker face a little bit, huh?

182
00:12:56,102 --> 00:13:00,315
You know, Leo, didn't you tell me that
whitelighters had the ability to heal?

183
00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:03,401
- Why can't you just...?
- No. My power is for others.

184
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:06,154
I can't use it on myself.

185
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:19,834
You know, we just...
We just gotta get you better.

186
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:22,962
Then you and Piper will have
lots of time to talk about stuff

187
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:26,633
- when you're well.
- Phoebe, I'm not gonna get better.

188
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:29,385
That's ridiculous, Leo.
Of course you will.

189
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:31,763
<i>We just have to find something
in the Book of Shadows...</i>

190
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,517
No, the darklighter's poison
can't be reversed.

191
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:42,023
It's meant to kill whitelighters.
That's what it's doing.

192
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,984
It's working its way
through my system.

193
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:49,280
It's just a matter of time.

194
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:51,824
How much time?

195
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:54,494
Not much.

196
00:13:57,205 --> 00:13:59,707
I'm gonna die, and there's nothing
you can do about it.

197
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:08,132
My power is ebbing, and with it,
my ability to cloak Daisy.

198
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:16,557
We're gonna save you both, Leo.

199
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:31,572
I have looked everywhere
in this damn book for something,

200
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:34,784
anything to help Leo, and I can't...

201
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:38,370
What's that face?
What's the matter?

202
00:14:39,914 --> 00:14:42,291
Leo's in pretty bad shape, Piper.

203
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,878
And he's getting worse.

204
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:49,465
I know, that's why I need to find
an ointment or a cure or something...

205
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:52,176
Okay, you need to listen.

206
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,767
This is really hard to say...

207
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:03,187
...but I think you need to hear it.

208
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:09,318
I think that you need to learn
to accept the possibility that...

209
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:14,364
...maybe we're not supposed
to save Leo.

210
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:18,327
Maybe he's not our innocent.

211
00:15:18,911 --> 00:15:23,290
Maybe we're only meant
to save Daisy.

212
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:33,300
We have to save him,
whether we're meant to or not.

213
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,738
I got you your favourite.

214
00:15:56,072 --> 00:15:58,116
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

215
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,162
I've missed this. Us.

216
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:07,459
There is no us, Alec.
Please, stop.

217
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:08,877
Never.

218
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:12,130
You're the one, Daisy.
You're mine.

219
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:15,091
Indian summer.
Do you remember that, Daisy?

220
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:18,261
When it got so hot in the city
you could barely breathe,

221
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:19,971
and we sat out on your fire escape

222
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:23,641
taking turns rubbing ice cubes
down each other's necks

223
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,101
- and backs.
- Stop!

224
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:27,645
That's when you first said
you loved me.

225
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:30,315
"Forever, Alec.
I'll love you forever."

226
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:37,071
Now, is that any way to treat
the man who loves you?

227
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:40,116
You're not a man.
You're not even human.

228
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:43,995
Don't make me regret telling you
who I really am.

229
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:45,997
Don't you get it, Daisy?

230
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:49,167
I love you.

231
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:51,836
And now no one can stop us
from being together.

232
00:16:52,003 --> 00:16:53,713
Think about it.

233
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,842
I found you.
What do you think that means?

234
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:00,011
Yeah, that's right.

235
00:17:00,178 --> 00:17:03,139
I've clipped Leo's wings,
and soon he'll be gone.

236
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:06,309
So I can find you whenever I want.

237
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:09,520
Hello? Manager.
Everything okay in there?

238
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:10,980
I win.

239
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,694
No. You only win if I come willingly,
and I never will.

240
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,613
Then I'll never go away.

241
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:20,489
Hey, I'm coming in.

242
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:22,575
No! Don't!

243
00:17:22,783 --> 00:17:24,410
I thought I heard...

244
00:17:25,453 --> 00:17:27,455
Nobody can keep us
apart now, Daisy.

245
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:29,582
Please, stop!

246
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:43,179
- You can't run from me!
- Daisy!

247
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:58,986
What the hell was that?

248
00:17:59,153 --> 00:18:01,322
Welcome to my world.

249
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,245
Hey, Prue's home. She just...

250
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:10,372
<i>"What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine</i>

251
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:14,293
<i>- Let our powers cross the line"
- I hear rhyming.</i>

252
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,463
- What are you doing?
- Everything I can.

253
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:21,341
Look, we know Leo can't heal himself,
but maybe with his powers, I can.

254
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:24,011
- What are you talking about?
- It's a power-switching spell.

255
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:25,512
If Leo and I exchange powers,

256
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,015
then I'll have the healing touch
and maybe I can fix him.

257
00:18:28,182 --> 00:18:31,185
- Hey, what's going on?
- You know, the usual.

258
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:33,145
Made some coffee,
read the newspaper,

259
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,231
walked in on Piper switching powers
with Leo, you know.

260
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:38,233
I have to save him, Prue.

261
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:41,069
Okay. Is it safe?

262
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:44,239
To tell you the truth, I don't really care.
He's slipping away.

263
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:47,159
And if either one of you has
a better idea, then I'm all ears.

264
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,161
If not, then I'm casting the spell.

265
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:52,039
And I'd like to do it
with the support of my sisters.

266
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:54,458
Cast away.

267
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:00,881
<i>"What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine</i>

268
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:02,674
<i>Let our powers cross the line</i>

269
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,052
<i>I offer up my gift to share
Switch the powers through the air"</i>

270
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,974
- Did it work?
- I don't know.

271
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:20,650
- I can't freeze.
- This is a good sign.

272
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:23,653
The spell must've worked.
Okay, that means Phoebe and I...

273
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:32,954
Oh, I think I just had one of Phoebe's
premonition thingies.

274
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,166
Really? What did you see?

275
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,127
That shattering.

276
00:19:40,336 --> 00:19:42,088
Kit, no!

277
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:46,676
Did I just do that?

278
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:49,637
And I saw it. So...

279
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:53,224
Okay, you're moving things,
I'm having premonitions

280
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:55,935
and Piper can't freeze anymore,
which means...

281
00:19:56,102 --> 00:19:57,979
Am I gonna get yelled at?

282
00:19:58,146 --> 00:20:03,026
<i>- It switched all of our powers?
- It's a supernatural Freaky Friday.</i>

283
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:05,069
You know what,
I'm gonna go get that,

284
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:10,324
and I'm sure you guys will have all of
this worked out by the time I get back.

285
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,747
Okay, I can do this.

286
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,791
Now heal.

287
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:22,211
Come on, heal.
Why aren't these working?

288
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:24,839
Okay, okay, okay. Piper, relax.

289
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,966
Remember when we first got
our own powers,

290
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:29,343
it took us a while to figure out
how to trigger them.

291
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,304
I'm doing what I always do.

292
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,766
Yes, but maybe you have
to find his trigger, not yours.

293
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,893
Hey, that was Andy.

294
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,646
A new charge came up
on Daisy's credit card report.

295
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:43,232
She bought a bus ticket
20 minutes ago. She's running again.

296
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:46,444
If she leaves town, we'll never
be able to find her. Let's go.

297
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,195
Wait. We have to switch
our powers back.

298
00:20:48,362 --> 00:20:51,699
- Not until I heal Leo.
- Piper, we have to go get Daisy.

299
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:54,493
And I have to heal him.
I'm not losing him again.

300
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:57,955
Okay, you know what, you stay here.

301
00:20:58,122 --> 00:21:00,708
We have to find Daisy
before the darklighter does.

302
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,253
We'll just have to do it using
each other's powers. Come on.

303
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,757
You wanted to see me?

304
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:11,010
Sit down.

305
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:18,600
You make a habit out of showing up
at the scene

306
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:20,352
before the crime is reported,
inspector?

307
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:22,479
I don't know what you're talking about.

308
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:26,817
Motel Capri. No one called
the manager's murder in, Trudeau.

309
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:28,485
Not until you did.

310
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:31,864
- I got a tip.
- You're lying.

311
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:38,954
Witnesses place you
at the scene with a woman.

312
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:43,041
Five-three or four,
brunette, attractive.

313
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,252
Ring any bells?

314
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:46,545
Last time I checked,

315
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:49,840
I didn't have to reveal
my informants to you, Rodriguez.

316
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:51,717
Maybe not in a court of law,

317
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:54,011
but last time I checked,
we weren't in one.

318
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,099
This is an IA investigation.
You don't have the same rights.

319
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:04,521
You have no idea
how much I can hurt you.

320
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:11,194
Just tell us who you're
covering for, inspector.

321
00:22:31,214 --> 00:22:32,298
Screw you.

322
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:49,023
Excuse me,
where can I find bus 24?

323
00:22:50,108 --> 00:22:52,110
I told you, I'll always be there
for you, Daisy.

324
00:22:58,032 --> 00:22:59,784
- I'm sorry.
- It's quite all right.

325
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:05,498
I'm in no hurry. I've got forever.
You care to join me?

326
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,340
- Okay, are you trying to piss me off?
- That's exactly what I'm trying to do.

327
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:16,217
- Only it's not working.
- How do you know?

328
00:23:16,384 --> 00:23:18,469
Because I don't see anything
flying across the room.

329
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:20,513
You're gonna need to know
how to use my power

330
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,473
in case the darklighter
shows up, remember?

331
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,976
When I first got my power,
it was anger that triggered it,

332
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:28,938
- so I need to push your buttons.
- Okay, it's not so easy to break me.

333
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:31,649
What was it in high school
that the guys started calling you

334
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:34,068
after they caught you making out
with someone under the bleachers?

335
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:36,696
- Not gonna work.
- What was that?

336
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:39,407
Oh, yeah, "Freebie."

337
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:43,995
Well, class is over.

338
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:48,124
You know that was just
a rumour, right?

339
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:54,964
Okay, now it's your turn.
We need a premonition.

340
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:56,424
- Where's Daisy?
- Do I have to?

341
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,052
The last time I got all woozy and...

342
00:24:01,595 --> 00:24:03,430
Okay, you know,
you guys take for granted

343
00:24:03,597 --> 00:24:07,268
that I'm your Innocent Yellow Pages.
Okay, this takes work.

344
00:24:07,434 --> 00:24:10,020
It is useless, all right.
I am never going to get...

345
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:18,153
- Do your ears ring when you do that?
- What did you see?

346
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,031
I can't be sure,
because it went by so fast,

347
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:23,575
but if I were playing odds,
I would say that it was Daisy.

348
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:26,203
- Where is she?
- Bathroom.

349
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:30,082
Okay.

350
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:33,460
I'm gonna be okay.
I can handle this.

351
00:24:37,714 --> 00:24:42,010
- You can't run from me, Daisy.
- Why won't you leave me alone?

352
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:45,764
Because we can be happy together.
We were once, remember?

353
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,684
All you have to do
is come with me willingly.

354
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:52,396
And what? Watch while you kill
more innocent people.

355
00:24:52,563 --> 00:24:54,314
You made me do that.

356
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:57,484
That man would still be alive
if you had just come with me.

357
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:01,196
That's all I ask,
and the killing will stop.

358
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:04,241
We can have eternity together.

359
00:25:12,582 --> 00:25:15,961
- I believe this is the ladies' room.
- And this is a private conversation.

360
00:25:19,297 --> 00:25:20,799
Phoebe!

361
00:25:22,717 --> 00:25:24,135
Oops.

362
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:27,013
Okay, now would be a very good time
to get angry.

363
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,015
I've never used this
on a witch before.

364
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:32,727
Oh, Grandma's car, fender dented.
You got blamed for it. I did it.

365
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:38,692
I got grounded for that, Prue.

366
00:25:42,946 --> 00:25:44,864
I've never used this
on a darklighter before.

367
00:25:50,078 --> 00:25:52,080
Oh, God. Is he...?

368
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:55,250
Daisy. Leo sent us.
We have to take you to him.

369
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:58,044
Come on, it's okay.

370
00:26:10,223 --> 00:26:14,435
Oh, God, please work.
Come on, work.

371
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:22,777
- When I die...
- You're not gonna die.

372
00:26:23,111 --> 00:26:25,321
When it happens...

373
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:31,452
...know this is where
I want to be.

374
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:40,002
I love you.

375
00:26:50,554 --> 00:26:52,765
Oh, God. He found me again.

376
00:26:52,932 --> 00:26:54,642
- How do you know?
- That's what he does.

377
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:58,229
He sends me flowers
so I know he's watching.

378
00:26:59,814 --> 00:27:01,524
No, honey, these are for Prue.

379
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:05,194
They're from Andy.
He needs to see me right away.

380
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:07,196
Something wrong with his phone?

381
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:09,865
It's a long story,
but I can't leave you guys.

382
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:12,868
No, Prue, we'll go up
and check on Leo,

383
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:16,247
and, you know, remember, I'm the one
with the active power now. Go.

384
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:18,666
- Are you sure?
- Yes, absolutely. We'll be fine.

385
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:23,379
Let's go check on Leo.

386
00:27:25,756 --> 00:27:27,591
Piper, we found Daisy and...

387
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:32,346
I tried.

388
00:27:37,726 --> 00:27:39,603
He's gone.

389
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:56,787
Daisy, I really don't think this is
the best time for you to be alone.

390
00:27:56,954 --> 00:28:01,083
Without Leo, it's just a matter of time
before Alec finds me again.

391
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:03,502
- I have to get away.
- No.

392
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:05,879
My sisters and I
can take care of Alec.

393
00:28:06,046 --> 00:28:10,717
I don't want you to try. Too many
people are dead now because of me.

394
00:28:10,884 --> 00:28:14,054
- And now Leo.
- Honey, that's not your fault.

395
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:15,514
It doesn't matter.

396
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,268
When Alec finds me again, he's not
gonna let you get in the way either.

397
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,356
It's better off that I leave.
Trust me. I have to go.

398
00:28:24,523 --> 00:28:26,566
Don't you dare.

399
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,612
Leo gave up his life
to bring you here.

400
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:34,032
If you leave,
Alec will find you for sure,

401
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:37,077
and Leo's death will mean nothing.

402
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,080
You're not going anywhere.

403
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:53,635
So I take it we're not here for the
same reason we used in high school.

404
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:55,970
Unfortunately, no.

405
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:58,723
Makes me kind of wish
for the good old days.

406
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,267
Yeah, we tried that already.

407
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:03,478
Prue, I did everything I could

408
00:29:03,645 --> 00:29:06,689
to keep Internal Affairs
from finding out about you,

409
00:29:06,856 --> 00:29:08,733
but there's not much more
I can do after today.

410
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,068
Why? What happened?

411
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,154
I wouldn't tell them
what they wanted to know.

412
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:16,157
I turned in my shield.
Automatic suspension.

413
00:29:17,408 --> 00:29:20,578
I gotta hand it to Rodriguez,
he's a pit bull.

414
00:29:20,745 --> 00:29:22,914
But when he connects you
to all those unsolved cases,

415
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:25,041
he's gonna put the heat on you
to get to me.

416
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,043
And unless you're careful,

417
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,213
he's gonna figure out that it's you
and your sisters that he really wants.

418
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:33,841
Wait, you just got suspended and
you're telling me to watch my back?

419
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:37,637
Until IA's off my case, it's better
if we're not even seen together.

420
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,224
You don't want them to connect
the dots, believe me.

421
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,144
I can't believe
that you're worried about me

422
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:48,481
when you're about to lose everything
you ever worked for.

423
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,404
Every one of those unsolved cases
that Rodriguez is tracking down...

424
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,742
...is an innocent life that you
and your sisters helped to save.

425
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:02,870
What you're doing
is the reason I became a cop.

426
00:30:03,913 --> 00:30:06,207
I guess that's how I do it.

427
00:30:08,751 --> 00:30:11,712
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

428
00:30:12,588 --> 00:30:14,799
Everything happens for a reason.

429
00:30:14,965 --> 00:30:16,759
Remember, you taught me that?

430
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,350
Thanks.

431
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:32,483
Take care, Prue.

432
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:45,829
I thought you might like to talk.

433
00:30:47,873 --> 00:30:51,543
He could have stayed with us.
He could have fought harder.

434
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:55,214
He was in pain. He had to let go.

435
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,633
He didn't have to.
Our magic's never failed before.

436
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,760
I cast the spell.
I took his power.

437
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:03,472
All he had to do was show me
how to do it, and he never did.

438
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:08,518
- How can you be mad at him?
- Because it should have worked.

439
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:13,649
Prue's having premonitions, and
you figured out how to use her power.

440
00:31:13,815 --> 00:31:17,361
Why couldn't I find the trigger?
Why couldn't he just tell me?

441
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:20,113
Give me his power?

442
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:27,871
He wanted to live.

443
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:32,375
He didn't want to leave you.

444
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:40,717
It's hard to lose someone you love.

445
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:03,114
I love you, Leo.

446
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,641
I found it.

447
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:34,437
Leo, I love you.
Can you hear me?

448
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:36,689
I love you, Leo. Please hear me.

449
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,954
- Piper!
- Oh, thank God.

450
00:32:52,997 --> 00:32:57,168
I tried so hard,
and I couldn't make it work before.

451
00:32:57,335 --> 00:33:01,130
- Why didn't you tell me?
- That love was the trigger?

452
00:33:01,297 --> 00:33:04,091
You had to find that out
on your own.

453
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:07,094
Why couldn't you tell me?

454
00:33:07,261 --> 00:33:11,682
I don't know. I was afraid. I was afraid
if I admitted how I really felt

455
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:13,559
that I would hurt more
if I lost you.

456
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:16,479
I'm so sorry.
I should have said it before.

457
00:33:17,855 --> 00:33:19,565
It's better late than never.

458
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:35,164
- Leo? Oh, my God. How did you...?
- There's no time to explain.

459
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:37,791
You've been out of the cloak
too long. Alec can find her.

460
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,627
Where's Prue?
We need to get her back here

461
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:42,421
and we need to find a spell
to vanquish darklighter.

462
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:43,797
A power-of-three spell.

463
00:33:43,964 --> 00:33:46,467
Okay, I think she has
her cell phone on her.

464
00:33:48,177 --> 00:33:49,344
No!

465
00:33:51,722 --> 00:33:54,475
- All right, no more tricks, ladies.
- Let her go, Alec.

466
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:58,312
I don't think so. I have what you love,
you've got what I love.

467
00:33:58,479 --> 00:34:01,565
Care to trade? Don't do that.

468
00:34:01,732 --> 00:34:03,275
I will kill her if I have to.

469
00:34:03,817 --> 00:34:06,320
You still think I'm incapable
of love, Leo?

470
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:08,155
You want to see how far
I'm willing to go?

471
00:34:08,322 --> 00:34:10,741
- Alec, no!
- Daisy, stay back.

472
00:34:10,908 --> 00:34:12,534
You shut up!

473
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,165
- No!
- Phoebe, stop him.

474
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:35,056
I can't do it.

475
00:34:35,432 --> 00:34:36,933
Yes, you can.

476
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,312
You have every one of my powers,
including the power to find Daisy.

477
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:43,481
Leo, wouldn't it be faster for you guys
just to switch your powers back?

478
00:34:43,773 --> 00:34:45,942
No, I'm still too weak.

479
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:47,444
It's up to Piper.

480
00:34:48,778 --> 00:34:50,530
Now trust me, Piper.

481
00:34:51,031 --> 00:34:53,325
Okay, look deep inside yourself...

482
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,369
...at peace...

483
00:34:57,287 --> 00:34:59,247
...a place where you find love.

484
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:04,377
- Wait, I can hear her.
- All right, listen to her.

485
00:35:04,544 --> 00:35:05,879
Let her tell you where she is.

486
00:35:07,046 --> 00:35:12,802
She's screaming. She's afraid.
He's pushing her past some trees.

487
00:35:13,386 --> 00:35:16,681
Can you recognize the place?
Can you tell where they're at?

488
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,476
- Heroes Grove. Golden Gate Park.
- Let's go.

489
00:35:22,061 --> 00:35:25,648
- What about Leo?
- I'm fine. Save Daisy.

490
00:35:25,815 --> 00:35:29,193
Piper, we really sort of need
the power of three to do this.

491
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,738
Actually, I don't think we do.

492
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:36,701
I think there's a better way. Piper, you
stay with Leo. Prue, you drive. I'll talk.

493
00:35:39,662 --> 00:35:40,955
Why are you taking me here?

494
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:43,750
You could have been
my mate, Daisy. My equal.

495
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:44,959
I don't understand.

496
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:46,961
Now you've made this place
your deathbed.

497
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:49,046
It's your own fault
that you won't live.

498
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,507
No, Alec, please don't kill me.

499
00:35:51,674 --> 00:35:54,594
- If you ever loved me...
- If I ever loved you what?

500
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,514
You think I could just get over you?
Move on? Find somebody else?

501
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:03,561
You're the only woman
I've ever loved, Daisy.

502
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:07,023
And now I'm the last man
that you'll ever leave.

503
00:36:08,691 --> 00:36:10,401
Let her go!

504
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,320
- She's mine!
- You son of a...

505
00:36:15,531 --> 00:36:16,824
Do it, Prue. Now!

506
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:19,243
<i>What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine</i>

507
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,786
<i>Let our powers cross the line</i>

508
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:23,581
You really should have
stayed out of this.

509
00:36:25,124 --> 00:36:28,627
<i>I offer up this gift to share
Switch our powers through the air.</i>

510
00:36:31,297 --> 00:36:32,464
What?

511
00:36:34,341 --> 00:36:36,427
Where's my power?

512
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:42,141
- It's hate. Hate is his trigger.
- Then hate him.

513
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:44,810
No problem.

514
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,896
Bring him to me, Phoebe.

515
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,037
<i>What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine</i>

516
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:05,998
<i>Let our powers cross the line</i>

517
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:15,382
He's gone.

518
00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:17,384
You did it.

519
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:20,887
Are you okay?

520
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:25,434
I can't believe
how much hate that took.

521
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:28,145
I never want to feel like that again.

522
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:31,690
You just gave me my life back.

523
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:39,364
Now when we get home, you're gonna
give me my power back, right?

524
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:46,162
I almost wish I didn't give you
your powers back,

525
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:48,623
then you wouldn't be able to leave.

526
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:50,834
Me too.

527
00:37:53,211 --> 00:37:55,755
So if Daisy's a whitelighter to be,

528
00:37:55,922 --> 00:37:58,633
doesn't that mean
that you used to be...?

529
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,677
Human?

530
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:03,179
Yes, it does.

531
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:06,891
I was actually born right here
in San Francisco.

532
00:38:07,058 --> 00:38:10,228
I lived here all the way up
until I went off to the war.

533
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:13,022
You mean, like Vietnam?

534
00:38:13,189 --> 00:38:15,191
No, World War II.

535
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,695
I left med school
and enlisted as a medic.

536
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:22,282
I wanted to help save people,
not shoot them.

537
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:24,742
The last thing I remember,

538
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:28,079
I was bandaging
a soldier's head wound,

539
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,790
then I felt a sharp pain,

540
00:38:30,957 --> 00:38:34,544
and then the next thing I know I was
floating, surrounded by whitelighters.

541
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:38,339
And they offered me
immortality...

542
00:38:39,007 --> 00:38:43,803
...and a chance to help
special people like you.

543
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:51,352
I never once ever doubted
that I didn't make the right choice...

544
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:53,396
...until I met you.

545
00:38:55,022 --> 00:38:59,527
Ever since, all I can think is how I'd
give it up to have a mortal life again,

546
00:38:59,694 --> 00:39:03,489
to have a family and grow old...

547
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,866
...with you.

548
00:39:08,703 --> 00:39:10,204
Is that possible?

549
00:39:10,371 --> 00:39:13,332
Yeah, I can become human
again, Piper.

550
00:39:13,499 --> 00:39:16,002
I mean, if you want me to.

551
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:19,588
Are you kidding?
I want that more than anything.

552
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:22,925
- I don't want to lose you again.
- But?

553
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:27,847
But then you wouldn't be able
to help other witches,

554
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:31,058
or other future whitelighters,
would you?

555
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:34,270
You couldn't help save
the next Daisy.

556
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:45,030
I'd better go.

557
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,460
I love you.

558
00:40:12,015 --> 00:40:14,226
I love you too.

559
00:40:25,362 --> 00:40:28,824
- How you doing?
- Been better. How about you?

560
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:30,867
Those IA sons of bitches
wanted me to wear a mike.

561
00:40:31,034 --> 00:40:33,203
Yeah. So you wearing one?

562
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:35,747
What do you think?

563
00:40:36,832 --> 00:40:38,208
You in any kind of trouble?

564
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:40,502
Less than you.

565
00:40:42,087 --> 00:40:45,340
I just want you to know
I'm doing it for a good cause.

566
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,717
Andy, I'm your partner.

567
00:40:48,426 --> 00:40:50,428
More importantly, I'm your friend.

568
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,933
I want to believe
that you're on our side.

569
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,561
But it would really help me
if I knew why you were doing this.

570
00:41:00,188 --> 00:41:04,567
I'm not asking for IA,
I'm asking for me.

571
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:07,404
I think you owe me that.

572
00:41:13,535 --> 00:41:16,037
I told you they'd meet, didn't I?

573
00:41:16,204 --> 00:41:19,707
Doesn't do us any good
if we can't hear them over the noise.

574
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:24,087
Sure wish I could read lips.

575
00:41:25,964 --> 00:41:27,382
Who are you covering for?

576
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,973
It's Prue.

577
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:39,018
And all I can tell you is

578
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:42,563
she's connected to all
of our unsolved cases.

579
00:41:43,898 --> 00:41:45,817
Prue, huh?

580
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:50,238
I was so hoping
you weren't gonna say that.

581
00:41:55,493 --> 00:41:59,497
- I can't get a thing.
- He's covering up for Prue Halliwell.

582
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:01,124
What?

583
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,584
How the hell did you...?

584
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:05,670
Oh, my God!

585
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:22,061
Leo.

586
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:39,119
Is it just me, or can you draw
a chalk outline around this place?

587
00:42:39,286 --> 00:42:41,497
Wow, I don't know what you could
possibly mean, Phoebe.

588
00:42:41,664 --> 00:42:46,001
I mean, the weekend's almost over,
we never made it to Cabo,

589
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:49,296
I'm never gonna see Andy again,
and Piper just lost the love of her life.

590
00:42:49,463 --> 00:42:52,341
The glass is way more
than half full here, Prue.

591
00:42:52,508 --> 00:42:57,596
Piper saved the love of her life,
Alec is long gone,

592
00:42:57,763 --> 00:43:01,475
and Daisy is on her way back
to her family.

593
00:43:01,642 --> 00:43:05,354
We even managed to straighten out
our powers. Thank God.

594
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:09,108
Thank God? I thought that you always
wanted an active power.

595
00:43:09,817 --> 00:43:14,655
Maybe, but I never thought
I'd actually miss my premonitions.

596
00:43:14,822 --> 00:43:18,784
Having your power was like wearing
a dress that was too tight.

597
00:43:18,951 --> 00:43:20,494
Not that that would ever happen.

598
00:43:20,661 --> 00:43:23,080
Remember when I said
that you had no vision?

599
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:26,333
- Which time?
- Well, you will never hear it again.

600
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:29,836
It takes a lot of strength
to see what you see.

601
00:43:30,629 --> 00:43:32,589
I'll drink to that.

602
00:43:32,756 --> 00:43:36,301
If we can't go to Cabo, we might
as well bring Cabo to us, right?

603
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,846
I don't know, Pheebs,
we still have some serious problems.

604
00:43:40,013 --> 00:43:43,809
Oh, problems
are for Monday mornings.

605
00:43:43,975 --> 00:43:45,894
What do you say?

606
00:43:46,144 --> 00:43:49,564
It's gonna be a hell of a Monday
morning, but until then...
