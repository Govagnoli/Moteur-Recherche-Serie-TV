1
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,232
Mrs Allison Spencer, I presume?

2
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:29,446
You mean Mrs Allison
Michaels-Spencer, don't you?

3
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,740
- You wanna be alone?
- No.

4
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,367
- Not getting cold feet, are you?
- No, Elliot.

5
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,995
I am definitely not getting cold feet.

6
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,581
I love you, you know that.

7
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,000
But?

8
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,086
I don't know.
It's just so overwhelming.

9
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,757
I mean, after all these years of
dreaming about us getting married,

10
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:53,428
I just... I don't want anything bad
to happen, that's all.

11
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,889
I've got an idea. Let's elope.

12
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:59,392
Yeah, right, like your mom
would really allow that.

13
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,438
Elliot?

14
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,482
Speak of the devil.

15
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,445
- Hi, Mom.
- I have been looking all over for you.

16
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,573
- Did you get the marriage certificate?
- Not yet.

17
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,743
Well, you have to.
The wedding won't be legal without it.

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,371
We're going to city hall tomorrow,
before the rehearsal dinner.

19
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,249
- But why not go today?
- Mom, relax, will you?

20
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,251
Why are you so bent about this?

21
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,798
Who's that?

22
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,554
Oh, no.

23
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,099
Who is it?

24
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,643
Someone I haven't seen
for a long time.

25
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:05,124
- What are you doing here?
- Forget about our little pact?

26
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,128
No, Jade, but I was
hoping that you did.

27
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,630
My God, you haven't aged in 20 years.

28
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:13,674
You could've asked for
eternal youth, Grace,

29
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:17,928
instead of choosing wealth,
power, all of this.

30
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,264
You've had a good life, haven't you?

31
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:22,475
Where to?

32
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:25,227
Oh, have the butler
show you to our rooms.

33
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:29,106
Tell him Mrs Spencer
was expecting us.

34
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:33,652
You can't just move in here.

35
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:35,571
People will be suspicious,
what will I say?

36
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,780
Say the truth.

37
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,076
Say your son's had a change of heart.
That was our deal, remember?

38
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,913
Don't worry, Elliot won't even know
what you did until it's over.

39
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,296
Elliot!

40
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:54,214
Elliot!

41
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:03,348
No! Help me! No!

42
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:06,852
Piper?

43
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:08,937
Are you still in there?

44
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:12,065
- I'm almost done.
- Define "almost."

45
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:14,985
Just give me another minute.
Or two.

46
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:19,031
- You're positive?
- I hope not.

47
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,825
- Piper, I cannot be late today.
- I know the feeling.

48
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:23,827
My first biannual auction
starts tomorrow...

49
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:26,121
I wanna do a good job.
Yes, I know.

50
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:29,124
- So can you hurry?
- Just use the bathroom downstairs.

51
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,210
- All my stuff is up here.
- Well, borrow mine. It's all down there.

52
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:35,172
But then... Never mind.

53
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:43,346
Piper?

54
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:46,308
- I'll be right out.
- Is there any hot water left?

55
00:03:50,478 --> 00:03:54,232
- What?
- Am I in for a cold shower, yes or no?

56
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:58,069
At certain times in our life, a cold
shower is probably a good thing.

57
00:03:58,236 --> 00:04:00,030
Not three mornings in a row, it isn't.

58
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:30,887
Hello?

59
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,476
Okay, thanks. Bye.

60
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:39,813
The three of us need to figure out
some kind of a morning schedule.

61
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:41,815
I think I'm gonna be sick.

62
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:43,608
In the upstairs or downstairs
bathroom?

63
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:46,987
Maybe Phoebe can help me cater
the Elliot Spencer wedding tomorrow.

64
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,447
Shouldn't you check with the chef
who hired you first?

65
00:06:49,614 --> 00:06:50,991
That would be Chef Moore.

66
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:54,452
Who is on his way to France.

67
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:57,205
And since, technically,
the contract is with Quake,

68
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:59,124
he is off the hook,
and I'm on the line.

69
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,835
Now I have to tell one of
the richest families in the city

70
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:03,920
that the chef they hired
can't do their wedding,

71
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:06,673
they're stuck with me.
And I hope they go for it.

72
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:09,843
Bright side? Who else
can they hire in 24 hours?

73
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,681
- It's not the end of the world.
- What's not the end of the world?

74
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:16,766
- Piper's problem.
- Oh, you know too?

75
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,185
- She just told me.
- How do you know?

76
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:21,563
- Oh, I...
- Piper can definitely handle this.

77
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:23,648
Frankly, I don't even think
anyone will notice.

78
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:27,151
- I thought maybe you could help me.
- Me? What can I do?

79
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:29,487
Pick up some supplies.
Tie some bows.

80
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:32,532
Offer moral support if I panic
and freeze anything.

81
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,867
- Ten bucks an hour.
- I'd take it.

82
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:36,911
Good luck with the wedding.

83
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:40,373
- So will you do it?
- Yeah, sure.

84
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,417
Okay, here's a list of supplies I need.

85
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,920
I'll go to the Spencer estate,
and you can meet me there at 1.

86
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:48,297
You and Prue were really just talking
about a wedding?

87
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:50,341
Yeah. What did you think
we were talking about?

88
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:54,929
Jeremy and his aftermath.
You know, you slept with him.

89
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:58,349
Don't ever mention
that warlock's name again.

90
00:07:58,808 --> 00:08:02,186
It is over, he is in demon hell,
end of story.

91
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:04,230
Wedding, yes. Warlocks, no.
Am I clear?

92
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,482
Good, because there is nothing in me

93
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:09,068
that wants anything to do
with Jeremy ever again.

94
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:17,785
Don't touch those!

95
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,265
<i>Yes, may I help you?</i>

96
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:42,726
My name is Piper Halliwell.
I'm the caterer.

97
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:45,271
<i>I have a Chef Moore
listed as the caterer.</i>

98
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,023
Yeah, there's been a change.

99
00:08:48,857 --> 00:08:50,526
<i>Sorry, ma'am.</i>

100
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:54,947
I've got ice sculptures melting over
wedding cake, I've got to get in now.

101
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:56,949
<i>Someone will be with you
in a moment.</i>

102
00:09:03,997 --> 00:09:06,458
Please, I have to
get into the compound.

103
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09,378
This is a matter of utmost importance.
I must get in.

104
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:12,798
Father Trask.
We've been expecting you.

105
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:16,051
- Hey, easy on the padre, buddy.
- Go right ahead in, ma'am.

106
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:19,596
She is the bearer of the demon child!
Beware Hecate!

107
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:24,601
Hecate?

108
00:09:24,977 --> 00:09:26,687
Okay.

109
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:38,365
It's a Lassa warrior fertility goddess.
Very rare. And very powerful.

110
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:41,743
The tribe believed its mere presence
would help a woman conceive.

111
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,289
You take it. My biological clock's
not the one that's ticking.

112
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:50,418
Prue, your sister is here to see you.
She's waiting in your office.

113
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,128
Which sister?

114
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:55,215
The one who, on seeing your office,
said, "I should go back to college."

115
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,843
Phoebe. Well, for once,
her timing is good.

116
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,638
The fertility icon
has been catalogued.

117
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:05,934
I'm sorry, it's no longer available.

118
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:11,606
Hannah.

119
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,113
That was very careless of you.

120
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,281
You should know for whom
we acquired this.

121
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,033
Her sister's catering the wedding.

122
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:23,827
Prue won't even be there.

123
00:10:29,415 --> 00:10:31,417
Oh, gotta go.

124
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:34,379
This place rocks! No wonder
you never wanna come home.

125
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:36,839
- Get out of my chair.
- I love, too, that you found time

126
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:39,717
to scribble a morning shower schedule
for we Halliwell sisters.

127
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:42,095
- I noticed that I'm last.
- What are you doing here?

128
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:44,263
I thought you were helping Piper
with the wedding?

129
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,015
I am, but I need to talk to you.

130
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:48,726
You've got five minutes. Go.

131
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:51,062
Okay.

132
00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:56,526
I had a vision this morning,
and in this vision...

133
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,903
...a thing was being born.

134
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,906
So I started to think back,
six, eight weeks ago.

135
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:04,659
- Oh, my God, you're pregnant.
- What?

136
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:07,036
That's why you came back
from New York, isn't it?

137
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,706
No, but I shouldn't be surprised
that you would think that.

138
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:15,294
After all, I am the irresponsible sister,
the black sheep who always screws up,

139
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:17,755
the dark cloud over
the Halliwell household.

140
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:20,424
- Phoebe.
- Okay, I'm not pregnant.

141
00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:23,928
- But then why...?
- Excuse me, I still have two minutes.

142
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:28,933
FYI, you have another sister
who has had sex.

143
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:30,476
Remember Jeremy?

144
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:33,729
The guy who blew up in the attic?
The warlock boyfriend?

145
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:36,607
Think about it, Prue,
because it wasn't me in that vision

146
00:11:36,816 --> 00:11:39,110
having the demon child.

147
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:40,528
It was Piper.

148
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:44,406
So if you won't believe me,
you can believe my power.

149
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,250
You have to stop calling here,
Allison, do you understand?

150
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:57,127
Do I understand? Are you kidding me?

151
00:11:57,294 --> 00:12:00,381
What the hell is going on?
Why won't Elliot return my calls?

152
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:03,175
- I can't explain right now.
- You damn well better explain

153
00:12:03,342 --> 00:12:05,302
because I am not leaving here
until you do.

154
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:07,638
I've called the police, the sheriff,

155
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:09,723
nobody will listen to me,
nobody believes me!

156
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:12,893
- I know how hard this must be...
- Who is this Jade?

157
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:15,729
She's an old acquaintance
of the family.

158
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:20,108
I don't believe that.
Elliot would've told me about her.

159
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:23,570
There are many things about our
family that you will never understand.

160
00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:25,989
Then let Elliot explain it to me.

161
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:28,992
If he's gonna marry somebody else,
I wanna hear it from him.

162
00:12:29,576 --> 00:12:32,996
It's over, Allison.
That is all you need to know.

163
00:12:33,163 --> 00:12:34,957
Elliot doesn't love you anymore.

164
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:36,500
How can you say that?

165
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:41,129
I'm sorry.
He's going to marry Jade D'Mon.

166
00:12:41,338 --> 00:12:42,756
Please don't ever call here again.

167
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:57,020
Keep that at a simmer, not a boil.

168
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:01,233
Hi, sis.

169
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,903
- Finally! Did you get everything?
- Most of it.

170
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:08,031
No, wait! I've got buns in the oven.

171
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:09,699
You're not kidding.

172
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:12,077
I expected you over an hour ago.
Where have you been?

173
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:14,204
- I went to see Prue.
- At the auction house?

174
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:17,290
That's all the way down...
What were you doing there?

175
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:19,626
Adding more bricks to the wall
between us.

176
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:22,504
Mrs Spencer and Miss D'Mon
will see you now.

177
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:25,840
- Miss D'Mon?
- The bride.

178
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:27,801
Jade D'Mon.

179
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:30,303
But I thought the bride's name
was Allison...

180
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,847
Does not like to be kept waiting.

181
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:48,363
Oh, my son is very lucky.

182
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,531
You're going to be
a beautiful bride, Jade.

183
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:52,158
Thank you, Grace.

184
00:13:52,492 --> 00:13:53,910
Miss Piper Halliwell.

185
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,041
And her sister Chopped Liver.

186
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,044
Mrs Spencer, it's so nice of you
to see me.

187
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:06,881
Wow, your dress is beautiful.

188
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:09,592
I'd recognise the style anywhere.
It's a Shiro, isn't it?

189
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:12,136
Is it?

190
00:14:12,303 --> 00:14:14,222
How are things in the kitchen?

191
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:15,515
Right on schedule.

192
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:19,143
The lobsters arrive tomorrow morning,
the hors d'oeuvres are ready,

193
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,729
Chef Moore is in France,
and the puff pastries are baking.

194
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:24,106
- What?
- Chef Moore's gone?

195
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:28,944
Yeah, I'll be handling the catering.

196
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:30,571
Charles, get me my pill.

197
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,115
My wedding, it's ruined!

198
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:37,203
Oh, my, no, no.
I would never let that happen.

199
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:39,371
I know you may have made
the deal with Chef Moore,

200
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:42,083
but I have been involved
with every step of the preparation.

201
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,836
So if you let me,
I can guarantee you a wedding

202
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:49,757
that your children and grandchildren
will talk about for generations.

203
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:53,093
Okay, okay. We don't need to
talk about children just yet.

204
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,223
Look. You don't know me.
Hell, I barely know me.

205
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:05,564
Okay, but I do know my sister, and she
is the best damn chef in this city.

206
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:07,566
No one, and I do mean no one,

207
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:11,570
puts the love and tender care
that Piper puts into her cooking.

208
00:15:11,737 --> 00:15:15,449
So you should not only be grateful
that Chef Moore bagged out,

209
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,494
but you should
consider yourselves lucky.

210
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:22,748
If there is even the slightest hitch,
I will have your head.

211
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,418
Kidding.

212
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:31,006
Then it's settled.

213
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:33,008
No, actually, there's
just one more thing.

214
00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:35,302
I need to confirm the party trays

215
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,846
for the bachelor and bachelorette
parties tonight.

216
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:40,349
It looks like no decision
has been made yet

217
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:43,310
about the type of deli sandwiches
for the bachelor party.

218
00:15:43,518 --> 00:15:45,562
Whatever you decide is fine.

219
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:49,733
I think my son can make any decisions
about his own bachelor party.

220
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,693
Then we'll ask him together.

221
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,572
I thought it was bad luck
to see the bride before the... Ouch.

222
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:57,324
Come on.

223
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:07,500
- Is there a problem?
- No. No problem at all.

224
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:10,795
- I'm finished.
- Then go.

225
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:23,433
Hey, Darrin, come over here.

226
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:26,478
What's the matter?
What happened?

227
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:29,147
- The priest, he got away from us.
- What?

228
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:32,859
Check the perimeters, go.
All sectors, code three.

229
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:36,780
Father Trask is on the grounds.
Find him.

230
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,830
Elliot.

231
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:30,750
What have they done to you?

232
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:34,420
Listen to me, Elliot. You can't
go through with this wedding.

233
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:37,590
Jade doesn't love you.
She barely even knows you.

234
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:42,803
Well, if it isn't Allison.

235
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,640
- Allison?
- Yes.

236
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:48,809
Don't just stand there, call security.

237
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:51,729
- Of course.
- Don't bother, I was just leaving.

238
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,147
Let me show you the door.

239
00:18:03,657 --> 00:18:05,159
Is that the alarm?

240
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,161
What happened?

241
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:13,709
Hey, that's the priest.

242
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:25,220
Don't forget, Elliot. Remember
what I said. It's not too late!

243
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:27,806
Don't hurt Allison!

244
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,433
Get in here.

245
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:50,412
Father Trask.

246
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:52,456
I banish thee.

247
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:55,959
Back to the underworld, Hecate.

248
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:58,378
Not today, Trask.

249
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:11,892
Now, get rid of him.

250
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:18,440
He's after the bride. Upstairs!

251
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:54,058
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

252
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:57,228
No worries.
This is all kind of freaky, huh?

253
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:58,771
You have no idea.

254
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:02,567
What my sister meant to say was,
"What is up with you and Elliot?"

255
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,236
- Phoebe.
- You love him, don't you?

256
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:06,487
With all my heart.

257
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:09,282
- Okay, well, if that's true, then...
- I've gotta go.

258
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:16,164
This is so sad.
We have to do something.

259
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,915
- Yeah, but what?
- I don't know.

260
00:20:18,082 --> 00:20:21,627
We're good witches. It's our job, right?

261
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,632
I wouldn't be worrying
about Allison's problem just yet.

262
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:29,135
What the...?

263
00:20:29,802 --> 00:20:31,554
How many times do
I have to go through this?

264
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:33,306
Until I'm sure I understand you.

265
00:20:33,472 --> 00:20:35,933
You say Trask chased you
to the window?

266
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,353
Yes, with that big knife.

267
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:44,275
He was saying the most horrific things.
Crazy things.

268
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:46,277
He lunged at me.

269
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:48,571
I screamed and I ducked.

270
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:51,949
And the next thing I knew,
he was dead.

271
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:54,452
It was awful.

272
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:56,287
Can I go now?

273
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:59,290
I have, like, a million things to do
before my wedding tomorrow.

274
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:00,499
Sure.

275
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:06,130
Sorry the dead man on your driveway
was such an inconvenience.

276
00:21:06,297 --> 00:21:09,550
Welcome to the lifestyles
of the rich and shameless.

277
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:11,051
Look at the window, Morris.

278
00:21:12,052 --> 00:21:14,305
Look where Trask landed.

279
00:21:15,097 --> 00:21:17,891
Tell me how anyone
could have jumped that far.

280
00:21:19,184 --> 00:21:21,603
That's why we get paid
the medium bucks.

281
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,814
Figure it out.

282
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,362
Kirsten, killing a priest
was not part of our deal!

283
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:34,032
Word of advice, you keep your eyes
closed and your mouth shut.

284
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:36,827
In 24 hours, Jade will be pregnant.
This will all be over.

285
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:40,038
If anything happens
to my son, Elliot...

286
00:21:40,205 --> 00:21:43,041
You should've thought about that
before you agreed to our arrangement.

287
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,919
And let me remind you
of one more thing, Mrs Spencer.

288
00:21:46,336 --> 00:21:48,046
We're still on the second floor.

289
00:22:06,064 --> 00:22:07,399
You wanted to see me, Prue?

290
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:11,403
Yeah, I wanted to know what you
wanted me to do with the fertility icon?

291
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,906
- Sorry?
- Well, it's the companion piece

292
00:22:15,073 --> 00:22:18,076
to the female icon. The one that
you didn't want catalogued before?

293
00:22:18,493 --> 00:22:20,412
Oh, right, yeah.

294
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:23,290
Yeah, by all means, go ahead
and tag this one for the auction.

295
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:26,251
That particular client only wanted
the female icon.

296
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,295
Okay.

297
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:32,257
It's a wedding gift, actually.
Quite an exquisite one, at that.

298
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:33,925
For the Spencer bride.

299
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:36,886
Spencer? Really?
My sister's catering that wedding.

300
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:38,972
Is she? Small world.

301
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:41,391
Is that the sister that I met, Phoebe?

302
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:45,103
No, I have another sister, Piper.
Although Phoebe will be helping out.

303
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,106
I see. And what about you, then?

304
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:51,526
Me?

305
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,778
I don't do weddings.

306
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:57,991
No, I was just wondering how close
you and your sisters were.

307
00:22:58,157 --> 00:22:59,659
Anyway...

308
00:22:59,993 --> 00:23:01,452
...carry on.

309
00:23:14,048 --> 00:23:15,675
Well?

310
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:19,095
Fortunately, you're right.
Prue won't be in attendance.

311
00:23:20,054 --> 00:23:23,766
- Does that mean we can still go?
- No. No, I'm afraid not, it's too risky.

312
00:23:25,685 --> 00:23:28,938
Don't pout, Hannah.
I'm sure we'll think of something to do.

313
00:23:29,397 --> 00:23:30,982
Perhaps we could go
to a football match.

314
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:34,443
And watch some players get injured.

315
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:51,627
I'll come back when you're alone.

316
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:54,338
No, it's okay, I'm finished.

317
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:57,883
Somebody just put
a sticky inventory tag on his...

318
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:00,511
- On the...
- Artefact?

319
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:04,515
Yes. Yes, the artefact.

320
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:08,310
I should know that word,
shouldn't I?

321
00:24:08,936 --> 00:24:10,771
Where is your...?

322
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:14,149
Artefact?

323
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:17,695
- Right here.
- May I?

324
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:22,282
It's all yours.
It's the knife I called you about.

325
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,460
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

326
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:36,839
Any time. I'm happy you called.

327
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:39,383
<i>This poignard is exquisite.</i>

328
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:42,052
Fourteenth century, Italian.

329
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:47,724
<i>"Nec prius absistit
quoad protero prodigium."</i>

330
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:51,228
My Latin's a little rusty.
"He shall not...?"

331
00:24:51,436 --> 00:24:52,604
"I shall not.

332
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:55,399
I shall not rest until
the demon is vanquished."

333
00:24:57,192 --> 00:24:59,236
Let me see what else I can find.

334
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:09,913
- You found this at a crime scene?
- It was on the victim.

335
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,209
What was on the suspect?
Chain mail and a coat of armour?

336
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:15,710
It belonged to a priest.

337
00:25:17,003 --> 00:25:19,881
He was at the Grace Spencer estate.

338
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,800
The Spencer estate?

339
00:25:23,051 --> 00:25:24,761
Piper's catering
a wedding there tomorrow.

340
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:26,555
I know, I saw her and Phoebe.

341
00:25:26,763 --> 00:25:28,098
Don't worry. They're fine.

342
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:39,734
This can't be a coincidence.

343
00:25:40,443 --> 00:25:41,861
What?

344
00:25:42,195 --> 00:25:43,988
Nothing, I'm just mumbling to myself.

345
00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:46,116
Do you mind if I keep this
for a while?

346
00:25:46,282 --> 00:25:48,284
I would like to show it
to Russell in Armaments.

347
00:25:48,451 --> 00:25:50,370
Sure, I checked it out
so you could research it.

348
00:25:50,537 --> 00:25:52,497
Great. I'll call you.

349
00:26:17,313 --> 00:26:20,108
I knew I wasn't crazy.
Look at these matches.

350
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:22,985
Look at these napkins.
They all say "Allison and Elliot,"

351
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:25,988
- not "Jade and Elliot."
- That explains a lot.

352
00:26:26,155 --> 00:26:28,783
And look at this. It's Chef Moore's
contract for the wedding.

353
00:26:28,991 --> 00:26:32,245
At the top it says, "The wedding of
Allison Michaels and Elliot Spencer."

354
00:26:32,411 --> 00:26:35,039
Allison is supposed to marry
Elliot tomorrow, not Jade.

355
00:26:35,206 --> 00:26:37,166
That's probably why she was crying.

356
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:39,460
- I wonder what happened?
- Me too.

357
00:26:39,627 --> 00:26:42,588
Could you imagine watching the man
you love marry somebody else?

358
00:26:42,755 --> 00:26:45,800
- No. Poor Allison.
- Now we have to help her.

359
00:26:46,008 --> 00:26:49,053
We're the only ones that know.
We're the only ones who can.

360
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:51,847
Okay, I can't hold this in any longer.

361
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:54,517
Your name isn't Piper,
and that's the good news.

362
00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:56,894
You're really Hecate,
Queen of the Underworld.

363
00:26:57,103 --> 00:27:00,356
You're pregnant with the demon child,
which means...

364
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:02,066
...l'm afraid I have to kill you.

365
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:04,860
- What?
- Not to worry. You have plenty of time.

366
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:07,404
<i>I still have to find
the jewelled poignard to kill you with.</i>

367
00:27:07,655 --> 00:27:10,282
- See?
- Are you talking about this?

368
00:27:11,534 --> 00:27:14,703
The odds, Piper.
What are the odds?

369
00:27:15,704 --> 00:27:17,665
I am not pregnant. Trust me.

370
00:27:17,831 --> 00:27:19,208
Well, that's good news.

371
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:21,502
Are you kidding? That's great news!

372
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:23,003
You can live!

373
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,547
Wait. My vision.

374
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:28,842
Phoebe, what is it that
you saw exactly?

375
00:27:29,468 --> 00:27:32,930
Well, I saw the thing being born.

376
00:27:33,138 --> 00:27:36,183
- Did you see Piper?
- Yes, I saw her legs.

377
00:27:36,392 --> 00:27:38,519
- Never saw her face?
- No.

378
00:27:39,144 --> 00:27:40,687
Hello, bickering sisters.

379
00:27:40,896 --> 00:27:43,232
I am not pregnant,
but I am in the room.

380
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:47,110
Phoebe, how did you know
I took a pregnancy test?

381
00:27:47,277 --> 00:27:50,364
I... I found the box in the bathroom.

382
00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:53,283
You're supposed to take the trash out,
not dig through it.

383
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,576
Piper, it's not like that.

384
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:56,912
We're making
those bathroom schedules now.

385
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,790
We have bigger problems to deal with.
Cliffs Notes version:

386
00:27:59,957 --> 00:28:01,291
The priest who was killed today,

387
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:04,086
he belonged to a secret order
pledged to stop Hecate.

388
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:07,214
"Beware Hecate,"
that's what Father Trask said.

389
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:10,300
- Then he tried to kill Jade.
- Yeah, she's a demon.

390
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:13,178
She comes to Earth every 200 years.

391
00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:16,139
She has to find an innocent,
put him under her spell

392
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:17,891
and marry him
in a sanctified wedding.

393
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:21,978
That doesn't sound any different than
most of the single women in this city.

394
00:28:22,145 --> 00:28:23,814
Well, she needs Elliot
to impregnate her.

395
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:27,275
That way, her child would look
normal on the outside.

396
00:28:27,442 --> 00:28:31,154
But internally and mentally,
her child would be pure demon.

397
00:28:32,072 --> 00:28:33,698
This is huge,
a child born into

398
00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:35,992
the wealth and power
of the Spencer family?

399
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,995
And I don't think it's a coincidence
that you're catering the wedding.

400
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:40,956
I think it's one of those things

401
00:28:41,164 --> 00:28:44,459
that we can kind of look forward to
as protectors of the innocent.

402
00:28:45,794 --> 00:28:49,255
Well, before we ruin the wedding,
and my career,

403
00:28:49,422 --> 00:28:51,508
let's make sure
we're right about Jade.

404
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:04,145
This should make his assets rise.

405
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:07,273
Looks like a normal
bachelorette party to me.

406
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,484
I don't believe it.
They've barely touched my food.

407
00:29:09,651 --> 00:29:11,611
- Piper.
- Those deli trays took hours.

408
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:13,529
And you know who this is from.

409
00:29:13,738 --> 00:29:17,408
They understand how important it is
for you to get pregnant right away.

410
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,459
Hey, I know that piece.
It's from the auction house.

411
00:29:27,418 --> 00:29:28,503
Come in.

412
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:31,506
Hi, pizza delivery.

413
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:33,674
They ordered pizza?

414
00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:44,977
Okay, now I feel better.

415
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:53,486
- He looks good enough to eat.
- Good idea.

416
00:30:04,246 --> 00:30:06,582
Girls, I'm the bride.

417
00:30:26,977 --> 00:30:28,812
Somehow we have to stop them.

418
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:31,148
So there's only one problem
with our plan.

419
00:30:31,315 --> 00:30:34,818
We're assuming that Allison
is gonna be a willing accomplice.

420
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:37,279
She still loves Elliot.
You heard what she said.

421
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:39,656
<i>The Book of Shadows says
that the spell can be broken</i>

422
00:30:39,823 --> 00:30:41,700
by a declaration of love,
sealed with a kiss.

423
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:44,453
It's so romantic, just like a fairy tale.

424
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,456
And once Elliot is out of his spell,
Jade's out of luck.

425
00:30:47,623 --> 00:30:49,082
No wedding,
no honeymoon night.

426
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:50,876
No honeymoon, no sex.

427
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:54,796
And no sex, no monster child spending
alternate weekends with daddy.

428
00:30:54,963 --> 00:30:57,216
I still say we rely on our
power-of-three thing

429
00:30:57,382 --> 00:31:00,636
and ix-nay the monster bride
and her carnivorous bridesmaids.

430
00:31:00,802 --> 00:31:03,222
Phoebe, we're supposed to
help people, not harm them.

431
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:05,057
And that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

432
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:07,559
You two will get Elliot,
I'll get Allison.

433
00:31:07,726 --> 00:31:09,770
We'll meet at the front gate
no later than 2:30.

434
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:11,229
Everybody have their weapons?

435
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:15,108
I'll take that.

436
00:31:15,317 --> 00:31:20,072
Okay, so it's time to shower, shampoo
and go kick some Hecate butt.

437
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:23,533
- Did she just say "shower"?
- She did, didn't she?

438
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:26,244
- Hot water!
- Hot water!

439
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:33,960
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

440
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:36,880
- M.E. report?
- It is now officially a homicide.

441
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:39,424
The priest's neck was broken
before he went out the window.

442
00:31:39,591 --> 00:31:41,593
- Told you.
- So what?

443
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,429
You're saying that that little
120-pound blushing bride

444
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:46,473
tossed him out the window?

445
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,433
I don't think so.

446
00:31:50,268 --> 00:31:53,063
The security tapes from the estate
might show us who did.

447
00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:54,522
Yeah.

448
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:56,566
That's a good idea.

449
00:31:56,733 --> 00:31:59,235
I already had them
sent to the station.

450
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:01,696
You did, did you?

451
00:32:07,076 --> 00:32:08,953
- Allison Michaels?
- Yes. Prue Halliwell?

452
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,247
Hi, thanks for coming. Come in.

453
00:32:11,748 --> 00:32:14,083
You said it was important.

454
00:32:17,462 --> 00:32:18,838
Where did you get this?

455
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:21,257
This won't take long, I promise.

456
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,392
I'll need those in the kitchen
right away.

457
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,144
Yes, ma'am.

458
00:32:33,561 --> 00:32:36,606
No, no, no! Not in the sun.
Get an umbrella.

459
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:39,484
Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't we
trying to stop this wedding?

460
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,736
You're right. I just can't help myself.

461
00:32:41,903 --> 00:32:43,446
- Forget the food. Let's go.
- Okay.

462
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:49,327
And everything was fine,
right on schedule...

463
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:54,749
...until about six days ago.

464
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:58,586
That's when Jade appeared
out of nowhere

465
00:32:58,753 --> 00:33:02,381
and started working at
the Spencer family business.

466
00:33:03,132 --> 00:33:09,638
Before I could say, "I do," I was out
and she was in. End of story.

467
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:13,017
- Did you talk to Elliot?
- They wouldn't even let me see him.

468
00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:15,227
Not a big surprise.

469
00:33:16,437 --> 00:33:18,355
It wouldn't make
any difference anyway.

470
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:22,776
The Elliot I know, the Elliot I love,

471
00:33:22,943 --> 00:33:24,361
isn't here anymore.

472
00:33:26,697 --> 00:33:31,744
What if I told you Elliot isn't himself,
because this woman...

473
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:34,163
...has put him under a spell,
so to speak?

474
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,916
Allison, Elliot loves you, not Jade.

475
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,127
If that were true,

476
00:33:40,294 --> 00:33:42,588
I would be the one
walking down the aisle today.

477
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:46,050
You still can be. All you have to do
is crash your wedding.

478
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:49,595
- What?
- Look, it's not that crazy.

479
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:51,764
The man that you love
is marrying somebody else.

480
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,807
Don't you wanna stop him?

481
00:33:53,974 --> 00:33:57,186
This isn't a fairy tale.
Real life doesn't work that way.

482
00:33:57,352 --> 00:33:58,896
But what if you can get him back?

483
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:01,732
Do you really wanna spend
the rest of your life just wondering?

484
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:05,110
In your heart of hearts,
you must still love him.

485
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,613
I do. God, I really do.

486
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:12,909
- Then let me help you.
- But you don't even know me.

487
00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:15,954
Why would you want to help me?

488
00:34:17,581 --> 00:34:19,249
Have you ever seen
that television show

489
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:22,127
where there's the woman
who's an angel,

490
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:24,838
and she helps strangers
every week?

491
00:34:25,005 --> 00:34:26,048
I love that show.

492
00:34:26,423 --> 00:34:28,425
Don't get too excited,
I'm nothing like that.

493
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:32,304
But my sisters and I,
we have special gifts.

494
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:35,307
Gifts? What kind of gifts?

495
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:36,892
Ones you can't return.

496
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:41,146
Let's just say we come from
a very interesting family tree.

497
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:45,525
Look, if you can, if you'll trust me...

498
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:47,611
...we can bring
you and Elliot together.

499
00:34:53,116 --> 00:34:54,993
Here we are, finally.

500
00:34:55,201 --> 00:34:57,329
Your big day.

501
00:35:08,298 --> 00:35:10,884
Forgive me, son.

502
00:35:16,556 --> 00:35:18,057
Stripper-eating bridesmaid ahead.

503
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:20,059
Keep walking.

504
00:35:22,312 --> 00:35:24,188
We need to talk to Mr Spencer.

505
00:35:24,397 --> 00:35:26,482
No one sees the groom
before the ceremony.

506
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,152
Actually, that's the bride.
This will only take a minute.

507
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,487
What part of "no"
did you not understand?

508
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:33,323
The non-original part?

509
00:35:37,827 --> 00:35:40,747
- Is there a problem?
- Don't even get me started.

510
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:44,292
Could we talk to you for a sec?
Lt'll... You know, in private?

511
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:45,793
Certainly.

512
00:35:54,302 --> 00:35:56,762
- Is everything all right?
- It's about your son.

513
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,098
What's wrong?

514
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,726
Well, he...

515
00:36:01,892 --> 00:36:04,061
He... He's not supposed
to marry Jade.

516
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,690
- I know.
- You do?

517
00:36:08,357 --> 00:36:10,401
I know more than you could
possibly imagine.

518
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,238
- We can help him.
- No on can help us. It's too late.

519
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,866
No, we have a plan.
We can stop the wedding.

520
00:36:22,872 --> 00:36:23,998
Go to the wine cellar.

521
00:36:24,206 --> 00:36:26,208
Wait for me there.
I'll join you in ten minutes.

522
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,089
I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do for you.

523
00:36:46,312 --> 00:36:47,813
Did you hear that?

524
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,483
Not to worry. We still have
30 minutes before the wedding.

525
00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:09,126
- This is bad.
- Real bad.

526
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:14,715
- Freeze them.
- I'm trying, it's not working!

527
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:17,884
Yes, it is. Look, you froze the fly.

528
00:37:18,093 --> 00:37:21,138
You have to be closer to the object
you're trying to freeze.

529
00:37:22,681 --> 00:37:24,766
Forget it. Run!

530
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,365
Here you go, inspector.

531
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:47,205
Man, the Spencers sure go in
for a lot of security.

532
00:37:48,874 --> 00:37:50,625
Those cameras should've
picked up something

533
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:53,503
around the time
the priest was killed.

534
00:38:00,176 --> 00:38:02,178
It's 2:40, could we have missed them?

535
00:38:02,345 --> 00:38:04,597
I hope not. Where are they?

536
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:11,729
<i>- Hello?
- Piper, where are you?</i>

537
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:13,857
We're down in the wine cellar. Help.

538
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,116
This is from me,
your something borrowed.

539
00:38:31,082 --> 00:38:33,376
<i>Faust. I love this.</i>

540
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:35,586
I read it the last time I was here.

541
00:38:37,964 --> 00:38:40,008
What about my something blue?

542
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:46,514
You're right.

543
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:50,351
Nothing's bluer than the heart
of a mother giving away her only son.

544
00:38:55,648 --> 00:38:58,568
It's just two women talking.
You can't even hear them.

545
00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:00,695
What, you don't read lips?

546
00:39:03,447 --> 00:39:07,577
Something, "Killing a priest
wasn't part of our deal."

547
00:39:08,244 --> 00:39:11,080
Damn. You're good.

548
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:42,570
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to celebrate this sacred union

549
00:39:42,736 --> 00:39:47,283
as we join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

550
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:53,414
Okay, they're really close now.
Freeze them.

551
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,665
Great.

552
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:58,293
Piper, Phoebe, duck!

553
00:40:03,924 --> 00:40:05,175
Are you guys okay?

554
00:40:05,843 --> 00:40:07,845
- Nice timing.
- Where's Allison?

555
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:10,222
I've got her upstairs. Come on.

556
00:40:12,391 --> 00:40:14,351
If there's anyone here
who knows of a reason

557
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,936
these two should not to be joined,

558
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:18,105
speak now
or forever hold your peace.

559
00:40:19,565 --> 00:40:21,567
We have a reason.

560
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:22,901
I love you, Elliot.

561
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:26,113
- Why, you little witch.
- Hey!

562
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:30,492
By Asteria and Perses,

563
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:35,330
open, sky, and do you worst!

564
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:44,005
You're coming with me.

565
00:40:44,214 --> 00:40:45,757
Come on.

566
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:52,931
This is exciting.
I wonder what's going on here.

567
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:16,162
Quick, we have to banish them
back to the underworld.

568
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,709
<i>The poignard, it's gone.</i>

569
00:41:22,877 --> 00:41:24,379
Elliot!

570
00:41:28,883 --> 00:41:30,593
Prue, do something.

571
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:54,742
Whoever you three are,

572
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:56,869
thank you.

573
00:42:07,421 --> 00:42:08,798
We did that.

574
00:42:09,006 --> 00:42:10,758
And they'll live happily ever after.

575
00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:12,551
I wonder if we will.

576
00:42:12,718 --> 00:42:14,136
Of course we will,
why shouldn't we?

577
00:42:14,303 --> 00:42:15,763
That's easy for you to say.

578
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:19,350
You'll never greet your husband with,
"Honey, I think I froze the kids."

579
00:42:19,517 --> 00:42:22,603
No, I've just accidentally moved them
to another zip code.

580
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:25,856
But I will see them, find them
and bring them back safely.

581
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:28,234
If I can ever learn
to control my powers.

582
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:30,194
If any of us can.

583
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:33,531
Oh, just think of the obstacles
that Allison and Elliot have overcome.

584
00:42:33,697 --> 00:42:35,241
If they can do it, so can we.

585
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:37,284
I guess true love does conquer all.

586
00:42:37,451 --> 00:42:40,162
Especially if you have
separate bathrooms.

587
00:42:42,373 --> 00:42:44,333
Speaking of true love...

588
00:42:47,628 --> 00:42:49,296
Fancy seeing you here.

589
00:42:49,463 --> 00:42:50,756
Yeah, isn't it?

590
00:42:51,632 --> 00:42:54,343
I wanted to give this back to you.
I'm finished with it.

591
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,512
How'd you know I'd be here?

592
00:42:57,012 --> 00:42:59,264
I didn't, I was gonna drop it off
after the wedding.

593
00:43:01,975 --> 00:43:04,436
Shall we talk about this
in private, Prue?

594
00:43:08,941 --> 00:43:12,653
- So you believe in destiny?
- He believes in destiny.
