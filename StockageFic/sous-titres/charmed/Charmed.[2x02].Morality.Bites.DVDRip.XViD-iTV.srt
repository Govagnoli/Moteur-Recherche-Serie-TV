1
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:12,758
- What did you buy?
- Doodie.

2
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,362
We weren't out of that.

3
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:17,605
No. I stepped in it, again.

4
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:20,237
That man has turned our front walk
into a puppy minefield.

5
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:22,923
I can't believe that guy
still lets his dog do his business

6
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,728
- right in front of our house.
- Well, we've left notes.

7
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:28,198
- And gotten nowhere.
- Yeah, well, I've had it.

8
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,441
The next time I catch him in the act,
I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind.

9
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:36,397
- That couldn't be.
- Oh, I hope it is.

10
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:48,806
That's them.
That's the guy and his dog.

11
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,442
I can't believe it.

12
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:53,079
That is so rude,
he's just gonna walk away.

13
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:55,399
Then don't let him. Use your magic.

14
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:58,158
If you can't teach the dog new tricks,
how about the owner?

15
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,889
Just think of the money we'd save
on carpet cleaning alone.

16
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,883
Phoebe, we can't use our magic
just to teach him,

17
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,198
or anybody else, a lesson.

18
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:11,007
Why not? It's for the greater good.
I mean, that's our job, right?

19
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:15,845
Think of it as community service. We'd
be doing the whole block a favour.

20
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,601
Come on.

21
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:26,121
- Okay, Piper.
- Hope he's not out of my range.

22
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:28,643
Prue?

23
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:33,678
- Nice shot.
- An eye for an eye, a shoe for a shoe.

24
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,088
Oh, duck.

25
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:40,880
- Did he see you?
- So what if he did?

26
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:43,085
What's he gonna do, cry witch?

27
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:47,805
Well, we've done our good deed
for the day.

28
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:50,244
I think I deserve 15 minutes
of channel surfing.

29
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:53,367
- Who wants coffee?
- I'll grind.

30
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:59,163
Koko now has a vocabulary
of over 500...

31
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:00,478
Justice Today.

32
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:02,328
And Cal Greene tied a record

33
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,923
by smashing his sixth grand slam
of the year today.

34
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,282
Phoebe, are you okay?

35
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:20,280
Take a deep breath, honey,
it's all right.

36
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:23,043
No, it's not. I saw my future.

37
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:25,727
I was being executed.

38
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:27,878
Burned alive.

39
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:02,765
Why would a report
about a baseball player

40
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:05,363
- trigger a premonition like that?
- I don't know.

41
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:09,078
All I know is I could feel it.
I could feel the fire.

42
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,319
And we were just standing there?
That can't be right.

43
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,366
- It's what I saw.
- There's no way

44
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:16,487
that we would let that happen.
Not in the past, present or future.

45
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:21,165
What did I do?
Or what is it that I'm going to do?

46
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:24,441
That's Leo. I'll get that.

47
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,848
- Hey, stranger.
- Oh, is that what I am now?

48
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:31,278
Playing hooky?

49
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,404
Well, they're making me work tonight,
so I've got the afternoon off.

50
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,559
The old "I've gotta save the world"
excuse again?

51
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:40,720
Oh, like you've never had to use it.

52
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,048
You're about to use it.

53
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,805
Well, there's just something
I have to do.

54
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:49,402
Maybe you could...

55
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:53,084
Now?

56
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,726
- Leo?
- It's okay.

57
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:01,523
You go, there's actually something
I have to take care of so...

58
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:04,123
Well, we really need to talk
about things, you know.

59
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:06,200
About where we stand.

60
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:08,403
Yeah, we do.

61
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:11,644
Rain check?

62
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,127
It's what we do best.

63
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:23,158
I hate when he does that.

64
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:36,444
- So, what did he want?
- He cancelled our date.

65
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:38,042
He's working again.

66
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:40,086
You didn't ask him
what we should do?

67
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:41,602
He had to fly, literally.

68
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:44,329
The pages were doing
that flipping thing on their own again.

69
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:47,247
It's a spell to take us to the future.

70
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,877
Two, actually. One to send us
and one to bring us home.

71
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,758
But apparently we only get one shot.
Once we use it, they disappear.

72
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:57,046
Wait a minute, you guys.
We almost died going back to the past.

73
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:59,200
This is not something
that you just do.

74
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:03,039
- We're talking about your life, Phoebe.
- And I'm talking about yours, Prue.

75
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,963
I'm just saying I think we should
think this over a little bit.

76
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:09,127
Look, you had that premonition
today for a reason.

77
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:11,598
It must mean that we're supposed
to do something about it.

78
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:14,045
Going to the future might be
the only way to find out

79
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:15,927
what you did to put you
on that pyre.

80
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:17,727
How do you know
it's something that I did?

81
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:20,403
It might be a demon
or a warlock that puts me there.

82
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:22,761
Do you really wanna wait
to find out?

83
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:29,838
Okay, pack your bags. We go,
try and figure out what happened,

84
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:32,398
and hopefully come back
with enough information to stop it.

85
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:34,924
We're gonna need a date, Phoebe.

86
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:39,002
February 12th, 2009.

87
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:41,603
That's two weeks before the date
I saw in my premonition.

88
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:43,441
That should give us
more than enough time

89
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:45,406
to figure out what put you there.

90
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:47,317
I wonder how I look.

91
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:50,119
Piper, you look great.
This is hardly the time to...

92
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:52,803
Not now. In the future.

93
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:55,278
When we went back to the '70s,
we saw ourselves as kids.

94
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,838
Now we'll be seeing ourselves
walking around ten years older.

95
00:06:58,049 --> 00:07:00,563
All the vanquishing,
think of the wear and tear.

96
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,481
Okay.

97
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:06,678
Hear these words
Hear the rhyme

98
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,238
We send to you this burning sign

99
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,648
- Then our future selves we'll find
- In another place and time

100
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:41,924
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

101
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:47,488
You... I think you
have the wrong house.

102
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:51,280
- Certainly the wrong mommy.
- Stop fooling.

103
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:54,325
Car pool.

104
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,600
Phoebe. Where's the volume?

105
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:12,884
Command recognized.

106
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:15,483
And more news on the execution
of Phoebe Halliwell

107
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:17,002
coming up in just a moment.

108
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:19,399
Now back to your regularly
scheduled programming,

109
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:22,402
MTV's Real World 18, on the moon.

110
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,084
- Mom, I'm gonna be late.
- Okay.

111
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:30,518
- TV, shut up. Mute. Something.
- Command recognized.

112
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:35,287
- Morning, Piper. You all right?
- I guess.

113
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:39,404
Yeah, it's... With your sister,
it's rough, I know.

114
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:43,642
Don't worry about your little one. I'll get
her from school like you asked,

115
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,607
but you sure you want me
to take her to your ex's?

116
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,045
"Ex"? As in husband? As in mine?

117
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,966
Yes. Yes.
If that is what I told you, then yes.

118
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,080
So you and he
are getting along better now?

119
00:08:57,849 --> 00:09:00,966
Maybe. Prue? Prue?

120
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:03,484
Okay, kiddo, let's hit the road.

121
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:12,283
Don't worry, Mommy,
I promise I'll do as you ask.

122
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:15,725
I won't use my magic again, ever.

123
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:53,403
Hey, hey, hey, people. Okay, enough.
People, stop touching me.

124
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:58,322
Stay. Stay.

125
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,407
- Prue, what's going on?
- I don't know.

126
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:03,321
But I could get used to it.
Check me out.

127
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:05,559
I don't just work at Buckland's,
I own it.

128
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:08,528
And three more:
Paris, Tokyo and London.

129
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:10,408
And you're blond.

130
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:12,518
Yeah, strange.

131
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:15,449
Wait, you had time
to go to work already?

132
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:18,203
Well, actually, I woke up there.
But it was amazing.

133
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,519
I had all these assistants
and this huge office.

134
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:22,919
And I have a chauffeur,
and he is so totally hot.

135
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:27,120
How'd you do?

136
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:30,844
Is that a good thing or...?

137
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:34,126
Well, if you ignore
my apparently failed marriage,

138
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:36,120
the fact that I'm still living
in the manor...

139
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:38,200
Wait. You're married?

140
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:41,561
- Was. My daughter is on her way...
- Wait.

141
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:43,162
Stop right there.
You have a daughter?

142
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:47,768
Yeah. And she's... She's beautiful.

143
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:49,647
Of course she is.

144
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:50,924
What's her name?

145
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,488
Oh, God. I don't know.
But, Prue, she has powers.

146
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:59,005
But for some reason I told her
not to use them. Why would I do that?

147
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:03,606
Speaking of why,
why are we in our future bodies?

148
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:06,562
I mean, I thought that we were just
supposed to come here and see them.

149
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:08,401
Well, apparently going to the past

150
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:10,048
isn't the same as going to the future.

151
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:12,639
I just wish that since
we are in our future bodies

152
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:14,128
we could remember
what's happened

153
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:16,484
in the last ten years,
like how I got a daughter.

154
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,800
Okay, wait a second.
If I'm in my future body,

155
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:21,960
and you are in your future body,

156
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:23,608
then that means that Phoebe...

157
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:28,002
- Oh, TV. Louder. Louder.
- Command recognized.

158
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:30,763
- Execution. We're less than
eight hours away now

159
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,647
until the burning of Phoebe Halliwell,

160
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:35,721
the witch accused of murdering
Cal Greene six months ago.

161
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:38,483
Eight hours? We were supposed
to be here two weeks before.

162
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:43,039
Let's go there now, live, where
Sierra Stone is standing by. Sierra?

163
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:45,518
San Francisco district attorney
Nathanial Pratt,

164
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:47,486
whose discovery of the witch
last August

165
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:49,799
has made him an early favourite
for the governor's seat,

166
00:11:49,969 --> 00:11:52,324
just came out to make a statement.
Let's listen in.

167
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:57,119
This is a reflection of our citizens'
resolve to ferret out the hidden evil,

168
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,603
to turn fear into fight,
and to band together as one.

169
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:05,841
To cleanse our city
of its greatest threat.

170
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:10,964
Tonight, Phoebe Halliwell
will burn for her crime.

171
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:15,805
And when she does, let that be
a warning to other witches out there.

172
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,288
You're next.

173
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:33,767
Oh, surprise.
Here we go up the stairs,

174
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:35,681
into the attic,
grabbing the Book of Shadows.

175
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:38,727
Please tell me we're still not
gonna be doing this in ten years.

176
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,800
- Apparently not.
- What?

177
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,687
- The book is gone.
- It's got to be here.

178
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:44,919
We need it to find the return spell.

179
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,284
- Prue...
- Piper, just help me look for it.

180
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:50,327
- Okay, relax. We'll find it.
- You don't know that.

181
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:52,639
I mean, what if it's lost?
What if we can't find it?

182
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:55,801
Then we're stuck in our future bodies
with no way of getting out of them

183
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:57,243
and no way of saving Phoebe.

184
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:07,406
- Been working out?
- Well, I guess that's a little sample

185
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:09,207
of what ten years does to our powers.

186
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:11,007
And to our attic.

187
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,567
A key.

188
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,839
It's the key to my wall safe
at Buckland's.

189
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:25,802
Do you think that means it's there?

190
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:28,005
We've never taken the book
out of the house before.

191
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:30,603
Yeah, we haven't, but maybe
our future selves have.

192
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,442
- The question is why.
- We don't even know what we're like

193
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,361
in this time period,
let alone what we think.

194
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,447
But if the book is at Buckland's,
maybe it will give us some answers.

195
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,088
All right, then we go there first.

196
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:42,638
Then to Phoebe to see
if she's all right.

197
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:44,367
Sorry about the mess.

198
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:50,642
Hello.

199
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54,526
Hello.

200
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,761
Could somebody
please answer me?

201
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:00,443
I really need to talk to someone.

202
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:07,563
Okay. How about a snack?
Maybe some crackers, peanuts?

203
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:09,568
Something?

204
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:16,080
A tray full of goo?
Hey, wait a minute...

205
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:25,481
- Don't I even get a phone call?
- Shut up, witch.

206
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:34,558
I can't believe you get a limo
and a driver,

207
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:37,562
- and I've still got my same old car.
- You have a husband.

208
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:40,641
Had a husband, you mean.
I'm getting divorced, remember?

209
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:43,528
And how do you know
you don't have a guy in this time?

210
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:46,999
I mean, after all, I have a kid
and an ex, you could have several.

211
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:49,125
- Ex's?
- No, kids.

212
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:52,361
I mean, we're in the future but with
no memory of the past ten years.

213
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:54,247
I don't even know
who my ex-husband...

214
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:06,604
Okay, apparently my power isn't
the only one that's grown.

215
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:09,198
- You just froze...
- Everything.

216
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:12,566
- What a difference a decade makes.
- What the hell are you doing?

217
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:15,643
Leo, I'm so glad you're here,
I have so many...

218
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:17,837
What's wrong?

219
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:19,920
I knew you'd do
something stupid like this.

220
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:22,678
You used your magic in public?
What's the matter with you?

221
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,527
- Are you insane?
- Leo...

222
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:26,361
Remember, he thinks
we know what's going on.

223
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:27,962
You want to end up like your sister?

224
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:30,040
We had an agreement,
no magic for Melinda's sake.

225
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:32,963
- Melinda?
- Our daughter. What's wrong?

226
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:36,485
- Our daughter?
- Wait a second. You're Piper's ex?

227
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:42,601
Witch!

228
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:45,329
- Okay, what is going on here?
- Prue.

229
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:50,762
Over there. Witch! Witch!

230
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,124
Hurry, we gotta get
out of here before they see you.

231
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,280
- "They"?
- The witch hunters.

232
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:08,005
Prue? Piper?

233
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:11,479
They haven't been to visit you before.
Why would they come now?

234
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:14,407
No...

235
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:17,402
...they're going to be as happy
to get rid of you as I am.

236
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:19,044
Who are you?

237
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:23,126
I'm sorry, it's been so long
since our last visit.

238
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:27,567
Executions are a bitch to plan.
Logistics, alerting the media,

239
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:28,923
gathering the kindling.

240
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:37,601
You know, I've had a lot of time

241
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:40,926
to do some thinking about...

242
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:44,367
...why I'm here.
- Well...

243
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:46,838
...no amount of thinking
will change the outcome.

244
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,204
Justice will be served
for your crime.

245
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:52,122
But it wasn't really
a big crime, was it?

246
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,121
You are truly evil.

247
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,244
What bigger crime is there
than taking a man's life?

248
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:09,237
I killed someone?

249
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:15,838
Phoebe, what is this? An attempt
to stay your execution? Plead insanity?

250
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:18,401
It won't work.

251
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:23,927
- You have five hours to live.
- What? Five hours?

252
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,442
But that's not possible.

253
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,642
Well...

254
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:32,807
...l'm happy to see the seriousness
of your crime has finally hit you.

255
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,281
See...

256
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:41,240
...you represent everything I abhor.
You're a threat.

257
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:44,640
A danger to everything that is good
and pure in our world.

258
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:47,041
You're talking out of fear.

259
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,527
Just because you don't understand
something doesn't make it evil.

260
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:52,407
No, it's you
who doesn't understand.

261
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:53,922
You killed a man using your power,

262
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,920
and now you're gonna die
because of it.

263
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:58,967
I only wish that I could burn
all of your kind with you.

264
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,164
But don't worry...

265
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:07,883
...in time I will.

266
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:09,562
This is only the beginning.

267
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:22,723
Leo, listen to me.

268
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:25,528
The two of us, the Prue and Piper
that you see before you,

269
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:28,283
are from the past.
From ten years ago.

270
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:32,608
- So we have no idea what is going on.
- Don't even lie to me.

271
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,248
All right, Phoebe is set to die today,

272
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:36,923
and I only hope that this madness
dies with her.

273
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:40,206
All right, these people are in danger
because of the witch trials she started.

274
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,405
How? How did she start them?

275
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:44,480
You know, I don't know
what you hope to accomplish

276
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:46,640
by pretending not to know.

277
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:57,086
You haven't kissed me
like that since...

278
00:18:57,249 --> 00:19:00,798
Since this morning, 1999, remember?
We were supposed to meet,

279
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:04,006
you had to leave, I went up to the attic
and this is where I came. The future.

280
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:07,525
If you don't believe me, at least
believe what you feel. Trust that.

281
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:13,766
I remember.

282
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:15,408
That day they sent me
to the attic

283
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:17,400
to open the Book of Shadows
to the future spell.

284
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:19,639
Wait, that was you?
We just assumed that it was Grams.

285
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:21,481
No, it was me.

286
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:22,923
But they didn't tell me why.

287
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:27,119
Wait, you don't know what's happened
the last ten years? Any of it?

288
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:30,880
These people...

289
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:32,558
They're here underground

290
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:35,527
because they've been
accused of practicing witchcraft.

291
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:38,006
- They're witches?
- Some of them.

292
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:41,559
Most of them
have been falsely accused.

293
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,562
But they're safe here for now.

294
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:48,082
- What did Phoebe do?
- Six months ago, she...

295
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:52,002
...killed a man, Cal Greene.

296
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:54,362
The baseball player?

297
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:59,364
No, this is crazy. I mean Phoebe
would never hurt anyone.

298
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:01,281
She hurt him.

299
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:02,882
Because he murdered someone.

300
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:05,040
Someone Phoebe cared about
very much.

301
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:07,928
A dear friend who he brutalized.

302
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:11,038
But a technicality set him free.

303
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:14,965
Phoebe was furious, outraged.

304
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:16,562
And that's when she crossed
the line

305
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:18,879
from protecting the innocent
to punishing the guilty.

306
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:21,961
She used her power to kill Greene,
got caught,

307
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:24,080
and her magic exposed
by Nathanial Pratt.

308
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:28,245
And this is the result, modern-day
witch trials with Pratt at the helm?

309
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:32,119
And Phoebe at the stake,
I don't buy it. Her power can't kill.

310
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:35,884
Well, it can now. It's been ten years,
all your powers have grown.

311
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:38,847
- We have to get to Phoebe to explain.
- You can't.

312
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:41,239
All right, as it stands,
you and Prue are safe.

313
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:44,162
Pratt checked you out, and he
doesn't suspect that you're witches.

314
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:46,285
To get to Phoebe,
you'd have to use your powers.

315
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:48,326
And they'll catch you,
then they'll kill you.

316
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:50,923
Leo, she's our sister,
we're not gonna let her die.

317
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:55,008
Wait. I'll go.

318
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:58,878
- Leo, this is our sister, we have to.
- No.

319
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,200
I'm still your guide. I can orb in
and keep you out of danger.

320
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:04,522
Then we'll go back to Buckland's

321
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:06,645
and get the book
and get the spell to send us home.

322
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,527
We'll meet you at the manor.

323
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:12,807
Leo...

324
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,924
We got married?

325
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:20,525
Piper, later.
There'll be plenty of time later.

326
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:35,406
Oh, Miss Halliwell.
Can you sign the PO for the new...?

327
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:38,084
People, give the woman some air.

328
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:42,322
She will meet with all of you
after lunch. Thank you.

329
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:47,524
Okay, good news first.

330
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:50,487
The acquisition paperwork
was approved and...

331
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:54,045
- Yes?
- I'm with her.

332
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:56,841
It's Piper.

333
00:21:57,569 --> 00:21:58,763
My sister?

334
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:01,565
Oh, right, sorry.

335
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:05,039
Almost forgot you had another one.
I mean, other than...

336
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:07,002
That's okay, I forgot your name too.

337
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:09,729
Anne, Miss Halliwell's
personal assistant.

338
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:15,404
Anne, right. My personal assistant.
By the way, Anne...

339
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:20,604
...do you know if my husband
called by any chance?

340
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:25,922
Husband, good one. Very funny.
Like you have the time.

341
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:29,126
Okay, I just need to get
your final okay on the acquisition.

342
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:31,484
Your sister was amazing.

343
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:33,879
I mean at first the board
was a little resistant,

344
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:37,837
what with the layoffs it would entail,
but Prue pushed it through.

345
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:39,244
I did?

346
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:41,400
I thought the "to hell
with the little people" part

347
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:45,721
- was particularly persuasive.
- Oh, okay. Anne, sweetie,

348
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:48,642
I really need some private time
with my sister so if you can just...

349
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:52,119
- No problem, just buzz me.
- Look at me.

350
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:55,201
All right, I am booked with work,
I am about to lay off

351
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:59,408
countless people with a flick
of my pen, no man to speak of...

352
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:01,207
Maybe you're just picky.

353
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:03,482
What's happened to me?

354
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:09,246
Okay, well, I could dwell
on the nightmare my life will become,

355
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:10,762
but we have work to do.

356
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:13,523
At least some things around here
haven't changed.

357
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,318
Okay, it should be after
the demon with the tusk

358
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:22,480
and before the spell
to discourage a lover.

359
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:29,759
- Where is it? It was here in l999.
- Yeah, and now it's gone.

360
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:32,204
So if the spell
can only be used once

361
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,963
that must mean that our future selves
have already used it.

362
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:39,327
- Which means...
- We have no way of getting home.

363
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:50,561
Leo. Oh, thank God. Look, I know
what they think I did, and if we just...

364
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,606
They'll hear you.

365
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:55,078
Where's the rest of the cavalry?

366
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:56,238
They're not coming.

367
00:23:57,009 --> 00:24:00,160
So, what, you'll grab me
and we'll just orb out or whatever,

368
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:03,207
- and we'll meet them back at the...
- Look, Phoebe...

369
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:04,484
I'm so sorry.

370
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:06,484
For what?

371
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:10,039
Did something happen to my sisters?

372
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:12,327
Nobody's gonna rescue you.

373
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:20,442
If that is some kind
of whitelighter humour,

374
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:23,726
let me be the first to tell you, you
are not a very funny race of people.

375
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:28,802
You know, I wish you remember
what you've done.

376
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:31,437
It would make this so much easier.

377
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:39,080
Your future self used witchcraft
for vengeance, Phoebe.

378
00:24:39,249 --> 00:24:41,558
Pratt is using that as a platform.

379
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:44,243
Why does everyone think
that I killed someone?

380
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:46,162
I wouldn't.

381
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:49,719
I mean, I couldn't. What did I do,
premonition the man to death?

382
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:52,608
- My power is passive.
- Not in the future.

383
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:56,558
It's grown. It's changed.
As have you.

384
00:24:57,129 --> 00:25:00,485
Which means, unfortunately,
you have to suffer the consequences.

385
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:03,041
No.

386
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:04,882
I don't believe it.

387
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:07,567
Then believe what you see.

388
00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:29,565
Oh, my God.

389
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,403
What have I done?

390
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:34,561
Leo?

391
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,559
Help me!

392
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:51,918
You wanna tell me again
exactly how screwed we are?

393
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:54,557
- Pretty screwed.
- Thanks.

394
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,558
- I wonder what's taking Leo so long.
- You know...

395
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:02,642
...some of these pages are marked.

396
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:07,401
The top corners are turned down,
and all of them are new spells.

397
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:09,127
Such as?

398
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:11,962
Like, here's a spell to create a door.

399
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:16,277
One to induce slumber, a glamour
to change one's appearance.

400
00:26:17,689 --> 00:26:19,998
Some of them have
these little baggies attached.

401
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:22,558
Those must be potions
of some kind.

402
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:27,085
But what about these?
I mean, there's...

403
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:29,080
Okay, one to create money,

404
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:34,883
to bend someone's will,
to erase a memory, a binding spell.

405
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:37,005
Binding? What are all these
marked for?

406
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,127
This must have been
our future selves' plan.

407
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:41,881
Here's a prison map.

408
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:45,086
We were gonna use all of this
to break Phoebe out.

409
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:47,046
But something is bothering me.
I mean, clearly,

410
00:26:47,209 --> 00:26:49,643
some of these spells
are for personal gain.

411
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:53,121
Which would break the most basic
of Wiccan rules. We wouldn't do that.

412
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:54,802
We wouldn't.

413
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:58,200
But maybe in ten years
our future selves would for Phoebe.

414
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:02,804
Perfect timing, we found the book,
but we can't...

415
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,368
- Where's Phoebe?
- Where is she?

416
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:06,838
In prison where she belongs.

417
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:09,324
Leo, you were supposed
to bring her back here.

418
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:11,605
No, I said I'd go to her.

419
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:14,721
And I did, to explain to her
why she has to pay for her crime.

420
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:16,806
You're our guide,
you're supposed to protect us,

421
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,358
- and you're just gonna let her die?
- You're signing her death warrant.

422
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:23,408
I am trying to protect the greater good.
All right, if Phoebe lives,

423
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:27,198
if you use your magic to save her,
then the persecutions will continue.

424
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:30,722
And our daughter will grow
into a world where her power

425
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:32,766
is punishable by death.
Do you want that?

426
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:35,887
- Of course not.
- Well, then it has to end with Phoebe.

427
00:27:36,209 --> 00:27:38,803
- She has to die.
- Like hell.

428
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:41,848
Prue, relax.

429
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:44,728
We've seen what your new powers
can do when you're angry.

430
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:47,406
He's gonna stay frozen, right?

431
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:50,928
If he knows what's good for him,
he'll stay frozen.

432
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:52,568
All right, let's get these spells.

433
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:05,762
Now, some people
say this is a victory for me,

434
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:10,684
but I say it is a victory for us all.
For today,

435
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:15,804
a blight on everything that is good
in our world will be extinguished.

436
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:21,919
Tonight, the witch will burn!

437
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:30,245
Piper, if you're gonna do this,
you better hurry.

438
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,479
Leo can unfreeze and be home
any second.

439
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:34,840
Besides, Phoebe has less
than an hour.

440
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:13,119
Can't do it, can you?

441
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:15,962
No.

442
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:19,641
Our grandmother did it to us
for protection.

443
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:24,246
You don't have to bind
her powers, Piper.

444
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:28,158
We agreed that I'd take care of her,
and I will, I promise.

445
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:30,765
I know you will.

446
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:34,200
So we were together.

447
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:37,202
Does that mean you clipped
your wings for me?

448
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:40,522
No.

449
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:43,400
You wouldn't let me.

450
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:46,401
We...

451
00:29:46,969 --> 00:29:50,678
...tried to make it work
with our powers.

452
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,208
But it didn't, and then this
all happened, and...

453
00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:01,161
Were we happy?
Just for a little while, were we happy?

454
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,601
Very.

455
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:18,319
Are you gonna try and stop us?

456
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:21,208
I can't do that.

457
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:26,400
Then I hope you understand
why I have to do what I'm doing.

458
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:29,883
Yeah.

459
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:33,087
What are we gonna do?

460
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,246
What we always do.

461
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:43,087
Talk about it later.

462
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,127
What is it? What's wrong?

463
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:08,801
I have no one to say goodbye to.

464
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:11,601
No life.

465
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:15,724
They didn't even know who you were
at the office, my own sister.

466
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:19,406
If we die tonight,
my tombstone will read,

467
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:21,804
"Here lies Prue. She worked hard."

468
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:24,047
We're not gonna die.

469
00:31:24,209 --> 00:31:26,200
We're gonna find a way
back to the present,

470
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:28,320
and we'll create a new future.

471
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:30,963
What if we can't?
What if we can never get home?

472
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:32,966
According to Phoebe's premonition,
we fail.

473
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:37,121
Our future selves fail.
We've still got a shot.

474
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:42,279
You're right. You're right.

475
00:31:42,449 --> 00:31:45,202
All right, let's go get Phoebe.

476
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:56,846
So far, so good.

477
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,240
Don't people normally
break out of prison?

478
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:02,280
Nothing about this is normal.

479
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:08,768
"To create a door."
Okay, but where?

480
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:11,358
- No place like here.
- Okay.

481
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:18,400
Kind of small for us, don't you think?

482
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:22,284
When you find your path is blocked
All you have to do is knock

483
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:43,844
- Freeze.
- Good idea.

484
00:32:44,969 --> 00:32:46,402
All right.

485
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:49,607
Her cell should be
up those stairs. Come on.

486
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:56,441
She'll be guarded.
Are we ready for this?

487
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:58,480
Do we have a choice?

488
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:04,486
We're too late.

489
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:49,925
I love the smell of burnt witch
in the morning.

490
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:53,842
At least I'm paying for my crime.

491
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:56,963
There'll come a day
when you'll have to pay for yours too.

492
00:33:59,129 --> 00:34:01,120
Remorseless to the end, huh?

493
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:11,205
Let today be a lesson to all those
who would seek to defy human nature

494
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:12,484
with their way of life.

495
00:34:12,689 --> 00:34:14,566
Let today serve notice

496
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:17,727
that black magic will not be tolerated
in our society.

497
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:22,286
And let today be remembered
as the day we burned the witch!

498
00:34:24,249 --> 00:34:26,080
Piper, freeze him.

499
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,442
Prue, Piper.

500
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:32,158
- Come on, we're getting out of here.
- No, wait. You can't.

501
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:34,724
- Prue, I'm serious.
- What are you talking about?

502
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:39,366
You guys have to leave.
I deserve to be here.

503
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:42,447
Or my future self does.

504
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:45,402
But you killed a killer.
Don't be ridiculous.

505
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:50,808
Look, this is Pratt's personal crusade.
This isn't about us, it is about him.

506
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:53,125
Wherever we go, he will follow us.

507
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:56,162
He will hunt us,
he will hunt our families.

508
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:58,724
If anybody should be punished,
it should be him.

509
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:03,443
- Prue, what are you doing?
- Saving the future good witches

510
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:06,123
- and our future.
- Prue, wait.

511
00:35:06,889 --> 00:35:10,199
Don't. Don't become a murderer too.

512
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:12,641
It has to end with me.

513
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:17,323
Phoebe, he was evil,
he deserved what...

514
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:20,447
The wrong thing done for
the right reason is still the wrong thing.

515
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:28,166
Our job is to protect the innocent,
not punish the guilty.

516
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:32,999
And I crossed that line,
and I know that.

517
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:36,923
And now you guys
have to know that too.

518
00:35:40,689 --> 00:35:42,281
We are not leaving here without you.

519
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:50,798
Prue, we were sent here
for a reason.

520
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:54,048
Maybe not to stop this
like what we thought,

521
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:58,928
but maybe to understand
why this has to happen.

522
00:36:03,009 --> 00:36:05,125
Why you have to let this happen.

523
00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:09,528
I don't want to die.

524
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:13,885
But I don't want you to die
because of me.

525
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:29,124
I love you.

526
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:24,482
Prue.

527
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:29,085
What are we doing here?

528
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,007
Phoebe?

529
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:35,207
You don't think she was...?
I mean, we saw...

530
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:39,482
I know. I know. Oh, please, God,
don't let it be true. Phoebe.

531
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:50,401
We thought that we had lost you.

532
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:53,121
You did.

533
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,481
I was burning.

534
00:37:57,049 --> 00:38:02,840
And I could... I could feel
the flames on my skin.

535
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:06,200
And then l... I was here.

536
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,842
I don't know what happened.

537
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,042
It's okay, you're safe now,
you're home.

538
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:13,399
Yeah, home, but when?

539
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,121
And Cal Greene tied a record
by smashing his sixth grand slam

540
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,321
- of the year today, making...
- Wait, that's the baseball player.

541
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:23,880
That's what triggered
my premonition.

542
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:25,841
We're back where we started.

543
00:38:26,049 --> 00:38:27,528
The day we cast the spell.

544
00:38:28,249 --> 00:38:29,364
Why?

545
00:38:29,929 --> 00:38:31,328
Maybe because it worked.

546
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:34,202
We were sent into the future
to find out what Phoebe did.

547
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:37,242
Maybe we came back
to stop it from happening.

548
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:40,926
But we didn't cast a spell to come
back. We didn't even have one.

549
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:43,001
Maybe they sent us back.

550
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:45,445
But who? And why today?

551
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:47,725
If we were sent back to keep
the future from happening,

552
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:51,888
shouldn't we have been sent back
to the day Phoebe killed Cal Greene?

553
00:38:56,449 --> 00:38:57,438
Not again.

554
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:02,405
This guy still hasn't learned
his lesson.

555
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:05,724
Apparently, neither have we.

556
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:08,525
I think this is why we
were sent back here,

557
00:39:08,689 --> 00:39:12,159
to this moment in time.
This is where it all started.

558
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:14,758
The first time we used
our magic for revenge.

559
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:18,686
But it's just a little thing,
it's harmless.

560
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:20,441
Yeah, but once you break
the small rules,

561
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:23,840
it's just a matter of time
before the big ones are next.

562
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:25,882
A very smart girl once told me

563
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:29,644
that we're supposed to protect
the innocent, not punish the guilty.

564
00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:31,727
I haven't told you yet.

565
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:34,882
Now maybe you won't have to.

566
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,281
Pratt.

567
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:51,079
- Do you think we should follow?
- No.

568
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:54,163
Our little act of revenge
might have been what sent Pratt

569
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:55,603
on his path to seek his own.

570
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:58,602
Which might have led him to start
the future witch trials.

571
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:00,760
Hopefully now he won't.

572
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,602
I still think we should keep an eye
on him, just in case.

573
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,805
Absolutely.

574
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:09,004
Hey, what's up?

575
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:12,725
Not work. There is no way
I'm going to the office tonight.

576
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:14,208
I'm going out with you guys.

577
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:15,768
We all have a lot
of changes to make

578
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:18,159
if we want to avoid ending up
where we just came from.

579
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:19,603
Hey, the future wasn't all bad,

580
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:23,205
you were like Miss Fortune 500.
And I had a beautiful little girl.

581
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:26,084
- What?
- Details later.

582
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:28,359
We can still make
the good things happen, Piper.

583
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:30,838
We just have to make
the right choices.

584
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:33,245
So maybe Leo and I
will end up together.

585
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:35,964
Wait, you and Leo?

586
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:37,960
Speak of the angel. I'll get that.

587
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:42,202
Hey, stranger.

588
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,768
I would have settled
for a nice hello.

589
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:56,124
Didn't anybody
ever tell you not to settle?

590
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:57,768
That's a good lesson.

591
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:00,160
I've been learning
a lot of them lately.

592
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:02,161
So I've heard.

593
00:41:04,169 --> 00:41:06,239
Honestly, I didn't know
you'd be sent to the future.

594
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:08,525
I don't even know what happened
when you got there.

595
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:11,487
All I was told is that apparently
you had something to learn.

596
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:15,761
- So that's why you're here?
- No.

597
00:41:15,929 --> 00:41:17,157
That's why you're here.

598
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:19,880
You three were given a glimpse
of your future

599
00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:21,402
to learn a valuable lesson.

600
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:23,722
And I'm glad you learned it too,

601
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:26,608
because they wouldn't have
brought you back if you hadn't.

602
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:30,000
Speaking of which, they're making me
work tonight so I can't really...

603
00:41:30,169 --> 00:41:32,524
This is always gonna be
a problem for us, isn't it?

604
00:41:33,769 --> 00:41:35,566
I'm willing to work on it.

605
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:38,767
Good. Don't ever forget
you said that.
