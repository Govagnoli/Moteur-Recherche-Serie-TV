1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,634
Can you hand me that tyre iron?

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,303
Yeah, sure. Here.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,388
That's a lug bolt.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,391
It's all right. I got it.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,143
That's a tyre iron?

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,189
Well, I... I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,192
I mean, I probably
could've just called a tow truck.

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,654
It's no problem. Too bad
you didn't get this before class.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,533
Could've avoided Dr Rousseau's
lecture on cognitive dissonance.

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,618
Yeah, pretty dull.

11
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,328
Thought about leaving, but...

12
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,373
I felt bad about skipping class,
so I ended up staying.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,542
To avoid your own dissonance?

14
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,088
You're pretty good
at this psychology stuff.

15
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,674
- You should read my column.
- I do.

16
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,345
Why don't we get together
sometime and study?

17
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:59,101
Well, I may not know the difference
between a lug bolt and a tyre iron,

18
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:02,729
but I do believe that you
just asked me out on a date, Tim.

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,067
Yeah, so...

20
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,236
How about dinner tomorrow night?

21
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:15,325
Okay. But it's my treat.
It's the least I can do.

22
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,620
- Deal.
- You're gonna take me up on that?

23
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,414
It's reverse psychology.

24
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,253
Whoa.

25
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,853
Tim! Tim!

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,814
Help! Somebody help me!

27
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,292
Phoebe, what happened? Paige
called and said you were attacked.

28
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,878
No, I wasn't. A guy from my class was.

29
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,589
- Is he okay?
- No.

30
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,758
- He's dead.
- Oh, God!

31
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,468
It was so weird.

32
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:43,932
One second he was helping me
with my flat tyre, and then the next...

33
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,185
And I don't get it.

34
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,063
The demon didn't seem interested in me.
He went right after Tim.

35
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,318
- Did you find anything in the Book?
- It was a raptor demon. A hired gun.

36
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,527
Hired by who?

37
00:03:55,694 --> 00:04:00,032
That's what we're trying to figure out.
Paige's trying to find a lead.

38
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,493
I just don't understand
why he attacked him.

39
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,079
There's a reason.
How well did you know him?

40
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,291
We sat next to each other in class
and, you know,

41
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,169
talked occasionally and flirted a bit.

42
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,797
In fact, he asked me out
on a date for tomorrow night.

43
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,510
It's just my luck, huh?

44
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,847
Phoebe, stop it. It's not like
you're cursed or something.

45
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,183
We don't know that. I might be cursed.

46
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,976
We don't know what's going on.

47
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,729
Tim could have been a witch,
or another demon.

48
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,023
No, he's definitely not a demon.

49
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,943
Okay, then there's
probably another reason.

50
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,946
I don't know, but what
I do know is it's not your fault.

51
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:47,079
Look, why don't you call Darryl and see
if he can do a background check on Tim.

52
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,540
Maybe you should go to the morgue to see

53
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,959
if you can get
a premonition from his body.

54
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,335
I don't wanna see him.

55
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,421
What if it's the only way
to find out why he was killed?

56
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,007
Okay.

57
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,135
You keep checking the Book.

58
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,513
Sure.

59
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,608
Impressive.

60
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,695
Most impressive.

61
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,240
But you're gonna learn to like me yet.

62
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,718
Well, it's about time.

63
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,553
Where's the body?

64
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,265
- Why didn't you bring it?
- Patience, my old friend.

65
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,727
Have I ever failed
to deliver on a promise?

66
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,020
I don't know.

67
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:58,066
It has been an eternity
since we... worked together.

68
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,903
Yes, those were the days. The Crusades,

69
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,488
the September massacres,
the Black Plague.

70
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,116
- Good times.
- Good times, good times.

71
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,827
- So let's get on with it already.
- No.

72
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,080
No. It's taken me
months to get this far.

73
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,042
I'm not gonna blow it all now
by moving too quickly.

74
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,877
You gotta understand,

75
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,172
when the dead are involved,
I get a little... excited.

76
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,259
That's exactly why you'll never
become anything more than an Alchemist.

77
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,929
You're unable to see the bigger picture.

78
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:31,099
- And you can?
- I study the sisters.

79
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:35,103
With all the knowledge I've gained,
I'm gonna shake them to their core.

80
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,981
Make them more vulnerable
than they've ever been.

81
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,442
That's why you had
Phoebe's friend killed.

82
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,612
It seemed a little petty of you.

83
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,991
But he served a much greater purpose.

84
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,330
Imagine how upset Phoebe
will be when she realises...

85
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,833
...he died just because he knew her.

86
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,920
Imagine how cursed she will feel.

87
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,508
Do you really think that's enough
to make them vulnerable?

88
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,009
Of course not.

89
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:11,181
If I am to get what I'm after,
I'm going to have to attack them all.

90
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,893
Not as witches, but as women.

91
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,774
Phoebe, I'll meet you at the morgue.
This isn't a good idea.

92
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,026
Are you ready to go?

93
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,823
Sheila... Honey...

94
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:32,035
Darryl, please don't
tell me you have to work.

95
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:36,874
- We bought tickets three months ago.
- Listen, I know. I'm really sorry.

96
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,752
- Why don't you take your friend Nadine?
- That's who I took last time.

97
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,423
- Can't you get somebody to cover?
- Not on this one I can't.

98
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,343
- It's the sisters, isn't it?
- Yeah.

99
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,846
- They okay?
- Lieutenant, we need to talk.

100
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:54,099
A Halliwell has reported
yet another suspicious murder.

101
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,852
Inspector Sheridan,
you've met my wife Sheila?

102
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,522
No, actually.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

103
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,858
- I'm surprised we haven't met.
- We did.

104
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,819
Six months ago at the medal ceremony?

105
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,533
That must have been before I got hurt.

106
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,745
Yeah, I've been having
memory problems since then, so...

107
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,997
Really? Darryl never mentioned it.

108
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,583
You know what,
we really gotta be going now.

109
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,794
- Date night?
- It was.

110
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,172
Listen, I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

111
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,968
- What happened to her?
- You don't wanna know.

112
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,513
Darryl, what aren't you telling me?

113
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,767
Honey, I really have
to get to Phoebe. I'm sorry.

114
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,151
Hello? We're home!

115
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,404
Traffic was horrible.
We should've been home an hour ago.

116
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,783
We want a normal life.
That means we give up the cosmic taxi.

117
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,786
Doesn't mean I gave up
the right to complain about it.

118
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,163
Phoebe? Paige?

119
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,667
- Where do you want the party supplies?
- Put 'em on the table.

120
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,211
- I'm not sure we're gonna need 'em.
- Why not?

121
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,339
I don't know if it's right
to give Chris a birthday party

122
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:11,343
- when Phoebe's friend was just killed.
- We can't put everything on hold

123
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,554
- every time a demon attacks.
- Yeah...

124
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,807
- You guys just getting home?
- We started when you called,

125
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,434
but the freeway's a nightmare.
How's Phoebe?

126
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,311
- Not so good.
- Is she upstairs?

127
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,273
No, she's at the morgue.
I thought she said you knew.

128
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,109
How would I know?
I haven't talked to her.

129
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,780
- I'm kind of worried about Phoebe.
- Why?

130
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,991
I mean I know we've
seen a lot of deaths,

131
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,618
but she's taking
this one particularly hard.

132
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,080
I was talking to her on the phone
and she thinks she's cursed.

133
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,874
That's silly.

134
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,376
I know, but I'm thinking
if we can figure out

135
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,963
why this guy was killed, maybe
we can prove to her that she isn't?

136
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,675
- Find anything at Magic School?
- No. I'm not gonna be able to go back.

137
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,677
- I've got to meet Joanna.
- Joanna?

138
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,054
New charge. She's a Whitelighter-to-be.

139
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,433
She doesn't know magic exists
and thinks we're just friends.

140
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,269
Elders are worried
about her falling off the path.

141
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,771
I'm gonna guide her
in the right direction.

142
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,816
Go. The Elders wouldn't worry
unless they had reason.

143
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:11,195
- Piper and I are here. We can help.
- What about Chris's party?

144
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,989
- I think we're gonna have to postpone.
- What? No!

145
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,700
- No, Phoebe wouldn't want you to.
- I know, but...

146
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,162
We can make this work. I know we can.
Keep planning that party.

147
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,706
I'm gonna meet my charge,
give her a pep talk.

148
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,000
By the time Phoebe's back, I'll be home.

149
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,836
We can do this.

150
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:32,007
Mommy wants to teach you a new word.

151
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,592
It's called "denial."

152
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,767
Let's hurry and get out.
Sheridan's suspicious enough.

153
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:45,479
- I can't worry about her right now.
- Maybe you should worry.

154
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,690
That memory dust won't
matter anymore if this keeps up.

155
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,318
She's already linked you
to too many murders.

156
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,363
- It's getting harder to cover.
- I know, and I'm sorry.

157
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,865
She's got nothing.
She's going off a hunch.

158
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:01,203
But if we accidentally trigger
her memories, everything comes back.

159
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,290
And then that's it.
It's over. For all of us.

160
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,710
Well, maybe that's not such a bad thing.

161
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:13,173
- What do you mean by that?
- Nothing.

162
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,723
You sure you wanna do this?

163
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,268
Yeah...

164
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,229
I mean, I have to know what happened.

165
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:36,071
- Oh, God!
- Maybe we should go.

166
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,700
No...

167
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,743
I have to do this.

168
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,793
It looks like somebody
was trying to send a message.

169
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,380
What? Why would you say that?

170
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,340
It's vicious, it's calculated.

171
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,719
I see this all the time.

172
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,638
It's like he makes you
think twice when you see him.

173
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,891
Maybe that's the point.

174
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,896
Do demons send messages like this?

175
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,107
Well, if it is a message,
it's obviously for me.

176
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,861
I gotta go.

177
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,169
- Poor Phoebe...
- So troubled.

178
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,379
It's only gonna get worse for her.

179
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,758
So many bodies.

180
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,010
It's a shame to take just one.

181
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:44,389
Business first, pleasure later.
Can it be done?

182
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,103
Rigor hasn't set in yet.
It's barely a challenge.

183
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,731
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

184
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,525
Let's get to work.

185
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:04,576
It's the only thing that makes sense.
Tim was killed 'cause he was with me.

186
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,662
You don't know that for sure.

187
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,164
There has to be
some sort of an explanation.

188
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,458
- Okay?
- Well, I'm open to suggestions.

189
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,627
Phoebe, listen, we really have to go.

190
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,547
When I get home,
we'll figure out who sent the demon.

191
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,133
You need to get some rest.
That'd be the best thing for you now.

192
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,846
Rest? How am I supposed to rest
when I'm the reason that Tim's dead?

193
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,724
That's why you need some sleep,
'cause you are not thinking clearly.

194
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,726
Don't talk to me like I'm crazy!

195
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,687
I was there. I know what happened.

196
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:35,023
Fine. When I get home,
we will figure this out together.

197
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,151
But, for now, please,
please try to get some rest.

198
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,612
Take care, okay?

199
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:45,450
Listen... Phoebe,
don't do this to yourself.

200
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,996
It is not your fault.
There's nothing you could've done.

201
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,419
Hey. Sorry, that was my sister.

202
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,671
I might have to cut this a little short.

203
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,008
That's okay. Karl didn't want me
coming out tonight anyway.

204
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:04,595
- You're still seeing him?
- I know what you're gonna say, Paige,

205
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,973
- but he's a good guy. I swear.
- I'm just worried about you.

206
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,978
'Cause honestly, I kind of get
a little bit of a bad vibe from him.

207
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,439
But you don't know him like I do.

208
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,942
I know you've had a tough time lately,
and I don't wanna see you

209
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,029
- get hurt by this guy.
- I won't, I promise.

210
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:25,490
Trust me, he's the only thing
that's good in my life right now.

211
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,327
- Other than you, of course.
- Well, thank you.

212
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:32,331
Really. You've been such a good friend.
I don't know what I would've done

213
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:35,876
- without you the last few weeks.
- Sweetie, here's the thing.

214
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,670
You have an amazing future ahead of you.

215
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,007
You're just gonna
have to have a little faith.

216
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,425
Joanna.

217
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:49,890
- I told you I didn't want you with her.
- What're you doing?

218
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,392
- Getting her away from you.
- Don't be rude.

219
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,438
She's been trying to get between us
since day one. I know she has.

220
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,441
Look, come on, let's get out of here.

221
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,152
I... I'll be right there.

222
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,788
He probably just had
a bad day, that's all.

223
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,332
Yeah. I'm sure that's what it is.

224
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,043
You know, you don't have to go with him.

225
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:23,549
I'll be fine. I promise.

226
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,384
I'll call you later, okay?

227
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,242
It was your fault.

228
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,163
I died because of you.
Now I'm gonna make you pay!

229
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,253
- Phoebe, what's wrong? What is it?
- He's trying to kill me!

230
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,258
Who?

231
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:19,271
I'm telling you, he was there.
And he blamed me for letting him die.

232
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:22,065
And you're sure you
didn't just dream this?

233
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,860
I'm sure. How many times
do I have to tell you that?

234
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:29,364
It's a valid question, considering
Leo and I didn't see anybody.

235
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,408
That doesn't mean he wasn't there.

236
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:34,995
Okay, but isn't it possible
that maybe you were just dreaming?

237
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:39,124
Maybe it's your subconscious,
'cause you've been feeling guilty.

238
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,710
- It wasn't a dream.
- She might be right.

239
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:44,463
I found something
on the undead here in the Book.

240
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,382
- Undead, like zombies?
- According to the Book,

241
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:50,302
demonic alchemists have the ability
to control the undead,

242
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,596
but lack the power
to bring them to life.

243
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:55,057
They need a upper-level demon
for that.

244
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,017
Now we're looking for two demons?

245
00:16:57,184 --> 00:17:00,270
Which means Tim'll be back,
'cause he wants to make me pay.

246
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:04,066
- Who knows? Maybe I deserve it.
- Come on, you can't think like that.

247
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,944
If the demons are behind this
and controlling Tim,

248
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,030
- they're just trying to freak you out.
- It's working.

249
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:13,242
Which is why you need
to get back to business as usual,

250
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,203
before you drive yourself crazy.
Why don't you go to work?

251
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,706
- I don't wanna go to work.
- Might not be a bad idea.

252
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,417
It's public.
Nobody's gonna attack you there.

253
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,546
As soon as we come up with a plan,
I'll come get you.

254
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,549
Come on, you're not doing
anybody any good like this.

255
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,008
Just get up and go to work.

256
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:34,096
Okay. But if you find the Alchemist,
you have to come get me.

257
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,434
It's Joanna.

258
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,479
Now can we cancel Chris's party?

259
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,190
Before any walking dead crash it?

260
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,526
I guess we have to.

261
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:52,239
On the bright side, he's only one.
He's not gonna remember it.

262
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,283
We will.

263
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,370
She got in a big fight
with her boyfriend, she's upset.

264
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:00,455
- I have to go.
- A lover's spat?

265
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:04,293
That something her Whitelighter
needs to deal with? Especially now?

266
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,587
Her boyfriend.
I get a bad vibe from him.

267
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,590
- I feel like he's gonna hurt her.
- Then you should go.

268
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:16,096
And we should call Morris and make sure
that Tim's body is still in the morgue.

269
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:17,472
Or not.

270
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,607
You don't need to keep him like this.

271
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:31,778
Revive him.
I can control him.

272
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,156
I'll revive him when I'm ready.

273
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:36,783
But you've barely even used him.

274
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,578
I had to pull him out
before Piper saw him.

275
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:42,664
I can't allow the sisters
to figure us out too quickly.

276
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,416
They will in time.

277
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:48,837
Of course, but by then they won't
be able to ignore the emotional fallout.

278
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:53,842
Besides, right now your friend
there will only distract us.

279
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:59,056
- We need to keep our eye on the prize.
- Your prize! Not mine!

280
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:03,310
What if I were to give you a body
that's been dead quite a bit longer.

281
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,771
Would that satisfy your appetite?

282
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,899
Depends...
How long has he been dead?

283
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,151
Four years, give or take.

284
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:15,864
Was he embalmed?
Was the casket wood or metal?

285
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,658
Let's find out.

286
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:23,205
Metal. What do you know?

287
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:26,542
- Interested?
- You know me too well.

288
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:31,672
But why this body, out of all
the wonderful choices in the world?

289
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,883
As I said, I know the sisters.

290
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,595
This will help remind Phoebe
of the cost of the eternal fight.

291
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:41,640
Of all the innocents she failed to save.

292
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,727
That's hardly enough to make
all the sisters doubt themselves.

293
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,105
No, but as Phoebe
loses faith in herself,

294
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:51,817
she'll spread that feeling
to the other two. Starting with Paige,

295
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:55,237
who by then will be
ripe for a crisis of faith.

296
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,074
- I'll see to that.
- You better be sure about this.

297
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,742
Believe me, I am.

298
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:05,539
The sisters and the
Book of Shadows are linked.

299
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,250
Always have been.

300
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:13,922
By weakening them,
I'll weaken the Book's defences too.

301
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,593
Enough to make it mine.

302
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:27,019
- Damn it!
- I figured you'd come sooner or later.

303
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,773
- What are you doing here, Sheridan?
- The coroner called the captain.

304
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,026
Told him Tim Cross's body was missing.

305
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,403
And that you were
the last one to see it.

306
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:41,033
- You wanna tell me why you're here?
- I got an anonymous tip.

307
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,659
I decided to check it out.

308
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,496
Any chance that tip
came from a Halliwell?

309
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,457
- I said anonymous.
- I see.

310
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,754
Coroner also said that you
came by with a woman last night.

311
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,923
Phoebe Halliwell?

312
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,051
She was friends with the victim.
She needed closure.

313
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:00,802
She must need a lot of closure,

314
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,680
given the number of murders
she's been connected to.

315
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,850
Several of which
include law enforcement officers.

316
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:10,020
- Trudeau, Rodriguez...
- The sisters did not kill them.

317
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:11,355
Morris...

318
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,358
Darryl.

319
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,946
I know you're a good cop.
I can't believe you'd help killers.

320
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,323
I don't know what these women
have on you...

321
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,535
- They don't have anything.
- Why are you protecting them?

322
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:28,288
You know what you're doing to yourself?
To your career? Your family?

323
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,499
Your wife know the risk you're taking?

324
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,252
- Leave her out of this.
- Then come clean with me.

325
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,838
Tell me what you know.

326
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,423
Maybe I can help you
before it's too late.

327
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,261
Before you force me
to take you down too.

328
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:48,350
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna pull through this.

329
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:51,436
I'm not. This always happens.

330
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:55,107
Just when I think I've found
the right guy, it all falls apart.

331
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:58,318
But Karl might not be
the right guy for you.

332
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:01,697
You might really
be better off without him.

333
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:05,826
Why? So I can just be alone forever?

334
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:08,162
As if my life isn't bad enough already.

335
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,913
You can't talk like that.

336
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,583
- You can't just give up on yourself.
- Says who?

337
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,545
Sometimes I think maybe
the world'd be better off without me.

338
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:21,508
Now, that's absolutely not true. You're
gonna have to believe me on that one.

339
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:26,388
Now what?

340
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,307
Just give me a second, okay?

341
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:34,938
Hey, I thought you said
you could do this without me.

342
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,065
Well, you know, things change.

343
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:38,609
I just talked to Darryl.

344
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,402
Tim's body is missing.

345
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:43,572
Missing? I guess Phoebe
wasn't dreaming after all.

346
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:46,158
I'm gonna get to work
on a vanquishing potion

347
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,161
to get rid of the Alchemist.
Hopefully, if we do that,

348
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:52,039
it'll reverse his magic
and Tim can rest in peace.

349
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:56,627
We still don't know why the Alchemist's
doing this or who he's working with.

350
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,963
Well, we're just gonna have
to find him and make him tell us.

351
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,382
I need you to get Phoebe
and bring her home.

352
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,760
I don't wanna leave Joanna right now.

353
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:07,763
- Is it life or death?
- No.

354
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:11,558
Well, this is. Paige,
the faster we get rid of the demons,

355
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,769
the faster you can get to your charge.

356
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,105
Fine, I'll be there as soon as I can.

357
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:22,444
I'm gonna have to go.
I've got a bit of a family emergency.

358
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,572
What if Karl comes back?
I don't want to face him alone.

359
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:28,826
You won't have to. Just call me.
I'll be here in a second.

360
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:30,619
But what if you're far away?

361
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:33,956
If you really need me,
just yell my name loudly.

362
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,124
- But...
- No buts. It's okay.

363
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,127
You have to trust me.
I'm always watching out for you.

364
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,337
I promise.

365
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,674
Lock the door behind me.

366
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:46,927
If Karl comes by, do not open the door.

367
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:50,722
All right?
I'll be back as soon as I can.

368
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,027
What's the matter, Joanna?

369
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,989
I thought you loved being alone with me.

370
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,532
How did you get in here?

371
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,285
Magic.

372
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,209
Paige? Is that who
you're trying to call out for?

373
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,670
Well, I'm afraid Paige
has abandoned you.

374
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:23,839
But if it makes you feel any better,

375
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:26,967
I'm sure she'll be very upset
she had to miss this.

376
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,478
Send these Priority Mail. Actually,
overnight. These people need help.

377
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,939
- What are they?
- Advice to my readers.

378
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:44,610
- You're answering directly?
- Can only print so many in the paper.

379
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:48,030
Don't wanna let anybody down.
You can send my e-mails through.

380
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:51,325
You don't have to sort through them,
okay? Great, thanks.

381
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,582
- Thought she'd never leave.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

382
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:02,419
It's really busy today. Letters
don't answer themselves, you know.

383
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:05,047
- Great, you're feeling better then.
- Yeah.

384
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:07,674
I didn't wanna come in,
but you guys were right,

385
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,886
- it's really helped me a lot.
- Well, fantastic.

386
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:15,390
We should go, 'cause you told me to come
get you when we have something and...

387
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:18,477
- We have something.
- Can it wait?

388
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:20,479
Excuse me?

389
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:23,106
I have all these letters
that I have to answer.

390
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:26,068
Not to mention e-mails,
phone messages and faxes...

391
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:28,320
- So?
- These people need me.

392
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,656
I can't just let them down, you know.

393
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,827
- I see what's going on here, missy.
- What do you mean?

394
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:38,705
Nothing's going on, I'm just
helping innocents in need, that's all.

395
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:42,042
You're feeling guilty
and you're overcompensating.

396
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:45,045
That's ridiculous, I'm not.

397
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:48,924
I'm just doing my job. I thought
I was the one studying psychology.

398
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,009
I may not have studied psychology,

399
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:53,846
but I've studied you,
and this is classic Phoebe.

400
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:57,307
You're running from your pain.
You cannot run away from this.

401
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,518
Well, I can try, can't I?

402
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:11,280
He was just helping me
with a flat tyre, that's all.

403
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,992
He didn't do anything wrong.

404
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,661
He was just...

405
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,580
...with me.

406
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:23,167
And how am I supposed to deal with that?

407
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:28,172
Well, I think you deal with it
by vanquishing the demons responsible.

408
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:30,591
Making Tim's death count for something.

409
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:34,261
We don't know who's responsible,
or why they're doing this.

410
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:36,805
I'm starting to think
there's only one demon

411
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:39,433
who could be responsible for this.

412
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:45,355
Careful. Take it easy.

413
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:48,233
Careful. Not so much.

414
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:53,197
Yes, yes! He's alive!

415
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:58,076
Welcome back, Inspector.

416
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:01,747
Where am I?
What am I doing here?

417
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,041
Beginning your new life.

418
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:07,294
What's the last thing you remember?

419
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,546
You've been so brave, Inspector.

420
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,341
- Don't ruin it now.
- Open the gate!

421
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:16,178
A demon...

422
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:19,848
...attacked me. Bit me.
- It killed you.

423
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:23,352
More than four years ago.
I brought you back.

424
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:25,896
We brought you back.

425
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:27,439
I don't understand.

426
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:30,776
Well, then let us help you, my child.

427
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,821
You remember Phoebe Halliwell?

428
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:40,661
Miss Halliwell, I think you
know more than you're letting on.

429
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:43,747
You're scared.
You're afraid that if I find the truth,

430
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:46,333
you're gonna get in trouble.
Am I right?

431
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,670
I wish I could help you.
But I can't.

432
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:50,879
But I can't.

433
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:55,509
She could've warned you. Saved you.
Think of all that she cost you.

434
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:58,804
A wife, a family.

435
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:01,056
You were just doing your job.

436
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:03,725
It was quite selfish of her, really.

437
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:07,354
She lived on while they suffered,
grieving over your death.

438
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:10,816
It's time to even the score.

439
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:16,822
Zankou?

440
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:19,950
He's certainly powerful enough
to help the Alchemist.

441
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:22,828
He knows us well enough
to try something like this.

442
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:26,707
- Maybe he's finally going after us.
- Yeah, but why kill an innocent?

443
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:30,043
- Why not just come after me?
- Maybe he's trying to break you.

444
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,755
I'm beginning to like it better
when I thought I was cursed.

445
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:36,508
- You know you're not, right?
- Right, I do now.

446
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:39,720
- I should've listened to you yesterday.
- What do you mean?

447
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:42,014
You know, the talk we had in the attic.

448
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,019
Wait, was that not you?

449
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:50,314
It was probably Zankou,
he shapeshifted into us before.

450
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,691
Okay, well how do
I know this is you now?

451
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:54,902
How do I know you're not Zankou now?

452
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,945
- Because I'm not.
- Prove it.

453
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:00,532
Jake Singer. Back seat, tenth grade.

454
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:02,784
Can Zankou tell you all about that?

455
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:05,412
- I think I'm losing my mind.
- Where are you going?

456
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:09,791
To the Book. To find a way to vanquish
Zankou before I do lose my mind!

457
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:12,878
What are we gonna do about her?

458
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:16,089
The only thing we can do.
Help her vanquish Zankou.

459
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:19,259
Okay, well, then I guess
we won't be needing that potion.

460
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:23,180
Actually, we need to get to the
Alchemist who can lead us to Zankou.

461
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:25,599
Hopefully, when we
get rid of both of them,

462
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:28,393
Phoebe will be able to sleep again.

463
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:32,773
- Where's Phoebe going?
- Probably to a mental institution.

464
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,317
- You put the kids down for their nap?
- Yes.

465
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:38,612
And I started calling
our friends to cancel Chris's party.

466
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:42,282
- I'm sorry you guys had to do that.
- Next year, he'll have two.

467
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:45,077
I have to go check on Joanna.
Make sure she's okay.

468
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,538
- Okay, hurry back.
- I will.

469
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:55,087
Hey Joanna, it's me, Paige.
I'm back.

470
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,798
Joanna, open up.

471
00:29:57,965 --> 00:29:59,550
You okay?

472
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,720
I told you to keep the door locked.

473
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:06,640
Oh, God.

474
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:15,065
I'm so sorry.

475
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:17,568
I'm so sorry.

476
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:29,663
Lieutenant. We've been waiting for you.

477
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:32,332
Sheila.

478
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:35,836
What are you doing here?
What's wrong?

479
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:39,298
I called her. I thought
that someone should fill her in.

480
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:40,757
And I'm glad she did.

481
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:43,760
At least somebody's
telling me what's going on.

482
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:46,430
- You're way out of line on this one.
- Am I?

483
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,933
I'll leave you two alone to talk.

484
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:56,648
What did she tell you?

485
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:59,735
She said you could
lose your job or go to prison.

486
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:04,114
- How could you hide this?
- I'm trying to protect you.

487
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,617
I wanna know when I'm gonna lose you.

488
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:10,120
- You are not about to lose me.
- You don't know that!

489
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,041
Did you say anything to her about them?

490
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:16,001
Don't worry, I kept their secret.

491
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:18,795
I always will, no matter what happens.

492
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:22,090
Come on, Darryl. I know
you've had to struggle with this,

493
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:24,676
with how far you can go
to help the sisters.

494
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:28,597
- Baby, I'm so past that.
- No, you're not. How can you be?

495
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:34,353
I used to stay up late worrying
because of all the criminals out there.

496
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,606
That is nothing compared
to what I have to worry about now!

497
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:41,026
- This is not the time or the place.
- No? When is the time?

498
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:44,321
When I bring our kids to jail
to see you or to your funeral?

499
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:49,076
This is not your fight, Darryl.
It's theirs.

500
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:56,667
That's them, isn't it?

501
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:01,213
Please don't answer that, Darryl.
I'm begging you.

502
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:06,009
Come on, Darryl, pick up the phone.

503
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,683
Sheila, baby. They are in trouble.

504
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,352
So are we.

505
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:20,148
It's our family or theirs.

506
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,570
Darryl's not answering.

507
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,447
How can he not answer?

508
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,992
I'm beginning to think
he can't help anyway.

509
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,246
I have to call the police. I can't
let Karl just get away with this.

510
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:38,208
I should have been there with her.
I should not have left her alone.

511
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:42,421
You can't blame yourself. You have
responsibilities you can't ignore.

512
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:46,133
You said I'm supposed
to sense my charges, and I didn't.

513
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,511
- Tell me what's wrong with me.
- Nothing is wrong with you.

514
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:53,765
It takes time to form the bond
between charges and Whitelighters.

515
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:55,559
That's not good enough.

516
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:58,478
I promised her that
I was gonna be there and I failed!

517
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,105
No, you didn't, sweetie.

518
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:02,566
I think Zankou wants you
to think you did.

519
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,610
- Zankou?
- It has to be him.

520
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:08,238
First Phoebe's friend, now her charge.
Can't be a coincidence.

521
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:12,784
- Karl's working with Zankou?
- I think he is Zankou.

522
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:15,496
Think about it,
he knew exactly what he was doing.

523
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:19,791
- He's targeting people in our lives.
- Well, what good would that do?

524
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:23,795
I don't know. Maybe if he thinks
we're rattled, we'll be vulnerable.

525
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:26,465
- No one in your life's been targeted.
- Not yet.

526
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:29,718
That's why you need to get Leo
and the boys to Magic School.

527
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:33,472
I'm not gonna run and hide
every time a demon attacks.

528
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:38,477
Leo, this is not just another demon,
and this is not about you hiding.

529
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:40,979
This is about the safety of our family.

530
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:42,689
You need to go. Now.

531
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:46,777
All right. I'll get the boys.

532
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,031
Piper, what about
the other people in your life?

533
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:55,369
The best way to protect them is
to get Zankou. For that we need Phoebe.

534
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:07,464
Piper?

535
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:09,967
- Paige?
- Guess again.

536
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:14,680
Who are you?
What do you want?

537
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:17,182
What you took from me! My life!

538
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:21,311
What's the matter?
Don't you recognise me?

539
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:24,481
- Inspector Davidson?
- In the flesh.

540
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:29,319
- What's left of it.
- Oh, no. Not again.

541
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:32,948
Hold on, hold on.
I wanna talk to you!

542
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:37,494
- I think you owe me that much.
- Who did this to you? Zankou?

543
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,246
I didn't get a name.

544
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:42,124
It was obviously someone
who knows you pretty well.

545
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:45,460
Don't worry, death's not so bad.

546
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:48,672
- I think you're gonna like it.
- I tried to save you.

547
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,175
- You should've tried harder!
- I couldn't.

548
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:53,802
- The angel of death was after you.
- At the end.

549
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:56,138
You're forgetting the months before.

550
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:58,682
All those times
I asked you to come clean!

551
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:02,811
- If you told me the truth just once!
- I couldn't. I'm sorry.

552
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:07,232
Did you go to my funeral?
Did you see my wife, my kids?

553
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:10,402
They're growing up
without a father because of you.

554
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,697
- I'm so sorry.
- I bet you are, now.

555
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:16,992
You're gonna be even more sorry
when I'm through with you.

556
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:19,495
Paige!

557
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:21,872
Piper! Piper!

558
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:24,333
He's right behind me.
Get him! Get him!

559
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:27,961
Phoebe, there's no one there.

560
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:32,591
He was there. I swear it.

561
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:34,510
Who?

562
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:37,137
Inspector Davidson.

563
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:39,431
Reece Davidson?

564
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:42,851
He died four years ago.

565
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:07,292
Getting closer.

566
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:12,089
I guess I'm gonna have
to kick things up a notch.

567
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:22,015
It's clear.

568
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:25,185
- No one dead or undead.
- You sure?

569
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:29,314
- Pretty sure, unless they're invisible.
- Think they could be invisible?

570
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:32,901
No. Come on, we gotta find
the Alchemist and, hopefully, Zankou.

571
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:34,444
Paige!

572
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:38,157
I was getting Leo and the boys
settled in at Magic School.

573
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:41,118
I need you to see
if you can find Joanna, quickly.

574
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:44,246
- I thought I told you, she's dead.
- Yeah, not for long.

575
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:47,499
- Think Joanna's gonna come back too?
- I'm counting on it.

576
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:50,127
So, you need to see
if you can sense her.

577
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:53,630
Anything?

578
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:57,009
No, but Leo said
our bond hadn't fully formed yet.

579
00:36:57,176 --> 00:37:01,013
Okay, then we're gonna have to
scry for her the old-fashioned way.

580
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,765
Do you think she's
even gonna turn into a zombie?

581
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:05,058
It fits the pattern.

582
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:08,145
Trust me, you don't wanna
be surprised once it happens.

583
00:37:08,312 --> 00:37:12,232
Just concentrate, she was your charge.
If anybody can find her, you can.

584
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:16,403
You know, I'd rather not find her,
considering I'm the reason she's dead.

585
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,613
Join the club.

586
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:20,741
The faster we find Joanna,
we'll find the Alchemist.

587
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:23,952
And Zankou, before he kills
anybody else in our lives.

588
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,496
Found her.

589
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,998
Cemetery.

590
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:30,459
Not good, never good.

591
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,510
Oh, God, that's her.

592
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,429
Miss me?

593
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,474
Looks like it's time for payback!

594
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:49,394
- Look, we don't wanna hurt you.
- It's a little late for that.

595
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:51,772
Paige, maybe you
should orb us out of here.

596
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:54,316
No, the Alchemist
has to be around here.

597
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:56,735
I see my reputation precedes me.

598
00:37:56,902 --> 00:38:01,031
But if you want to get to me,
you have to get through them.

599
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:07,538
These are all innocents I've lost.

600
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:12,292
That's right. You three have done
a hell of a lot of damage in your time.

601
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:15,879
Seriously, have you
done any good at all?

602
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,425
Phoebe!

603
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:23,971
Friend, my ass!

604
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:30,811
Yes.

605
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:33,689
Yes, my children. Good!

606
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,705
Don't make me do this.

607
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:57,004
God help us.

608
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:03,051
No!

609
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:17,608
- It's okay, you had to.
- We all had to.

610
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:20,652
You. He told me you wouldn't.

611
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,738
- You couldn't!
- I lied.

612
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:31,163
- He served his purpose.
- Why would you do that?

613
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:34,458
What do you have to gain?

614
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,877
You'll soon find out.

615
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:50,182
Inspector Sheridan. Got a minute?

616
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:56,230
- First of all, you had no right.
- I had every right.

617
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:59,816
We're cops. Crimes are being
committed and that gives me the right.

618
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:04,446
Look, as I said before, you are either
with me on this or you're against me.

619
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:09,159
I'm taking some vacation time...
to be with my family.

620
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:11,662
That's curious timing.

621
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:14,289
I don't like being put in this position.

622
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:17,084
You put yourself
in this position, Lieutenant.

623
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:21,922
You're not gonna be able
to take them down. They won't let you.

624
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:24,967
What, is that supposed
to be some kind of a threat?

625
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:27,177
It's a friendly warning.

626
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:30,138
What they're doing,
and what they're all about...

627
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:31,974
...it's above reproach.

628
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,814
I wouldn't mess with them if I were you.

629
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:43,360
Have a nice vacation.

630
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:57,499
Why can't we vanquish Zankou the
same way we vanquished The Source?

631
00:40:57,666 --> 00:41:00,752
He'll be ready for that.
That's why we need something new.

632
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,589
Why did he vanquish
the Alchemist himself?

633
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,466
I don't know,
maybe there's something in the Book.

634
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:09,094
Where's the Book?

635
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:14,641
- Zankou.
- Yeah, but how did he get it?

636
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:16,894
It doesn't matter, he's got it now.

637
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,855
The question is,
what's he gonna do with it?

638
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:31,116
Now the fun really begins.
