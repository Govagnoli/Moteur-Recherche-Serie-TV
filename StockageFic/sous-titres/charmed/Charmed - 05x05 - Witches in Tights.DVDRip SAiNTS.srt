1
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,787
What are you doing?

2
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,121
The DJ is really good, huh?

3
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,541
Yeah. Too bad
she's not really good at P3.

4
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:41,875
Right. Sorry.

5
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,378
Focus, we are here
on business, not pleasure.

6
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,796
Okay. I know, I know.

7
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,965
But don't you think
you're overreacting a little?

8
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,134
No, I don't. This club has become
the hottest thing in town,

9
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,470
and I'd like to know
what they're doing that I am not.

10
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,055
Well, P3 is still doing great.

11
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,140
Not as great as it used to be,
thanks to me.

12
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,727
Well, Piper, you're having a baby.
Your priorities have changed.

13
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,312
Yeah, well, haven't you heard?

14
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,815
Women can have careers
and babies now.

15
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,149
It's been in all the papers.

16
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,528
Are those women trying
to save the world from demons too?

17
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,282
Oh, for God's sakes,
people, get a room.

18
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,368
- Piper.
- Paige.

19
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,206
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, you know, just hanging out.

20
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,584
You couldn't hang out at our club?

21
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,753
What, and miss this DJ?
Come on.

22
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,633
This is my other sister, Piper,
and her husband, Leo. This is Dave.

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,343
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too, mate.

24
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,761
I didn't know there was a Dave.

25
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:38,098
Oh, we've only been hanging out
for, like, three weeks.

26
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,725
Weeks?

27
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,226
Here you go.

28
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,520
Oh, hi, Piper.

29
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,983
Hey. Hey. Wow, you're up late.

30
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,403
- What are you doing here?
- Right back at you.

31
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,322
- Dave, how about I buy you a drink?
- Yeah.

32
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,783
- I've got one, thanks.
- That's not gonna be enough.

33
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,161
I thought you were working tonight.

34
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,747
Yeah, well, I mean,
actually, I'm working here.

35
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,708
You know, I thought
that guys could help me

36
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:08,086
with my advice
to other guys, you know?

37
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,131
And that guy over there
with the dimples.

38
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,843
Hi. Yeah, huge help. Yeah.

39
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,095
See, yeah,
I don't know what bugs me more.

40
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,182
The fact that you guys are here,
or that you're here without me.

41
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,143
Oh, we just didn't think
it would be good for the baby.

42
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,187
You know, all the noise
and the people.

43
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,482
Yeah, I know. But sometimes
it's good for the mommy to get out.

44
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,109
Okay, so you would have
wanted to come?

45
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,445
No, but that is beside the point.

46
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:37,241
- You're a very confusing woman.
- It's all right. Hey, it's no big deal.

47
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,160
You guys, I'll see you at home.

48
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,996
Oh, Piper.

49
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,626
- Still think this is a good idea?
- Well, you know Piper.

50
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,087
She won't slow down
unless someone slows her down.

51
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,716
I just don't want to do anything
to add to her stress.

52
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,178
You seem stressed.

53
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,807
Arnon, you scared me.

54
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,480
What are you doing out here?

55
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,900
Door is locked, so I thought
I'd practice drawing while I waited.

56
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,152
Good.

57
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,196
Not really.

58
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,449
I don't know, I just can't seem
to make it work.

59
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,160
I've done everything you said,
tried to focus...

60
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,496
Then you're not trying hard enough.

61
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,588
You have a special gift, Kevin.
A very special gift.

62
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:37,217
And if you're to master it,
you have to believe in it fully.

63
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,934
You draw to see it better,
but it'll never be real,

64
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,312
not unless you make it real
in your mind's eye.

65
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,900
Make it real, Kevin.

66
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,944
Make it come to life.

67
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,547
Oh, my God, it worked.

68
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,597
Okay, how do we make it go away?

69
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,360
Now it's time to make
that hero of yours real too.

70
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,946
To take care of your little problem.

71
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,282
And then, take care of mine.

72
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,162
Yo.

73
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,414
What are you doing here, fool?

74
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,002
- I'm just trying to get home, Kaz.
- Listen.

75
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,214
We've had this conversation.

76
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,591
This is where I do my business.

77
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,135
All right?
And I don't like getting bothered.

78
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,345
Turn around.

79
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,555
It's gonna cost you.

80
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,307
Hey.

81
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,647
What is this?

82
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,816
Is this me?

83
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,069
Getting my ass kicked by you?

84
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,630
Catch you next time, little man.

85
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,450
All right, that's enough.
Let's get out of here.

86
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,129
What is this, Halloween?
Who the hell are you, fool?

87
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,214
I'm The Aggressor.

88
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,091
The Aggressor?

89
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,095
Well, whoever you are,
you just made a serious mistake.

90
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,181
Behind you.

91
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,799
- Morning.
- Morning.

92
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,678
- Did you just get home?
- Yeah.

93
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,305
Oh, my God.

94
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:36,642
Pickles, hot fudge sauce and mustard?
Are you seriously eating that?

95
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,101
That was the plan.

96
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:42,064
Wait a minute,
you didn't come home all night?

97
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,775
No, Mom. Why?

98
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,693
I must be going nuts.

99
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,821
Because I could have sworn I saw you
when I walked past your room.

100
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,032
Was it about 2:30?

101
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,576
Was I half-naked?

102
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,038
Paige, what's going on?

103
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,959
- Nothing. I don't want to bother you.
- You're not bothering me.

104
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,419
Why does everybody think
they're bothering me?

105
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,129
I'm not bothered.
What's the matter?

106
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,259
Well, I was sort of
messing around with Dave, and...

107
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,096
- Messing around?
- Yeah, having "sex."

108
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,724
This is why I don't want to
talk to you about this.

109
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,102
It's weird talking to a pregnant lady
about sex anyway.

110
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,230
Well, Paige, how do you think
I got pregnant?

111
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,525
I don't want to know that either.

112
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,113
Anyway, so we were doing,
you know,

113
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,952
and I was about to, you know,
and suddenly I orbed out upstairs.

114
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,955
Oh, my God. You didn't?

115
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,040
- Did he notice?
- No, thank God.

116
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,501
I orbed back in
before the lights came back on.

117
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,879
- Talk about embarrassing.
- Forget embarrassing.

118
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,631
Paige, you could have had
some serious explaining to do.

119
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,176
Well, I didn't plan on
orbing out, Piper.

120
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,053
It wasn't exactly my particular goal
at the moment.

121
00:09:55,971 --> 00:10:00,142
Okay, so why do you think
this is happening?

122
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,270
I mean, is he not
getting the job done?

123
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:07,024
No, he's getting the job done fine.

124
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:12,112
I think I like him a lot.

125
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,073
And, I mean, other than Glen,

126
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,243
he's the first guy I've been with
since I found out I was a witch.

127
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:25,083
I think I'm so busy protecting
this big old secret of ours that

128
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,794
I guess I can't really
let my guard down.

129
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:30,714
How'd you do it?

130
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,009
Marry an angel.

131
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,222
Leo?

132
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,350
Sorry. I'm sorry. Are you all right?

133
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,644
Been orbing long, have we?

134
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,437
Hey, I'm a little nervous.

135
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,232
Leo, what happened?
We heard a crash.

136
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,317
He missed.

137
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,528
Huh, who's the critic?

138
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,740
This is Ramus. He's an Elder.

139
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,660
An Elder? Really?

140
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,371
I thought you told us
he wasn't coming till tonight.

141
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,833
Told us? Nobody told me anything.
Leo?

142
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,043
We didn't want you
to worry about demonic threats

143
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,712
until it was absolutely necessary.

144
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,089
What threats?

145
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:15,884
Well, I suppose this will have to do.

146
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,429
Okay.

147
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,057
What are you two up to?

148
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,851
It was Phoebe's idea.

149
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,895
We were just trying to make things
a little easier, that's all.

150
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,772
- Relieve some stress.
- Well, stop it,

151
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,900
because it's pissing me off.
I'm pregnant, not terminal.

152
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,196
So, what...? What is he doing here?

153
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,906
Ramus is retiring.

154
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,617
He came down to pass on his powers
to a new Elder.

155
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,452
- So?
- So?

156
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,372
There isn't a demon alive
who wouldn't love to have his powers.

157
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:48,333
So the Elders want you to protect him
in case there's an attack.

158
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,460
Why couldn't he just orb out?

159
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,256
Because my powers are mental,
young lady, not physical.

160
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,553
You'd think a charge of yours would
know something as basic as that.

161
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,018
- Nothing wrong with his hearing.
- No, just his attitude.

162
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,187
Piper. Little respect.

163
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,814
For crying out loud.

164
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,358
So who is this new Elder,
and when does he get here?

165
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:17,321
We don't know who he is.
All we know is that the transfer

166
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,115
must take place
during tonight's equinox,

167
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,868
or else I will lose my powers forever.

168
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:27,039
So we're just supposed to
sit around here and wait?

169
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:31,460
Yes. Unfortunately.

170
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,025
Arnon?

171
00:12:56,193 --> 00:13:00,531
- I was getting worried about you.
- Arnon, you scared me.

172
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,533
Sorry.

173
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,622
Where's The Aggressor?

174
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,874
He's...

175
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,043
He's gone.

176
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,838
- I ripped up the drawing.
- You what?

177
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,132
He killed a guy.
Arnon, he killed Kaz.

178
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,386
Isn't that why you wanted me
to help you create your superhero?

179
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,931
- No, not to kill. I never wanted that.
- He was a bad guy, wasn't he?

180
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,892
Just like Ramus is.

181
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,353
I'm not drawing him again.

182
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,148
Arnon, I'm sorry.

183
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,777
We had a deal.

184
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,821
I help you, you help me, remember?

185
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:45,284
Now, I need The Aggressor
to take out Ramus.

186
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,744
To rid him of his powers.

187
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,331
Why can't you just
take him out yourself?

188
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:56,628
I told you, I only have the ability to
sense great powers, not possess them.

189
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,840
That's how I found you,
that's how I'll find Ramus.

190
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,095
Now, help me
do the right thing, Kevin.

191
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,892
Bring your superhero back to life,

192
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,811
before somebody else loses theirs.

193
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,153
- Those are all life and death?
- Well, not literally.

194
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,654
At least, not most of them.

195
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,490
What am I supposed to do?
I can't keep up, they just keep coming.

196
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,742
What can you do?

197
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,660
Answer two or three a day,
ignore the rest.

198
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,538
- You can't help everybody.
- Yeah, that's the problem.

199
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,709
I got it. Thanks.

200
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,212
- Phoebe Halliwell.
- So, what do you say

201
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,923
to an overbearing younger sister

202
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:45,177
who's treating her pregnant
older sister like a porcelain doll?

203
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,638
- "Thank you"?
- How about, "knock it off"?

204
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,641
That's probably better advice.
Are you mad at me?

205
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,185
No, not if you come home
and babysit Ramus.

206
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,064
Oh, sweetie, I can't. I've got
a gazillion letters that I have to get to.

207
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,359
Well, "Bored in Berkeley" can wait.
I've got DJs to audition.

208
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:02,236
No, these are
a lot more serious than that.

209
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,321
You're not supposed to be
going to work, anyway.

210
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,783
- Phoebe.
- Can't I worry about my niece?

211
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,743
Okay, look, what about Paige?
Can she come?

212
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:11,662
Apparently not.

213
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:14,790
She's with Dave,
trying desperately not to orb.

214
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:18,836
Oh, for goodness' sakes, okay.
Well, what about...?

215
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:23,423
- Cole.
- Cole, watching an Elder?

216
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,467
I really don't think that's a good idea.

217
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,261
No. He...

218
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,848
Okay. I'll be home
as soon as I can, okay?

219
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,976
- Phoebe.
- Whatever it is, I don't have time.

220
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,437
No, you don't understand.
This isn't about us.

221
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,439
- I need your help.
- Yeah, who doesn't?

222
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,568
You ever heard of Edward Miller,
the slumlord?

223
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,736
He took millions from the city
in renovation moneys,

224
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,573
but instead of fixing the buildings,
he's kicking the tenants out?

225
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,575
Well, how is he able to do that?

226
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,744
I don't know, but that's why I'm trying
to get an injunction to stop him.

227
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:56,081
Oh, really? You?
What's with all the red tape?

228
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,417
Why don't you just
turn him into a fountain pen?

229
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:01,295
Believe me, I'm tempted.

230
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,756
But I've decided I'm not gonna
use my powers, no matter what.

231
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:09,386
- Since when?
- Since I tried strangling you with them.

232
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,769
I'll be working from home
for the rest of the day.

233
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,855
Phoebe. Listen to me,
this is legitimate.

234
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,690
These people are
gonna be evicted tonight

235
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,775
and I can't get an injunction
until tomorrow.

236
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:27,362
I mean, if you could just
threaten to expose him in your paper

237
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,114
or maybe even
leak it to a TV station...

238
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:32,784
I don't have enough time to help my
readers with their problems right now.

239
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,828
But we're talking about
whole families here.

240
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:37,915
Kids, babies, with nowhere to go.

241
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,666
Look.

242
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,293
It's great that you want to help.

243
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,378
I really do, but I can't.

244
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,089
I am powerless
to do anything right now.

245
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:50,844
You may be a lot of things,
but powerless isn't one of them.

246
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,809
Was he talking about Edward Miller,
the slumlord?

247
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,395
Actually, you did get some letters
from some of his tenants.

248
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:04,441
- Really? I haven't seen them.
- No, you haven't gotten to them.

249
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,125
Did you?

250
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,379
No.

251
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,423
I didn't think so.

252
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,259
It's not you, Dave.

253
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,760
Trust me, it's me.

254
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,513
You keep saying that, Paige,
but what does that mean?

255
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,683
It's complicated.

256
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,435
Well, you're in luck.

257
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,980
Because I happen to specialize
in complicated.

258
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:47,234
Come on, talk to me.
You won't scare me away.

259
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,028
Promise?

260
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,783
It's just that I'm...

261
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:58,162
...really different than other girls.

262
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,915
I know.
That's what I like about you.

263
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,002
No, I mean really different.

264
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:07,421
More than you
could possibly imagine.

265
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,090
Okay.

266
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,343
So you're all right with that?

267
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:14,720
All right with what?

268
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,140
- Forget it.
- Forget what?

269
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,893
Look, I'm not a freak.
It's not like I have a tail or something.

270
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,895
Paige, I don't know
what you're talking about.

271
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:27,608
- Just forget I said anything.
- But you didn't say anything.

272
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:34,656
You know, I think
I got closer that time.

273
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,409
You wanna try again?

274
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,460
Leo?

275
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,795
Leo!

276
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:52,883
- What are you doing?
- Would you mind?

277
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,136
My meditation
requires peace and quiet.

278
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,347
Well, then you're in
the wrong house, pal.

279
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,516
- Have you seen my husband?
- He's upstairs.

280
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,143
Okay, could you tell him
that I'll be at P3?

281
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,395
He can watch over you
until Phoebe shows up.

282
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:09,191
I'll tell him no such thing.
It is your job to protect me, not his.

283
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,692
Those are the rules.

284
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,737
Little history lesson:

285
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,322
I'm not a big fan of your rules.

286
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,282
In fact, I take pride
in breaking them.

287
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,410
I know, you've been
a real pain over the years.

288
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,704
Oh, you mean marrying Leo?

289
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,541
Yes, I know you Elders
were dead set against that.

290
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,168
Not all of us.

291
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:31,547
Some of us foresaw
the special baby you'd be carrying.

292
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,507
Still, that doesn't...

293
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,509
What do you mean, "special"?

294
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,388
- Hi.
- Wait, what do you mean?

295
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:41,807
Don't get excited,
I can't stay long.

296
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,852
- You'll see.
- Hi.

297
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:52,568
It is an honour and a pleasure
to meet an Elder, sir. Really.

298
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,237
Okay, but I gotta go.

299
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:58,532
I'm sorry, but if I don't
stop that dirt-bag landlord...

300
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,869
What's the matter?

301
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,663
Someone's coming.

302
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,707
For me.

303
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,335
- Ramus.
- Hurry, freeze him.

304
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,218
Paige!

305
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,931
Damn, I was so close.

306
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,684
I don't wanna hurt you.
I just want him.

307
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:28,645
Yeah, well, forget about it.

308
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,735
Ramus!

309
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,955
Who was that masked man?

310
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,128
Okay, we should look under...

311
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,589
Actually, I have no idea
what to look under.

312
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:59,343
Well, he had a great big giant
A on his chest, how about A?

313
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,304
I'm telling you, you're not gonna
find him in the Book of Shadows.

314
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,223
At a comic-book convention maybe.

315
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,351
- He could still be a demon.
- Paige, he was in tights.

316
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,354
Ramus is safe,
but he can't stay there long.

317
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:12,105
Otherwise he'll miss the equinox.

318
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,149
Oh, can't he just wait
for the next one?

319
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,359
No, he can't.

320
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:18,737
Otherwise he'll miss his chance to
pass on his powers to his successor.

321
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:21,782
But tonight's my only night
to help the families being evicted.

322
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,076
Otherwise they'll be on the streets.

323
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:27,704
Phoebe, I think super villains
trump slumlords.

324
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,415
Paige, where did you orb in from?

325
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,210
Just dealing
with some personal problems.

326
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,504
I'm your whitelighter,
so if you ever want to talk...

327
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:36,797
- No.
- No.

328
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,299
Can we please just concentrate
on the comic-book guy?

329
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,594
Well, comic books wouldn't be
a bad place to start.

330
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,472
- Remember the Demon of Illusion?
- No.

331
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:48,433
He was before you.
He literally hid in movies.

332
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,688
So this guy could be hiding in comics
or coming out of them somehow.

333
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,523
So we need to check
comic-book stores?

334
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,483
Oh, that's gonna take forever.

335
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,862
You just go deal with your slumlord.
I'll catch up with you later.

336
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,196
No, we should do it together.

337
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:04,283
No. If I see some dude in tights,
I'll just orb out.

338
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,493
Paige, it's dangerous.
You shouldn't do it alone.

339
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:10,205
Well, guess what. She won't have to.
Remember me, the invisible woman?

340
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:14,209
Now, you two have got to
cut this crap out, now.

341
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:17,963
Come on, let's go get you
into something less comfortable.

342
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,970
How could The Aggressor fail?

343
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,556
You told me you drew him invincible.

344
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,812
The equinox comes around
once in a lifetime.

345
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:37,900
And I don't plan on spending
the rest of that lifetime sensing power.

346
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:40,986
I want power. Ramus' power.

347
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:46,033
- I tried.
- Not hard enough.

348
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,913
You'll draw a new Aggressor.

349
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:54,833
Stronger. One that can handle
the witches when Ramus returns.

350
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,961
What if I turn The Aggressor
on to you?

351
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:00,547
I'd kill you before you could try.

352
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:04,968
And then I'd kill the rest of the people
in your life who still care about you.

353
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:08,222
I may not have much power,
but I have enough to do that.

354
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:09,681
Now...

355
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,391
...draw.

356
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:34,248
All right, come on. Move it.

357
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:44,049
Hey, let's get these people
cleared out, okay?

358
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:45,926
- Edward Miller?
- Yeah?

359
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,261
Phoebe Halliwell, Bay Mirror.

360
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,054
Could I ask you a few questions?

361
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,431
No. I don't think so.

362
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:55,060
Okay, so how does it feel to be
the most hated man in the city?

363
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:58,480
- Excuse me?
- Well, at least, not until tomorrow,

364
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:00,357
when the morning edition comes out,

365
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:03,485
and everyone reads that you're
forcing families out on the streets.

366
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,363
You print that, lady,
and I'll sue you for libel.

367
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,615
Now, I'm a little rusty on my law,

368
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:11,952
but how could it be libel,
when it's actually the truth?

369
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,538
- Get out of my way.
- Hey!

370
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:18,167
Look! You can run,
but you cannot hide, mister.

371
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,919
My newspaper's gonna do
a huge exposé on this.

372
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,298
- You won't get away with it.
- I already have.

373
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:47,070
Well, we have a few more stores
to check out.

374
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,864
Maybe we'll still find something.

375
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:52,493
Yeah, more Ionely superheroes
who have to hide their true identities,

376
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,245
which does not bode well
for my love life.

377
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:59,166
Paige, let me ask you a question.
Are you gonna marry Dave?

378
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,584
No, I just met him.

379
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:04,838
Well, then relax. Worry about it
when you gotta worry about it.

380
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:12,095
Okay, what just happened here?

381
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:15,682
See, I was kind of hoping
you could tell me.

382
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,810
Help! Somebody help me!

383
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,313
Please, help me!

384
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:23,524
No! No!

385
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,820
- Please don't shoot me.
- Hey!

386
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,957
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but it'll do.

387
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:45,379
Hi. How's it going?

388
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,887
- Are you all right?
- Who are you people?

389
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:56,223
Where did you come from?

390
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,142
That's a mighty good question, lady.

391
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,527
They don't have to move.
They can stay for a year.

392
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,487
Ten years.

393
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:14,158
What about the cockroaches? Are you
gonna do something about them?

394
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:17,536
First thing tomorrow. Just please,
don't drop me. Please!

395
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:19,163
Phoebe?

396
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,373
Cole? What are you doing here?

397
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,626
Well, I got a call
from one of the tenants

398
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:29,506
saying that Wonder Woman
was terrorizing the landlord.

399
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:31,300
What the hell are you doing?

400
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:33,552
Well, I'm teaching my buddy here

401
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:36,013
how important it is
to be a better person.

402
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:39,266
- Are you a better person yet?
- I'm slipping.

403
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,143
No, you're not slipping.

404
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:43,395
That's slipping.

405
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:47,191
- Honey...
- Don't call me "honey" anymore.

406
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:50,068
I don't know what's going on here,
but this is not you, literally.

407
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:51,820
Are you kidding?
This is better than me.

408
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:54,406
This is new-and-improved me.

409
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:57,784
Not only can I help my readers,
but I can help the entire city.

410
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:01,747
- Careful, he's got ears.
- Oh, please, relax.

411
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:05,417
The only thing he can hear right now
is the blood rushing to his brain.

412
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:12,174
One more slip-up, Edward,
and we'll end up right back up here.

413
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:20,390
Phoebe, are you out of your mind?
What if somebody sees you?

414
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,726
That's why we wear masks.

415
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:26,522
- We?
- Yeah, superheroes.

416
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:30,526
Cole, I gotta go. Because I have a lot
of loyal readers that need my help.

417
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,819
- Okay?
- Okay.

418
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:43,205
I want you to find out everything
you can about Cole Turner's wife.

419
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:46,542
- His wife? Why?
- Just do it.

420
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:53,924
Head rush.

421
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,552
- Let's do it again.
- No, what if somebody sees us?

422
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,345
Sees us? We're blurs.

423
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:00,681
Besides, who cares?

424
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:04,601
Okay, give me a sec
while my organs catch up.

425
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:07,604
- Nice outfit.
- Back at you, sis.

426
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:10,482
- Okay, but where did we get them?
- I don't know and I don't care.

427
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:14,528
All I know is I'm on a roll.
I've helped so many readers...

428
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:16,280
...today.

429
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,490
- What?
- I don't know, but suddenly,

430
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:21,076
I don't feel so good about this.

431
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:23,495
It's like the masks
are clouding our judgment,

432
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:27,166
making us feel like we're invincible.

433
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:32,838
- Yeah, see?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

434
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,966
I don't like it. I'm putting it back on.

435
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:39,011
No, Paige, we need to think clearly
so we can figure out who did this...

436
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:44,850
Phoebe.

437
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:17,716
Thank you.

438
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:36,652
What are you waiting for?

439
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,404
How do we know if we heal him
he's not gonna try and kill you again?

440
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,114
Leo, he's a kid.

441
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,700
Plus, killers don't usually thank you
for killing them.

442
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:45,536
He thanked you?

443
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,329
Just hurry up.

444
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:58,966
What happened?

445
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:03,262
Before or after
your alter ego tried to kill us?

446
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,640
Come on.

447
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:10,352
- What's your name?
- Kevin.

448
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,771
Well, Kevin, you have
some explaining to do.

449
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:14,898
Are you responsible
for these outfits?

450
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:19,278
I was hoping you'd be able
to stop The Aggressor.

451
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:22,698
- The Aggressor? Don't you mean you?
- Yeah.

452
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:24,491
We were gonna kill you.
We almost did.

453
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:26,869
Is that what you wanted?

454
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,371
I didn't know what else to do.

455
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:31,290
I didn't want to hurt anyone else.

456
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:34,835
And then after our first battle, I thought
maybe if I drew you with powers...

457
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:38,297
Hang on a second, mister.
What do you mean you drew us?

458
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,675
I've always been able
to imagine things,

459
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:44,678
and then make them come to life
through my drawings.

460
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:46,305
Like you guys, the Protectors.

461
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:49,141
I never told anybody
about what I could do.

462
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:52,936
I knew it would freak people out.
I mean, hey, it freaked me out at first.

463
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:56,607
Thought projection is a rare power.
It means he's a witch too.

464
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,609
Why did you
make yourself a superhero?

465
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:01,278
Because I got tired
of getting beaten up all the time.

466
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:04,656
Then Arnon came along and said
he'd teach me how to focus my power.

467
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:08,285
- Arnon. Who's that?
- Somebody I wish I'd never met.

468
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:10,621
He used me to get to Ramus.

469
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:13,332
Said he was a bad guy,
that we had to stop him.

470
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,710
But all Arnon wanted
were his powers.

471
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:22,132
The Elders, they want me
to bring Ramus back down.

472
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,260
No, you can't. Not until
we figure out a way to stop Arnon.

473
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,554
I don't have a choice.
The equinox is starting.

474
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,265
- He'll kill Ramus.
- He can't, not without The Aggressor.

475
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:33,560
We can't know that for sure.
You have to wait till we find him.

476
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:36,313
- Yeah, but how?
- I know how.

477
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,274
Arnon doesn't know
The Aggressor failed yet.

478
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,944
So all you have to do is
follow me back to his hideout.

479
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:45,072
No, that is too dangerous.

480
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,949
I won't be in danger
with you guys there.

481
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:49,910
With all your super powers
and your super hearing,

482
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:52,830
you'll easily be able
to overpower him. Trust me.

483
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:55,582
After all, I drew you, didn't I?

484
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:01,213
Okay, but you have to
do exactly what we say.

485
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:03,507
Promise.

486
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:17,521
- Is this it?
- Yeah, through that door.

487
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:20,315
Do you hear anything inside?

488
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:22,568
Rats.

489
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:27,030
Dripping water, cockroaches.
Might as well be my old apartment.

490
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:29,825
I don't hear any Arnon, though.

491
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:40,043
Well, at least
you didn't break anything this time.

492
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,172
- I think we'd be safer upstairs.
- No. Here is fine.

493
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:44,923
With all the doors,
if anybody attacks...

494
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,051
Anybody who attacks
doesn't need doors, Leo.

495
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:50,220
Relax.

496
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:55,309
There's nothing either of us can do
to change what's meant to be.

497
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:57,227
What is that supposed to mean?

498
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:02,566
- What aren't you telling me?
- Actually, quite a bit.

499
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:09,990
Look, Leo, you know as well as I do
that there is a reason for everything.

500
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:14,161
Which means
there is a reason for here, for now.

501
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,038
How the hell
am I supposed to protect you

502
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:17,915
if I don't know what the hell
is going on?

503
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:22,377
- Sorry.
- No, no, I like that.

504
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:25,005
You could stand to be
a little tougher sometimes.

505
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:26,381
Just because you're an angel

506
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:30,052
doesn't mean you can't
kick some ass now and again.

507
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,641
Leo, my fate is sealed.

508
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:39,436
Win or lose,
I'm right where I'm supposed to be.

509
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,813
Which means
that there is nothing more

510
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,067
either of us can do to change that.

511
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:51,156
There is, however, perhaps
something I can do for you.

512
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:53,492
What do you mean?

513
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:56,119
I am an Elder
and I can foresee the future.

514
00:33:56,286 --> 00:34:01,750
Enough of it, anyway, to give you
a glimpse, if you're interested.

515
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,129
Isn't that against the rules?

516
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:08,423
I'm retiring. What do I care?

517
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:13,971
You can ask me one question,
and one question only.

518
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:21,937
Well, will our baby be healthy?

519
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,399
Yes, very healthy.

520
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:29,778
And more powerful
than you can even imagine.

521
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:36,076
Okay, listen. You're gonna go in there
and summon him, okay?

522
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,745
But when he comes, call for us
and we'll get you out of there.

523
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:40,998
The slightest peep, I'll hear it.

524
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,083
Okay.

525
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,752
You don't have to do this, you know.

526
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,631
No, I want to.

527
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,513
You okay?

528
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:19,077
Arnon. Arnon, it's me...

529
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:22,122
You betrayed me.

530
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:31,673
Now that I know you can draw powers
for others, you can draw some for me.

531
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:37,137
Stupid planes.
All I hear is ringing in my ears.

532
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:40,140
Okay, forget it.
We gotta get him out of there.

533
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:48,315
Kevin. Wake up. Come on.

534
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,902
What is this?

535
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,862
Another Aggressor?

536
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:55,656
That's right.

537
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:28,772
- Everybody still alive?
- I'm not sure yet.

538
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,732
Oh, no complaining.

539
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:33,235
You're the one that didn't want
to be pampered, remember?

540
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:34,736
I take it back, I take it back.

541
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:37,656
Hey, at least you have
a baby that can heal you.

542
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:42,202
Yeah, open wounds.
But apparently not aches and pains.

543
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:45,164
Oh, God. Oh, God,
I'm so sorry about this.

544
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,500
- It's okay, it's not your fault.
- I didn't have a choice.

545
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,252
Arnon threatened to kill me
if I didn't.

546
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:53,380
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is that you're fine.

547
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:56,633
For now, until he needs me
to draw him even more powers.

548
00:36:56,842 --> 00:37:00,804
Well, he won't need any more powers
if he gets to Ramus before we do.

549
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:04,975
Okay, so how do we stop him?
We're not superheroes anymore.

550
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:06,894
I could make you superheroes again.

551
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,813
No, that'll take too long.
He'll have Ramus by then.

552
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,192
- So how do we stop him?
- As super witches.

553
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:15,986
But you couldn't stop
my superhero as witches.

554
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:18,113
How are you gonna stop Arnon's?

555
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,157
Okay. So we'll rip up his drawing

556
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:23,368
and turn him back into
the wimpy demon that he is.

557
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:27,539
You can't.
He took the drawing with him.

558
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,002
Will you just relax?
You're making me nervous.

559
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:34,421
Okay. Well, something isn't right.
I can sense it.

560
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,632
Leo, I've told you.
You've already done your job.

561
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:39,259
Now it's time
to let your charges do theirs.

562
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,428
I just don't understand
what's taking so long.

563
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:44,056
- They should be home by now.
- They will be.

564
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:45,599
They're just gonna be too late.

565
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:48,602
You know what,
I'm getting you out of here.

566
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:53,023
Oh, I'm afraid this is gonna hurt.

567
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,618
Looks like getting your powers
will be even easier than I thought.

568
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:07,788
Enjoy it while it lasts.

569
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:22,386
You're too late. Ramus is dead.

570
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,598
- Leo.
- Paige, now.

571
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:27,975
Boot.

572
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:31,770
Left. I meant left boot.

573
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:35,190
- Oh, for goodness' sakes.
- Left boot.

574
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,410
Yeah. Don't you just hate it
when that happens?

575
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:48,620
Fortunately,
since you have Ramus' powers,

576
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,914
you can foresee
what's gonna happen next.

577
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:54,877
It's gonna hurt, isn't it?

578
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:57,963
No!

579
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,466
What the hell is that?

580
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:07,014
What?

581
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:09,474
What just happened?

582
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:13,520
Looks like Ramus was able to pass
his powers to the new Elder after all.

583
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,606
An Elder? He's only 13.

584
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:19,401
Elders are like kings.
They can be any age.

585
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,862
I don't understand.

586
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:23,447
What does this mean?

587
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:25,282
Well, for one thing,

588
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:28,076
it means that nobody's gonna be
pushing you around anymore.

589
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:40,964
Are you Turner?

590
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:42,257
Yeah. Who are you?

591
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:43,675
Edward Miller.

592
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,802
But you can call me Ed.

593
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:47,846
I've got nothing to say to you.

594
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,932
Yeah? Well, I got something
to say to you,

595
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,684
as well as the little missus.

596
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:56,730
You know, there's just
a very certain, special way

597
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:58,690
that married people
talk to each other.

598
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:00,609
It's very distinctive to the ear,

599
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:02,903
even when you're
hanging upside down.

600
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,907
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

601
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:08,200
Really?

602
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:11,370
Well, maybe this
will jog your memory.

603
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,458
Maybe we should go talk somewhere
a little more private, huh?

604
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,065
Looks like someone
needs to get a room.

605
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:44,611
Cute, very cute.

606
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:45,904
How's it going, Dave?

607
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:48,699
Never better, mate.
Never better.

608
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:50,742
Oh, really?

609
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,705
How about you guys
go get us girls some drinks?

610
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:57,875
- Sparkling or still?
- Sparkling, of course.

611
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:02,212
Right. Oh, by the way, congrats on the
club. It's great. And the DJ's wicked.

612
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,506
Thanks.

613
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:09,803
See, it's nice to know
you still got it in you.

614
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,181
Yeah. Although
I'm beginning to realize

615
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:16,560
that being number one in town
just isn't as important as it used to be.

616
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:18,979
And neither is fighting demons,
for that matter.

617
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,607
What, you didn't like
being a superhero?

618
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:23,817
Oh, no. Are you kidding?
It was awesome.

619
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:26,612
I mean, being a witch
is still awesome.

620
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,114
It's just that there's
a new number one in town.

621
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,700
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

622
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:33,952
And apparently, good for you.

623
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:38,415
Since you worked through
your issues with Dave, I gather.

624
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:42,711
Yes, I did, thank God.
I was just about to join a convent.

625
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:45,589
Must have been the pink leather,
broke you down.

626
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:47,925
Don't laugh, but I think
it might have been.

627
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:50,969
Something about leaping
over tall buildings in a single bound.

628
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:54,681
- I guess that will free any girl up.
- And let your guard down.

629
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:57,768
Yeah, I'm gonna take your advice,
and just, you know, relax.

630
00:41:57,935 --> 00:42:02,439
If he's Mr. Right, I'll tell him
I fly around on broomsticks.

631
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:05,526
He may find out by himself.

632
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:07,861
- What?
- Cole just called.

633
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:11,281
He said the idiot slumlord
wants to meet Cole and me, now.

634
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:13,575
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know. Something about

635
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:17,788
having a tape of Cole's
superhero ex-wife in action.

636
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:19,665
Oh, no.

637
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:29,174
What do you want?

638
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:33,220
Well, your wife off my back,
for starters.

639
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:36,139
Then, maybe 50 grand a month.

640
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:37,975
- Fifty grand.
- Yeah.

641
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,395
And if they don't have it,
they can certainly get it.

642
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:44,898
Just put on those cute little outfits.

643
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:50,487
They don't have them anymore.

644
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,615
Well, they better find them.

645
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,827
I wouldn't try anything if I were you.

646
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,704
All right, this is just a copy.

647
00:42:59,288 --> 00:43:00,455
I can find the original.

648
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:02,124
Oh, yeah? How?

649
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:05,419
Well, I have certain powers too.

650
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,922
But I'm trying very hard
not to use them.

651
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:10,591
Very hard.

652
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:12,634
I don't like what they do to me.

653
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,095
Yeah, okay. Whatever, pal.

654
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:18,265
Guess I'll just sell this
to the highest bidder.

655
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:21,768
- I can't let you do that.
- Try and stop me.

656
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,146
No!

657
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:32,905
- Is he here?
- Who?

658
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:35,782
Miller. Edward Miller.
You said he was coming.

659
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:38,118
Oh, yeah.

660
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:41,455
I took care of it.

661
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:44,750
What do you mean?

662
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:46,376
What does that mean?

663
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:48,128
Phoebe, he was gonna expose you.

664
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,130
What was I supposed to do?

665
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,425
Phoebe, wait.
