1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,088
Okay, three dead innocents,
three weeks,

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,798
all near Memorial Hospital.

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,176
Yes, and one witch
is gonna vanquish a whole lot of...

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,636
- Nothing.
- What?

5
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,972
Nothing. Look, all we
need you to do is surveillance,

6
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,141
especially because
it's your first solo outing.

7
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,476
Oh, come on.

8
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,395
How can you vanquish a demon
until you know what you're up against?

9
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,314
I'll bring extra potions.

10
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,192
No. You are going to go,
you're going to ID the demon,

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,111
and then you're gonna come up
with a plan after that.

12
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,780
You know, I just have one question.

13
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,990
Are you guys really
this overly protective

14
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,993
- or are you just afraid of letting go?
- What?

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,412
I'm saying, there's gotta be
a reason you hold me back.

16
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,123
Or maybe you secretly
wanna be out there doing it yourself.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,293
That's ridiculous. First of all, I don't
wanna be fighting demons anymore,

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,337
let alone teaching you
how to fight demons.

19
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:48,257
Why don't you loosen the leash
and let me show you what I can do?

20
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,342
Because I'd really rather you not die.

21
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,429
Okay.

22
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,516
Go get my car,
drive to the hospital,

23
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,477
find out who's attacking
the innocents, okay?

24
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,522
- We'll go from there.
- Okay, you got it.

25
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,360
Billie, empty those pockets.

26
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,362
- What?
- Empty them, missy.

27
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,664
Back ones too.

28
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,547
You guys are so not fun.

29
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,015
Help me. Somebody please help.
My wife is having a kid...

30
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,850
- Buddy, what's wrong?
- I crashed my car.

31
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,186
My wife's pregnant,
she's pinned, I can't get her out.

32
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,522
- Where is she?
- She's down there. Please help me.

33
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,082
Hey, where did you say she is?

34
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,872
Gross.

35
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,718
Okay, come on, we need to get you
to a hospital. Come on.

36
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,289
Oh, come on,
it's only for a few hours tomorrow,

37
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:11,210
and you yourself said you haven't
been meeting any cute guys lately.

38
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,629
Okay, there are not gonna be
any cute guys there,

39
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,758
because they're all desperate and
that's why they are doing speed dating.

40
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,885
That is not necessarily true.

41
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,763
Yeah? Then how come you're
so nervous about having it at the club?

42
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,266
Hey, it wasn't my idea,
it was Dad's idea, as was bingo night.

43
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,310
I'm just trying to do
a little damage control.

44
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,479
Well, you cancelled that,
so cancel this.

45
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,147
I can't, it's too late.

46
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,941
Which is why I need your help.

47
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,485
Come on, I need to up
the babe quotient a little.

48
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,529
So you're pimping me out?

49
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,072
What, do you wanna be homeless?

50
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:43,575
Because that's what's gonna happen
if we lose our only source of income.

51
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,661
Thanks, Miss Guilt-Giver.

52
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,497
I will resort to whatever I have to.

53
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,958
Besides, you might actually
meet someone you like.

54
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,127
- Yeah.
- Baby Tylenol?

55
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,588
Top shelf. How is he feeling?

56
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,925
Well, the fever's going down.
I'm gonna put him down early.

57
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,760
How's Wyatt?

58
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,637
You know, doing better.

59
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,473
You know, I think he should stay
at your dad's another day or so,

60
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,017
you know,
just to be on the safe side.

61
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,936
I think I like your other alias better.

62
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,648
Well, too bad. Get used to it.

63
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,485
- Hey, can I borrow a suitcase?
- Closet.

64
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,696
So is Julie gonna be helping
with the speed dating?

65
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,949
- Nope, I'm ovulating.
- What?

66
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,951
You know, eggs,
fertility, baby-making.

67
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,579
Yeah, I got it.
I know what ovulating is, thank you.

68
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,206
Well, I'm supposed
to get pregnant by Dex, right?

69
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,001
What better place to try than Napa.

70
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,337
I thought your premonition
was about you getting married to Dex?

71
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,298
Well, one step at a time.

72
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,050
At least that's what
my star chart keeps saying.

73
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,887
- I gotta get to work.
- Work? What happened to love?

74
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,807
No time for that. Destiny calls.

75
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,978
Is that what we've been reduced to?

76
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,607
- Loveless sex, pimping?
- Yes.

77
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,819
- Billie!
- Yeah?

78
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,989
Just the girl I was looking for.
Are you, by any chance, single?

79
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,616
- Why?
- Forget it, Piper.

80
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,868
She's not even old enough to drink.

81
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,703
So how did the surveillance go?

82
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,207
The surveillance? Oh, it was fine.
It was great. It was totally fine.

83
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,750
Okay, did you ID the demon?

84
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,837
You know, actually, I...

85
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,172
I'll get that.

86
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,890
Paige?

87
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,478
- Hi.
- Hi.

88
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,314
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I think you can.

89
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,525
Agent Murphy, Homeland Security.

90
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,736
We need to talk.

91
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,075
Please. It wasn't their fault, Antosis.

92
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,202
The witch surprised them.

93
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,079
They weren't prepared.

94
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:56,708
Except you told me
that they could handle surprises.

95
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,585
That's one of the reasons
why I brought you

96
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,505
and your little pests here
in the first place.

97
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,382
Killing Good Samaritans,

98
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:07,010
placing my mark
across entire neighbourhoods,

99
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:11,139
and of course, the ever-present risk
of the unexpected.

100
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,183
For example,

101
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,560
now.

102
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,856
- Now?
- Do I kill you?

103
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,984
Or do I give you
and your toothy friends

104
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,112
another shot
at helping me get that territory?

105
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,407
Well, of course,
if I have a choice, I would rather...

106
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,075
You don't.

107
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,079
We've helped you get this far,
haven't we?

108
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,707
Replacing us now
might set you back.

109
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:40,252
Open up the territory
to other demons.

110
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,131
What about your witch?

111
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,216
She won't surprise us again.

112
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,051
She can't.

113
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,220
We'll be waiting for her next time.

114
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,475
I've been following you, Billie.

115
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,019
For a while now.

116
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,188
You have? Why?

117
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,647
I think you know why.

118
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,567
If I knew why,
I wouldn't ask why, would I?

119
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,527
- Cute.
- Thanks.

120
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,820
It wasn't a compliment.

121
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,990
Look, I'm just trying to solve
a mystery here, Billie.

122
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,160
In the process, you know,
maybe save a few innocent lives.

123
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,495
But I'm gonna need your help
to do that.

124
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,831
I'm gonna need you to come clean

125
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,876
about what it is
that brought you here,

126
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,003
and what you know
about the Halliwell sisters.

127
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,464
Who?

128
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,549
Call anytime.

129
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,011
Call soon.

130
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,102
- Who was that?
- Oh, that? That guy?

131
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,312
Just a guy...

132
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,232
"... from" Homeland Security.
- What?

133
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,400
What did he say? What did he want?

134
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,154
Well, he said
that he's been following me.

135
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,364
- Why?
- I don't know.

136
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,324
He thinks I know something
about you guys.

137
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,825
Great, just great.

138
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,203
- Did he follow you to the hospital?
- What hospital?

139
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,872
You didn't use your powers, did you?

140
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,208
I had no choice.
The imps were attacking an innocent.

141
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,793
- Imps?
- According to the "Book,"

142
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,629
imps are these gremlin-like creatures,
but way nastier.

143
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,339
I know what imps are.

144
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,174
If he saw her use magic,
we're screwed.

145
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,052
Why? He can't prove you're alive.
You don't even look like you.

146
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,179
He must have known
you were connected somehow.

147
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,181
Otherwise he wouldn't be
following you, right?

148
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,225
You shouldn't have sent her out.

149
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,228
She was just supposed
to go and ID the demon.

150
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,397
That's all I did.
Look, imps have an imp master,

151
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,190
so if we attack
the imp master, we can...

152
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,150
No, Billie, they're guns for hire.

153
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,820
- They can be working for any demon.
- That's what I'm saying.

154
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,114
We get the imp master
so he can tell where they are.

155
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,366
- No, we're not gonna do anything.
- But I think...

156
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,535
No buts. She's right.

157
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,496
If they're watching you, they're
watching us. We need to be careful.

158
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,123
Well, what are we supposed to do?

159
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,125
We just act normally,
and live our lives,

160
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,460
and hopefully
he'll go away sooner or later.

161
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,130
We'll go to P3 tomorrow
just like we planned and...

162
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,715
Great.

163
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,842
And you'll go to Napa with Dex.

164
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,677
- Well, I can't go now.
- Why?

165
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,554
He's gonna be here
in a few minutes.

166
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,056
Well, let's just say
I'm not in the mood anymore.

167
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,102
This ruse isn't really
working very well, is it?

168
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,771
Well, maybe we need to give it
a little more time.

169
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,982
You guys, I'm so sorry.

170
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,652
It's okay, sweetie. It's not your fault.

171
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,406
So much for happily ever after.

172
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,535
Come on, come on, come on.

173
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,662
There's gotta be some way
to fix this.

174
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,790
I could put Murphy to sleep.

175
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,375
No, no. That won't work.

176
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,842
Well, maybe at least
this one will help Phoebe out.

177
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,431
Okay.

178
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,684
- Dex.
- Hey.

179
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,854
What's wrong?

180
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,439
I'm so sorry.

181
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,943
<i>Hear these words
Hear my rhyme</i>

182
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,445
<i>Bless these two
In this time</i>

183
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:58,784
<i>Bring them both into the fold
Help them now cross love's threshold</i>

184
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:03,080
Please believe me, this has nothing
to do with you, it's just...

185
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,374
- It's just what?
- Well...

186
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,097
- What are we waiting for?
- I don't know. Let's go.

187
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,730
- Make a little more room here.
- Hi, listen, top 40 only.

188
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,860
Really. One power ballad and you'll
never DJ in this state again. Seriously.

189
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,945
Hi. You, come here,
come here, come here.

190
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,282
Table eight, water spots on a glass.
Please fix it, fix it, fix it.

191
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,616
Okay, okay.

192
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,660
Jeff, did you do
the final sound check?

193
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:42,953
Yeah, I sure did.

194
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,830
Okay, you need to relax
just a little bit.

195
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:47,332
I'll have plenty of time to relax
when this thing tanks.

196
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,251
Why are you worried?
This is not gonna tank.

197
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,503
Because it's what I do best, okay?

198
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,298
Dave, where are the mints?
We need mints on the table

199
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,508
if we're gonna matchmake here.
Thank you.

200
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:57,926
And people, help me out.

201
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,345
Okay, so listen. Be nice.

202
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,016
And try not to blow anyone off
until at least the second round.

203
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,809
I'm here, aren't I?

204
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,020
Okay. All right, let them in.

205
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,159
You so owe me.

206
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,540
- I love you, Mrs. Lawson.
- Say it again.

207
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:29,791
Mrs. Lawson.

208
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,379
I love it.

209
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,551
Wait.

210
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,554
I have to carry my bride
across the threshold, don't I?

211
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,362
Oh, what happened?

212
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:01,657
Well, you dropped me,
that's what happened.

213
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,660
- Look, I'm sorry.
- You should be sorry.

214
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:06,829
What...? L...

215
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:11,250
- Why was I just carrying you?
- What are you wearing?

216
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,459
What am I wearing?

217
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,214
Did we just do
what I think we just did?

218
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,591
You...

219
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,093
I just...

220
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,886
I need...

221
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,686
What did you do to me?

222
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,881
Tell me, was your dad a thief?

223
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:00,841
No, why?

224
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:05,053
Because he stole the stars
and put them in your eyes.

225
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,646
Yo, if I could rearrange
the letters of the alphabet,

226
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,441
U and I would be together.

227
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:44,760
- You look like you need a break.
- Yeah, I'm just a little overwhelmed.

228
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,303
You wanna sit this session out?

229
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,559
No. No, actually,
it would be perfectly great

230
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,353
if you stayed.

231
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,357
Well, my name's Whit.

232
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,150
Hello, Whit.

233
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,820
Hey, I'm Nick.

234
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,156
Hi, I'm married.

235
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,325
Yeah, I know, I read your bio, Jamie.

236
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,285
I work for "415 Magazine,"

237
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,329
and I came here to do a piece
on failing clubs,

238
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:14,873
but apparently,
I'm in the wrong place.

239
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,793
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

240
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,212
It seems you made
speed dating cool.

241
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:24,550
And that's news.
So I'd like to figure out how you did it.

242
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,969
What do you say I interview you
around 6:00 tonight?

243
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,055
Six?

244
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,683
- Yeah, sure.
- See you then.

245
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,773
Hello.

246
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,151
Billie did what?

247
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,987
So I said, "How much for the tool?"

248
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,364
And I've been working
at Homes For Humanity ever since.

249
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:52,244
I think you might
just be too good to be true.

250
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,121
Ditto.

251
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,040
Hello. Sorry to interrupt.

252
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:00,961
I just got a call,
and we need to go home.

253
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,213
Yeah, well, now's not really
a great time.

254
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,842
But it's a family emergency.

255
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:09,261
Excuse me.

256
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,349
Okay, I thought
we were done with those.

257
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,767
Well, apparently not.

258
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,144
Fine. Well, you take this one,

259
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,438
- I'll take the next.
- Listen, Jo...

260
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:22,608
Look, I did you a favour
by letting you drag me here,

261
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,693
now you do me a favour
by letting me stay.

262
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,781
- Fine, be that way.
- Fine, I will.

263
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,121
Sorry about that.

264
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,915
Where were we?

265
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:52,596
This is not little.
You made him marry me.

266
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:58,310
- Hi.
- Hi.

267
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,062
Dex, right?

268
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:04,816
- Right.
- I'm Julie... Jamie, Julie's cousin.

269
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,029
Where's the lucky bride?

270
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,365
You weren't supposed
to make him marry me.

271
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,325
I was supposed
to make him marry me.

272
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:14,827
Excuse me.

273
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,582
What's the problem
if the end result is the same?

274
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,376
- Who are you?
- You weren't thinking

275
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,169
about the rest of us.

276
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:27,047
- I was just trying to help.
- How is this helping?

277
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,007
Well, I didn't mean for you
to get married.

278
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,968
Well, you know what? I did.

279
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,719
And I cannot believe
that you used magic

280
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,930
when we specifically told you not to.

281
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,016
I thought you just meant demon magic,
not innocent magic.

282
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,102
Oh, really? And this is innocent?

283
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,396
Well, you look fabulous.

284
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,232
You know what, don't try to butter
me up with a compliment, missy.

285
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,359
Are you out of your mind?
What did you do now?

286
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:50,529
- Okay, do I have to start again?
- I can't believe you did this.

287
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:53,031
With Agent Murphy
watching our every move?

288
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,534
Skip down, I already
went through that with her.

289
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,911
I still don't know what I did
that was so bad.

290
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,830
This. This is what's bad.

291
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,124
Hey. Wow, that's huge.

292
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,501
Look, you guys,
I am so sorry, all right?

293
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,378
I know I screwed up
with the imps and...

294
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,547
Which, actually,
I really don't think that I did.

295
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:10,549
And then I felt bad,
like I ruined your lives.

296
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,676
I just wanted to fix it, that's it.

297
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:15,304
- By getting them married?
- Well, no.

298
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,432
No, not exactly, but she was supposed
to get married anyways, right?

299
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,602
- Yeah, but normally, not magically.
- How do you know?

300
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,979
How do you know it wasn't
supposed to happen like this?

301
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,565
I mean, she foresaw it, right?
She knew it was gonna happen.

302
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:29,359
That is completely besides the point.

303
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,153
- I don't think so.
- Well, I do.

304
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,697
And I'm older,
so what I think counts more.

305
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,159
Maybe she's right.

306
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:43,373
I mean, maybe this is how
it was supposed to happen.

307
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,168
How else would you explain Dex
and I getting married so quickly?

308
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,378
I'm confused.

309
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,755
Are we mad at her or not?

310
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,010
- We're not.
- Yes, good.

311
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,095
Now, can I go back to looking
for the imp demon?

312
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,305
- No.
- No.

313
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,849
No? What about the next innocent?

314
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,851
What we have learned
about this specific demon

315
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,687
is if we don't get him, he's gonna
keep going after these people.

316
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:09,024
Billie, if we get exposed, we may never
be able to help an innocent again.

317
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:12,027
- Do you understand that?
- Yeah, but don't you think...?

318
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,112
She's right.
You gotta pick your battles.

319
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,240
And right now,
this is not one of them.

320
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:22,496
- I'm a nurse, where is he?
- My son.

321
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,164
He's at the bottom
of the fire escape.

322
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,124
- He's not moving.
- Call 911.

323
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,996
Where's your witch?

324
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:06,290
Maybe we scared her off last time.

325
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,917
If she came once, she'll be back.

326
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,879
Witches can't help
but help other people.

327
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,755
It's their fatal flaw.

328
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,390
What are you gonna say to him?

329
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,601
- I don't know, I'm just gonna wing it.
- Wing it?

330
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,020
He's married. Don't you think
he's gonna wanna know why?

331
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:29,688
He doesn't have to know
it was magic.

332
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,523
But still, what is he gonna think?

333
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,233
Maybe that he got really drunk.

334
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,194
I mean, the point is it happened.

335
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,281
So that's what I have to focus him on.
For his sake and mine.

336
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,950
Wait, Phoebe, hold it.
Hang on a second, hang on.

337
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:43,785
You're really gonna
go through with this?

338
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,996
- I don't have a choice.
- Yeah, but, Phoebe, you...

339
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:48,624
I know that this
is not my Cinderella wedding.

340
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,251
Okay? But I also know
that everything happens for a reason.

341
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:53,629
So I have to just go with it.

342
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,797
Till death do you part?

343
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,051
Yes! Man.

344
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,471
Oh, man. Gee!
Oh, man, did you see that move?

345
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,306
Can you believe
he held on to that thing?

346
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,102
Hi, how's it going?

347
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,688
Good, watching the game.
Did you know Dex used to play?

348
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,607
No, I didn't know that.

349
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,318
Just a little college ball,
nothing really.

350
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,529
Oh, come on, nothing really.

351
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,532
Honey, I gotta get back to the club.

352
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,534
Okay, well, I'll see you tonight.

353
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:26,453
Don't you wanna walk me
to the door?

354
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,958
Sure.

355
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,335
Nice meeting you.
Congratulations.

356
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,254
Thanks.

357
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,387
Aren't you even remotely surprised
that they're married?

358
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:45,347
Not at all. She had that premonition.

359
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:46,640
Yeah, okay. Forget it.

360
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,767
Listen, try and give them
a little space, okay?

361
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:52,729
- I have to go, I've got an interview.
- An interview? Really? About what?

362
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:57,317
About P3 and me or, you know,
the me they think I am.

363
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,903
It's still the same you,
at least on the inside.

364
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,905
You should be excited.

365
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,657
I am.

366
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,450
Bye.

367
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,452
Bye, baby.

368
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,915
You changed.

369
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,209
Those things aren't very comfortable.

370
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,003
Do you even remember
how you got it?

371
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:19,506
- No.
- Yeah, me neither.

372
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:23,260
Look, Julie, I don't know
what's going on here,

373
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,471
but if you wanna go down
to city hall and get this fixed...

374
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,640
- To get it annulled?
- Well, yeah.

375
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,142
Is that what you want?

376
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,770
Look, I don't know what I want.
This is really weird.

377
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,732
I mean, one minute we're off to Napa,
and the next minute we're...

378
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:38,609
Yeah, I know.

379
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,446
- I mean, it's weird for me too.
- Yeah?

380
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:43,989
Yeah.

381
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:47,409
Somehow you seem, like, okay with it.

382
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,953
I mean, the fact
that we just got married.

383
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,249
No. I mean, I'm not okay with it.

384
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,210
It's just...

385
00:22:56,668 --> 00:23:01,215
Things happen to me in my life
and I've learned to accept them.

386
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,050
You know, I've had to.

387
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,719
Yeah. This sort of thing
happens to you all the time?

388
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:10,432
Well, no, not exactly this,
but, you know, other things have.

389
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:15,103
And it always turns out okay.

390
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,481
And I guess
I've just learned to trust that.

391
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:23,779
Even though you have no idea
how we got married?

392
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:27,991
Well, I kind of feel like
that part's irrelevant.

393
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,495
I mean, really, whether
we remember it or not, it happened.

394
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:34,498
And I believe that everything
happens for a reason.

395
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,502
So...

396
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,755
I don't know, maybe we should
just see this through.

397
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:45,509
It's not like we don't care
about each other.

398
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,554
True.

399
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,850
And I guess if things don't work out,

400
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,435
we can just have it annulled
in the future, right?

401
00:23:58,605 --> 00:23:59,857
True.

402
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:03,902
It's crazy, you know.

403
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:07,990
Yeah, I know.

404
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:27,759
Okay, wait.

405
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:32,181
Maybe we should
slow this down a little.

406
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:33,390
You're right, I'm sorry.

407
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,895
No, I'm sorry.

408
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,649
Why don't you tell me
a little more about yourself?

409
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:44,568
Well, I...

410
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,278
Screw it.

411
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,075
God, you're beautiful, Jo.

412
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,373
What's the matter?

413
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:06,757
- I can't do this.
- Okay, okay.

414
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:07,966
Was it something I said?

415
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,093
No, absolutely not.

416
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,303
It's not you.

417
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:14,139
I'm sorry.

418
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,981
Phoebe?

419
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:26,068
- Are you in there? Phoebe? Phoebe?
- What?

420
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:28,862
So I think I found out
who the imp master is working for.

421
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,197
No, no,
you don't understand.

422
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:32,741
I cross-referenced demons
that go after Good Samaritans,

423
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:34,451
and ones
that typically recruit others.

424
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:36,453
- Came up with a high-level demon.
- Billie...

425
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,664
Then I narrowed it down to one demon
named Antosis.

426
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:41,333
We need the power of three
to vanquish him, so I have a plan.

427
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,419
- Forget it.
- What do you mean forget it?

428
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,296
I mean forget it.
We are not doing this.

429
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:49,091
- That was before I found the demon.
- A power-of-three demon.

430
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:52,344
- So?
- So we can't take that risk.

431
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:53,887
But what about the greater good?

432
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:56,932
And everything you taught me
what you guys were about?

433
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:00,769
Okay, you know what, Billie, you have
to understand this is hard for us also.

434
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:04,606
We are not doing this, and we'll talk
more about it in the morning, okay?

435
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,150
No, it's not okay.

436
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,202
Is everything all right?

437
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:20,247
No, it's not all right.

438
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,098
Hey.

439
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:41,268
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

440
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:43,562
Just sitting here thinking.

441
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:45,522
Yeah? Mind if I join you?

442
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,649
No, of course not.

443
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,776
Pull up a pillow.

444
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,198
What's the matter?

445
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:57,993
Oh, it's just been
a very interesting day.

446
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,078
Tell me about it.

447
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:04,208
What? I take it Dex didn't like
not being able to go away?

448
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,585
Boy, are you behind in the news.

449
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:09,087
Oh, my gosh.
He asked you to marry him?

450
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,757
No, we're actually already married.

451
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:15,469
It's not what you think.

452
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:17,763
- Billie cast a spell.
- She did what?

453
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,432
I know, I know,
and we already yelled at her.

454
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:26,605
Besides, I actually don't think
she did anything wrong.

455
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,361
In fact, I think she's the only one
doing anything right around here.

456
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:35,072
If you're trying to confuse me,
you're doing a bang-up job.

457
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,157
Do you ever wonder

458
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,910
that maybe we made a mistake
faking our own death?

459
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:43,789
Funny you should ask,
I met this guy today

460
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,669
and I kind of could have liked him.

461
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,295
That's great, Paige.

462
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,131
No, actually, it's not.

463
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,967
How am I ever supposed
to be with someone

464
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,468
when they're not with
the real me?

465
00:27:58,762 --> 00:27:59,972
Yeah.

466
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:02,641
I keep asking myself
the same exact question.

467
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:06,645
Only it's not just about guys,
it's everything.

468
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:11,608
I mean, you know, who we used to be,
the whole "greater good" thing.

469
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,318
Right.

470
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:17,197
And I just worry
that the more we ignore it,

471
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,658
the more we're just
not gonna be able to.

472
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:21,493
What are we gonna do?

473
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,330
Thanks to Billie, we're gonna have
to come up with a plan pretty soon.

474
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,833
I'm sorry, what do you mean,
thanks to Billie?

475
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,963
Yeah, she made me feel pretty guilty
about not helping her with this demon.

476
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,090
- And she was right.
- Well, where is she?

477
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:38,177
I don't know.
She stormed out of here.

478
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:39,678
Maybe she went to her dorm.

479
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:44,141
No, she's probably after the demon.

480
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,025
- I'd really like to help you, Agent...
- Murphy.

481
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:55,235
Murphy.

482
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,070
But I have an interview.

483
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:00,199
You know, if I showed
these photos to most people,

484
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:03,243
more than likely,
they'd be shocked or repulsed.

485
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,329
- But not you.
- I internalize a lot.

486
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:08,499
Or you're more used to seeing these
kind of victims than you let on.

487
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:11,168
Agent Murphy,
I just run a nightclub. That's all.

488
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:13,921
Just like Piper used to, right?

489
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:17,716
I've been watching you ever since
she and her sisters disappeared.

490
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:19,259
Don't you mean since they died?

491
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:24,723
You tell me. Look, I'm not the hard-ass
Agent Keyes was, all right?

492
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:28,560
He left me behind because he didn't
believe the Halliwells were really dead.

493
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:32,105
Even though we both think you know
exactly what really happened.

494
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:36,026
The difference is,
I don't wanna bust you or them.

495
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:38,737
I just want help. I need it.

496
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:41,073
For the past month,
people have been showing up dead

497
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,242
for reasons
no one can really explain,

498
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:48,956
but I think you and your cousins know
exactly who or what is responsible.

499
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:51,750
By what, you mean?

500
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:54,294
You know exactly what I mean.
Things beyond normal.

501
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,255
Powerful things like yourself.

502
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:58,298
Of course, like everything else,

503
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,717
there are good things
and bad things.

504
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,637
But if you're not doing anything
to stop this, then,

505
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:06,098
as far as I'm concerned,
you're on the wrong side.

506
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,852
And I don't know
how you could live with yourselves.

507
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:17,317
I'm sorry, but I really need to get this.

508
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,279
Billie has my number.

509
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:27,202
Taxi. Taxi.

510
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:31,665
Here, get him to a hospital fast, okay?
Hurry up. Go.

511
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:44,970
Like a moth to a flame.

512
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,359
Any sign of Billie?

513
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,820
Well, just that she's in the area.

514
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,780
What do you mean,
she's in the area?

515
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:06,658
She's moving around so much
it's hard getting a lock on her.

516
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,495
You know, we should upgrade
to her GPS scrying system.

517
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:12,247
Well, if she survives this,
we'll ask her how.

518
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:13,999
At least we know
what we're up against.

519
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,667
She left the "Book" open to the demon.

520
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:18,837
The problem is only the power-of-three
spell is going to vanquish him.

521
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:22,883
I don't understand why she'd go up
against a demon she can't vanquish.

522
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,219
I'll make sure to ask her that
if she's still alive.

523
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:27,012
I can't believe we're doing this again.

524
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,515
Well, Agent Murphy thinks
we never should have stopped.

525
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,850
Wait, does he know
who we really are?

526
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:34,520
No, but he's getting warmer.

527
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:38,524
Guess who?

528
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:42,361
- Looking for me, are you?
- Antosis.

529
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:47,032
I'm flattered. And of course,
you've already met my friend.

530
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,035
- Or rather, his friends.
- What do you want?

531
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:54,164
You, alone and out of my way.

532
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:04,675
- No, wait.
- Are you kidding me?

533
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:07,553
- There's demons in the house.
- But she said she has a plan.

534
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,054
I am curious.

535
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,683
What made you think
you could take me out all by yourself?

536
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,645
I know I can't take you out.
But I can take them out.

537
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:28,448
Only the Charmed Ones
can vanquish you.

538
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:29,825
Too bad they're dead.

539
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,910
Are they?

540
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:36,248
<i>Hear us now, the witches call
He who makes Samaritans fall</i>

541
00:32:36,415 --> 00:32:40,586
<i>We speak as one, the sisters three
And banish you to eternity</i>

542
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:46,133
No! No!

543
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:53,056
- I wanna learn how to do that.
- You know what?

544
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,434
Are you crazy? Really?
You could have been killed.

545
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:57,936
I would've been if you guys
would've gotten home earlier.

546
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:00,105
I've been walking around outside
for like an hour.

547
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:02,065
You took a huge risk.

548
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:03,525
For all of us.

549
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,278
Thank you.

550
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:05,879
Morning.

551
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,172
- Morning.
- Morning.

552
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:08,966
What's the matter?

553
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:12,386
I don't know, I guess the same thing
that's been bothering you guys.

554
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:15,180
What makes you think
something's bothering us?

555
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:16,431
Thin walls.

556
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:18,517
You've been eavesdropping?

557
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:19,852
Well, only from the bathroom.

558
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,895
Yeah, and the hallway,
but don't worry,

559
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:24,356
I haven't been listening
to any, you know, funny stuff.

560
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,234
How long has this been going on?

561
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:30,696
Since like the fourth or fifth grade.

562
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:34,741
- I'll fix it.
- Basically,

563
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,911
I don't think this whole thing
is working for any of us anymore.

564
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,413
I don't think it ever worked.

565
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,623
It helped you find a life
outside fighting demons.

566
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,126
Which is something we need
to keep trying to do.

567
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,712
Well, we've got Billie,
so that's gonna make it easier.

568
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,881
Yeah, but it doesn't solve
our bigger problem,

569
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,924
which is how we're gonna
get out of this mess.

570
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:55,596
I am so tired of pretending
to be someone else.

571
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,181
I miss me.

572
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,099
Maybe that's what
your premonition was for.

573
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:01,685
Maybe you wouldn't have realized
if you hadn't married Dex.

574
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:05,147
Yeah, but I didn't marry Dex.
Julie married Dex.

575
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:06,440
I think that's her point.

576
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:09,735
I think that's everyone's point.
You want your old identities back.

577
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:16,575
Are we sure
we really wanna do this?

578
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:18,619
- Positive.
- Absolutely.

579
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,623
All right then.

580
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,420
You sure you can rework the spell?

581
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:31,632
Oh, I already have.

582
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:36,428
<i>I call upon the ancient powers
To unmask us now and in future hours</i>

583
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:41,141
<i>Show us well and thoroughly
Reveal ourselves so the world can see</i>

584
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:47,105
Now, that's more like it.

585
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:53,487
It's good to be back,
although Dex is gonna freak out.

586
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:57,574
Everyone's gonna freak out,
because technically we're still dead.

587
00:35:57,741 --> 00:35:59,701
How exactly
are we gonna explain this?

588
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:05,123
Well, it's nice to know
they can't overhear everything.

589
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:35,863
Hi, how's it going?

590
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:38,157
By any chance, is Agent Murphy in?

591
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:41,577
Who should I say is asking?

592
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:46,331
Oh, I don't know, girls,
maybe we should just surprise him.

593
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:55,716
- What the hell?
- What's the matter, Agent Murphy?

594
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,551
You look like you just saw a ghost.

595
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:01,013
Leave us.

596
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,015
Keyes was right.

597
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:04,975
So were you.

598
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:07,352
Did you mean when you said
you just wanted our help?

599
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,770
You weren't here to bust us?

600
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:11,190
Wait, how'd you know I said that?

601
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:13,233
Because you weren't talking
to Jamie Bennet.

602
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,526
You were talking to me.

603
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:16,862
We were all magically disguised.

604
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,032
Come on, don't look so surprised.

605
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:23,410
You yourself said
we were these powerful things.

606
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:25,746
Powerful witches, to be exact.

607
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:28,123
Who did exactly what you wanted.

608
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,750
Getting rid of that bad, bad demon

609
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:32,044
who was hurting
those good Good Samaritans.

610
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:34,129
Demons?

611
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:35,714
He seems awfully shocked for a guy

612
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,925
that claims to know
about the supernatural.

613
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:40,052
You're right, maybe we should go.

614
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:42,596
Wait. No, no. Don't. Please.

615
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:44,473
Look, it's just...

616
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,561
It's one thing to believe in this stuff,
but another to actually see it.

617
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:51,688
- Fair enough.
- Okay, here's the deal.

618
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:54,274
You wanna know more
about who we are and what we do,

619
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:55,484
we'll tell you.

620
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:58,070
And help you out
with a few cases along the way.

621
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,239
If you help us.

622
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:04,409
- And you don't get too greedy.
- And if you protect our secret.

623
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:05,911
Or else what?

624
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:07,496
What, is that some sort of threat?

625
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:09,498
You don't wanna know.

626
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:13,877
Okay.

627
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:15,629
What do you want me to do?

628
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:19,591
I can't talk about
the specifics of the case

629
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:21,260
the sisters were involved in, okay?

630
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:23,846
All I can say is it involved
a threat to national security,

631
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:26,473
and that our agency got involved
to protect them. That's it.

632
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:28,475
What kind of threats?

633
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,936
What kind of threats, sir?
What kind of threats?

634
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,063
<i>I already said
they were witness to a crime,</i>

635
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,648
<i>an attempt was made on their lives.</i>

636
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:38,402
<i>We only falsified their deaths
in order to flush out the perpetrators.</i>

637
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:41,280
<i>All right? No more questions.</i>

638
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:44,908
<i>Up next, our local weather
is in for some big changes.</i>

639
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:48,453
<i>Plus, I'll take a trip to an area...</i>

640
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:55,335
- Phoebe?
- Hi.

641
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:57,296
- Hi.
- Can I come in?

642
00:38:57,796 --> 00:38:59,631
Yeah, sure.

643
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:02,718
I was just...

644
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:06,305
I mean, I can't believe
you're actually...

645
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:08,015
- Alive?
- Yeah.

646
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:09,224
It's crazy, huh?

647
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:10,809
Yeah.

648
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:14,563
If you're looking for Julie,
she's not here.

649
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:18,233
Well, that's not entirely true.

650
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:20,819
Sorry?

651
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:22,905
Look, Dex,

652
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:28,160
I wish that there was an easier way
to explain this to you,

653
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:34,333
to lessen the blow, but there isn't.

654
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,543
So I'm just gonna have to show you.

655
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:39,004
Show me what?

656
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:41,507
Forgive me.

657
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:55,145
How do I look?

658
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:57,648
Not bad,
considering you've been dead.

659
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:01,026
Well, I just hope this blows over
sooner rather than later.

660
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:04,071
Don't count on it.
We're not that lucky.

661
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:09,159
All right, we can do this.
We are back and better than ever.

662
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:10,619
I'll hold you to that.

663
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:14,289
There they are!

664
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:20,587
Welcome back!

665
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:24,258
We're back.
