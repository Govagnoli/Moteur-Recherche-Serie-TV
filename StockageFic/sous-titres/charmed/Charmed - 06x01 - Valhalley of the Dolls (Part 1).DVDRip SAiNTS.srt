1
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,132
All right!

2
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,468
Give it up for Smash Mouth!

3
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,805
Let's hear it, come on!

4
00:00:56,181 --> 00:01:01,061
Hangin' Chad, coming back live
at the KQSF Annual Beach Bash.

5
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:04,189
Winding it up with
our special guest,

6
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:09,528
the stunningly beautiful,
Phoebe Halliwell

7
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,530
of "Ask Phoebe" fame.

8
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,532
Okay, so, what's your deal?

9
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,409
Are you psychic, is that it?

10
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,537
- I'm sorry?
- I mean you gotta be, don't you?

11
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,622
Your column has skyrocketed,

12
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:25,460
all the critics rave about how
amazingly insightful your advice is.

13
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,837
How else do you explain it?

14
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,506
I just think I read people really well.

15
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,675
Oh, you do, do you?

16
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:32,885
Can you read me?

17
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,599
I don't know.
Write a letter and we'll see.

18
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,267
Come on, give it a shot.

19
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,979
You guys wanna see her do it,
don't you?

20
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,609
All right, all right.

21
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,028
What do you want advice on?

22
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,696
Okay, let's see.

23
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:56,533
There's this woman that I like,
and I'd like to ask her out.

24
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,245
But I'm afraid she'll say no.
What should I do?

25
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,045
Well, why don't you just ask me
and find out?

26
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,448
Hey, are you out of your mind?

27
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,741
What are you doing here?

28
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,409
Freyja sent me.

29
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,370
She wants to know
what's taking so long.

30
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,247
Freyja?

31
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,541
For a mythical character,
she sure does worry a lot.

32
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,417
She's not the only one
who's worried.

33
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:49,878
He's an Elder, Chris.

34
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,130
How much longer do you really
expect us to keep him?

35
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,715
Don't tell me he's complaining.

36
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,175
Yes, a lot actually.

37
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,261
I don't believe it!
Banish the guy to an island

38
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,472
filled with beautiful women
and he still complains.

39
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,391
- I can't win.
- How much longer?

40
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,684
Until I'm ready.

41
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,688
I'm sorry, but I haven't finished
what I came here to do yet.

42
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,815
And I need Leo
out of the way until I can.

43
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,485
More importantly, the sisters
can't find him before I'm ready.

44
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:14,945
- Or else...
- I know.

45
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,615
We all understand the risks.

46
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,327
I'd never hurt you, Mist.

47
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,331
- You know that.
- You would if you had to.

48
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,001
I know that too.

49
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,628
Chris, are you up there?

50
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,631
You better go.

51
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,273
Please. Hurry.

52
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,781
Hey, do you have any laundry?

53
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,661
No, no. I'm good, thanks.

54
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,290
I'm gonna get your sisters.
We have another demon to vanquish.

55
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,042
Okey-dokey.

56
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,551
Hi. I'm sorry if I embarrassed
you back there.

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,763
- I'm glad it was on the radio.
- I don't know why I answered like that.

58
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,973
- It was...
- It was dead on, that's what it was.

59
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,352
It was exactly what I was feeling.
Nervous about asking you out.

60
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,687
Really? You were?

61
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,650
Well, then maybe I should ask you out
and just take the pressure off.

62
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,531
I just don't know
what's the matter with me.

63
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,075
It's gotta be the heat or something.

64
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,248
- Bayview CafÃ©, say, 1:00?
- I'll be there.

65
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,749
Phoebe.

66
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,210
Chris, what are you doing here?

67
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,504
Listen, I gotta get back.

68
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,840
- Don't be late.
- I won't be.

69
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,596
Trok demon. Remember?

70
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,600
- Chris, get a life.
- Come on.

71
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,478
Stop! Stop!

72
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,109
Sit! Heel!

73
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,406
Stop!

74
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,953
I gotta get a real job.

75
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,877
Trok demon?

76
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,837
What now?
Can't you see I'm working?

77
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,603
All right, can we get this started
because I have to go...

78
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,146
Where did they come from?

79
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,106
He wouldn't let me
take them back first.

80
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,775
- Back?
- Yeah, I'm a...

81
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,194
...dog walker.

82
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,321
The temp agency messed up.

83
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,409
Do you mind? We have to summon
the demon while he's still on our plane.

84
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,454
- Piper!
- Oh, Chris, lighten up.

85
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,957
Sending us after all these demons
is getting to be a real drag.

86
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,336
- Yeah, you're working us like dogs.
- I don't see Piper complaining.

87
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:20,464
No, because Piper doesn't complain
about anything anymore.

88
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,174
Ever since Leo left
to become an Elder,

89
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,594
all she does is walk
around the house all chipper.

90
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,721
- So?
- So it's unusual.

91
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,598
What's worse, it's not Piper.

92
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,183
I'd love to have a play date.

93
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,019
Maybe we can call Jennie
and she can bring baby Josie.

94
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,397
And then I'll bring the juice
and maybe bake some muffins, and...

95
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,150
Oh, how cute.

96
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:41,777
Okay?

97
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,779
- She's getting worse.
- Definitely.

98
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,198
- Do you have a spell?
- Right out of the Book.

99
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,992
After you summon him,
make sure Piper freezes him.

100
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,869
Otherwise you'll never
get the spell off.

101
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,205
Take these guys to the attic,
they'll be fine there.

102
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,999
- Wait. Me?
- Yeah, you. Go.

103
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,297
- Alrighty, are we ready?
- Alrighty.

104
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:06,552
Phoebe, have I told you how much
I love your new 'do, it's fabulous!

105
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,346
- Very chipper.
- Okay, let's do this.

106
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,390
You take this.

107
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,820
Piper, freeze him!

108
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,617
What did you do that for?

109
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,828
I don't know. I didn't mean to.

110
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,294
"From other worlds far and near

111
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,504
Let's get him the Trok out of here"

112
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,680
Everybody okay?

113
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,765
Yeah. That was awesome.

114
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,995
What kind of whitelighter can't heal?

115
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,207
- For the record, you can't heal either.
- I'm half whitelighter.

116
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,626
How come you didn't tell us this
before we hired you?

117
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:06,004
Because you didn't hire me.
I was assigned by the Elders.

118
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,590
Any other little surprises
you'd like to share with us?

119
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,509
No.

120
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,888
Look, I haven't been a whitelighter
very long, okay?

121
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,140
And healing, it's big.

122
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,519
- And takes a while to learn how to do.
- Great, student-lighter.

123
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:24,731
You could have told us about this,
like, I don't know, maybe a month ago?

124
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,567
Well, I know one thing for sure.

125
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,027
We're gonna stop
all this demon-fighting for a while.

126
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,863
Wait. Why?

127
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,366
Can somebody please fold the towels
in the dryer when it's done?

128
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,576
That's why.

129
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,829
I put a casserole in the oven. You can
check it in about an hour or so.

130
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,082
I will be at the club if you need me.
Have fun.

131
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:46,086
Oh, my God. She is so sad.

132
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,547
Sad?
Where are you getting sad from?

133
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,301
How about this? Three more demons,
then we can talk about taking a break.

134
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,886
Do you have a quota or something?

135
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,304
I've told you this before.

136
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,348
I know from future knowledge that
a demon is gonna come after Wyatt.

137
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,392
These are all
just pre-emptive strikes.

138
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,519
Okay. Look, Chris, we like you a lot.

139
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,897
But we've been doing this
a lot longer than you have.

140
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:09,943
Trust me, you have to pace yourself
and you gotta let us have a life.

141
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,071
Speaking of which, I have to go
get ready for my lunch date.

142
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,324
Oh, I didn't know your boss
was back in town.

143
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,117
No, it's not with Jason.

144
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,537
It's with Chad, the DJ,
who I'm not really interested in.

145
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,915
Two demons.
How about that? Two?

146
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,793
No, Chris, and especially not until
we figure out what's wrong with Piper.

147
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,879
And more importantly,
Piper's powers.

148
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,798
I swear, I think Leo did something
to her before he left.

149
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:36,094
You know what? I think it's about time
we orb him down here and ask him.

150
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,805
- I don't think that's possible.
- Well, then make it possible.

151
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,016
Even if he doesn't care
about Piper as his wife,

152
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:44,686
as an Elder, he at the least should care
about what happened to her powers.

153
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,147
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

154
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,983
You just go up there and tell him
to get his butt back down here.

155
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,402
That's not why I can't.

156
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:56,156
I didn't wanna tell you this because
I didn't wanna worry you two but...

157
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,284
Leo's missing.

158
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,663
- What?
- Missing? How long?

159
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,083
Since the last time we saw him.

160
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,006
Anyways, the Elders
think he's been... kidnapped.

161
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,384
By whom?

162
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,974
Go! Go!

163
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:25,435
They got Kruger!

164
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,442
Who?

165
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,529
What the...?

166
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,282
It's all right.
You don't have to be afraid.

167
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,617
You're one of the chosen few.

168
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,712
Don't worry.

169
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,214
I promise you'll understand
soon enough.

170
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,571
- You're amazing, Piper.
- Sorry?

171
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,656
I mean, seriously,
I don't know how you do it.

172
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,034
I mean, I could barely
take care of myself

173
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,828
when little Darryl was a baby,
let alone run a daycare.

174
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:28,040
Well, you know, nobody was using
the club during the day anyway,

175
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:31,710
and I was running out of room at home
with all of Wyatt's play dates.

176
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,754
Well, I think it's great.

177
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:37,424
Really, I mean, especially
with everything you're going through.

178
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,262
What?

179
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,265
Sheila's been a little
concerned about you lately.

180
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,976
You know, with Leo and all.

181
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,354
I can't even imagine
how hard it must be for you.

182
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,105
Do you ever even talk to him?

183
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,441
Oh, no. It's probably
against the rules.

184
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,944
But, you know,
no use crying over spilt milk.

185
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,322
And besides, you know,
I just gotta push ahead for Wyatt.

186
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,618
Well, better get these treats
to the little ones.

187
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,829
Is Darryl Jr. Staying late?

188
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,622
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

189
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:09,998
Super.

190
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,336
Hey, guys, have fun.
Coming through.

191
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,422
I gotta get back to the station.

192
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:20,801
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

193
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,846
- Hi.
- What's the matter?

194
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:28,141
- Sorry?
- Something's bothering you, I can tell.

195
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,979
- Phoebe?
- What?

196
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,230
Oh, sorry.

197
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,774
So, you know,
Piper's doing fine, huh?

198
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,110
Yeah, but you don't think she is.

199
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,865
Don't mind her,
she's just being a little annoying.

200
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,075
Would you excuse us for a second?

201
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,786
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

202
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,746
- See you later.
- Bye.

203
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,832
What is going on with you?

204
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,208
I don't know, it's weird.

205
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,462
Lately, I've just been feeling
a lot of weird vibes.

206
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:58,714
I don't know what it is.

207
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,466
Vibes.

208
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,760
Check it out.
I can really, really only deal

209
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,889
- with one whacked out sister at a time.
- Got it.

210
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,517
Piper?

211
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:11,852
Piper, you got a minute?

212
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,480
- Can it wait?
- No, actually, it can't.

213
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,941
- It's about Leo.
- Oh, did he call?

214
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,193
Not exactly.

215
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,446
There's no easy way to break this
so I'm just gonna come out and say it.

216
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,407
Leo's missing.

217
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:29,661
We found out the Elders haven't heard
from him since he left to join them.

218
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,417
So did he happen
to say anything to you

219
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:38,420
the last time you saw him
that could potentially help?

220
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,756
No. All I remember him saying

221
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:44,760
is that he was leaving to become
an Elder and I wished him good luck.

222
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,845
That's it?
That was your big goodbye?

223
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,889
Yeah, as far as I can remember.

224
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:52,476
But I wouldn't worry about it too much.
He'll turn up sooner or later.

225
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:53,685
Excuse me.

226
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:57,940
So much for that shocking
her back into reality, huh?

227
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,317
Unfortunately,
I think only Leo can do that.

228
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,952
Greetings, Mist.

229
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,417
You under-rotated.

230
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:00,544
Now watch.

231
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,891
You were gone a while, Mist.

232
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,142
I was beginning to worry.

233
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,728
I wanted you to be pleased.

234
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,948
Cute.

235
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,617
But can he fight?

236
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:32,993
Like no other.

237
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:34,369
We'll see.

238
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,830
Am I in heaven?

239
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,749
Warrior heaven.

240
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,336
Until I see how well you do
against our champion, anyway.

241
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,656
What do you want from me?

242
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,491
We want you to fight.

243
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,377
He fought well enough.

244
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,714
Heal him. Get him into training.

245
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,845
- Come.
- What about me?

246
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,264
I don't belong here and you know it!

247
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,058
No? You're an Elder, aren't you?

248
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,520
You have much to teach
my warriors.

249
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,885
Where exactly are you trying
to find Leo? Jupiter?

250
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,553
When an Elder gets kidnapped,

251
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,223
they're probably not just gonna
take him to Chinatown, right?

252
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,767
I think everything is game,
even the cosmos.

253
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,102
Still, I don't see how the crystal's
gonna find him,

254
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,813
especially not without something
of his to focus it better.

255
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,108
I've got one of his plaid shirts.

256
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,070
I was thinking something
a little more special than that.

257
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,822
Leo loved those shirts.
His entire closet's full of them.

258
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,078
What's your problem?

259
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,165
You're nervous, I can feel it.

260
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,167
Watch your vibes.

261
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:31,588
I just think you guys should be
focusing on helping Piper, not Leo.

262
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,298
- I was right.
- Hey, finding Leo

263
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,300
could help us with Piper.

264
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:39,263
Well, then you better find another way,
because you are not gonna find him.

265
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,810
I mean, you haven't found him yet,
have you?

266
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,564
I'm telling you, just leave
it up to the Elders, all right?

267
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,692
- Just let it go.
- Let it go? He's Wyatt's father.

268
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,902
- And our brother-in-law.
- Ex-brother-in-law.

269
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:57,072
I'm just trying to get you two to focus
on your sister here. That's all.

270
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,492
Because with her powers messed up,
you guys are all at risk.

271
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:04,454
- He's right.
- I know.

272
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,791
But if Leo did do something
to block Piper's pain,

273
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,501
how do we unblock it without him?

274
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,296
- A magical laxative.
- Okay.

275
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,966
But think about it. If we can write
a spell to help her remember her pain,

276
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,886
I don't know,
it could even help us find Leo.

277
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,098
Who are you calling, Spells "R" Us?

278
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,808
No, I'm calling the Bayview CafÃ©.

279
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:28,103
I'm gonna cancel my lunch date
with Chad, which I'm already late for.

280
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,313
Bayview CafÃ©.

281
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,398
Hi, can I speak
to Chad Carson, please?

282
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:34,318
- I was supposed to meet him for...
- Yes, he couldn't make it today.

283
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,486
- What?
- He called and he cancelled.

284
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,405
- He cancelled?
- Yes, he cancelled.

285
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:39,948
Are you sure?
He didn't even call...

286
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:43,869
He told us to let you know
he's very sorry.

287
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,706
He stood me up.

288
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,501
Wait, weren't you just calling
to cancel on him?

289
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,711
Yeah, but I called him.
That's cancelling.

290
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,422
He called the restaurant.
That's standing up.

291
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,342
This doesn't make any sense.

292
00:20:58,509 --> 00:20:59,593
I don't understand.

293
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,930
He liked me,
he really liked me. I felt it.

294
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:07,935
Well, excuse me, but it didn't even
seem like your heart was in it anyway.

295
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,396
Where you going?
We have a spell to write!

296
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,357
And I have a DJ to grill!

297
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,237
All right, here you go, Chad.

298
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,197
Thanks, Billy.

299
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:21,865
Hey.

300
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,284
I hear they have hot dogs
at the Bayview CafÃ©.

301
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,286
Phoebe, what are you doing here?

302
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,580
That's funny, I was about to ask
you the same thing.

303
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,582
Listen, I can explain.

304
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,835
That's good,
because that's why I'm here.

305
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,379
I was just hoping you could
help me understand something

306
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:38,257
that's baffled women
since the beginning of time.

307
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:42,135
Why don't men call
after they ask us out?

308
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,054
And why do they cancel
at the last minute,

309
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:47,307
and even worse, stand us up?

310
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,853
Look, I'm sorry but I had something
really important come up.

311
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:56,316
- Are you intimidated by me?
- What?

312
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,319
Because you weren't intimidated
by me when you asked me out.

313
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:01,405
Hold on, you asked me out,
remember?

314
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,991
Oh, wait. Are you saying
that you didn't want me though?

315
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:07,703
- Because I know you did, I felt it.
- Wait a minute.

316
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,916
You don't like successful women.

317
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,086
I gotta go.

318
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:20,048
Wait, are you telling me that everything
that I've worked so hard for in my life,

319
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:24,136
everything I fought to achieve,
makes me less attractive to men?

320
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:27,055
Because if that's what you're saying,
I just...

321
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:31,810
It just hurts. It hurts so much.

322
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,730
It hurts so much, Mommy!

323
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,274
Don't you think
you're overreacting just a little?

324
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,692
No, I don't!

325
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,030
Actually, yeah, I do.

326
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:47,451
- It hurts so much, Mommy.
- I know it does.

327
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,498
Sir, what does it matter
when I bring the dogs home?

328
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:56,210
Their owners aren't there. That's why
I got the job in the first place.

329
00:22:56,418 --> 00:23:00,339
Why don't you go hump a dog?
Did you ever think of that?

330
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,049
No, not you, sir.

331
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,968
Look, you know,
when I came to the agency,

332
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:11,433
I really went with the idea that I would
be helping people, not animals.

333
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:14,102
And what I really mean
to say is that it's...

334
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:18,232
Sir, it is time for me
to strike out on my own.

335
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:23,195
Yeah, I'll have the dogs
back in an hour.

336
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:27,366
- Piper's home!
- Coming.

337
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,285
Hey, who's that?

338
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,787
Ask her.

339
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:34,414
Hi, how's it going?

340
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,667
How's it going?

341
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:37,960
What are you doing?

342
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,753
Whose babies are these?

343
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,046
Hi.

344
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:43,549
Well, their mommies
couldn't pick them up in time,

345
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:46,051
so I offered to bring
them home for a while.

346
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,887
Oh, you did?

347
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,722
What about, you know, Leo?

348
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:53,392
I don't know, what about him?

349
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,812
Look, Wyatt, look who's here.

350
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,606
Another friend for you to play with.

351
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:02,192
- Is that the memory spell?
- Yeah.

352
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,237
And she can stay
as long as she likes.

353
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,864
Cast it.

354
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:11,326
"Powers and emotions tied
A witch's heart is where it hides

355
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:15,164
Help her through her agony
Bless her with her memory"

356
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:21,879
Piper, you okay?

357
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:25,507
I'm sorry, do I know you?

358
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:27,968
Very funny.

359
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,721
Oh, cute.

360
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:33,432
Yours?

361
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,392
No, yours.

362
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,020
Mine? Well, what do you mean?

363
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:40,981
Wait, who am I?

364
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:43,650
What am I doing here?

365
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:47,070
Great, Paige, you didn't restore
her memory, you erased it.

366
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,823
That's impossible.
It's a good spell, I know it.

367
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:54,328
Unless it interacted badly
with Leo's magic.

368
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,666
What happened?
How did that happen?

369
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,544
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

370
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:05,464
Just don't point at anything, okay?
Just keep your hands down.

371
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:08,175
Like this: Okay?

372
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,469
Can somebody please
tell me what's going on?

373
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:14,306
We're gonna tell you that,
just as soon as we know ourselves.

374
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:18,477
Okay, you come in here,
and you have a seat,

375
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:20,020
and take a load off.

376
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,105
Yeah, and keep those arms down.

377
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:23,815
Oh, my goodness.

378
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:27,694
Don't freak out, because magic got us
into this and magic will get us out.

379
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:37,621
- Did you see that?
- See what?

380
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,958
- Wyatt, he orbed his pacifier.
- What?

381
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,545
I think I know how to find Leo.

382
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:47,840
Leo? Will you please
forget about Leo?

383
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,801
Oh, Piper, hi!

384
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:52,386
You're never gonna believe this.

385
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,054
I think I have a new power.

386
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:56,765
It would certainly explain
a lot of my weird behaviour lately,

387
00:25:56,932 --> 00:25:58,183
like why I wanted to date Chad,

388
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,395
and why my advice
has been so amazingly accurate.

389
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:04,857
I know, this is huge, right? Huge.

390
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,484
So, what's my new power you ask?
Oh, I'll tell you.

391
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:10,487
Do you remember that empath
we helped a couple of years ago?

392
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:13,240
That guy that could feel
what other people were feeling?

393
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,658
- Phoebe.
- Just a sec.

394
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:16,410
I think that's what I am now.

395
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,620
An empath.

396
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:21,206
I am an empath.

397
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,791
That's my new power.

398
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,752
Or at least an advancement
of my premonition power, I don't know.

399
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:27,671
Neither does she, I'm afraid.

400
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,548
Know, that is, anything.

401
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,258
Paige erased her memory.

402
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,761
Can you blow things up too?

403
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,640
Oh, boy.

404
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:39,892
Paige!

405
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,233
What did you do to our sister?

406
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,277
Oh, you poor dear.

407
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,779
You feel awful about it, don't you?

408
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,031
I'm so sorry.

409
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:58,744
- Thanks. I think.
- That's it?

410
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:02,122
That's all the ass-kicking you'll dole
out? You're supposed to be sisters.

411
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:04,374
She's clearly devastated about this.

412
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:07,711
You can't let her off the hook. You
need enough guilt to get her to fix it.

413
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:10,130
I think I just fixed it.

414
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:11,924
I think we just found Leo.

415
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:14,801
- "We"?
- Yep, Wyatt and me.

416
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:18,305
I mean, nothing's more important
to Leo than him, right?

417
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:20,140
Oh, there you go, big boy.

418
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:24,228
- Let's go.
- Go? Go where?

419
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,438
It's pointing to the middle
of the Indian Ocean.

420
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,482
There must be something there.
I trust Wyatt.

421
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,983
- No, this is crazy.
- Chris,

422
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:32,110
she's feeling really
strongly about this.

423
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,406
I have a new power.

424
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:38,575
I'll explain on the way.

425
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:40,494
Hey, can you take the dogs
back for me?

426
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:42,913
- The addresses are in the book.
- No, there's no way.

427
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:52,422
If anyone should be protecting
themselves, it's me from you.

428
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:18,657
It's so beautiful here, it's like paradise.
But why isn't it on the map?

429
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:20,909
They obviously don't want
anyone to know it exists.

430
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:24,371
Like the island has some sort
of magical camouflage or something.

431
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:26,665
Yeah, well,
that's a hell of a lot of magic.

432
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:28,375
Over there!

433
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:43,599
Well, that was close.
I hope they're not looking for us.

434
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:00,365
Anything?

435
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:01,783
Phoebe. Paige.

436
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,286
Leo! Oh, my God.

437
00:29:04,495 --> 00:29:06,038
I can't believe it.

438
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:08,123
I can't tell you how good
it is to see you guys.

439
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,667
- Hey, you cut your hair.
- Yeah, you like it?

440
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,044
Hello, people.

441
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:14,796
What are you doing in here anyway?

442
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:17,633
Somebody put me here, that's what.
Watch out!

443
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:40,948
Oh, thank you.

444
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,787
Wow, Leo, I didn't know
you had it in you.

445
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,038
I've changed.

446
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:51,667
Get out before the Valkyries find you.
If you orbed here, they've been alerted.

447
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,378
Valkyries? Who are they,
and what do they want with you?

448
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:56,547
But you can't orb out from here,
it's protected.

449
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:59,550
You need to get out of here.
Now go! Run!

450
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,884
We'll be back.

451
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:14,523
I told you, I don't belong here.

452
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:26,285
You could have been killed, you know
that? What were you thinking?

453
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:30,372
We were thinking of finding Leo, which
we actually did, if that matters to you.

454
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,875
What was up with that skirt
he was wearing?

455
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,335
At least the skirt wasn't plaid.

456
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,298
I don't believe this. It's like neither of
you guys are taking this very seriously.

457
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:44,845
- Hey, do you mind?
- I can't help it if he doesn't like you.

458
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:46,430
You were supposed
to take him home.

459
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,599
I tried, but the owners weren't there.

460
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:51,476
Besides, the dog,
he's not my job, he's yours.

461
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,103
I know, don't remind me.

462
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,772
Hey, Oscar, lay down.

463
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:02,488
Look, Paige, I think he likes you.

464
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:03,822
Yeah, great.

465
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,782
Don't tell me you can read
his feelings too.

466
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:09,411
No, but if I start
licking your toes, run.

467
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:10,621
Where's Piper?

468
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:13,207
I put her in her room, hoping
that it might jog her memory,

469
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,083
since nobody else
seems to be trying to.

470
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:17,294
Here it is.

471
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:20,047
"Valkyries, a powerful race
of demigoddesses

472
00:31:20,214 --> 00:31:22,424
who scout the battlegrounds
for dying warriors..."

473
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:24,092
"...then take their souls to Valhalla,

474
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,845
where they prepare them
for the final world battle."

475
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,514
Valkyries, huh?

476
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:30,766
Does that mean they're good?

477
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,769
How can they be good
if they've got Leo?

478
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:37,147
And how did they even get Leo?
He's not a dying warrior, he's an Elder.

479
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:39,733
Why don't you guys
concentrate on helping Piper.

480
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,361
I'm gonna fill in the Elders
and see what they want to do.

481
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:45,155
Chris, we don't have time.
We have to go back for Leo now.

482
00:31:45,364 --> 00:31:47,115
Why? Doesn't sound
like he's in trouble.

483
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,326
He's only stuck in a cage.

484
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:51,203
They tried to kill us.

485
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,622
My point exactly. Too dangerous.
You're not going back.

486
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:55,791
Wait, let me get this straight.

487
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,377
Are you telling me that you'd
rather just let Leo rot there,

488
00:31:58,544 --> 00:31:59,670
is that what you're saying?

489
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,755
- No, but...
- He needs our help.

490
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:04,716
Not to mention he may be
the only way we have to save Piper.

491
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:09,179
You can't orb into Valhalla
undetected.

492
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:11,974
The only way to get there safely
is with a Valkyrie's pendant.

493
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,896
But that still won't get you close to Leo.
He's too well-guarded now.

494
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:19,147
How do you know all this?

495
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,483
I've crossed paths
with Valkyries before...

496
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,402
...in the future.

497
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,613
Anyway, I can get you pendants,
but the only way to get close to Leo

498
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,782
is by proving to the Valkyries
you're one of them.

499
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,492
How are we supposed to do that?

500
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:33,370
Easy, just arrive
with a warrior's soul.

501
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,747
Oh, easy.

502
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:38,208
Where are we supposed to find
a warrior's soul?

503
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:40,752
Beats me.

504
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:53,932
It's all right,
you don't have to be afraid.

505
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:55,475
You're a brave warrior.

506
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:56,977
I'll take care of you.

507
00:32:57,394 --> 00:33:00,189
I don't think so, Leysa. Not this time.

508
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:01,523
What are you doing here?

509
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:03,609
My plans have changed,
unfortunately.

510
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,944
The witches found Leo
sooner than I would have liked.

511
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:09,531
That's not my problem.
We kept our end of the deal.

512
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,325
I know.

513
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:13,452
And I'm forever grateful.

514
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,621
But I can't risk them
finding out what I'm up to.

515
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,999
I'm truly sorry.

516
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,269
Forgive me.

517
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:03,460
Officer down, 8th Avenue sewer.
We need an ambulance.

518
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,463
Attention all units in the vicinity
of the 8th Avenue sewer.

519
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,508
We have an officer down.
I repeat, we have an officer down.

520
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:16,807
- You ain't got nothing on me.
- Shut up.

521
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,601
Get in there.

522
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,440
- Wait here.
- Yeah, like I'm going anywhere.

523
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:28,944
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing here?

524
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:30,154
Darryl, we need your help.

525
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,073
Does this have anything to do with
you asking Sheila to watch Wyatt?

526
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,576
- She just called.
- Yes, but we don't have a lot of time.

527
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,077
- It's about Leo.
- You found him?

528
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,746
- Actually, we did.
- We need your help to save him.

529
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:41,999
Sure, you know that.
Just ask. Anything.

530
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:45,335
Great. We just need to borrow
your soul for a couple of hours.

531
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:46,587
We'll get it right back.

532
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:49,423
It's perfectly safe really.
Your body will just slip into a coma

533
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,508
and as long
as we get your soul back in time...

534
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:53,802
- Which we will.
...you'll be fine.

535
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:56,138
Just a little headache, that's all.

536
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:57,973
What do you say?

537
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:02,186
You're serious, aren't you?

538
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:05,022
Please, Darryl, it's the only way
we can save Leo.

539
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,983
No. I ain't doing it.

540
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:09,526
Darryl, please.

541
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:11,195
No, absolutely not.

542
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:13,155
I love Leo like a brother,

543
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:16,033
but you know, there is a limit
to what you can ask a man to do.

544
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,743
And this is definitely over the limit.

545
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:21,079
- Darryl?
- What?

546
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:29,379
That's just great.

547
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,387
I hope this works.

548
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:45,395
Just remember everything I told you
and you'll be fine, okay?

549
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:59,952
Okay we got the... Oh, my God,
what did you do to Piper?

550
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,913
I turned her into a Valkyrie.
And convinced her she's one too.

551
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,750
Actually it wasn't that hard really,
considering the fact

552
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:09,419
- that her mind is basically a blank.
- Why?

553
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:12,089
You might need the power of three
to get Leo out of Valhalla.

554
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:15,384
And this is the only way
you're gonna get her into Valhalla.

555
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:18,136
Well, if Piper ever gets
her memory back, she's gonna kill you.

556
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,013
- Why?
- Because she hates wearing

557
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,849
those costumes as much as we do.

558
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:27,104
Yeah? Well, in that case,
you're gonna kill me too.

559
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:02,806
Can I help you?

560
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,308
We've brought you a warrior.

561
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,687
- Warrior?
- Is there a problem?

562
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,613
How come I don't recognize you?

563
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,160
Perhaps you'll recognize this.

564
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:31,460
A warrior's spirit, worthy of Valhalla.

565
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:38,133
Well done.

566
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:11,250
Not a bad afterlife if you ask me.

567
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:15,712
You're doing great, honey.

568
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:35,148
Okay, I know how
we're gonna save Leo,

569
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:36,775
but how are we gonna save Morris?

570
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:38,986
I have no idea.
That's why they call it winging it.

571
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:41,029
- What are you two talking about?
- Nothing.

572
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,210
What are you waiting for? Attack!

573
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,928
Leo?

574
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,849
What are we gonna do?

575
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:10,142
It's Piper.

576
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:12,019
Her pain is back. Do something.

577
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:15,272
Kill him!

578
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,450
- Take the fall!
- What fall?

579
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,454
Stay down.

580
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:39,171
What is he doing here?

581
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:41,089
What are we doing here?

582
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:42,466
Piper.

583
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:45,928
Do something.

584
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:52,059
We just wanted to apologize
for sending you such a weak warrior.

585
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,436
We can get rid of him for you.

586
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:56,355
Get rid of him?

587
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:58,982
Yeah, you know, like,

588
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:04,571
send his spirit on
to the hereafter... or something.

589
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:08,534
Very well.

590
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:23,632
You left me, didn't you?

591
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:26,885
Potion, potion!

592
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:31,056
We gotta get out of here.

593
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:41,233
It's clear!

594
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:46,155
I'll open the portal.

595
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:49,366
Phoebe.

596
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,660
It's Piper.

597
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:54,663
Her heart is breaking.

598
00:40:55,164 --> 00:40:57,416
- Piper...
- Don't. Stay away from me.

599
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:59,751
I promise I will explain everything
when we get home,

600
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:01,253
but right now we need to go.

601
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:02,546
Home?

602
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:05,090
We don't have a home. You left us.

603
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:07,426
Leo, talk to her.

604
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,928
I didn't have a choice.

605
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:13,807
I became an Elder. It's not something
I wanted, it just happened.

606
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:15,893
Yeah, see, I know all of this.

607
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:17,561
Why didn't I remember it?

608
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:22,566
Because I used my powers
so you wouldn't have to.

609
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:27,946
Your anger almost destroyed a city,
then your pain almost destroyed you.

610
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:31,408
I wanted to help you, so you wouldn't
have to deal with it all at once.

611
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:33,911
So you took my feelings away?

612
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:35,579
No.

613
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:37,080
Never.

614
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:40,918
I was gonna reverse the spell slowly so
you could feel a little more every day,

615
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:45,130
but then somebody did this to me.
Somebody put me here so I couldn't.

616
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:49,593
I'm sorry.

617
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:54,431
Look, I don't want to rush you two,
but we have to go.

618
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,807
I have to second that.

619
00:42:08,821 --> 00:42:13,116
You bastard,
how dare you do this to me?

620
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:15,160
- To our son.
- Phoebe?

621
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:18,705
We had a life together,
a family, and you destroyed it.

622
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,165
You destroyed me.

623
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:24,461
You left me alone
to raise our son by myself!

624
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:26,255
How could you do this?

625
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:29,049
How could you do this?

626
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:31,301
How could you?

627
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:54,449
I don't feel Piper anymore.

628
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:57,369
We have to go.

629
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:03,792
Come on, Piper. We gotta go.

630
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:06,712
- Go? Go where?
- Home, hurry!

631
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:11,675
We gotta leave her. Come on!
