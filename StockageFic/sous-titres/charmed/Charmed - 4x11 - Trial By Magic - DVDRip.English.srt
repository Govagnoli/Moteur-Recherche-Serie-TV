1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,352
Okay, move it or lose it, people.
Coming through.

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,351
Hey, I was using that.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,954
Yeah, well, I'm late,
and I need caffeine, so sue me.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,192
Two weeks of jury duty,
and suddenly she's lawyer-y.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,675
You know, normally, I would have
a witty comeback for that,

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,432
but I am too tired.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,637
I'd be tired too if I had to decide
whether or not someone lived or died.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,518
What's your decision?

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,750
Paige, you know
I can't talk about the case.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,549
Besides, that's not why I can't sleep.

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,790
I can't sleep because
I miss Cole too much.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,269
If he doesn't come home soon,
I'm gonna turn into a vampire.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,919
Jokes like that in this house,

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,354
- not so funny.
- Not so funny.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,078
When do you think
he's gonna come back?

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,309
Who knows?

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,357
He said he needed
some time to find himself

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,750
and figure out who he was
without his demon side.

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,388
Does that mean he's off banging
on drums in the woods somewhere?

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,876
God, I hope not.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,312
- Oh, gotta go.
- Wait!

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,954
- Who's testifying today?
- Nobody, it's closing arguments.

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,634
- Already? That was fast.
- Oh, no, not you too.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,554
Oh, come on, Phoebe,
it's only natural to be curious.

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,073
- Forget it.
- Listen,

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,392
nobody keeps secrets better than us.
We are the mistresses of secrets.

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,710
- Well...?
- Well...

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,832
Let's just say it will be
my supreme pleasure to send

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,514
that murdering bastard
straight to hell,

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,433
by legal means, not magical.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,434
You might actually be
the first person

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,591
who enjoys jury duty.

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,079
You know what it is?

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,834
It's just-- It might actually be nice
for a change

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,798
to get some kudos
for vanquishing the bad guy.

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,760
I mean punishing.
You know what I mean.

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,629
Okay.

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,869
- Hey.
- Hi.

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,031
- Is Paige home?
- Yeah, she is, but I'm not.

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,349
Bye.

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,512
- Hey.
- Glen, it's so good to see you.

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,272
What are you doing here?

43
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,955
I'm done with Australia, finally,
and I'm actually thinking about Nepal.

44
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,031
I just wanted to stop by
and see how you're doing.

45
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,198
It's so great to see you.

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,836
- Oh, that's my sister Piper.
- Of course, of course.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,989
Hi.

48
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,878
I still can't believe you got sisters.

49
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,110
Yeah, it takes some getting used to.

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,874
So where are you staying?

51
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,838
I don't know yet, actually.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,558
Good, you'll stay here.

53
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,711
- What?
- Yeah, first door up, top of the stairs.

54
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,748
- Are you sure that's all right?
- Yeah, don't be ridiculous.

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,951
I'll be right back.

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,078
Great. Thank you.

57
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,152
Paige.

58
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,355
What?

59
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,671
I don't think it's a good idea
for your boyfriend to stay here.

60
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,276
He's not my boyfriend.

61
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,238
Sometimes he's my boyfriend, but
mostly he's just my really good friend.

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,470
Well, we usually
don't have houseguests,

63
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,632
because of all the obvious reasons.

64
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,349
You can trust Glen. He's been
my friend since-- God, kindergarten.

65
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,397
You haven't been a witch
since kindergarten.

66
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,357
- I don't think you understand--
- I understand

67
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,351
that I also pay rent here.

68
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,714
There is no rent.

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,389
- It's an expression.
- No, it's not.

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,074
Well, it should be.

71
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,871
There is no excuse,

72
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,110
Iadies and gentlemen of the jury.

73
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,595
The defendant has no alibi,

74
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,716
no credible explanation

75
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,440
for how he was able
to lead the police

76
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,034
directly to his ex-wife's body.

77
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,794
Other than his--
How did he describe it?

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,230
Psychic vision.

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,435
No.

80
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,477
Premonition.

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,073
That's it.

82
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,674
That was his alibi.

83
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,395
That's what Mr. Provozoli
expects you to believe.

84
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,632
To counter the overwhelming evidence
against him, including,

85
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,470
with the court's permission,

86
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,194
people's 1 7, the murder weapon.

87
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,754
One that he has admitted
to using in his own magic show.

88
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,156
And then he used it to rob
Angela Provozoli

89
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,998
of her life.

90
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,596
Return the verdict
you know you must.

91
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,875
Murder

92
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,075
in the first degree.

93
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,239
Are you all right, ma'am?

94
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,839
Ma'am, are you all right?

95
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,751
This shouldn't take long.

96
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,189
Should be pretty quick.

97
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,432
Oh, man.

98
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,113
It's hot.

99
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,519
You gonna sit there?

100
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,629
Hey.

101
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,552
Hey, I just got a premonition.

102
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,790
We'll be out of here
in time for lunch.

103
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,759
Okay, well, I think
that the proper procedure

104
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,514
is that first we review the evidence.

105
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,274
We heard the evidence, so let's
take a vote and get out of here.

106
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,796
- Still, as the foreman, it's my job--
- All those in favour of guilty.

107
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,475
One, two, three, four, five,

108
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,676
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 1 1...

109
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,599
Come on, lady, what's it gonna be?

110
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,998
I have to go to the bathroom.

111
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,396
Leo. Leo.

112
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,318
- Phoebe, what?
- Quick. Orb me to the manor.

113
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,230
I thought you said it was
an open and shut case.

114
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,709
So did l. But the killer,
in my premonition,

115
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,950
was definitely not Stan Provozoli.

116
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,918
Okay, now, I didn't see his face,
but he had this tattoo on his arm,

117
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,433
Iike a Medusa's head with snakes.

118
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,150
- What are you gonna do?
- Well, I'm gonna stall

119
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,039
while you guys try to get Darryl
to get you in to see Stan.

120
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,000
Describe the tattoo,
maybe he knows the real killer.

121
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,273
I don't know. He must not have seen
him in his premonition, otherwise--

122
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,429
He had a premonition?

123
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,830
That's how he claims
to have known where the body was.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,116
And you of all people
did not believe him.

125
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,750
Piper, he's just a club magician.

126
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,273
I assumed that he was a fraud.

127
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,874
Believe me, I feel horrible about this.

128
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,548
All right, we'll fix it somehow.

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,230
Do we hunt killers
that aren't demons?

130
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,589
Well, I had that
premonition for a reason.

131
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,557
Just because the killer
isn't supernatural--

132
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,709
Hey there, Glen.

133
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,033
- What did you hear?
- Excuse me?

134
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,034
- She said, "What are you doing here?"
- I was just looking for the kitchen.

135
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,398
Didn't you--?
Didn't you leave already?

136
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,471
Yeah, yeah, but now I'm back.

137
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,756
But I better get going again
before somebody wonders

138
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,114
what happened to me.

139
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,191
I'll just take Glen to the kitchen

140
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,316
and show him
where to make a sandwich.

141
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,314
Is he staying here?

142
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,358
I think you need to talk to her.

143
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,195
I did, and apparently
I was the only one paying attention.

144
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,236
What the hell's going on in there?

145
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,912
Come on, open the damn door!

146
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,150
Maybe something's wrong.
I'll call for the bailiff.

147
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,630
I am so sorry.

148
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,358
It's that time of the month.

149
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,795
Look,

150
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,509
the rest of us finished voting,
1 1 guilty. What's it gonna be?

151
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,472
Well...

152
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,238
Before I cast my vote,

153
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,551
I think that we should
all consider the possibility

154
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,234
that the defendant might
actually be a psychic.

155
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,352
What?

156
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,796
And all he is guilty of
is having a special gift.

157
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,076
You're the foreman. Make her vote.

158
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,032
- Yeah.
- Not until I review the evidence.

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,798
Every single piece.

160
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,835
- Thank you.
- Sure.

161
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,871
So I have to go to work,
but if you want,

162
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,996
you can drop me off
and then use my car.

163
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,311
Oh, no, I'm wiped.
I'm just gonna hang here if it's cool.

164
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,073
Paige, is everything okay?
What was going on in there?

165
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,629
Oh, that? That's just
a family meeting,

166
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,796
deciding who's gonna
take out the trash

167
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,912
or whose turn it is to clean
the bathroom.

168
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,957
We take it all very seriously here.

169
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,355
I heard words like "killer"

170
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,714
and "supernatural."

171
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,110
That doesn't really sound
like housework to me.

172
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,953
We never really could lie
to each other very well.

173
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,078
Well, maybe that's why
we didn't make it as a couple.

174
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,191
I've been worried about you,

175
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,954
since the last time I saw you,
just before you moved in here.

176
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,236
And the vibe that I've been getting
since I got here

177
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,594
doesn't make me worry any less.

178
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,918
Everything is fine, Glen, just fine.

179
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,354
Things are just...

180
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,153
...different now.

181
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,433
Yeah, you have sisters to talk to,
and I think that's great, I really do.

182
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,478
But that doesn't mean that we still
can't be there for each other, does it?

183
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,310
Talk to me, Paige. What's--?
What's going on?

184
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,678
Paige?

185
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,596
Darryl got us that thing

186
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,075
with the guy that Phoebe
was talking about.

187
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,675
Are you coming?

188
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,717
Yeah, I can't. I have to go to work.

189
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,517
All right, well, keep
your cell phone available,

190
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,636
just in case anything comes up.

191
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,672
I'll see you later.

192
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,236
Excuse me.

193
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,513
Paige, you're gonna leave him
here alone?

194
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,433
Well, he can't fit
in my cubicle with me at work.

195
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,837
Paige, keeping your secret
has to be the most important thing.

196
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,468
I know, which is why
I just lied to my best friend.

197
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,198
It didn't feel good, Leo, but I did it.

198
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,238
That's not good enough.
It's irresponsible to leave him here.

199
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,550
You told me when I became a witch
I'd still have a life.

200
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,632
- I call having a friend having a life.
- But that doesn't mean you can--

201
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,199
Paige, Paige--

202
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,238
- I'm interrupting again.
- Yeah.

203
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,558
All right, we gotta go,

204
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,315
so be sure to lock up
all the doors before you go.

205
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,637
She always that friendly?

206
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,119
Yeah, pretty much.

207
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,911
I'll see you later.

208
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,590
I still don't understand exactly
who you people are.

209
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,716
Did lnspector Morris vouch for us?

210
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,074
Yes, but that doesn't really--

211
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,748
All you need to know is that
we may be able to save your client.

212
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,989
Isn't that enough?

213
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,559
Look, the jury's deliberating.

214
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,790
Nothing short of a miracle
can help him now.

215
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,029
Precisely.

216
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,153
Don't tell me they reached a verdict?

217
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,151
No, they haven't.

218
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,878
These people wanted to talk to you.

219
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,829
Who are you?

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,592
We're people who believe
you're innocent.

221
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,194
So if you don't mind, we'd like
to ask you a few questions.

222
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,839
Was there anything
in your premonition

223
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,752
to indicate who the killer might be?

224
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,358
- Yeah, all right, that's it. Out.
- What? Why?

225
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,590
Because we're not hanging
any more of this case

226
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,558
on that so-called vision of his,
unless you want him to plead insanity.

227
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,199
No, wait, wait!

228
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,431
You actually believe me

229
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,999
about having had a premonition?

230
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,035
Yes, we do.

231
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,269
That's why we need to know
exactly what you saw,

232
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,078
if we have any chance
of saving you.

233
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,470
I don't need a premonition
to know who killed Angie.

234
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,471
It was Wyke, Andrew Wyke.

235
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,278
He owns the magic club
where I performed.

236
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,794
Why do you think he killed her?

237
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,918
Angie kept the books for the club,
even after we got divorced.

238
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,071
She found out that Wyke was using
the club to launder dirty money.

239
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,198
And when he found out
that she told me about it,

240
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,549
well, he killed her with

241
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,950
one of my knives to frame me.

242
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,752
Then I go and help him by telling
the police where Angie's body was.

243
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,038
Do you know if Wyke has a tattoo
of a Medusa head on his arm?

244
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,595
I don't know.

245
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,631
Well, let's hope he does. Thank you.

246
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,028
Look out, Nancy Drew,
coming through.

247
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,474
Maybe we should come back
at night when they're open.

248
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,355
I don't think we have that kind of time.
How does this place stay in business?

249
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,520
Demons you can handle,
but not rats?

250
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,759
Hey, what are you doing in here?

251
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,195
- Who the hell are you?
- We're friends of Stan Provozoli's.

252
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,313
Good for you. We're closed.

253
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,914
Yeah, I see that. I was just hoping--

254
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,038
I said we're closed, and I don't want
to have to say it again. Leave.

255
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,031
All I am saying is to reach
a fair and just verdict,

256
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,839
we have to analyze
every aspect of this case.

257
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,991
- We've done that.
- Twice.

258
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,674
You know what? Maybe we
should do it a third time.

259
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,434
Because it seems to me that you
people care more about getting home

260
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,431
for dinner than about the fact
that the evidence

261
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,273
against Stan Provozoli
is entirely circumstantial.

262
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,793
He led the police to the body!

263
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,595
You heard the shrink say
that's as good as a confession.

264
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,189
- Unless it was a premonition.
- She's back to that again.

265
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,154
Is it so hard for you
to believe that that's possible?

266
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,914
That there are powers
beyond what we can see?

267
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,918
Okay.

268
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,352
Haven't any of you ever known
who's calling before

269
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,714
you answer the phone?

270
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,915
That's not magic.

271
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,037
Oh, no? Then what is it?

272
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,960
Look, just because
you don't understand magic

273
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,872
doesn't mean that you have
to be afraid of it.

274
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,756
It's around us all the time.

275
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,310
Like a friend, guiding us,
giving us inspiration,

276
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,351
helping us fall in love.

277
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,596
Giving our lives meaning.

278
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,277
And I'm sorry, but l...

279
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,591
...think that we all need
to believe that magic exists.

280
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,639
Tanya,

281
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,799
why are you wearing an angel pin?

282
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,675
I don't know. Just because
my mother gave it to me.

283
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,678
But why did she give it to you?

284
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,560
- To watch over me.
- That's magic.

285
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,758
Something that you can't see.

286
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,033
You can't quite put your finger on it,

287
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,952
but you know that it's there.

288
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,192
The man killed a woman!
Period! End of story!

289
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,153
- All those in favour of another vote...
- Here.

290
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,435
- Aye.
- Aye

291
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,073
- Nature calls.
- Oh, no.

292
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,279
- No, you don't. No, no, no.
- I can't believe this.

293
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,879
No way.

294
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,549
She's stalling.

295
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,199
We gotta do something about this.

296
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,759
- Hi.
- Hi.

297
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,797
- We found the killer.
- The owner of the club,

298
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,831
- a guy named Andrew Wyke.
- Can you prove it?

299
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,433
That's the next step.

300
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,909
Okay, well, you gotta hurry
because I'm dying in there.

301
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,308
Be easier if we vanquish him.

302
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,516
You can't, but you might be able
to use your magic.

303
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,114
Well, there is one guy
I'd love to turn into a wart hog.

304
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,396
Not on the jury. On the killer.

305
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,836
You and Paige could use your powers
to scare him into confessing.

306
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,275
And show our powers to Wyke?
I do not think so.

307
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,158
You think anybody's gonna
believe him?

308
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,913
Not this jury.

309
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,873
Hey, come on!

310
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,359
Sorry!

311
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,872
Can somebody find me a plunger?

312
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,473
Oh, great.

313
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,238
What? Gotta buy
some time somehow.

314
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,913
And you gotta call Paige.

315
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,197
Maybe there's a spell
in the Book of Shadows we can use?

316
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,517
Okay, go, go, go.

317
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,591
Okay.

318
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,512
Piper, you up here?

319
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,796
What's the emergency?

320
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,714
Oh, my God, Glen,
what are you doing up here?

321
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,632
It's funny. See, after you left,

322
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,711
I was still hungry,
so I opened the fridge.

323
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,429
I found some bags labelled
"pig's feet,"

324
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,557
"rabbit blood,"

325
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,073
"frog tongue."

326
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,436
So I decided to take
a little look around.

327
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,750
I found more than
what I bargained for.

328
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,914
Look, I can explain everything,
okay? I really can.

329
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,230
I'll just have to explain it
later because if Piper

330
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,709
- finds us up here she's gonna freak.
- Piper's gonna freak?

331
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,518
I just found out that your new sisters

332
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,796
have been messing with the occult
in a serious way.

333
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,520
And you're worried about
how they're gonna freak?

334
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,878
Look, we're not "messing around"
with the occult.

335
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,349
We're witches.

336
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,433
My sisters and I are
born good witches.

337
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,999
We do good magic.

338
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,838
This book is full of pictures
of demons and warlocks.

339
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,150
Well, demons and warlocks
that we fight and destroy.

340
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,477
These girls have you brainwashed.

341
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,392
How do you even know
they are your sisters?

342
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,755
Glen, you gotta trust me, please.

343
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,757
I am not brainwashed.

344
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,912
I am still the same old Paige,
only now

345
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,196
if I make a rhyme, magic happens.

346
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,908
Paige.

347
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,036
Look, you've been to Africa.
You've met those

348
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,872
witch doctors on your travels, right?

349
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,880
Yeah, but these guys
were like 1 00 years old,

350
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,032
and they speak in tongues.
And you're you.

351
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,999
- There is a spell in here...
- What?

352
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,993
...to stretch the imagination.

353
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,270
It should be able to help you

354
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,914
understand and accept
the truth about me.

355
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,833
So you're gonna cast a spell on me?

356
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,634
- With your permission.
- And when nothing happens--

357
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,109
When nothing happens,
you can drag me out to the funny farm,

358
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,352
tell them I've been brainwashed.
Believe me, I could use the vacation.

359
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,669
Oh, here it is.

360
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,512
Let mind and body soar
To heights not reached before

361
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,151
Let limits stretch, that you may catch
A new truth to explore

362
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,714
I don't feel any different.

363
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,271
That's weird. It always works.

364
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,432
- Paige, where are you?
- God, we gotta hide you. Come on.

365
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,237
No, wait--

366
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,068
It's the spell. Just pull it back.

367
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,710
Oh, I was giving Glen
a tour of the house.

368
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,313
Next stop, the basement.

369
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,313
Come on, Glen.
Why don't you get a head start.

370
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,039
A tour? Of the attic?

371
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,994
- You showed him the Book?
- Well, he went into the fridge,

372
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,515
and he saw the potion ingredients.
So understandably,

373
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,716
he started looking around
and he found the Book.

374
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,757
So you didn't lock the attic?

375
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,677
- It didn't occur to me.
- What do you mean?

376
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,831
I told you to lock all
the doors before you go.

377
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,513
I thought you meant the front door.

378
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,033
You should have been
more specific.

379
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,519
Well, I was speaking in code.

380
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,996
Listen, I trust Glen.

381
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,948
But you're trusting him with a secret
that is all of ours, not just yours.

382
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,749
Honey, she didn't tell him about it.
He discovered it.

383
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,313
Because she left him in the house,

384
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,391
because she let him stay
here in the first place.

385
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,834
So you're saying I have to choose

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,718
between having friends
and being a witch?

387
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,916
- Yes, I have.
- Well, I won't.

388
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,709
Okay,

389
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,269
we all need to put this on hold
for a second, okay?

390
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,674
Let's take a deep breath,

391
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,877
Iet's calm down. We have a lot of work
to do and not a lot of time to do it.

392
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,431
- What do we have to do?
- Piper will fill you in on the way.

393
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,591
I need to go check on Phoebe.

394
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,597
So actually, the origin of magic
dates back to prehistoric times.

395
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,917
- People from all cultures believed in--
- Let's vote,

396
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,559
- now.
- Wait.

397
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,029
No, no, we vote.
Okay? If we can't agree,

398
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,519
we declare a hung jury.

399
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,513
All in favour of a guilty verdict...

400
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,593
People, please!
There is magic in the world.

401
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,390
There are angels. Tanya, you could
tell your mother that she's right.

402
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,232
They're real. And there are fairies.

403
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,149
They're real too. I mean,
just think back to your childhood

404
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,072
before you were too jaded
to believe in them.

405
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,715
And Cupid, not a myth.

406
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,952
I mean, he doesn't actually use
arrows, but he's real too.

407
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,512
- Sit down.
- Please.

408
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,273
Bailiff!

409
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,838
- What are you doing?
- We don't have

410
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,433
to declare a hung jury after all.

411
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,272
We don't?

412
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,355
Foreman?

413
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,398
Tell the judge that we have
a juror who's...

414
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,917
...not quite right.
We're asking that she be dismissed

415
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,798
and that you bring in
one of the alternates.

416
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,552
Are you kidding me?

417
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,396
- And you all agree?
- Yes.

418
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,952
- Okay.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

419
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,158
I have an idea.

420
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,232
If I can convince you,

421
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,428
all of you,

422
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,990
that magic really does exist,

423
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,875
will that be enough
reasonable doubt for an acquittal?

424
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,671
Lady, you're late for your shrink.

425
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,394
Like two years late.

426
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,199
Well, what do you mean, "magic"?

427
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,277
Like Siegfried and Roy stuff?

428
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,590
No. I mean real magic.

429
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,997
No trap doors,
no smoke, no mirrors,

430
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,754
just real, supernatural magic.

431
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,038
Come on, she's stalling.

432
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,589
What's the matter?

433
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,236
Are you afraid I might actually
be able to pull it off?

434
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,157
Well, we've been here this long.
I say we let her take it on home.

435
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,839
All right.

436
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,673
But if you fail,

437
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,319
you vote guilty with the rest of us.

438
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,073
Good point.

439
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,314
- Call the judge.
- Okay, okay, okay.

440
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,789
It's a deal.

441
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,599
All right.

442
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,555
Show us some magic.

443
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,988
I'm gonna need a few things.

444
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,196
- A sage stick, five white candles and--
- A magic wand.

445
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,871
No, incense.

446
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,873
I'm gonna summon the dead.

447
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,434
Okay, just remember,

448
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,431
you play good witch,
I play bad witch.

449
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,435
Okay, but won't that risk
exposing our powers?

450
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,990
No, I'm only gonna show
my powers to Wyke,

451
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,754
and once we get him to talk,
we'll use the tape to force him

452
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,353
to confess to the police.

453
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,159
So it's okay to show our powers
to a murderer but not to Glen?

454
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,714
Saving an innocent's life
is worth the risk.

455
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,472
Entertaining friends is not.

456
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,548
What the hell?

457
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,713
What are you?

458
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,510
- What do you want?
- We want a confession.

459
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,749
That's what we want.

460
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,994
Careful, you might kill him.

461
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,878
- So?
- I don't know

462
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,758
- what you're talking about.
- Sure, you do.

463
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,031
Angela Provozoli found out about

464
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,031
your little money
laundering operation,

465
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,633
so you killed her, didn't you?

466
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,549
I've never seen her like this, pal.
You might wanna talk.

467
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,951
You know what?
This is getting boring.

468
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,509
What do you say we move
on to some body parts?

469
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,511
Okay, okay, okay! All right.

470
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,113
All right, I admit it.

471
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,589
I killed her.

472
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,354
She was ready to march
the cops down to Pier 86.

473
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,670
If I hadn't killed her,
they would have.

474
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,832
And then they would have killed me!

475
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,794
Who, the cops?

476
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,428
No. No, not the cops.

477
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,635
They...

478
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,355
Look, believe me,

479
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,237
- you don't wanna know.
- Try me.

480
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,873
What the--?

481
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,233
He's pretty good.

482
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,469
Where'd he go?

483
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,548
There's gotta be a trap door.

484
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,239
Here.

485
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,673
- How does this thing work?
- There's gotta be stairs here.

486
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,589
Wait.

487
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,313
All right, don't.

488
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,715
I can explain.

489
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,679
You stupid human!

490
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,990
You told the witches everything.

491
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,153
- And they've got it on tape!
- So what?

492
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,718
- They'll never find out about you guys.
- Not from you, they won't.

493
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,629
No, no. No!

494
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,559
Dinnertime.

495
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,880
What, demons you can handle
but not rats?

496
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,512
Right back at you.

497
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,751
I don't get it. Where'd he go?

498
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,797
Is hell too much to hope for?

499
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,116
Yeah, well, at least
we got his taped confession.

500
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,997
Yeah, but that's not
gonna save Stan,

501
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,593
or Phoebe, for that matter.

502
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,637
Why don't we just give it
to the police?

503
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,597
Well, without Wyke,
the confession is no good.

504
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,274
I mean, Darryl could open up
an investigation

505
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,237
but not in time to exonerate--

506
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,156
Now I actually sound
like Nancy Drew.

507
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,958
So, what, we're supposed
to go find Wyke?

508
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,839
How are we gonna do that?
We have no idea where he is.

509
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,155
What?

510
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,232
- What?
- That noise.

511
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,469
Noise?

512
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,074
- I feel like I'm in Switzerland.
- Switzerland?

513
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,912
- There it is again.
- What?

514
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,117
That annoying echo.
Paige, what's going on?

515
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,591
Nothing. Nothing's going on, Piper.

516
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,795
Hey!

517
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,757
Piper, don't!

518
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,514
You!

519
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,838
You cast a spell on him?
Are you crazy?

520
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,237
No, but somebody is.

521
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,592
I was just trying
to have some fun. Sorry.

522
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,791
Okay, but this is not supposed
to be fun for you.

523
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,598
It's not supposed to be for you at all.

524
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,755
Well, then I guess
I better call off the tabloids.

525
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,709
- He was just making a bad joke.
- Yeah.

526
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,996
Funny how that's the first thing
that came to his mind.

527
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,799
He just thought he was being funny.
Nobody got hurt.

528
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,598
Yeah, maybe you'd feel
a little differently

529
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,954
if you had lost a sister.

530
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,154
Don't ask.

531
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,277
Did you get Wyke to confess?

532
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,512
Yeah, and then he got away.
How's Phoebe doing?

533
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,796
Not so good. She's trying
to summon the victim, Angela.

534
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,949
Wait a second.

535
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,111
So it's not okay for me
to tell my best friend Glen

536
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,272
that I'm a witch, but it's okay for Phoebe
to tell an entire room of strangers?

537
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,078
They were gonna
kick her off the jury.

538
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,959
I think it was worth a try.
Only it's not going so good.

539
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,712
I believe she needs
the power of three.

540
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,279
Yeah, well, she's not gonna get it.

541
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,032
Better for them
to think she's a nut job

542
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,235
than think she's a witch.

543
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,197
There's an innocent man
at stake, Piper.

544
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,316
They'll convict him,
then we'll go to the police.

545
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,630
There'll be a new trial,
and they'll release him.

546
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,119
You don't know that.

547
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,874
All right, I have an idea.

548
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,031
- What?
- I'll explain on the way. Let's go.

549
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,189
What about him?

550
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,159
Yeah, just unfreeze him.

551
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,514
He won't tell anyone.

552
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,755
What--?

553
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,479
Where'd you come from?

554
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,918
Just stay here, order a pizza.
I'll be back soon.

555
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,669
What?

556
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,875
What--?

557
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,519
Where did they go?

558
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,799
Beloved spirit Angela
I seek your guidance

559
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,271
I ask that you commune with me
And move among us

560
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,317
- Beloved spirit Angela--
- That's enough. Bailiff!

561
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,751
Tell the judge
that we've reached a verdict.

562
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,070
Yeah, a deal's a deal.

563
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,231
- All those in favour of guilty?
- Aye.

564
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,992
- Aye.
- I'll get the lights.

565
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,751
Beloved spirit Angela
I seek your guidance

566
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,434
I ask that you commune with me
And move among us

567
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,194
- Phoebe, 1 1 jurors?
- I know.

568
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,918
I know, but this guy is innocent.

569
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,469
And he's being persecuted
for having the same gift that I do.

570
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,870
So if you guys aren't here
to help me summon Angela--

571
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,314
We are.

572
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,833
- We are?
- Yes.

573
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,275
If Leo will help us clean it up
after we're done.

574
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,754
No.

575
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,116
What do you mean, "no"?
You've done it before.

576
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,596
No, it is completely forbidden,
except in cases of dire emergency.

577
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,954
What's forbidden?

578
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,076
Using memory dust on people.

579
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,880
Oh, my God. This is brilliant.

580
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,477
We'll erase their short-term
memories after they vote not guilty.

581
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,359
Wait a second. Whitelighters
can erase people's memories

582
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,748
with some sort of special dust?

583
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,433
Why don't you just use it all the time?

584
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,716
Because you don't know
what you might be erasing.

585
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,189
Doctors' appointments,
children's birthdays...

586
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,715
Leo, this is an emergency.

587
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,070
I cannot live with these people
knowing our secret,

588
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,196
knowing that at any minute
we could have to relive

589
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,952
the hell we went through with Prue.

590
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,034
Okay.

591
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,438
Hear these words, hear our cry
Spirit from the other side

592
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,593
Come to us, we summon thee
Cross now, the great divide

593
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,638
Beloved spirit Angela
We seek your guidance

594
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,110
We ask that you commune with us
And move amongst us

595
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,072
Cold wind, that's our cue.

596
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,994
- See you later.
- Okay, thank you, thank you.

597
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,994
Are you all seeing that?

598
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,355
Dear God.

599
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,155
What happened?

600
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,673
Where am l?

601
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,671
We summoned you, Angela.

602
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,269
We need your help.

603
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,351
Actually your ex-husband
needs your help.

604
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,471
Stan? Why?

605
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,198
He's on trial for your murder.

606
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,509
Stan?

607
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,399
Are you kidding?
He couldn't hurt a fly.

608
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,071
- Even his gift terrified him.
- His gift?

609
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,594
What are you doing?

610
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,193
I'm looking for wires.

611
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,159
This is some kind of trick.

612
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,309
Did you find any?

613
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,549
What about his gift?

614
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,312
Stan could see things.

615
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,996
The past, the future. It scared him.

616
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,833
He hated it.
That's why he never nurtured it.

617
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,190
All the good he could have done,

618
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,349
wasted.

619
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,233
So he didn't kill you?

620
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,753
No.

621
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,918
The club owner did.
Andrew Wyke.

622
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,395
I found out he was laundering money
from some company at Pier 86.

623
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,120
Stan warned me to keep it to myself.

624
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,754
But I didn't.

625
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,357
He is a good man.

626
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,872
He is an innocent man.

627
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,914
Blessed be.

628
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,834
Shall we vote?

629
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,155
Not guilty.

630
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,191
Unbelievable.

631
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,559
So say you one?

632
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,472
So say you all?

633
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,199
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Yes, Your Honour.

634
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,952
This case is dismissed.

635
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,115
The defendant is hereby released,
and this court is adjourned.

636
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,074
Dust them, Leo.

637
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,036
Don't forget the bailiff.

638
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,593
I don't understand.

639
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,752
- How'd you do it?
- We didn't. Angela did.

640
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,312
- Hi.
- Hi.

641
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,958
You have a very special gift.

642
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,314
And you did the right thing
by going to the police.

643
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,512
It doesn't matter
what anybody else thinks.

644
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,992
All that matters is that
you use your gift to help people.

645
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,633
That's a beautiful thing.

646
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,680
So you guys have told people
about being witches lots of times?

647
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,515
Yes, innocents, but only when
we didn't have any other choice.

648
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,478
Our secret is never more important
than saving somebody's life.

649
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,916
Can't you guys just enjoy saving
this innocent for a minute and a half

650
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,593
before getting back
to the great debate?

651
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,877
Well, it's not over yet.
The killer is still out there somewhere.

652
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,193
Oh, Glen!

653
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,633
You have one hour
to deliver the tape,

654
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,396
or Stretch here is dead.

655
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,669
Paige, it's gonna be okay.
Just try to breathe.

656
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,558
Oh, my God.
If anything happens to him--

657
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,948
We won't let it.

658
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,838
When did this demon
become involved?

659
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,797
I thought this killer
was supposed to be human?

660
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,520
He was. But apparently,
he was fronting for demons.

661
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,990
Since when do demons
give a rat's ass, no pun intended,

662
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,149
about laundering money?

663
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,959
Because they need money
to insinuate themselves into our world.

664
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,839
To buy clothes, rent apartments,
to fit in with us.

665
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,156
That's probably the same way
they made Cole

666
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,753
Iegitimate when he was a demon.

667
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,433
I mean, they put him
through law school.

668
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,875
Which put him
in a position to hurt us.

669
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,039
Water under the bridge.

670
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,077
How is any of this gonna help us
get Glen back?

671
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,118
Even if we give
that rat-demon thing the tape,

672
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,716
what's to stop him from killing Glen?
We have no leverage.

673
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,348
Okay. Do we have to call him
the rat-demon?

674
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,159
Because it's very hard
to be appropriately frightened.

675
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,874
We could go over his head.

676
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,599
Look, I guarantee you that this club
is just the tip of the iceberg.

677
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,479
If we went to rat-demon's--
But what are we supposed to call him?

678
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,278
One hour, Leo, we have one hour.

679
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,078
Right. Look, so if we go
to their bosses

680
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,435
and we threaten to expose
their entire operation,

681
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,318
they're not gonna be
very pleased with him.

682
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,318
So we offer him up in exchange
for Glen. Might work.

683
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,993
Might work? It has to work.

684
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,670
Okay, so the only question is,
where is demon central?

685
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,156
Angela said something
about Pier 86.

686
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,829
So did Wyke. So we split up.

687
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,191
Phoebe, since you have
stalling down to a science,

688
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,191
you and Paige go to the club
and buy some time.

689
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,952
- Leo and I will go to--
- No.

690
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,633
- No, I'm gonna go.
- Well, Piper has more firepower.

691
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,758
- And if they get hostile--
- I'll just have Leo orb me out of there

692
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,955
if it gets too hairy.

693
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,236
I'm the one who put Glen,
my best friend,

694
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,799
in massive amounts of danger.

695
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,279
So I'm gonna get him out.

696
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,912
Just do me a favour and keep him
alive at the club until I get back.

697
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,436
I don't know if this is the right place.

698
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,388
Listen.

699
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,595
- Rats.
- Lots of them.

700
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,957
- Time to go.
- No.

701
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,317
- Paige, I really think that we should--
- No, Leo, they've got Glen.

702
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,829
Listen up!

703
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,558
We know what you're doing.

704
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,637
We're prepared to tell everyone.

705
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,756
And just so you know,
killing me won't help.

706
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,111
My sisters will take you down.

707
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,794
Maybe you've heard of us.

708
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,194
The Charmed Ones?

709
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,553
Now, who am I talking to?

710
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,713
We're listening.

711
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,669
- The tape.
- Where's our friend, mouse-man?

712
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,432
After I get the tape.

713
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,517
No, before.

714
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,752
- I could take it from you.
- You could try.

715
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,195
Just so you know,

716
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,990
if anything happens to me,
anything at all,

717
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,200
the ring will decapitate him.

718
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,395
That's new.

719
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,119
So much for a quick getaway.

720
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,914
Are there any copies?

721
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,956
- No.
- Now let him go.

722
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,115
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

723
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,309
I'm a rat. What'd you expect?

724
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,429
Don't. Don't. It might chop off
Glen's head.

725
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,589
What am I supposed to do?

726
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,318
Enjoy the show.

727
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,359
Did we just do that?

728
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,112
- Only copy?
- Yes.

729
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,395
How do we know?

730
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,834
What do you mean,
how do you know?

731
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,752
You just gotta trust us.
We're the good guys,

732
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,909
for crying out loud.

733
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,837
Guess we'll call this one a draw.

734
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,874
Almost done.

735
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,477
This is taking too long.
Can't you just use a little magic?

736
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,710
Well, don't you think
we've used enough magic lately?

737
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,110
Besides, I like working
with my hands.

738
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,675
Yeah, I kind of like a guy
in a tool belt.

739
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,239
Really?

740
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,959
Oh, leaving so soon?

741
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,149
Yeah, Glen's gonna go stay
with a friend of his across the Bay.

742
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,595
I can't imagine why you wouldn't
wanna hang around here.

743
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,794
Yeah, well, I like adventure.
Just not that much adventure.

744
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,712
So you're gonna stick
around a while?

745
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,269
Yeah. Keep an eye on Noogie here.

746
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,436
- Noogie?
- Glen, I think it's time for you to go.

747
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,719
Thanks for saving my life.

748
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,513
- I reversed the spell.
- Just checking.

749
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,353
- Bye.
- Bye.

750
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,428
Bye, you.

751
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,309
Okay, do you want it now?
Or should I e-mail it to you?

752
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,596
- What?
- My apology.

753
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,989
You were right.

754
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,549
Keeping our secret
is the most important thing.

755
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,358
I should have listened to you.

756
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,592
Do you want more?
Should I keep grovelling?

757
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,753
Fun as that would be...

758
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,719
I'm sorry too. I can be a little harsh,
but it's part of my charm.

759
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,233
You'll learn to love me for it.

760
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,598
We actually have a door.
Imagine that.

761
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,113
So how's the jury?

762
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,870
Fine. I knocked on Tanya's door,
and she thought I was the Avon lady.

763
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,793
So, good job, Leo.

764
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,554
Thanks, but I don't wanna
think about it, ever.

765
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,836
Can "ever" wait for a minute or so?

766
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,434
I was thinking maybe we should use
some of that dust on Glen.

767
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,150
You know, I don't want you guys
to have to be nervous.

768
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,469
Well, do you think
he's gonna tell anybody?

769
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,551
- No.
- And you trust him completely?

770
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,956
- Yes.
- Then so do we.

771
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,235
Thank God.

772
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,356
And whether we think
it's smart or not,

773
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,796
at least you have one person
outside the family that you can talk to.

774
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,791
Yeah, let's just keep it to one.
