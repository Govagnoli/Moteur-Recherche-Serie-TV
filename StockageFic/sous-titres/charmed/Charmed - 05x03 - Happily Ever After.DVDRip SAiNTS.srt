1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,963
"A year after the death
of Snow White's mother,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,423
the king remarried.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,843
But his new bride was in fact
a wicked witch,

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,055
- one consumed by jealousy..."
- What are you still doing up?

5
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,849
Not sleeping, as usual.

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,602
First trimester nonsense, I guess.

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,731
- You want me to mix you up a potion?
- Oh, no, thanks.

8
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,775
I don't want to turn my baby
into a guinea pig.

9
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,193
I got enough to worry about.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,363
Like I'd ever risk turning my future
niece into a rodent. Please.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,740
No, I was speaking figuratively.

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,951
And it is not a knock at your
super-witch kick.

13
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,078
It's just, I don't wanna subject her

14
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,081
to anything that could be
remotely bad for her, that's all.

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,834
Then maybe you should put away
those silly fairy tales.

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,378
Silly? You think fairy tales are silly?

17
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,255
Yeah, they're all about
helpless women

18
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,715
needing big, strong men
to come and rescue them.

19
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,885
Plus they're filled with evil witches.
You really wanna teach your kid that?

20
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,263
No, I wanna teach her values.

21
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,306
And that's what fairy tales are best at.

22
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,267
You know, good overcomes evil.

23
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,810
That's how Grams taught us.

24
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,937
Well, my grandmother taught me
values just fine

25
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,982
without big, bad wolves
devouring little girls.

26
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,569
- You want my advice?
- Not really.

27
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:14,199
You should ditch the fiction
and do what all other moms-to-be do,

28
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,743
and that is to rely
on your natural instincts.

29
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,581
Well, my natural instincts
are to panic.

30
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,458
And besides, every other
mother-to-be does not have to worry

31
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,837
about her child orbing out to Tahiti
when they are sent to their room.

32
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,046
I don't have a clue.

33
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,756
Luckily, you have
two magical sisters

34
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,425
who are gonna help you
any way they can.

35
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,845
So don't worry, honey,
you're gonna be just fine.

36
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,974
I hope so.

37
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,103
Where were we?

38
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,564
"A year after the death
of Snow White's mother,

39
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,399
the king remarried.

40
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,652
But his new bride was in fact
a wicked witch,

41
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,905
one consumed by jealousy.

42
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,742
Every day she asked
the magic mirror the same question."

43
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,620
Aren't you dead yet?

44
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,957
Still so bitter
after all these centuries?

45
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,918
Some things never change.

46
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,254
Careful, my boy.

47
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,968
Those are not just symbols.
They are pieces of history.

48
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,512
I understand.

49
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,390
Never forget,
the power of every fairy tale

50
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,269
emanates from each of these.

51
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:30,776
Their magic continues to shape
every child born, even to this day.

52
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:36,657
Which makes the task of preserving
and protecting them that much greater.

53
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,496
No, the mirror. Don't let it fall!

54
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,799
Thanks so much.

55
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,426
I thought I'd never get out of there.

56
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,057
Now, this is the way
to begin a story.

57
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,311
Who are you?

58
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,773
A little rusty
on your fairy tales, I see.

59
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,317
Evil witch, magic mirror?

60
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,070
Speaks only the truth?

61
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,573
Perhaps this will help:

62
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:23,954
Freedom's loss must be unwitting
Into the glass, to do my bidding

63
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,217
Now, amuse me.

64
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,679
Not that you have any choice.

65
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,598
Mirror, mirror on the wall,

66
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:47,477
who is the most powerful
witch of all?

67
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,857
You're much stronger
than most witches I see.

68
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,484
Yet, truth be told,

69
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:59,364
there are three
more powerful than thee.

70
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,876
We'll see about that.

71
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,311
Piper?

72
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,730
Where's the baby?

73
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,733
It's okay. You're okay.

74
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,735
I think I had a nightmare.

75
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,487
Yeah, the Brothers Grimm
strike again.

76
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,198
I wonder how they got their name.
Where's Leo?

77
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,910
I don't know. I think he's helping
one of his charges.

78
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,872
- What are you doing?
- Failing miserably.

79
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,250
I can't seem to make this
protection potion work.

80
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,419
Well, that's because it can't be done.

81
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,087
Well, according to the Book, it can.

82
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,839
Your Grams was working on an entry,

83
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,341
so that means she was close
to figuring one out.

84
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,428
Well, too bad she's not around.
She could help us both out.

85
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,722
I just... I need a little guidance.

86
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:50,893
What about your friend, Wendy?
She just had a baby, ask her.

87
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,730
Yeah, not one that could
heal herself from the womb.

88
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,442
I just wish I could talk to somebody
who's been through this before.

89
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,110
There you are.

90
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,321
Paige, did you ever
make that vanquishing potion?

91
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,948
- Vanquishing potion?
- The one for Cole.

92
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,451
Remember, I gave you
the letter opener with his blood on it?

93
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:08,744
Right, vanquishing potion.

94
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,580
I'm sorry, I didn't know you needed
that right away. Do you?

95
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, if the nightmare I had last night
turns out to be a premonition,

96
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,460
then yeah, bigtime.

97
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,670
He had me back in the underworld
as his queen.

98
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,964
Oh, yeah, but you've had
that nightmare before.

99
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,467
I've lived that nightmare before.
We all have.

100
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,094
But this time
we have to be prepared.

101
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,387
No arguments here.

102
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,014
And he's got a lot more powers now.

103
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,266
So there's no telling how
he's going to come after me.

104
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,227
You guys have to be
really careful, okay?

105
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,771
What, you think Cole's gonna
try and kill us?

106
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,398
That would not be exactly
the best way to win you back.

107
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,484
Yeah, but it wouldn't be
the first time he tried.

108
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,236
But he just helped us save her.

109
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,655
Only because he didn't wanna
lose me.

110
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:49,159
All I'm saying is we've gotta be ready
just in case he tries something.

111
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,619
He is still a demon.

112
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,832
Call me at work if you get
the potion, okay?

113
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,467
- Wanna see more?
- No.

114
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,595
I think I've seen enough
to know how to kill them.

115
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,515
Powerful though you are,
I doubt it can be done,

116
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,559
for good magic protects
the Charmed Ones.

117
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:16,687
Still, I wonder if it can
protect them against

118
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,606
such powerful magic
as we have here.

119
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,149
Certainly worth a try.

120
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,610
But using the props for evil could...

121
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,821
Change the meaning of fairy tales?

122
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:29,116
Shift them away from good?
So be it.

123
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:35,914
Let's begin with Snow White.
She was easy prey.

124
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,083
Woodsman, come forth.

125
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:52,347
Bring me the heart of the witch
who's as white as snow.

126
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,435
As you wish.

127
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,980
Now, mirror, mirror.

128
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,525
Show me the sister
who's been burned by love.

129
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,448
Oh, I know, I know.
I am very, very late.

130
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,658
It's okay, I switched
your 9:00 with the 2:00,

131
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,036
bumped your 10 to 12,
and I made your 11:00 a lunch.

132
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,580
I have no idea what you just said,
but it sounds great.

133
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:17,789
Any messages?

134
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,585
Yeah, your divorce attorney called,
then Cole, Cole and Cole again.

135
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,630
- Get my divorce attorney on the phone.
- Okay.

136
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,634
- I'm sorry.
- I'll get some paper towels.

137
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,469
- I am so sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.

138
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,929
Here, l...

139
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,139
Thanks.

140
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:38,519
I really am terribly sorry.
I'd be happy to pay for the dry-cleaning.

141
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,188
No, that's not necessary.

142
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,859
- Mr?
- Prince. Adam Prince.

143
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,819
- Hi, Adam, I'm...
- Phoebe.

144
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,738
I read your column.

145
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,117
- You do?
- You seem surprised.

146
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,621
Well, yeah, you're not exactly
my target audience.

147
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,082
Unless you're a closet
housewife pining for love.

148
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:03,627
Well, one out of two is not bad.

149
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:08,006
Adam, sorry. Got hung up in traffic.

150
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,466
What are you doing here?

151
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,802
You two know each other?

152
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,515
- Well, yeah, we're married.
- Yeah, but about to be divorced.

153
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,476
I didn't want this to affect your decision
whether to buy the paper.

154
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,229
What...? Buy what pa...?
This paper?

155
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,148
Adam's family owns several papers
across the country, Phoebe.

156
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,608
TV stations too.

157
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,319
And Cole, through his law firm,
was the one that suggested

158
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,363
I might be interested
in buying this one.

159
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,366
That's fascinating stuff right there.

160
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,827
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

161
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't know what you're up to,

162
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,794
but whatever it is,
it is not gonna work.

163
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,297
Don't you think you're being
a little paranoid?

164
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,633
With my demon ex-husband from hell?
No, Cole, I don't.

165
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,094
Look, I'm just trying
to help you, okay?

166
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,804
I found out that Adam
liked your column,

167
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,514
so I figured if he could
syndicate it...

168
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:01,393
If you hurt me or my sisters,
I will vanquish you.

169
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,854
And this time,
I'll make sure it sticks.

170
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,492
You all right?

171
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,329
Yeah. I'll be fine.

172
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:25,042
So I guess this is probably not
the best time to ask you out.

173
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,919
I mean, not on a date, per se.

174
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,172
It's just that I'm hosting a charity
fundraiser tonight at the St. Regis,

175
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,467
and I thought
maybe if you're interested...

176
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,052
I'm interested.

177
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,222
And very, very flattered.

178
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,643
But you're probably right,
it's not the best time for me, you know.

179
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,063
- Sure.
- Rain check?

180
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,148
Absolutely.

181
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,525
Okay.

182
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,235
All right.

183
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,075
You heard me, Leo. I want you
to bring Grams back, now.

184
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,785
Okay, I can't do that. She's dead.

185
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,204
Well, I realize that.
Thank you very much, Leo.

186
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,039
I'm not asking you to resurrect her,

187
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,292
I just need her here for a little while,
for some advice.

188
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,545
Then why don't you try
conjuring her?

189
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,879
You did it once before.

190
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,841
Yeah, okay, but that was
a unique situation, okay?

191
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,301
And besides, I already tried.
It didn't work.

192
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,847
Look, I know this doesn't seem
important, but it is to me.

193
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,431
I can't do this alone.

194
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,851
Well, you're not alone. I'm here.

195
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,311
Yeah, I know, and it's not your fault.

196
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,230
But there's only so much
you can do, okay?

197
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:32,067
I'm the one that's carrying the baby,
and I don't want to screw it up.

198
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,778
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not ridiculous.

199
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,614
It is not ridiculous at all.
This is not raging hormones talking.

200
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,158
Okay, this is a very special baby
with very special needs,

201
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,078
and I need someone pretty damn
special to help me figure it out.

202
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,830
And when I say now, I mean now!

203
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,838
Piper.

204
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:55,716
Thank you.

205
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,968
Don't thank me, I didn't do anything.

206
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,596
What am I doing here?

207
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,306
And corporeal to boot?

208
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,392
Well, what do you mean?
Didn't you come on your own power?

209
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,228
Honey, I'm good,
but I'm not that good.

210
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:12,733
Well, as long as I'm here,
don't I get a hug?

211
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:18,155
But wait, I still don't understand.
Who summoned you?

212
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,743
- The baby?
- No. You think?

213
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,828
Maybe you tapped
into her power somehow

214
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,246
and made your wish come true.

215
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:30,042
Oh, you wished for me? Why?

216
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,628
Because I need help.
I need your advice.

217
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,088
I need to know how
to get ready for this baby.

218
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,174
Oh, well, that's easy.

219
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:42,554
Now, let's see, have you been
exercising your powers daily?

220
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:43,847
Do I need to?

221
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,808
Well, you know, if you don't
wanna lose control of them.

222
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,354
Did you perform a ritual
to promote growth?

223
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:55,817
Did you cast a spell to ward off
demonic parasites?

224
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,654
Sweetheart, what did you do?

225
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,282
We built a nursery
in our bedroom closet.

226
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,410
Closet? Well, no wonder
this baby called me.

227
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:09,164
Come on, we'll start in there.
We've got plenty of work to do.

228
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,457
Oh, my goodness.

229
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,126
Don't tell me you're already
interviewing nannies.

230
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:19,508
Paige, you're even more beautiful
than I imagined.

231
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,177
And you are?

232
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:26,890
Why, I'm your Grams, of course.
Oh, come here.

233
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,606
Quick, go clean up the nursery.

234
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:40,195
No offence,
but aren't you supposed to be dead?

235
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,447
Oh, I'm over that. Look at you.

236
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,284
I mean, you're absolutely gorgeous.

237
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:49,580
You have my mother's eyes.
Oh, she was a real looker too.

238
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,373
Bet you have plenty
of boyfriends, right?

239
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,793
Actually, not a problem
I'm having right now, Mrs. Halliwell.

240
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,254
Oh, please, call me Grams.

241
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:13,520
Piper!

242
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,364
What the hell was that?

243
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,910
What's going on? Paige?

244
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,495
Paige?

245
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,123
Try as you might, fairy-tale magic
runs out at midnight.

246
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,709
There's still plenty of time.

247
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,462
The Woodsman failed, but I won't.

248
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,880
I'll split the witches up

249
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:44,593
and make sure that none of them
lives happily ever after.

250
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,726
I'm telling you, that was a demon.

251
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,896
No crazy person off the street
is that good with an axe.

252
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,649
Except since when do demons
attack with an axe?

253
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,484
Athame, axe, what's the difference?

254
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,445
Who cares? Let's just see if there's
any more where he came from.

255
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:06,949
I mean, I certainly don't want a body
if it's gonna get chopped up.

256
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,952
Well, Piper says you're the super witch.
What do you think he was?

257
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,203
I don't know.

258
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,456
Although there was something
about him that looked familiar.

259
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,959
A little like this, maybe?

260
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,421
Oh, the Woodsman, of course.

261
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,715
Oh, you recognized him too.

262
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:27,135
I read fairy tales to my baby
just like you read to me.

263
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:31,682
Oh, darling. Well, I'm glad
you're finally doing something.

264
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,602
Wait, you're saying a fairy-tale
character came to life

265
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,688
and attacked us? Come on.

266
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:38,939
Well, why not?

267
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,441
They're real.
I mean, at least they used to be.

268
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,818
What?

269
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,152
Oh, Paige.

270
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,615
I can see I have lots
to teach you too.

271
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,644
Fairy tales are not all fables, my dear.

272
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:22,774
Some are recountings of
ancient battles between good and evil.

273
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,194
And they're as much a part
of our heritage

274
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,154
as anything
in the Book of Shadows.

275
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:29,573
You expect me to believe
that there are giant beanstalks

276
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,533
and gingerbread houses
that actually existed?

277
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:35,537
You used to think the Evil Enchantress
was just a fairy tale too, didn't you?

278
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,247
That was different, that was...

279
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,500
A past life, yours.

280
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,587
Hey, you guys,
was anyone here when this got?

281
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,631
Grams.

282
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,300
In the flesh, so to speak.

283
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,095
Oh, it's so good to see you.

284
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,640
Wait, what did I just hug?
Where did you get the body from?

285
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:58,185
Oh, it's a long story.
And speaking of stories,

286
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,687
a fairy tale just tried
to slice our heads off.

287
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,105
A fairy tale?

288
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:04,024
The Woodsman from Snow White.

289
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:08,737
Okay, well, that would explain
where these came from.

290
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,113
Glass slippers.

291
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,033
Cinderella's, no doubt.
Cole knows it's my favourite.

292
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,118
Cole? You think Cole
is doing all of this?

293
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,704
Who else has enough power
to turn fairy tales against us?

294
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,206
I told you he was gonna attack.

295
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:23,418
Except it was an evil witch who sent
the Woodsman in Snow White.

296
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,379
I think I better go check
with the Elders.

297
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,589
I think you better.

298
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,594
- What are you doing?
- Proving that I'm right.

299
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,390
Hey, that's risky.
You don't know what could happen.

300
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:39,893
Well, I know that Cole won't hurt me,
physically anyway.

301
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,438
Well, as much as I distrust him,
we don't know that it's him behind this.

302
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:47,359
All the more reason to play along
and find out who is.

303
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:50,028
We can't just sit around here
and wait to be attacked.

304
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,405
She could get killed.

305
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,240
Piper, a little support here?

306
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:59,329
If Grams thinks it's a good idea,
who am I to disagree?

307
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,048
This way. See?

308
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,509
No problem. I'm fine.

309
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:26,315
Actually, I'm better than fine.

310
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,652
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

311
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,947
- I don't know, I can't stop!
- Well, get out of them.

312
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,033
I can't.

313
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,285
The door! The door!

314
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:40,829
- Grams, what do we do?
- Just let her go.

315
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:44,708
We're never gonna be able to get
to the bottom of this if you don't.

316
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,546
Paige, follow her.
Orb her out if she gets in trouble.

317
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,715
She's already in trouble.

318
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,800
Help!

319
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,720
I'm gonna have to help you
get ready to be a mother later.

320
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,389
Right now, we've got to deal
with evil witches.

321
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,266
Right.

322
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,521
Oh, not that book.
This one.

323
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,484
Listen, I am very interested
in making an offer,

324
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:14,446
but I am on my way
to a charity event right now.

325
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,617
Can we talk first thing
in the morning?

326
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:21,620
Great. Thank you.

327
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,707
What the hell?

328
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,594
How can I serve you, my queen?

329
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,974
Just be a charming prince.

330
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,852
Meet Cinderella at the ball.

331
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,689
But be certain that she's
in the carriage at midnight.

332
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:53,110
Otherwise, you won't have
a happy ending either.

333
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,784
- Hey, I'm walking here.
- Get out of the street!

334
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,037
Don't you have any way
of controlling those things?

335
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:08,750
They didn't exactly come
with an instruction manual, Paige.

336
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,752
God!

337
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:18,177
- They stopped.
- Yeah, but why did they stop?

338
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,814
Well, he's got style,
I'll give him that much.

339
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:33,901
Okay, this is getting too weird.
We're getting out of here.

340
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,446
Excuse me, sir?
Did Cole Turner send you?

341
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:42,659
Hello? I asked you a question.

342
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:48,749
Okay, whatever happens,
you are not getting into that...

343
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,209
Phoebe, no!

344
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:59,343
Looks like he wants Cinderella to go
to the ball alone, just like in the story.

345
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,802
Hold on.

346
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:03,055
I'll orb you out.

347
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,973
No, go back to the manor.

348
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,643
But what about you?

349
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:11,063
Look, I'll call for Leo
if I'm in danger, okay?

350
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,731
She's already in danger.

351
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,109
We never should have split up.
No offence, Mrs. Halliwell.

352
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,320
Grams. And none taken.

353
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,072
Yeah, well, if what we heard is true,

354
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:23,659
then Phoebe could be in a lot more
danger than we think. We all could.

355
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:25,744
Yeah, if somebody is using
fairy tales for evil,

356
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,997
it could rewrite them, corrupt them
for every future generation.

357
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,959
How? How can you rewrite them?
They're already in print.

358
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,962
Yeah, but every copy is
a manifestation of an original.

359
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,298
An original that was entrusted
to the Keeper of the Fairy Tales

360
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,342
long ago for protection.

361
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,761
The Elders think something
has happened to him,

362
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:45,389
that somebody took over
the fortress from the inside.

363
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,100
An evil witch, I might add.

364
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:50,602
Why don't we just orb to this fortress
and kick her butt?

365
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:52,813
Because nobody knows where it is.

366
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,816
Its location has been kept secret,
even from the Elders.

367
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:59,027
Where was their infinite wisdom
on the day that was decided?

368
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,530
The point is we have no way
of finding her.

369
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,574
Piper, I'm surprised at you.

370
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:07,119
I mean, she's a witch, isn't she?
Just scry for her.

371
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:08,787
Oh, right.

372
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,289
Then, after you find her,

373
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:14,668
you lure her back here to us,
and we vanquish her with a potion.

374
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:15,878
What potion?

375
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:19,756
Oh, one that works wonders
on evil witches.

376
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,592
Come, I'll show you.

377
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:29,850
Maybe we could also work
on your protection potion,

378
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,519
if we have time.

379
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:41,820
You all right?

380
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,156
I need to concentrate.

381
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,586
She'll find you.
And by midnight too.

382
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:01,131
I want her to find me.

383
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,175
Part of me, anyway.

384
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:07,471
Hair and a cloak? That's not
in the Little Red Riding Hood tale.

385
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:08,889
No.

386
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,435
But luring them away
from Grandmother's house is.

387
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:18,398
And so is the big bad wolf.

388
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:40,212
Excuse me, pardon me.
Coming through.

389
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,555
Excuse me.

390
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,644
Phoebe, you came.
I'm so glad.

391
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:59,606
Yeah, well, I didn't really
have much of a choice.

392
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,902
- You look fabulous.
- Thanks.

393
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,988
I just hope you're not here
with someone else.

394
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:08,949
Oh, no. I am definitely
not here with someone else.

395
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,993
Even if that someone else
thinks I am.

396
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,079
I'm sorry?

397
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:16,832
Oh, well, speak of the devil.

398
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,794
- What are you doing here?
- As if you don't know.

399
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:23,088
- Actually, I don't.
- Listen, Cole,

400
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:24,673
these boots may be
made for walking,

401
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:26,592
but they're never walking
back to you, buddy.

402
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,135
Boots?

403
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:30,220
You know what I mean.

404
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,640
Am I up to something again?

405
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,934
Listen, why don't we get a drink?

406
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:38,896
Oh, you two here together?

407
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,399
Yeah, yeah, isn't that part
of your master plan?

408
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,194
There is no master plan.

409
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,862
At least, not one that'll work.

410
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,781
- Okay, you ready?
- Yes.

411
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:52,618
- Phoebe, wait.
- Listen, why don't you back off, pal.

412
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:54,244
Excuse me?

413
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,543
Okay, you know what,
leave him alone, Cole. Let him go.

414
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:06,798
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. You ready?

415
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:10,302
- Phoebe, I don't think you should...
- I don't care what you think.

416
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,888
Just stay the hell away from me.

417
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:22,439
You must take care to cut
the mandrake root to expose the meat.

418
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:24,399
Otherwise, it doesn't do any good.

419
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:28,737
And then you simply roll them
in mustard seed, but not too heavily.

420
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:31,073
And then...

421
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,327
...goodbye, evil witch.

422
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,996
I can't believe you did that
without looking at the Book once.

423
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:41,291
Honey, I wrote the Book.
All the good potions, anyway.

424
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,001
Would you be a dear
and get me a vial?

425
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,045
Oh, yeah, sure.

426
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:55,806
Paige, the vial?

427
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:58,183
I'm sorry.

428
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:02,062
You know, it's a good thing
you quit your job.

429
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:05,190
You catch on quickly
and you have a real gift for the craft.

430
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:08,527
How'd you know I quit my job?
How'd you know I even had a job?

431
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:11,572
Oh, I peek.
I mean, you know, sometimes.

432
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,575
Oh, but never during
a private moment.

433
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:16,952
Thanks, I guess.

434
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,413
I mean, what choice do I have?

435
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,417
- Okay, no offence, Mrs. Halliwell...
- Grams.

436
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,171
Okay, that's my point.
I already had a grams.

437
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,339
One I really, really loved.

438
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:34,678
And yes, technically we're related
and you're my grandmother too.

439
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:39,266
I guess it just feels a little odd
because I don't know you.

440
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,560
I understand.

441
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:44,605
And I wouldn't dream of trying
to replace someone

442
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,148
as special to you as that.

443
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:51,445
But isn't it possible
that maybe there might be

444
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:54,114
a little room left in your heart
for me too?

445
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:57,242
Someday?

446
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:02,623
Well, at least I can see
where I get my stubbornness from.

447
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:09,254
I'd better get a couple of vials
for Phoebe and Piper too.

448
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:21,391
Grams?

449
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,478
You don't need Grams to do
the scrying. What's gotten into you?

450
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:28,398
I don't know. I suddenly feel
like I can't make any decisions at all.

451
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:32,611
I feel like I'm 10 years old again
around her.

452
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:35,948
Hey, what's this?

453
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:41,119
Oh, let me guess.
Little Red Riding Hood's?

454
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:46,250
Wait, we're off the beaten path,
aren't we?

455
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,710
Oh, no, Grams.

456
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,052
Paige.

457
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:00,889
Paige!

458
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,398
No. No!

459
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,924
What happened?

460
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:40,721
I'm afraid she's dead.

461
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:52,816
I know there's something in here
somewhere about poison. Leo?

462
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:57,863
No, we are not giving up.
This is a stinking fairy tale.

463
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,866
If Snow White can come back to life,
then Paige can too.

464
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,076
Right, Grams?

465
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:06,121
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

466
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:07,372
What are you talking about?

467
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:11,210
You're supposed to be the expert.
There has got to be some way.

468
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:13,754
- What about a kiss?
- A kiss?

469
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:16,131
It worked for Snow White.
It's worth a shot.

470
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:19,718
A kiss. Yes, by all means.

471
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,470
Come, let's find her boyfriend.

472
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:24,640
She doesn't have a boyfriend,
remember?

473
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:26,058
Right, sorry.

474
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,105
Stomach is really upset.

475
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,233
Wait, I got a spell.

476
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,401
Hear our call
For those who fall

477
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:41,865
Purge her to awaken
From this toxin taken

478
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:45,994
Nothing.

479
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:47,496
Grams, what do we do?

480
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:51,750
We focus on vanquishing
the evil witch,

481
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:55,921
in the hopes that it reverses
the dark magic. It's our only hope.

482
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,048
Did you finish
the vanquishing potion?

483
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,593
No, unfortunately.

484
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:04,513
Bad batch.

485
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:10,185
Oh, Leo, would you be a lamb
and see who that is?

486
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:21,155
Honey? Honey, you might
wanna come look at this.

487
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,414
What? What is it?

488
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:37,212
Someone here
eat a poisoned apple?

489
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:56,815
You know, there's a fine line
between love and hate.

490
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:58,400
What?

491
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:02,321
It's just I'm not sure if you're dancing
with me or for Cole.

492
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:03,697
To make him jealous, I mean.

493
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:07,743
Oh, no, it's not like that at all.
It's just very complicated.

494
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,661
I see.

495
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:11,788
I could always have him fired,
if that would help.

496
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,333
- Really?
- Absolutely, just say the word.

497
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,335
- Word.
- Done.

498
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,088
You know, it's almost midnight.

499
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:22,341
What do you say we get out of here?

500
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,137
Hold that thought.

501
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:32,768
I don't know what happened to you,
but I do know evil when I see it.

502
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:34,436
And you're it.

503
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:38,023
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No, of course you don't.

504
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,526
But if you try to hurt Phoebe,
I'll kill you.

505
00:31:43,821 --> 00:31:47,282
She's dead?
What do you mean she's dead?

506
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,368
Don't worry,
the dwarves are all over it.

507
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:50,577
The dwarves?

508
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,538
Piper cast a spell
that wound up summoning

509
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:54,498
the descendants
of the seven dwarves.

510
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,125
Actually, they prefer to be called
"little people" now.

511
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,752
Snow White and the Little People?

512
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,755
Look, the point is that they preserve
the dead. It's what they do.

513
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:02,965
At least it'll buy us time

514
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,509
until we can vanquish
the evil witch who's behind all this.

515
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,219
Cole is behind all of this.

516
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:09,179
Not according to the Elders he's not.

517
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:10,389
Wha...?

518
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:13,517
Look, even if he is responsible,
there's nothing more you can do here.

519
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:15,978
Piper needs you back home
to try and save Paige.

520
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,105
Okay.

521
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,573
When's her prince getting here?

522
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,032
She doesn't have a prince.

523
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,993
No prince?
Then who's gonna kiss her?

524
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:33,579
- I'll do it.
- In your dreams, stinky. I'll do it.

525
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:36,081
- I told you not to call me that.
- People!

526
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:39,168
A little professional
decorum here, please.

527
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,795
Forgive them, it's been a while.

528
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:47,092
Sweetheart,
what are you doing with that?

529
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:49,887
Well, I'm not gonna sit around
and wait for the wolf to attack.

530
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:52,222
Wolf? What wolf?

531
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:55,392
From Little Red Riding Hood.
This cloak is meant for me.

532
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:58,937
Oh, you don't believe
that silly old story, do you?

533
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:01,815
Grams, you're the one that says
fairy tales are based in truth.

534
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:05,903
Well, yes, but that one
was made up to scare little kids.

535
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:09,740
I mean, after all, a little girl gets
eaten in the end. What a downer.

536
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:13,452
No, the Woodsman comes
and cuts open the wolf's stomach,

537
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,871
and frees her and the grandmother.

538
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:19,374
Well, that's not the popular version.

539
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:22,628
Well, it's in our version.

540
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:25,047
Really? Show me.

541
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:35,641
- Think she knows that's a wolf?
- Not our business.

542
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,692
Okay, let's orb.

543
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,862
Phoebe, where are you going?
Who is this guy?

544
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:52,491
This is my brother-in-law. Something
has happened and I gotta get home.

545
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:55,118
- I'm really sorry, Adam.
- Then let me give you a ride.

546
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:57,412
Don't go anywhere with this guy.

547
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,791
How could you have done this?

548
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,543
- Done what?
- Come on.

549
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,294
- Phoebe, wait.
- Leave her alone!

550
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:06,547
Keep him away from me.

551
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,132
Leo, he's evil.

552
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,635
Really? And what are you?

553
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:16,265
So Red Riding Hood
comes into the house,

554
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:20,185
and finds the wolf
dressed as her grandmother.

555
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:23,522
As if she wouldn't see through that.

556
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:25,232
Skip down.

557
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,441
Okay, let's see.

558
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:31,113
She says, "Grandmother,
what big ears you have."

559
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,740
"The better to hear you with,
my dear."

560
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:37,953
And then, "What big eyes you have."

561
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,831
"The better to see you with,
my dear."

562
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,793
Yeah, yeah, and then,

563
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:47,588
"What big teeth you have."

564
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:52,134
"The better to eat you with,
my dear!"

565
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,273
Piper.

566
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,028
What are we doing out here?

567
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:26,627
No!

568
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:45,562
The end.

569
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:12,172
Put it down. Gently.

570
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:15,759
I can't. The witch will kill me.

571
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:17,261
And so will I.

572
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:21,056
You don't wanna hurt her.

573
00:36:36,238 --> 00:36:39,575
Oh, what am I gonna do with you?

574
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,670
Keep your hands off my pumpkin.

575
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,425
Where's my wife?

576
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:57,718
Where's my wife?

577
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:05,225
No!

578
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:11,523
Piper.

579
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:13,942
Are you okay?

580
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,446
Yeah, I think so.

581
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:20,991
- How did you?
- She blew him up from the inside.

582
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:23,952
Although it took her long enough.

583
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:26,747
Back off, Grams,
I just saved your ass.

584
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,251
She's back.

585
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:37,341
Your sister. And I had nothing
to do with this, I swear.

586
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:41,261
- Oh, my.
- What are we going to do now?

587
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,722
Well, we do what we were gonna
do in the first place.

588
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:45,807
We find the witch who did this
and vanquish her.

589
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:48,477
- Do you know how to find her?
- No.

590
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:50,604
Wait a minute, I think I do.

591
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,523
The wolf was trying to get into
the book of fairy tales.

592
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:56,026
Perhaps it's a portal of some sort.

593
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:58,695
Although I don't know how
we access it.

594
00:37:58,862 --> 00:37:59,905
Well, we can't.

595
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,743
But maybe
Little Red Riding Hood can.

596
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:08,997
I knew I was gonna have to put on
this stupid thing sooner or later.

597
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:12,501
Don't forget the potion.

598
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:18,924
Go on. Show her who's
the most powerful witch of all.

599
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:33,438
Why won't you answer
my question?

600
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:35,691
Why won't you tell me
what I want to hear?

601
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:39,653
You know as well as I
that I cannot tell a lie.

602
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,363
Damn it!

603
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,450
Well, then, if I'm not the most
powerful witch in the land, who is?

604
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:48,078
Take a wild guess.

605
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,288
You?

606
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,081
That's not possible.

607
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,751
The wolf ate you. I saw it.

608
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:58,297
Yeah, well, I didn't agree with him.

609
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:01,592
See if this agrees with you.

610
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:06,180
No, I'm melting.

611
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:13,687
I'm melting! I'm melting!

612
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:29,328
You saved me.

613
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:31,914
Are you the Keeper?

614
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:34,583
No, his apprentice.

615
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,668
Or at least I was.

616
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:39,171
Oh, no. Wait, if he didn't
come back to life,

617
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:40,881
does that mean
my sisters won't either?

618
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,884
No, no, they were victims
of fairy-tale magic,

619
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:47,304
so when you saved the fairy tales,
you saved them too.

620
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:52,518
A glass slipper is missing.

621
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:56,271
Must mean that story
hasn't found the happy ending yet.

622
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,608
Well, I guess this makes you
the new Keeper.

623
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,278
I guess so.

624
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:06,365
Any idea how I get
the heck out of here?

625
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:32,975
All right, can someone please tell me
how I got in a coffin?

626
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:34,309
You were dead, dear.

627
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:37,896
But bright side, at least now we have
something in common.

628
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:40,065
You know, you really ought
to get yourself a prince

629
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:41,692
in case this ever happens again.

630
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:44,820
- Who are you?
- We'll send you the bill.

631
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:46,113
Let's go, men.

632
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,449
- Come on, guys, let's go.
- All right.

633
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:55,455
Paige, you're okay.

634
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:59,209
Which means the witch is vanquished.
So where's?

635
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,007
Piper.

636
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:11,388
Is everybody okay?

637
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:13,515
Well, thanks to you they are.

638
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:17,561
Well, I suppose that means
it's time for me to go.

639
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:19,021
Mind giving me a lift?

640
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:21,190
Well, why do you have to go at all?

641
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:25,360
Because I don't belong here anymore.

642
00:41:26,195 --> 00:41:28,113
See, you thought you needed me,

643
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:31,325
but I was only here to remind you
that you don't.

644
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:32,576
Not even for her.

645
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:34,661
Okay, but what about me?

646
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:37,247
I feel like I didn't get to spend
any time with you.

647
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:41,251
That's okay. I don't stay dead long.

648
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,794
Good point.

649
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:48,425
Well, do I at least
get a hug goodbye?

650
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:55,098
It was great to finally meet you.

651
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:56,934
Grams.

652
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:09,822
Be safe, my darlings.

653
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:19,998
Where are you going?

654
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:23,794
I need to catch up on my fairy tales.

655
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:33,053
I guess I'm gonna catch up
on some sleep.

656
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:43,021
Okay, you want me to say it,
don't you?

657
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:48,318
I was wrong, okay? I'm sorry.

658
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,989
I really am.

659
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:54,575
It's not your fault.
I lost your trust a long time ago.

660
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:56,869
I can't expect
to earn it back overnight.

661
00:42:57,828 --> 00:43:00,914
I don't think I'm gonna trust anyone
any time soon.

662
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:04,168
Do you mean Adam?

663
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:07,838
He was just being used by the witch.
He's a good guy.

664
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:13,093
Really? I don't think
I can even tell anymore.

665
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:35,782
What are we doing here?

666
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:38,952
Rebuilding your trust.

667
00:43:39,828 --> 00:43:42,414
You liked him
when you first met him, right?

668
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:45,083
Yeah, so?

669
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:47,044
So he's not under a spell.

670
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:50,464
Why don't you see if
your original instincts were right?

671
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:55,552
Look, I don't want you
to fall in love with him, Phoebe.

672
00:43:56,887 --> 00:43:58,972
But you need to realize he's not evil.

673
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:02,476
Why are you doing this?

674
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:06,730
Because unless you learn
to trust yourself again,

675
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:08,816
you'll never learn to trust me.
