1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,183
Sounds like we found him.

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,519
Yeah, but what's he doing
at Magic School?

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,021
What do you mean?
This place is demon central.

4
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,566
And it's beating up other demons,
that's not what Krycheks do.

5
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:29,363
Well, they also don't attack gnomes
and leprechauns but this one did.

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,448
Something's not right.
It doesn't make sense.

7
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:35,994
Yeah, well, what doesn't make sense
is that we are tracking this thing.

8
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,163
What does the government want
with this demon anyway?

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,124
That will be the first thing
I'm gonna ask Agent Murphy when...

10
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,505
we figure out what's going on.

11
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,022
That thing's the Krychek?

12
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,859
- How is that possible?
- Who cares? Just vanquish it.

13
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,529
I already tried and Agent Murphy
wants us to bring the thing back.

14
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,323
I'm not bringing that thing back.

15
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,662
Go, go, go.

16
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,027
See, this is what a Krychek demon
is supposed to look like.

17
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,281
Well, maybe the one you guys
were following was just a bigger one.

18
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,949
No, this wasn't just bigger,

19
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,827
this was like going from you
to Schwarzenegger.

20
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,662
That is so weird.

21
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,081
Yeah, scary-weird.

22
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,878
Oh, good, you found the skis.

23
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,296
Yeah, they're kind of old though,

24
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,339
maybe we should just rent
new ones, you know?

25
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,383
- Damn it.
- Watch your language.

26
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,928
Wyatt is picking up
everything we say lately.

27
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,638
I'm gonna get coffee,
you guys want any?

28
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,348
No, thanks.

29
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,310
- You okay with those?
- Yes, I got these.

30
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,645
Why don't you finish packing?
I wanna miss traffic, okay?

31
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,855
I know, I'm gonna,

32
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,733
I just need to talk to Agent Murphy first
about this demon of his.

33
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,485
- Piper.
- What, I can't just let it go, can I?

34
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,906
Yes, you can. When was the last time
we had a weekend together alone?

35
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,201
I know. I promise, nothing is gonna
stop that from happening. I promise.

36
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,411
But I just kind of need
to talk to him first.

37
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,330
Why can't Billie talk to Murphy?

38
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,584
Because I cannot find Billie anywhere.
She's not answering.

39
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,587
- Maybe we could just get her a pager?
- Well, just keep trying.

40
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,382
Oh, Paige,
Henry called for you last night.

41
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,967
Why? What did he want?

42
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,513
I don't know,
but I'm pretty sure he wants you.

43
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,225
- That's ridiculous.
- Why? Don't you like him?

44
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,684
- No.
- Really?

45
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,269
Then why is your face turning red?

46
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,106
It's not turning red.
I probably just put too much blush on.

47
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,275
It's kind of turning red.

48
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,447
Okay, why don't you and me go see
what the government's not telling us?

49
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,282
And I'll be right back, I swear.

50
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:47,120
- Hey, don't you have a lunch date?
- I cancelled. I'm taking a little hiatus.

51
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,582
- From lunch?
- From men.

52
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:57,047
Okay. Come on, Billie.

53
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,854
Curious, very curious.

54
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,356
He still attacked me.

55
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,108
Why can't I have my revenge?

56
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:19,319
Because Margoyle wants to find out
how he transformed,

57
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,071
why he became so powerful.

58
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,489
I don't care.

59
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,491
I can't let a lower-level demon
get away with...

60
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,369
You can and you will, Emrick.

61
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,581
Otherwise, Margoyle will attack you.

62
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,799
I didn't do that.

63
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,064
Who are you?

64
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,775
Me?

65
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,653
I'm a student here at Magic School.

66
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,823
Yeah, you know, I must have got stuck
in an astral plane or something.

67
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,950
Did you guys possibly redecorate?

68
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,664
- Move and you're dead, understand?
- What do you want?

69
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,293
What I want is to find the demon
that took my sister 15 years ago.

70
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,629
But since you and your buddies
trashed this place,

71
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,130
I can't find the books that I need.

72
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,841
So you're gonna have
to find him for me.

73
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:27,054
Her name is Christy, Christy Jenkins.
Ask around, I'll be back.

74
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,231
Billie, finally.

75
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,443
Hi, how you doing?

76
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:45,197
- Henry, what are you doing here?
- I need your help.

77
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,908
The baby's mom got sent to prison.
I've got till the end of the day

78
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,118
to find his dad or he's gonna
get put into the system.

79
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,870
And you're telling me this why?

80
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,039
Because I need you
to watch him for me.

81
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,375
Oh, no, I don't do babies.
No, sorry, no.

82
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,043
I tried calling.

83
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,963
Look, you can't just stop by
and drop a baby in my lap.

84
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,507
Look, you said you were
all about doing good, right?

85
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,176
- Here's your chance.
- No, that's not what I meant.

86
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,971
You know how beautiful
your eyes are when you're angry?

87
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,514
Are you trying to charm me?

88
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,975
- You think I'm charming?
- No, I don't.

89
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,062
Look, I'm doing this
under the radar, okay?

90
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,480
I can't keep Ramon at my office,

91
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,525
social services could show up.
They'll take him.

92
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,362
Oh, thank you. Here you go.

93
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,406
But for the record, I resent this.

94
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,867
Yeah, he might need
to be changed, too.

95
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,994
I owe you.

96
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,215
Good, you're back. How'd it go?

97
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,176
- Not good.
- What do you mean?

98
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,136
- Where's our demon?
- Our demon?

99
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,680
Why don't you tell us
a little bit more about our demon?

100
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,058
Like how the government got him
in the first place.

101
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,354
I don't really know.
I wasn't in the loop.

102
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,773
Well, you need to get in the loop,
and fast.

103
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,109
Because our demon
was a little more powerful

104
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,403
than we expected,
and I'd like to know why.

105
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,573
Well, I'm sorry,
but I can't tell you what I don't know.

106
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,744
Phoebe, go get a premonition off him,
see if he's lying.

107
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,829
- No, I can't.
- What do you mean you can't?

108
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,957
- Just go touch him.
- Seriously, I can't.

109
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,710
I don't really believe in them
anymore.

110
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,504
What do you mean?

111
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,631
Well, they haven't really
worked well for me lately,

112
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:26,965
so why should I listen to them?

113
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,175
That's not true.

114
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,801
Oh, really?
Do I look pregnant to you?

115
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,346
- Ladies, did you get...?
- Hold it.

116
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,264
I realize why you feel this way.

117
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,476
And I understand,
but you can't give up on your gift.

118
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:41,271
- My gift gave up on me.
- That is not true.

119
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:45,025
Guys. Hey, did you or didn't you
get the demon back?

120
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,280
Well, that was the objective.

121
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,158
Are you kidding me?
We barely wounded it.

122
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,493
So you still gotta go get him.

123
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,827
Dude, are you deaf?

124
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,914
What did you guys do to that thing?

125
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:02,042
I have no idea, okay? I swear.

126
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,963
But if we don't get it off the streets,
we all could get exposed.

127
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,174
There's the E word again.

128
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,804
- Hey, where have you been?
- Class.

129
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,973
Oh, really? I've been trying
to call you all morning.

130
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,185
- Well, my cell phone died.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

131
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,817
Yeah, so that's a great baby there.
Is it yours?

132
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,736
Forget the baby, okay?

133
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,156
Where were you?

134
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,450
Look, I've been handling
this whole demon load just fine.

135
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,369
So, what I do on my own time,
it's my business.

136
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,121
Know what?
You are doing the bratty thing,

137
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,415
which means you were probably
doing something

138
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,000
you shouldn't be doing.

139
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,043
Did you go to Magic School?

140
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,336
Yes. Yes, okay.

141
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,006
But there's information there
on my sister. What do you expect?

142
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,842
I expect you to be available
when we need you,

143
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,719
that's the whole point
of us teaching you.

144
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:56,430
Well, I'm not a doctor, okay?
I can't be available 24/7.

145
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,098
Yes, actually, you can.

146
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,268
Because you weren't around,
I'm stuck taking care of this baby now.

147
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,606
Nursery.

148
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:10,736
- Remember me, witch?
- You know him?

149
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,337
Magic School.

150
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,052
Okay, so maybe I know him.

151
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:44,186
Oh, can't we just get back
to the freaky demon, please?

152
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,980
Yeah, we can, after I deal with you.

153
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,108
I don't understand
why you can't just let this go.

154
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,445
Look, I understand your problem
with your premonitions

155
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,864
but why cancel all your dates?

156
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:59,535
Because they're me trying
to make my premonitions come true.

157
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,037
- So?
- Well, so it's not working, okay?

158
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,290
My conception date
has come and gone.

159
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,794
Okay, Phoebe,
it's okay to feel disappointed.

160
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,505
No, I'm not disappointed.
You know, I'm relieved.

161
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,841
So now you don't want a baby?

162
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,636
No, of course, I do.
I definitely do, just not right now.

163
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:21,098
Okay, no men, no babies, just me.

164
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,850
- What's so wrong with that?
- Nothing.

165
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,186
Nothing is wrong with that
except for the fact that it's not you.

166
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,481
Don't you have a ski trip
to get ready for?

167
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,485
What the hell?

168
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,530
Language.

169
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,783
Hi.

170
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,035
What happened?

171
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,871
A demon attacked us.

172
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,165
I guess I kind of ticked him off
at Magic School.

173
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,833
Magic School?
What were you doing there?

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,003
Look, Paige already gave me the
"What were you thinking?" speech...

175
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,880
So, what were you thinking?

176
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,258
Look, I only went there so I could get
more information on my sister.

177
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,719
I understand you want answers.
We want answers too.

178
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,762
But that cannot be
your primary focus.

179
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,142
Oh, sweetie, you're hurt.

180
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,935
Oh, no, that's just a scratch.

181
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,855
Okay, but a hair deeper
and you would have needed stitches.

182
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:12,024
Really, it's not a big deal.
I'm getting used to it.

183
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,776
So anyway, Paige thinks the demon
did the same Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde

184
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,236
that the one at Magic School did.

185
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,864
So whatever got him all hulked out,
he was able to track me.

186
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:21,867
Which is cool. I mean, bad cool,
but still kind of cool.

187
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:24,244
So now, there's two of them
running around out there?

188
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,998
No, actually, I saw yours go...
back at Magic School. He's dead.

189
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,334
Oh, Murphy will be excited
about that.

190
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,878
Yeah, but why are all these demons
running around on steroids?

191
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,379
It doesn't make any sense.

192
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,672
You want me to check the "Book"

193
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,468
- so you can still go on your trip?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

194
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:40,844
You're still in the doghouse.

195
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,725
- That's not yours.
- That's not mine.

196
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:54,274
Hi. Where did you get the baby?

197
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,944
Oh, Henry dropped him off with me.

198
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,489
- Because?
- Because he likes to see me squirm.

199
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:05,327
No, apparently the baby's mom is in jail
and we're trying to find the dad.

200
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:06,912
Oh, that's very noble of him.

201
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,373
Yeah, well, ten bucks says
he knows where to find him.

202
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,124
Told you she likes him.

203
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,006
Hi, buddy.

204
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,009
Does he have a name?

205
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,929
Yeah, this is Ramon.

206
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,433
So Billie told us what happened.

207
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,270
Yeah, I talked to her about it,
you know, but I can't really blame her.

208
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,063
She said the demon
looked like the Krychek?

209
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,065
Yeah, only in size and in power.

210
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,277
Billie said when she confronted him
before, he wasn't nearly as big.

211
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,195
Did you get anything out
of Agent Murphy?

212
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,489
Just that he wants the demon back,
which is disturbing.

213
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:46,410
Now that Billie saw him die, I don't
really think it's our problem anymore.

214
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,079
I'd still like to know
what's making them so powerful.

215
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,623
Okay, well, I have to get Henry
to take this baby somewhere else

216
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,292
because it is too dangerous
around here.

217
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,460
- Pheebs, will you watch him for me?
- What?

218
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:59,173
I can't. I have stuff that I have to do.
You should take him with you, right?

219
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,134
I can't. Social services
might be there waiting to take him.

220
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:03,844
Oh, come on, you love babies.

221
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:07,264
Yeah, I know, I'm just, you know,
focussing on other things right now.

222
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:14,188
You know, I think this is precisely
what you should be focussing on.

223
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:18,233
Come on. She's gotta go to Henry.
I gotta go romance my husband.

224
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,110
It's just a baby. It doesn't bite.

225
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,904
- Did I miss something?
- Nothing.

226
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,572
A lot.

227
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,116
See you.

228
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:30,829
Whatever. Here you go, honey.
Here you go. Hey, you.

229
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:38,378
Okay, little one. Applesauce.

230
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:49,973
What's happening to me?

231
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,309
You're dying like all the others.

232
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:55,103
It's happening
all over the underworld.

233
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:56,980
What have you learned?

234
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,525
I'm still studying his...

235
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:03,487
Studying? I don't have time
for you to study.

236
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:06,073
I want you to know.

237
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,244
I want to harness this great power
before another overlord does

238
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,371
without meeting his fate.

239
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,165
At least this one's lived the longest.

240
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,668
He may hold the key to preventing
the power from killing you.

241
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:19,962
How?

242
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:25,050
If I can isolate the one cell fragment
in his blood that's causing it...

243
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:38,146
Margoyle, please.
I just need a little more time.

244
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,902
Time's up.

245
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,031
What do you want, Tracker?

246
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,576
Last night, I saw the Charmed Ones
attack the Krychek.

247
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:51,785
So?

248
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,912
This morning,
their new witch attacked Emrick.

249
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,914
Both demons
had the power you seek.

250
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,711
Which means they must be
after the power as well.

251
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,966
Perhaps we should let them
find it for us.

252
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,386
Follow them.

253
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,615
- Oh, hi. Hey.
- Hey.

254
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,451
- How's the packing going?
- Oh, it's great, great.

255
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,787
Two-day trip, Piper thinks
she needs a third suitcase.

256
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,206
Making any progress?

257
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,832
No, there's nothing in this book

258
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,667
that says how
to supercharge a demon.

259
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,086
Well, that means none
of their ancestors

260
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,713
had confronted anything
like it before.

261
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,465
It's just a book of their experiences.

262
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,217
Have you started
your own "Book of Shadows?"

263
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,885
No. Why, should I?

264
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,137
Yeah, I think every witch
should have one.

265
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,556
You know, you can pass it on
from generation to generation.

266
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,060
- You okay?
- Yeah.

267
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:02,022
Yeah, I'm just a little worried,
I mean, about all these demons.

268
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,483
Well, get used to it.

269
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,320
Hey, are witches
and demons different species?

270
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,822
- What?
- You know, like dogs and cats,

271
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,991
so they can't get each other
sick and stuff?

272
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,245
I guess so, why?

273
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,580
Okay, good.
No reason. Have a good trip.

274
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,333
Thanks, if we ever get there.

275
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,675
Well, if we check
employment records,

276
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:31,593
we're at least gonna know
where he worked last.

277
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,346
I mean, he has to feed himself, right?
He needs some food.

278
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:36,640
Bring me that file, then.

279
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:37,850
- Well, yeah...
- Hey.

280
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,644
Yeah, you have it, I don't have it.
Just bring it here.

281
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,896
Is everything okay?
Where's the baby?

282
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,023
Ramon is fine, he's with my sister,
but, you know,

283
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,359
you've gotta find another place
for him to stay.

284
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,152
Why, what's wrong with your place?

285
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,154
It's not a good place
for him to be right now.

286
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,739
- Why not?
- It just isn't.

287
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:53,949
More secrets, huh?

288
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:58,328
- Henry, we barely know each other.
- You don't wanna tell me, that's fine.

289
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:01,123
- It's okay.
- It's not that... Yeah, actually, it is that.

290
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,418
Anyway, can you please find
somewhere else for him to go?

291
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,295
- Paige, I can't.
- Why not?

292
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:09,381
Seriously, if I don't find the father
before social services finds out,

293
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,216
they're gonna stick Ramon
in a foster home.

294
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,718
They will do that.

295
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:13,927
Well, you know, I mean,

296
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,222
sometimes foster homes
aren't all that bad.

297
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:18,932
It was for me.

298
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,393
You were in a foster home?

299
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:24,104
Look, I just need
a little more time, okay?

300
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,815
I know I can find the father.
He used to be a parolee of mine.

301
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:28,984
- Was the mom too?
- Yeah.

302
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,402
But the dad, he turned out great.

303
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,821
I mean,
he straightened out his act and...

304
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:35,407
Oh, the problem is I don't think
he even knows he has a kid.

305
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,117
- Are you sure it's his?
- Yeah.

306
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:38,368
Yeah, I mean, she told me.

307
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,579
Ramon's the one thing
she wouldn't lie about.

308
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:43,415
But I've been showing these pictures
all around where he used to hang

309
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:44,833
and just nobody knows anything.

310
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,421
Hey, got those employment records
you wanted.

311
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:57,095
You did have it, huh?
This is what I wanted.

312
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,140
Okay, well, I'm gonna go.

313
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,601
The sooner you can find him,
the better.

314
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,353
- Paige.
- Yeah?

315
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,356
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

316
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,237
What are you looking at?

317
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:27,459
- You sure you need all this stuff?
- Yes.

318
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,339
Just so you know, I know what you're
trying to do and it's not gonna work.

319
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:33,590
Okay, just so you know,

320
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,093
I know what you're trying to do
and I will be relentless.

321
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,220
I just wanna stop him
from fussing, that's all.

322
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:40,639
Phoebe, come on,
you're a natural with babies.

323
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,057
Not right now, I'm not.

324
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,851
For crying out loud,
he's probably hungry.

325
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,228
Just take him down to the kitchen
and heat up a bottle.

326
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,647
That's a good plan. Here you go.

327
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,440
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

328
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:54,069
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Phoebe, no, don't...

329
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:57,281
- Damn it.
- Language.

330
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,075
Oh, sure, now you stop fussing.

331
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:01,285
Talk about a natural.

332
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,329
Yes, and I have the stretch marks
to prove it, thank you.

333
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:07,541
- What am I gonna do with Phoebe?
- Worry about it when you get home.

334
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,169
What's the big deal?
She takes a little break from dating.

335
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:13,964
The big deal is, it's not who she is.
The woman is a love machine.

336
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:17,009
And if she gives up on men,
something is very, very wrong.

337
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:20,012
And I know that it's just that
she's lost faith in her premonitions.

338
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:23,098
So making her watch a baby's
gonna make it better?

339
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,393
Look, I'm working with what I've got.

340
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:30,147
Hi. Maybe we should just stay.

341
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,691
For God's sakes.

342
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,569
Here, take this.
Take this, take this, take this.

343
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,571
Stay here.

344
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,081
No, Piper, it's Billie.

345
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,338
No, no, you might blow her up.

346
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,011
Okay, blow her up.

347
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,565
I don't know what happened.

348
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,859
I mean, one second,
she was helping me warm up the milk,

349
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:19,446
and the next she was throwing me
around the room like a rag doll.

350
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,158
What happened?
Another demon attack?

351
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,994
Not another demon. It's Billie.

352
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,455
That's Billie?
What happened to her?

353
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,916
- We don't know.
- Where's Ramon?

354
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,751
He's safe. He's with Leo.

355
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:35,420
Right now, we need to figure out
how to help her.

356
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,172
Before she goes... too.

357
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:39,591
Maybe we should call the Elders.

358
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,636
Maybe you're right.
I'll go do that. Paige...

359
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,346
Yeah, I'm gonna get the baby
out of here.

360
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:47,474
I've got a photo of his dad so it should
take about two secs to scry for him.

361
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:51,603
Phoebe, why don't you stay
with Billie here?

362
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,689
Okay, hurry.

363
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:05,784
- We know why you called.
- Are you spying on us again?

364
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,120
No, but we know
what happened to Billie.

365
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:10,914
What happened to her is happening
all over the magical community.

366
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:12,583
We don't know what's causing it yet.

367
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:16,587
It seems to be some sort of a virus,
and it's spreading fast.

368
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,590
- I don't understand, how is that...?
- Possible?

369
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:24,511
I'm afraid whatever this virus is, Piper,
wherever it came from,

370
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:26,889
it doesn't discriminate
against good or evil.

371
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,183
It can infect all magical creatures.

372
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,767
Even you and your sisters.

373
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:34,563
- So what do we do?
- We have to find a cure, an antidote.

374
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,482
But before we do that,
we have to find the source first.

375
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,903
- How much time does Billie have?
- Not long.

376
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:44,198
Although, we have learned
that the more powerful you are,

377
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,575
the quicker the virus consumes you.

378
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,710
Hi, hey.

379
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:58,837
Paige, what are you doing?
You can't bring him here.

380
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,672
No, no, no, it's okay. I found his dad.

381
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,466
- What?
- Yeah, Ernesto.

382
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:06,011
There, that's got his work number,
his home number,

383
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,721
a place where he likes to go
have a drink.

384
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:10,474
You might wanna talk to him
about that, new dad and all.

385
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:13,602
Wait, wait, wait. I don't understand.
How did you find him?

386
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:15,938
I've been looking for him
everywhere.

387
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,065
- I have my ways.
- Oh, really?

388
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:21,276
- Would you care to elaborate?
- No, not really.

389
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,363
Look, you wanted the baby
to have a chance.

390
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:26,323
And now he has one.

391
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:28,617
I don't know what to say.

392
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:32,746
You don't have to say anything.
My pleasure. Okay, I gotta go.

393
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:34,706
Is everything all right?

394
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,835
No, not really. A friend of mine
is in quite a bit of trouble.

395
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,127
Maybe I can help.

396
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:43,131
That's very sweet of you, but no.

397
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:44,424
Take care of the baby, okay?

398
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:58,605
Piper, something's happening
to Billie.

399
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,363
Oh, no.

400
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,409
"Oh, no"? What does "oh, no" mean?
What did the Elders say?

401
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:12,578
They think it's some kind of virus

402
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,913
and that she must have contracted it
from the scratch.

403
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,040
So the demon gave this to her?

404
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:21,670
If we don't find an antidote soon,
she'll die.

405
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:26,341
Well, no, I mean,
we can't let her die.

406
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:29,219
There's gotta be something we can do.
We can't just do nothing, Piper.

407
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,513
Well, we gotta figure out
where it all started

408
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,640
and who it all started from.

409
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,518
Paige, where are you?

410
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,271
What? What happened?

411
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:41,607
We gotta get to Agent Murphy's.
I'll explain later.

412
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:43,358
Quick, quick, quick.

413
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,743
You can't just...

414
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:55,829
- What the...?
- Locks.

415
00:24:58,207 --> 00:24:59,958
You're not telling us everything,
Agent Murphy,

416
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,335
and we're running out of time.

417
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:05,589
You need to tell us everything
you know about that demon now.

418
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:07,758
But I've told you everything I know.

419
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,927
See, I don't like that answer.

420
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:15,516
Are you out of your mind?
This is a federal office.

421
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:19,311
Listen to me. Whatever you guys did
to that demon created a virus.

422
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:22,439
A virus that can infect
every magical creature there is.

423
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:25,067
If we don't find a cure,
and soon, Billie will die.

424
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,318
Do you remember Billie?

425
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:29,363
Cute, blonde, perky.
Yeah, she's gonna die.

426
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,282
So we would like some answers,
and now.

427
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,117
- Paige.
- Chair.

428
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,123
You're gonna tell us
how this whole thing started.

429
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:43,418
Or the next thing
I'm gonna blow up will be you.

430
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:58,475
Did some digging after you left.

431
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:01,103
Look, all right.

432
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,272
If I would have known,
I would have told you,

433
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:06,149
but I wasn't cleared
for all the details.

434
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,653
They found the demon
in the desert?

435
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,530
Yeah, but it was a fluke,
and he was injured.

436
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,949
That's the only way the task force
was able to capture it.

437
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:17,327
The government just wanted
to study it, you know, learn from it.

438
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:21,540
I keep seeing the word "injected. "
What did they inject him with?

439
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,292
Human blood.

440
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,127
They were trying to find a way
to combine it

441
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:27,171
with the demon's blood
to extract its powers.

442
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:28,672
Powers, why?

443
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,216
To inject the serum back
into people.

444
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,636
Soldiers.

445
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:37,890
- To make them more powerful.
- But it didn't work.

446
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:40,434
When the test subject didn't react,
the project was shut down.

447
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:43,562
Apparently, when they were deciding
what to do with the demon,

448
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:45,397
that's when he escaped
from containment.

449
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:48,400
So now he's out there spreading
the virus that you guys created.

450
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,819
You said the test subject
didn't show any side effects?

451
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:53,155
- No, none.
- Where are you going with this?

452
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:55,282
I'm thinking the test subject's blood

453
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,409
probably holds the antidote
we're looking for.

454
00:26:57,576 --> 00:27:02,748
If he was immune to its effects,
where can we find him?

455
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:06,084
I don't know, I mean, he was
only referred to here as Patient X.

456
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:08,003
Like I said,
when the experiment was shut down,

457
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,505
all his records were destroyed.

458
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,007
There has to be something
that we can use to find him.

459
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:18,096
Well, the only thing I can think of
is this ID tag we got here.

460
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:20,933
But I already scanned the bar code,

461
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,352
and all the information's
already been erased.

462
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:25,562
He could be anywhere.

463
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,119
Thanks.

464
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:45,916
Wow, I must be pretty bad off
if you're waiting on me hand and foot.

465
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:49,461
Well, don't get used to it
because you're gonna be just fine.

466
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:51,755
Am I?

467
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,259
I'm dying, aren't I?

468
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,304
No, you are not dying.

469
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:01,640
Listen, do you have any idea

470
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:05,269
how many times I have almost died
in the last seven years?

471
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,439
Yeah, but this is different.

472
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:12,609
I'm sorry.
I should have listened to you.

473
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,319
Stop it. It's okay.

474
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:16,655
We're gonna save you,

475
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:19,116
and we're gonna save magic
while we're at it.

476
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:20,534
How can you save magic

477
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:23,954
if you don't even believe
in your own anymore?

478
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,624
I heard you talking to Piper.

479
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,840
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna get you some more ice.

480
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,873
- How's Billie?
- Not good. What'd you guys find out?

481
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,458
It was a government
secret experiment.

482
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,043
They mixed things
they shouldn't have.

483
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,128
Basically, their demon

484
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:15,380
was the "Outbreak" monkey
that caused all of this.

485
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:18,217
Okay, so if they made it,
then they must have a cure, right?

486
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:21,053
Well, they don't even know
how they created it.

487
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,554
Yeah, you don't know that for sure.

488
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:25,224
I mean, for all we know
this could have been their intention.

489
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,101
Phoebe, it's not a conspiracy.
They just screwed up.

490
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:31,355
We had a shot at an antidote,
and they screwed that up too.

491
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:32,564
What shot?

492
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:34,566
They injected somebody
with Krychek's blood

493
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:36,026
and it had no effect.

494
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:38,862
Okay, then maybe the cure
is in the blood, right?

495
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,992
Okay, look, this is all we've got.

496
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,495
And what we don't have,
is enough time.

497
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:48,372
We've gotta find this Patient X,

498
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,165
convince him to give us
some of his blood

499
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:51,708
so that we can make an antidote.

500
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,585
Fix us, and then fix Billie.

501
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:56,255
Even if we pool all
of our powers together,

502
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:58,382
we may not have enough time.

503
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:01,426
Then let's get stronger.

504
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,346
Let's get Billie to infect us.

505
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:07,933
What? Are you nuts?
Phoebe, we could die.

506
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,518
Not if we find the antidote first.

507
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:13,021
Still, there's no guarantee
it's gonna work. It's very risky.

508
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:17,901
Yeah, tell that to Billie.

509
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,320
Look, I don't see the point
of having powers

510
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:24,283
if we can't use them
to save someone that we care about.

511
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:34,793
Billie.

512
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,047
Billie, wake up.

513
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:41,925
Billie, wake up.

514
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:47,764
I think we figured out a way
to save you.

515
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,266
But we're gonna need your help.

516
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:55,147
- Wait, no, no, no.
- It's okay. Trust us.

517
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:01,612
- Should we tell Leo?
- No, I know what he's gonna say.

518
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,949
Come on.

519
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:08,827
Oh, come on, it won't hurt much.

520
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:28,263
- How long is that gonna last?
- Hopefully, long enough.

521
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:35,687
I haven't found an antidote yet.

522
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,981
That's okay. I think we have.

523
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:46,615
- Holy crap.
- Language.

524
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:57,709
- Leave Leo alone.
- He's my husband.

525
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:01,713
- What did you do that for?
- I just felt like it.

526
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:06,718
All right, stop it, you guys
are gonna kill each other.

527
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,513
How did this happen?

528
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,764
We made it happen.

529
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:14,101
All right, we have work to do.

530
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:49,761
Oh, my God.

531
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:53,932
- Duck.
- Duck?

532
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,642
Get down.

533
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:57,603
Fireball.

534
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:32,054
What do you want from me?

535
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:34,056
We want you to save magic.

536
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:36,725
- And us.
- Yeah.

537
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:59,081
Easy, easy, slow.

538
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:02,793
- What happened?
- CliffsNotes version:

539
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,337
We hulked out, kicked ass
and saved the world.

540
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:08,131
You know,
just another day at the office.

541
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,676
Yeah, I can see that.

542
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:13,887
We got the antidote to the Elders,

543
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:16,598
and everyone is being cured
right now as we speak.

544
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:19,268
- What about the demons?
- They got to the antidote too.

545
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,563
You guys risked yourselves
to save me.

546
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:27,943
Well, we gotta keep you around
so you can find your sister, right?

547
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,947
- I don't know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything.

548
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:35,159
We think of you
as part of the family now.

549
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:37,035
We're not gonna let anything
happen to you.

550
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:46,628
Hey, sunshine, it's good to see
some colour in your cheeks.

551
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:49,590
Yeah, grey and pasty,
not your colour scheme.

552
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:50,799
How'd it go with Murphy?

553
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:54,094
Oh, well, he decided we were
a little too difficult to work with.

554
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:57,556
So I don't think we'll be hearing
from him again anytime soon.

555
00:34:57,723 --> 00:34:59,141
How rude.

556
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:03,228
Well, if you guys will excuse me,
I'm gonna go check on little Ramon.

557
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:06,732
- Don't you mean Henry?
- No, I mean Ramon.

558
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:08,400
- Kiss him for me.
- Henry?

559
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:11,236
No, Ramon.

560
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:14,573
Okay.

561
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:20,954
He got to you, didn't he? The baby.

562
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:26,585
All right, don't you have some kind
of ski trip to get ready for?

563
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:29,171
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

564
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,516
Why didn't Tina tell me
we had a kid?

565
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:42,476
Look, Tina's a little messed up
right now, okay?

566
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:44,853
That's why she's back in prison.
She didn't make it.

567
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,439
But you did.
Now your son Ramon needs you.

568
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,025
I don't know if I can do this, man.

569
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:51,276
I know you can, Ernesto.

570
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,782
Don't you think he'd be better off
with somebody else?

571
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:58,450
He doesn't have anybody else.

572
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:01,453
It's you or the state, buddy.
Ernesto, look at me.

573
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,248
Too many sons, they grow up
without their dads.

574
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,917
That's how you got
where you were a while back, right?

575
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:08,794
Now you got a chance
to break that cycle.

576
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:11,630
Do right by him and by you.

577
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:15,968
How do I hold him?

578
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:18,804
I don't know, man, you just do.

579
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:20,806
Cradle his head there.

580
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:22,683
- You got him?
- Yeah.

581
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:31,733
- Kind of looks like me, don't he?
- Yeah, he does.

582
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,279
And I got you some diapers and stuff
just to get you started, you know?

583
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:38,031
You gotta heat up the milk too though,
right? But not too hot.

584
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:40,868
Call the lady at social services,
if you have any questions.

585
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,037
Here you go. You got it?
There we go.

586
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,290
And I'll come by later.
I'll check up on you.

587
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:48,417
Okay. Thanks, Henry.

588
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:51,753
Don't thank me. You can thank
the lady who found you.

589
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,672
- What lady?
- Paige Matthews.

590
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,967
Beautiful lady, great smile,
a little wacky.

591
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,554
- She didn't find you?
- No.

592
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:04,683
All right, man. Get out of here, Dad.

593
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:09,062
- Take care of your son.
- Okay.

594
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:20,199
So, what happened to the big lug
who didn't know a thing about babies?

595
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:22,242
Oh, I guess I'm a quick study.

596
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:25,746
Sure it wasn't just an excuse
to talk to me again?

597
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:28,707
I guess you're gonna have
your secrets, so I'll have mine.

598
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,376
Fair enough.

599
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:33,587
So I've got a great smile?

600
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:36,256
Yeah, you do.

601
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:56,735
- Mommy, mommy.
- Oh, hi.

602
00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:59,446
- Did you have a good day at school?
- Yeah.

603
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,406
Do you have homework?

604
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:18,257
I knew you'd come here
sooner or later.

605
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:19,758
Really? How's that?

606
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:23,595
Well, because six years ago,
I was you standing there talking to me.

607
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:30,185
Wait, so if you are me,
then who were you talking to?

608
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:33,146
Don't try to figure it out.
It'll hurt our head.

609
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:34,857
Our head?

610
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:37,359
The important thing is,
is that you're here now.

611
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,611
For a reason and to find answers.

612
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:42,030
Okay, you know what?
Don't get all cryptic with me, please.

613
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:43,824
Not after the day I've had today.

614
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:46,493
Oh, I remember the day you had.

615
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,163
It's the day you lost faith
in your premonitions

616
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,916
because of all you've been through,
and all your disappointments.

617
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,877
You were promised something,

618
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:57,504
something that means
the world to you.

619
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:59,256
And you're afraid
you might not get it.

620
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,885
Will I?

621
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:06,305
I'm living proof of that.

622
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,140
And so is she.

623
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:24,072
Piper, please.

624
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,868
Oh, come on,
what's one more pair of shoes?

625
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:38,086
Are you all right?

626
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:40,005
Yeah.

627
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:42,382
Never better.
