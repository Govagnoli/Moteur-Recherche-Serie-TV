1
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:03,420
- Okay, sign there.
- All right.

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:04,796
And there.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,341
And give me your John Hancock
right there.

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:08,592
And you are done.

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,638
- All right. What about the Smith case?
- Settled.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,766
- The amendments to my living trust?
- Filed.

7
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,393
Did you take care
of my donation to the...?

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,230
Children's Foundation. Got it.
It's going through in the morning,

9
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,316
and, may I say,
that is a very generous donation.

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,652
Yeah, well, it was the least I could do.
Believe me.

11
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,613
I couldn't have gotten through
all this without you, Paige.

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,490
You have been a miracle worker.

13
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,034
Thank you. You should have seen me
at my other temp jobs

14
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,911
if you wanna see miracles.

15
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:42,751
This is for you.
It's just my way of saying thank you.

16
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,962
- I really can't...
- Just take it.

17
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,297
I know a good soul
when I see one.

18
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,508
Thank you.

19
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:54,930
So you better go. I'm sure
your family would never forgive me

20
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:58,308
- if I kept you here past midnight.
- Okay.

21
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,352
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

22
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,236
I wouldn't count on it.

23
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,637
No, no, no!

24
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,472
Behind you, Paige!

25
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,229
No, Paige!

26
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,862
- Larry?
- Forget it, witch! You lost him.

27
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:45,267
- Let's try just a little bit. It's good stuff.
- Good morning!

28
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,395
So how was your date?

29
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,189
Don't ask.

30
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,983
You need a hand?

31
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,194
Sure, if you want to go
get my car washed,

32
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,779
go to the dry cleaners for me
and go to work for me too.

33
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:01,116
- That would be great!
- Sure, if you run the club for me,

34
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,452
go to the dentist
and raise Wyatt for me.

35
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,954
Today, I would trade with you
in a second.

36
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:10,626
Do you remember Spencer Ricks,
that slimy advice columnist?

37
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,462
- The one you turned into a turkey?
- Yeah, well,

38
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,047
I should have kept him that way.

39
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:21,011
Elise just hired him away
from the competition to work with me.

40
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,640
- Look how handsome he looks.
- Why would she do that?

41
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,977
I don't know. I guess to promote
his hiring, she wants us to pick a letter

42
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,773
and each give advice on it. So,
you know, one, sensitive and caring

43
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,776
- and the other one, chauvinistic and...
- Slimy?

44
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,947
Thank you. I have half a mind
to call Jason and complain about it,

45
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,366
but I don't wanna use
our relationship for leverage.

46
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,244
What's the use of sleeping
with your boss, then?

47
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,329
Because I actually enjoy
sleeping with my boss.

48
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,580
Yeah, don't brag.

49
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,751
- Not getting any is making you bitter.
- Hello. Hi. Excuse me.

50
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,878
Oh, he doesn't know
what we're talking about.

51
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:58,131
He's 10 months old. He thinks we're
talking about milk, for God's sakes.

52
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,758
Phoebe, he conjured a dragon.

53
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,177
- I wouldn't put anything past him.
- Good point.

54
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,013
Now, if he could only find a way
to keep guys from bolting

55
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,599
every time they lay eyes on him...

56
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,768
It's not easy dating
as a single mom.

57
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,145
There's gotta be lots of guys
out there that like kids.

58
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,859
Yeah, I haven't met any so far.
So I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

59
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,737
I've got three dates lined up. They're all
gonna meet Wyatt on the first date,

60
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,531
and if they don't like it, tough.

61
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,533
You could always turn them
into a turkey.

62
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,038
Where you been?

63
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,916
Paige?

64
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:37,546
Paige, what happened?
What's the matter?

65
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,798
What time is it?

66
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,135
Eight. Were you out all night?

67
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,637
- Yeah, I guess I was.
- Come here, mister.

68
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,893
- You hang on right there.
- Okay. Sit down here for a second.

69
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,896
Talk to us.

70
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,192
I lost an innocent last night.
A demon killed him right in front of me.

71
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,611
- Oh, God.
- At your temp job?

72
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,655
Yeah. I should have seen it coming.

73
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,783
Every other job,
someone's wound up needing my help.

74
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,662
- I just don't know why I didn't see it.
- Well, maybe you weren't meant to.

75
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,540
No, I was. I just... I didn't.

76
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,628
Even worse, when I tried to save him,
he wound up saving me.

77
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,882
I just wish I knew
what was going on.

78
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,842
Why they were after Larry
in the first place

79
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,761
and how he knew
they were coming for him.

80
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,263
- What do you mean, he knew?
- He just did.

81
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,432
He was finalising his will,

82
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,645
making donations,
tried to get me out of there.

83
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,439
- He knew.
- How could he have known?

84
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,734
I don't know,
unless maybe he wasn't so innocent.

85
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,237
Which is probably why
you weren't meant to save him.

86
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,114
No, I don't believe that.

87
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,159
Look, Paige,
even if he was an innocent,

88
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,870
you can't save everybody.
I mean, that's just the lesson

89
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,164
we've all had to learn, unfortunately.

90
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,666
I know.

91
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,544
Paige, you can't blame yourself
for what happened.

92
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,589
If you were meant to save him,
you would've. You have to believe that.

93
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,760
I can't.

94
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,041
Leo. What are you doing here?

95
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,503
- Get off of me!
- Are you following me again?

96
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,338
I thought we were past
these issues.

97
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,383
- What is that?
- That? Nothing.

98
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,843
No?

99
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,639
What the hell?

100
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,893
Long story.

101
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,563
What is that, a time portal? Is that it?
What are you using it for?

102
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,024
- I don't have to answer that.
- Thought you said

103
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,526
- you had nothing to hide?
- I don't have to answer that.

104
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,904
- Wanna bet?
- No.

105
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,553
- Where are we?
- How the hell should I know?

106
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,056
That's what I was trying to tell you.
I can't control it.

107
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,724
Yeah.

108
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,281
- So if there's anything that I can do...
- Thank you.

109
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,992
I just can't believe that he's gone.

110
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,702
I know.

111
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,705
I'm grateful that he was not alone
when it happened.

112
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:03,460
I know that he didn't know you long,
but I'm glad you were with him.

113
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,963
I just wish I'd gotten there sooner.

114
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,841
Well, there's nothing
you could have done.

115
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,427
He had a heart attack.
It was his time, I guess.

116
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:15,764
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.

117
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,977
I just...
I mean that he was so young.

118
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,563
And from everything
that people have said,

119
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,024
he was just this great guy,
you know?

120
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:30,445
- It just doesn't seem fair.
- No, it doesn't, does it?

121
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:36,201
Listen, Mrs. Henderson,
I feel weird asking you this,

122
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,997
but was he acting
any differently before?

123
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,791
I'm sorry, I have to go now.

124
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,211
But if there is anything you need,
just call me.

125
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,131
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

126
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,511
I don't mean to be taking up
all of your time.

127
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,096
No, wait, please.

128
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,099
What made you ask that?

129
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:05,063
It's just some of the things that
he asked me to do for him before...

130
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:09,359
It's just almost as if he knew
something was gonna happen.

131
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,822
Actually, he knew about a lot of things
before they would happen.

132
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,867
In fact, sometimes I almost thought
that he was clairvoyant.

133
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,537
- Really?
- I mean, at least in business anyway.

134
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,374
Up until a couple of years ago,
we had nothing.

135
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,085
Flat broke, going nowhere.

136
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:31,006
- And then, just all of a sudden...
- All of a sudden?

137
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,550
I don't know, it was like
he won the lottery or something.

138
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,889
Suddenly he couldn't lose.
Every deal he made was golden.

139
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,267
And at first he was happy,
of course,

140
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,019
but then he wasn't.

141
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:50,192
And whenever I would ask him
how he did it or how he knew,

142
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:55,405
he would just say that he could sense,
you know, what was about to happen.

143
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,660
What could that possibly mean?

144
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,997
Excuse me.
His brother's on the phone.

145
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,999
Excuse me.

146
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,046
Hi, Paige.

147
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,340
Richard.

148
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,009
Last time I saw you,
you were kind of saving my life.

149
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,387
How are you?

150
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,726
As I live and breathe. Feeble.

151
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,355
Where you been?
What, are you keeping bankers' hours?

152
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,609
Turkey. Okay, first of all,
get your feet off my desk.

153
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,070
And secondly, get out of my chair.

154
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,866
And here I thought
we were gonna be friends.

155
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,534
Now!

156
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:46,415
All right, all right.
Jeez, keep your panties on.

157
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,630
Nice.

158
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,383
Okay, let's get a couple
of things straight here.

159
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,385
I didn't ask for this
and I don't like it.

160
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:01,054
- So don't push it, or else...
- Or else what?

161
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,057
You know what?
Let's just pick a letter.

162
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,269
Well, let's start with there is nothing
good in this pile of drivel.

163
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:10,272
I mean, there's some lady
who wants to break up with a loser,

164
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,400
another who wants
to be closer to Mommy.

165
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,278
And this one,
she's worried about losing her virginity.

166
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,947
It's like a freaking PMS convention.

167
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,574
Let me ask you a question.

168
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:26,371
Do you ever get letters from anybody
other than a bunch of whiny chicks?

169
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,472
As you were saying?

170
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,144
Piper.

171
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,563
Ryan, hi.
Good, you got my message.

172
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,483
Yeah, my secretary caught me
before I left.

173
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,194
I thought we were gonna meet
at the restaurant.

174
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,073
- Yeah, sorry. Something came up.
- Is everything okay?

175
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,491
Yeah, everything's fine.

176
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,411
It's just that my babysitter cancelled
at the last minute.

177
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,497
Babysitter?

178
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,874
You have a baby?

179
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,379
What do you think?

180
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,382
I think...

181
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,509
...he's adorable.

182
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,469
- You do?
- Absolutely.

183
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,972
- What's his name?
- Wyatt.

184
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,808
So you're okay with this?
You still wanna go out?

185
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,893
What, are you kidding?
I love babies.

186
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,312
Although, I think we should go
to Chuck E. Cheese now.

187
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,524
- You mind?
- No. I'll just grab my purse.

188
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,110
Sure. Hey.

189
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,571
Hey there, big fella!

190
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,991
You wanna go with Mommy and me
to lunch, huh?

191
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,831
Oh, my...

192
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,669
We should probably take separate cars
because of the baby seat.

193
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,425
Hi. What are you doing?

194
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,515
Well, fine.

195
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,855
Actually, I'm all by myself
in the house now.

196
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:18,650
My mom moved out,
Eve's family followed.

197
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,945
It's weird to think the only thing
holding us together was a feud.

198
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:27,826
- Makes me sorry I helped end it.
- Don't be. It's an amazing freedom.

199
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,332
You're really beating
yourself up, huh?

200
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:34,583
Yeah, I guess I am.

201
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,002
You know, I think I was put
in Larry's life for a reason

202
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,838
and it probably wasn't
just to watch him die.

203
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,382
You really believe in that stuff,
don't you?

204
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,844
- What?
- Fate. Destiny.

205
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,596
Yeah, don't you?

206
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,765
I didn't. Not until I met you.

207
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:55,604
With all the magical wars in my family,
if there's some kind of grand plan,

208
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:56,813
it sucks.

209
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,485
What are you smiling at?

210
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:06,240
Nothing, it's just kind of nice to talk to
someone about all this magic-y stuff.

211
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,659
I mean, other than my sisters,
of course.

212
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,203
What do they think
you should do about Larry?

213
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,830
Basically, just let it go.

214
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:18,168
Well, if you'd have let it go with me,
I probably wouldn't be alive right now.

215
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,672
Still, I wouldn't even know
where to start.

216
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,091
Start with Larry.

217
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,679
Wouldn't be the first ghost
you've summoned.

218
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,894
The cream of the crop,
ladies and demons.

219
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:39,398
The best souls you'll find up for auction
anywhere in the underworld.

220
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:42,025
Guaranteed, or your powers back.

221
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,694
Straighten up!

222
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:47,489
Take for example,
Larry Henderson here.

223
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:51,326
Now, I'll spare you the pitiful details
of his life and only say,

224
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,454
that thanks to me, he became
one of the most prominent lawyers

225
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:59,168
in San Francisco.
Friends, don't let this one get away.

226
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:03,297
He's a true prize for any soul collector,
eater or trader.

227
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,842
So, what say we start the bidding
at two powers?

228
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,891
- Find him!
- Yes, sir.

229
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,691
- Welcome back, Larry.
- What?

230
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:37,789
Okay, you've gotta send me back
before Zahn gets pissed.

231
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,958
Zahn. Is that the demon that?

232
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:43,712
Killed me? Yeah.
For all intents and purposes, yes.

233
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,423
- Reverse the spell, come on.
- I can't. Not till we figure out

234
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,717
- what's going on.
- Paige, I'm begging you.

235
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,637
Larry, give it up.
She's stubborn when she wants to be.

236
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,973
Trust me.

237
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,768
- Do I know you?
- No.

238
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,354
You know my family.
You did some accounting for us.

239
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,523
And exactly how are you
involved with this?

240
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,859
Just fate.

241
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,862
Great, fate.
Well, you wanna talk about fate?

242
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,990
If I don't live up to my end of the deal,
my wife's fate is screwed too.

243
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,159
And I'm not gonna let that happen.
Now, come on!

244
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,328
What, did you make
some sort of Faustian deal?

245
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,998
Yeah.

246
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,876
Yeah, I did.

247
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,838
Look, I'm not proud of it. All right?

248
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:30,801
But Zahn came to me five years ago,
when I was down and hurting.

249
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:34,054
And he promised to pull me out of it
in exchange for my...

250
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,307
For my soul.

251
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,186
And last night,
payment became due in full.

252
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,188
So that's how
you built up your firm?

253
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,235
Among other things.

254
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:52,447
But then, when I realised
how Zahn was making me rich

255
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:56,702
off of other people's pain
and freak accidents,

256
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:59,037
I tried to stop it.
I tried to break the deal,

257
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:02,249
but when I realised I couldn't,
I tried to make amends

258
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:06,295
and I tried to give away everything
before it was too late.

259
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,718
Paige?

260
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,971
Oh, hey, you remember Richard.

261
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,764
- Hi.
- Hi.

262
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,225
- What's going on?
- Oh, you know,

263
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:23,103
just summoning a ghost.

264
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,780
- Okay, okay.
- What was I supposed to do?

265
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,033
Just let him rot in hell
or wherever he was?

266
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,827
That's the thing. You don't know
where you summoned him from.

267
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:42,331
How do you know that demons in the
underworld aren't out looking for him?

268
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:46,376
- All the more reason to save him.
- Save him? He's dead.

269
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,504
No, he hasn't moved on yet,

270
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,340
which means I have a chance
to save his soul before Zahn gets it.

271
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,218
- And who is Zahn?
- The demon he made a deal with.

272
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:57,888
No, that's not what I mean.
What is his level, what are his powers?

273
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,682
I don't know,
I haven't checked the Book yet.

274
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,143
So you have no idea
what you're up against?

275
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,437
No. But does it really matter?

276
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:09,608
Paige, look,
I know this search is important to you

277
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,652
and you need to maintain
a separate identity,

278
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,488
but you can't keep
going off on your own.

279
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,323
It's not how we work.

280
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,117
Well, if I hadn't,
Larry's soul could've been lost by now.

281
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:23,372
- He sold his soul. It was his choice.
- Well, so he makes a mistake in life.

282
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,874
Does that mean he has to pay for it
in his afterlife too?

283
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,877
Yeah, maybe,
because actions have consequences.

284
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,463
We can't go around cleaning up
after everybody's mistakes.

285
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,006
Especially mistakes like this.

286
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,050
So, what, do you want me
to just send him back?

287
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,553
I think that if you bring danger
into this house,

288
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,805
you need to talk to us
about it beforehand.

289
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:43,475
I did, but you weren't supportive.
Unlike Richard, who actually was.

290
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,103
What does Richard
have to do with this?

291
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,772
- You barely even know him.
- Maybe.

292
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,607
But he seems to get me
more than you.

293
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,993
Hey, listen,
thanks so much for your help,

294
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,705
but I think maybe you better go.

295
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:10,711
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, but I'll call you later.

296
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,754
Okay.

297
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,675
And you. Come with me.

298
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:20,762
- What...? Where are we going?
- We are going to save your soul.

299
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,197
Come on!

300
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,559
I don't understand.
Why can't we orb?

301
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,271
Prehistoric. Magic won't be around
till there's people around to use it.

302
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:15,317
Perfect. We'll just hang out for the next
million years or so? No problem.

303
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:18,612
More like 65 million.
Looks like the Cretaceous Period.

304
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,739
Man, you are old.

305
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,370
I think he's gone. He looks gone.
Do you think he's gone?

306
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:28,997
- No.
- Neither do I.

307
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,214
The sooner we get back to our time,
the less we'll have to worry about it.

308
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:40,926
- Yeah, that's gonna be a problem.
- What do you mean?

309
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,137
I mean, you just don't create
time portals out of thin air.

310
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,514
It's not like that.

311
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:49,059
Well, you coming back from the future
originally seemed like exact science.

312
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,395
That was a spell, all right?
A one-way door.

313
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:53,480
It only goes backward in time,
not forward.

314
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:57,317
So, what, you're creating portals
to get back to the future, is that it?

315
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,778
Why?

316
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,823
To see if it changed, okay?

317
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,534
To see if I stopped the demon
who was after Wyatt.

318
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,329
What, you still don't believe me?

319
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:12,791
All I care about right now
is getting back home.

320
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,713
Well, all you gotta do is find the portal
that dumped us here. Good luck.

321
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,465
- Watch out for the dinosaurs.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

322
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:21,925
Get rid of me once and for all?

323
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:25,512
You were the one who sent us back
to Jurassic Park, all right? Not me.

324
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,890
Wouldn't be the first time
you tried to get rid of me.

325
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,225
Think what you want,

326
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,603
but know this, if we don't get back,
Wyatt's screwed.

327
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,522
If you don't believe me, believe that.

328
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:40,944
- Have you tried calling for Leo?
- Yeah, he's not answering either.

329
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:44,198
He's probably out chasing after Chris,
and God only knows where that is.

330
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,326
We'll have to talk to them. They're
never around when we need them.

331
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:50,162
Yeah, I think we need to talk
to Paige first.

332
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,582
Because this little power-of-one kick
of hers is getting out of control.

333
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,335
Yeah, but didn't we promise her
we wouldn't butt in it anymore?

334
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,129
Yeah, but that was when
she was just helping Richard.

335
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:03,217
She wasn't yanking souls away
from angry demons.

336
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:06,261
Look, I'm not saying
that we need to gang up on her,

337
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,348
but this is clearly becoming a pattern
and we need to remind her

338
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,892
that we have a shared destiny
to worry about too.

339
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,727
Okay. I'll be right there.

340
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,646
Okay, bye.

341
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:20,150
All right, let's get this over with.
What do you think?

342
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:23,362
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where are you going, toots?

343
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,740
- Home, if you must know.
- Home? Are you nuts?

344
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:28,283
We got a column we gotta write.

345
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,080
And I have just found
the perfect letter for us to respond to.

346
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:38,043
"Dear Pheeb, I am a breast man at
heart, but the problem is, this girl I like

347
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,423
is flat as a board.
Should I even bother asking her out?"

348
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:47,386
Now, this is a letter I can respond to.

349
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:52,933
Must have been the wrong potion.

350
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:58,063
Excuse me. This way, please,
this way. Inside, inside.

351
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,149
- Brett, hi.
- Piper.

352
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:03,068
I didn't think you were...

353
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:05,737
...home.
- Oh, sorry it took me so long.

354
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:09,158
- I had to go get my baby.
- Your baby?

355
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:12,286
I actually didn't realise you were a...

356
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:15,122
- A mom?
- Right, that.

357
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,457
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, you know,

358
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:20,711
some guys
just don't hear that very well.

359
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:23,088
Go figure, right?

360
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:28,719
Well, I don't mean to be rude,
but something's come up

361
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:30,804
and I can't go out right now.

362
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,932
So if you don't wanna reschedule,
it's perfectly understandable.

363
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,475
Why wouldn't I?

364
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,853
Unless you got ten more
of those somewhere.

365
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:41,315
- No, just the one.
- Not a problem.

366
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,318
Did I pass the test?

367
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:45,777
With flying colours.

368
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:49,781
Paige?

369
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:58,248
I better...

370
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,667
...go.

371
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,845
You know, ordinarily I'd be upset

372
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:14,890
if you summoned me, but seeing as
how you just helped me find Larry,

373
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:17,267
- I'll be merciful.
- No, don't hurt her, Zahn, please.

374
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:19,186
She didn't know.
She was trying to help me.

375
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:20,521
Help? Really?

376
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:23,398
What, you thought vanquishing me
would set him free?

377
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,400
- Is that it?
- As a matter of fact...

378
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,865
- You were saying?
- You're a low-level demon.

379
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,284
- You're not supposed to have power.
- Lady,

380
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:36,245
I haven't been low-level in years.

381
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:42,167
Not since I started trading
souls for powers. Wanna see?

382
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:45,712
Paige?

383
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:49,174
Piper!

384
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,052
And just for future reference,

385
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:55,055
even if you could vanquish me,
it would only make it worse for Larry.

386
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:57,766
Paragraph five,
subsection six, line three:

387
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,435
All souls in my possession
will burn in eternal flames

388
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,772
upon my untimely demise.
Believe me.

389
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,984
It's a fate worse than anything
that could possibly happen at auction.

390
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:11,280
A little protection clause
I put in all my contracts.

391
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:18,412
Consider yourself repossessed.

392
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:31,175
This would all be so much easier
if someone that could heal you

393
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,010
was actually listening!

394
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:35,095
It's no big deal, I've had worse.

395
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:38,640
Still, those two need a talking-to,
I'll tell you.

396
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:41,935
I don't understand this. Faustian deals
have been around for over a century,

397
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:45,230
but there is nothing in here on how
to break them. How is that possible?

398
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,232
Maybe because
they can't be broken.

399
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:51,320
It can't be. There's gotta be a way.
I am not giving up on Larry now.

400
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:55,199
Listen, sweetie, maybe you should.

401
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:58,494
- I know you feel guilty about it...
- That's not it.

402
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:01,788
It's affecting all of us now,
not just you.

403
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,500
- I said I was sorry.
- That's not the point.

404
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,378
Listen, I just want to save his soul.

405
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:10,047
But you can't!

406
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:13,717
Larry said that Zahn keeps
his contracts locked up somewhere.

407
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:17,262
So if we can find and destroy them,
then we can set all those souls free.

408
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:18,764
I don't think so.

409
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:21,391
- Why not?
- We think we should go after Zahn.

410
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:23,560
Stop him before he gets
any more powers.

411
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,687
What, and just
let all those souls burn?

412
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:28,357
They're already lost, Paige.
He's already got them.

413
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:33,195
I think it's important that you stop him
before he becomes unstoppable.

414
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:35,113
No!

415
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,741
Paige, we don't like this
any more than you do,

416
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:39,451
but this is where we're at.

417
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,286
He's my innocent.

418
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:44,790
Yeah, but this is our problem
and one we did not ask for, by the way.

419
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,292
No, I'm not sacrificing him.

420
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,382
You don't have a choice.

421
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:57,219
This is beyond your control.
I'm sorry.

422
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:19,283
- Hey, Paige.
- Hey, your housekeeper let me in.

423
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:21,326
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, it's fine.

424
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,959
You okay? Everything all right?

425
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:31,628
No.

426
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:37,092
- This looks familiar, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

427
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:40,762
Maybe we should split up,
find the portal faster.

428
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:45,976
Wait.

429
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:49,980
If one of us gets caught, the other one
needs to keep going. For Wyatt's sake.

430
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:51,940
Oh, you believe me
about him now?

431
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:55,319
No, I just wanna let you know what's
gonna happen if you get caught.

432
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:05,579
Found it!

433
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:09,666
Leo!

434
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:21,762
Come on, come on. Go. Go. Go!

435
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,735
- You okay?
- Yeah.

436
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:38,779
Thanks for not listening to me.

437
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:40,697
Anytime.

438
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:51,416
You boys Yankees?

439
00:29:58,507 --> 00:29:59,550
Get up.

440
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:06,682
- Here.
- Thank you.

441
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:12,354
So, what are you gonna do?

442
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:17,943
Well, I got a plan on how to save Larry,
but it's kind of risky.

443
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,736
Maybe you shouldn't
go through with it.

444
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:22,030
I mean,
maybe your sisters are right.

445
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,241
You're the one who told me
to follow my instincts.

446
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:27,703
I know, I just...
I don't want you to get hurt.

447
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:31,456
Listen, I'm gonna need your help
to pull this off.

448
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:36,253
- Paige, if I do magic...
- No.

449
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,714
No. I am not asking you to do that.

450
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:42,050
I'm just gonna need you
to get my sisters when it's time.

451
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:45,512
I need their help, but they can't know
about it until it's too late to stop me.

452
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,722
Won't they get pissed?

453
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,350
Yeah, probably.

454
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,853
Guess I'm pretty stubborn, huh?

455
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:56,732
Yeah. In a good way.

456
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:58,817
Paige...

457
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:01,320
...you have a gift.

458
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:02,529
Don't fight it.

459
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:05,282
Thank you.

460
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:08,994
Got any candles?

461
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:15,959
How do we know she's not gonna
just summon him herself again?

462
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:17,461
Who, Zahn?

463
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:19,755
She won't try that again,
not without a potion.

464
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:22,508
What about Richard?
He can make potions.

465
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,426
Isn't he on the witch wagon, though?

466
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,887
I'm just saying,
I wouldn't put it past her.

467
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,097
I can't believe
it's even gotten to this point.

468
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:32,518
- It'll work itself out. It always does.
- I don't know about that.

469
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:34,436
I mean, we've all disagreed
with each other

470
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:37,439
at one point or another
over the years, obviously,

471
00:31:37,606 --> 00:31:40,234
- but this is different.
- So maybe we should call her again

472
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,443
and talk to her about it.

473
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,488
Or we can just summon Zahn
and vanquish him quickly

474
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:47,282
before she gets
her pigheaded self killed.

475
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:48,492
Oh, no, pig.

476
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,955
I'll take care of it. Don't even ask.

477
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:56,542
Okay, we give him one chance
at giving up Larry's soul and that's it.

478
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,335
Okay.

479
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,635
We call upon the ancient powers
To summon one to save his soul

480
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:15,018
You will be first up for auction.
Again.

481
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:20,566
All right, my fellow demons,
let's start the bidding, shall we?

482
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:23,569
Oh, great. Not again.

483
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:37,749
- What happened?
- Where did he go?

484
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:42,963
You again.

485
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,382
- This time, it's gonna cost you.
- Wait.

486
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,427
I'm gonna make you an offer
you can't refuse.

487
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:54,266
I think you'll find
that everything's in order.

488
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:56,185
You don't mind if I look it over first?

489
00:32:56,351 --> 00:33:00,147
Suit yourself,
but it's exactly as we discussed.

490
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:02,691
You'll notice the same clause
I mentioned earlier.

491
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:04,610
To protect me from your sisters,
of course.

492
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:07,654
- You won't have to worry about them.
- Good.

493
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:11,742
- Just sign on the dotted line.
- First Larry.

494
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:23,337
- Paige, what are you doing?
- Exactly what I said I'd do.

495
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:25,214
Saving you.

496
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:29,009
No, Paige, don't!

497
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,141
Have a nice afterlife.

498
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:57,246
You must really be a good soul
to do what you've just done.

499
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,185
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

500
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:32,406
- Did she answer?
- It's just her voice mail. Scrying?

501
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:35,659
Nothing. I can't find her anywhere.

502
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:37,744
You don't think Zahn?

503
00:34:37,953 --> 00:34:40,664
I don't know, but if he didn't, I will.
What was she thinking?

504
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:41,999
Chris! Leo!

505
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:46,503
- Where are those guys?
- Forget it, they're not answering.

506
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:47,754
What are we gonna do?

507
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:55,721
- Richard. Hi.
- Hi.

508
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,514
- You seen Paige?
- That's why I'm here.

509
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,433
Okay, inside, inside.

510
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,518
- Where is she? She all right?
- I don't know.

511
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,228
What do you mean?
What does that mean?

512
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:04,438
It means...

513
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:09,026
Does he do that a lot?

514
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:13,614
- Wyatt.
- What is he doing?

515
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:16,408
- Why is he doing that?
- Apparently, he's trying to scare away

516
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:19,745
all of my dates. You little rot...
Did your father teach you that?

517
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:23,123
- So not the time.
- Right. You're grounded.

518
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:25,000
Okay, back to Paige.

519
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:27,961
She's with Zahn,
or rather her soul is, right about now.

520
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,297
- What?
- Yeah, it's all part of her plan.

521
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:32,424
It's why I'm here.
You don't have much time.

522
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:35,886
She told me to tell you to reverse
a to-call-a-lost-sister spell?

523
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:38,222
- It'll take you right to her.
- To do what?

524
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:40,182
To save her.

525
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:46,563
Please, everyone!
May I have your attention, please?

526
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:54,321
Tonight,
I have a special treat for you.

527
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,032
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

528
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,161
to purchase one of the most
unique souls there is or ever was.

529
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,456
A Charmed One,
ladies and demons.

530
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:10,504
One of only three in existence.
And I have her here tonight.

531
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:12,589
Both soul...

532
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,175
...and body.

533
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:18,303
To be auctioned off separately,
of course.

534
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:19,596
Hurry up.

535
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:22,266
Shall we start the bidding at say,
ten powers?

536
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:23,767
- I'll give you 15.
- Fifteen...

537
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:24,977
- Twenty!
- I have 20!

538
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,937
And another 20 for the body.

539
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:29,356
- Do I have 30?
- Thirty, just for the soul!

540
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:31,191
- Any more? Thirty-two.
- Thirty-two.

541
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,277
- Thirty-six.
- I have 36!

542
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,696
Forty! And I'll throw in my minions.

543
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:36,947
And minions!

544
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:40,284
More Charmed Ones.

545
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:44,913
- One hundred for all three.
- Sold. To the dead grimlock.

546
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:55,215
Way to channel.

547
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:58,218
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Piper, hurry. Blow up the vault!

548
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:11,398
My contracts!

549
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,192
Cut it a little close.

550
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,320
- What the hell is going on?
- Bitch later, vanquish now!

551
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:18,697
No!

552
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:25,037
I love watching lawyers explode.

553
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,499
- Now can I bitch?
- No, let me explain.

554
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,710
I had to lure you down here. It was
the only way to destroy the contracts.

555
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:34,880
- All I had to do was find them first.
- But by dying?

556
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:36,465
No, I'm not dead.

557
00:37:36,632 --> 00:37:40,552
See, your brain has to be dead
before you can die, so I'm still alive.

558
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:45,015
Okay, so where's Larry's soul?

559
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:48,894
Larry's saved. He's moved on.

560
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:51,813
And that was worth
risking your life for?

561
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:53,982
No, I wasn't risking my life.

562
00:37:54,149 --> 00:38:00,072
See, I knew no matter how pissed off
you got, you'd still come and save me.

563
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,406
We are sisters.

564
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:16,231
Thanks.
We're just taking a short break.

565
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:17,608
Back in 20 minutes, thank you.

566
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:18,984
Piper, how did you have time

567
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:22,696
to book Steadman in your club?
Between raising my nephew

568
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:25,282
- and trying to date and vanquishing...
- A sister?

569
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:28,327
Does that mean
you're still mad at Paige?

570
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:29,703
Well, yeah, aren't you?

571
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,955
Well...

572
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,000
I mean, come on,
she didn't just risk her own life,

573
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:38,170
she risked ours as well.
Not to mention the power of three.

574
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:41,340
Yeah, I know, but don't we kind of
do that every week anyway?

575
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:44,801
No, not unilaterally we don't. Ever.

576
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,387
I'm not saying she has to answer
to us all the time

577
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:50,641
or that she can't go find her bliss,
whatever that may be,

578
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,184
but not at the risk of what we do.

579
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:54,686
I totally agree, but still,

580
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:56,688
we have to figure out a way
to work it out.

581
00:39:56,855 --> 00:40:00,400
You know, let her feel like she has a
voice in this whole thing. Compromise.

582
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,195
Since when did you become
Solomon all of a sudden?

583
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:06,907
I have surrendered
to being the middle sister.

584
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:09,952
Or does it have more
to do with this?

585
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:13,831
Look at that pig.

586
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:18,293
And I don't mean literally.
At least, not anymore.

587
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,672
Hey, look who it is.
Where you two been?

588
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:23,382
Long story.

589
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:27,553
We got a little lost, that's all, and it
took some time to find our way back.

590
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:30,389
So, what did we miss?

591
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:35,936
- You lay into them. I have a date.
- Hey, a date? Really?

592
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:39,565
- Does he know about Wyatt?
- No. He's not gonna any time soon.

593
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:43,694
- At least not till after the honeymoon.
- Hey, what did we really miss?

594
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:46,780
You know what?

595
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:50,033
It's a long story.

596
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:54,913
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

597
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,623
Whitelighters don't have any money.

598
00:40:57,249 --> 00:40:59,084
It was a gesture.

599
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:02,671
- Two cold ones, Billy.
- You got it, Leo.

600
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:04,715
It's on me.

601
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:18,020
For Larry. May your soul
find freedom and peace.

602
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,066
- You okay?
- Yeah.

603
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:25,486
What about you and your sisters?

604
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:29,323
Oh, we're gonna be fine.
Just a few growing pains.

605
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:34,077
I wanted to thank you, though,
for everything you've done.

606
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:36,663
Hey, I just delivered a message.

607
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:41,210
No, I couldn't have done it
without you.

608
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:44,087
Anytime.

609
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,673
Lucky I ran into you.

610
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,217
Luck.

611
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:50,093
It was fate.
