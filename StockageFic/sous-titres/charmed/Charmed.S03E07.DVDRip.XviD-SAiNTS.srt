0
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:17,562
What?

1
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:21,647
No.

2
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:23,367
Tell me.

3
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,167
I don't know.

4
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:32,640
It just seems like whenever
I get close to you...

5
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:35,518
...you pull away from me.

6
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:43,165
Why do you do that?

7
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:47,843
What are you so afraid
of telling me?

8
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:54,760
Phoebe, don't.

9
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,360
I wanna know.

10
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:05,405
I deserve to know.

11
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:09,965
Phoebe, you don't know
what you're asking.

12
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,041
Whatever it is,
you can't keep running from it.

13
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:22,765
And you can't keep pretending
that it's not coming between us.

14
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:27,043
You can't keep hiding from the truth.

15
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:39,408
That wasn't so difficult, was it?

16
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:44,086
- What are you doing here?
- Reminding you

17
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:45,807
of your inner nature, Belthazor.

18
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:50,880
One that would be in your best
interest to reconnect with soon.

19
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,682
- I won't let you down.
- You already have.

20
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,880
You vowed to destroy the witches.

21
00:01:57,089 --> 00:01:59,649
Instead you bedded one of them.

22
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:03,006
That was a mistake.

23
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:09,003
Find demonic help
if you have to, Belthazor.

24
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,838
But you better find a way
to kill the witches or...

25
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:15,648
...we'll kill you.

26
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,957
All right, look, we know that
Belthazor is not going to stop

27
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:29,327
until he kills us.
Phoebe. Phoebe. Hi.

28
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:33,317
I hate to interrupt your whole
"staring off into space aimlessly" thing

29
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:35,679
that you got going on right now,
but in case you forgot,

30
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,488
- evil Triad agent.
- Like you would ever let me forget.

31
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,283
Well, if he's as powerful of a demon
as Leo says he is,

32
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:42,882
he's going to be immune
to our powers.

33
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:44,960
That's why we need to practice
our counterattacks,

34
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:47,962
so the next time he shows up,
we can get some demon flesh.

35
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,682
White meat or dark meat?

36
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,845
Well, I don't like the idea
of demon fillet either,

37
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:54,477
but it might help us
with the vanquishing potion.

38
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:56,567
Hello. Pheebs.

39
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,167
Cole is 45 minutes late.
You would think he would be on time

40
00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:02,564
after he sleeps with a girl,
you know.

41
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,681
Can we fast-forward, because I got
Fastball coming in in a couple of days,

42
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:08,079
- and I need to get some stuff done.
- Cole.

43
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:11,327
He's here. He's here.

44
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:14,278
"I'm sorry, but we have to stop
seeing each other, okay? Why?

45
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:17,043
Because... Because I gotta
kill you, that's why." Smooth.

46
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:19,922
All right, we are practicing the...

47
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,199
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

48
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,048
The earthquake drill tomorrow at 3.

49
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:27,969
Sorry, Madam President, but
I have a doctor's appointment.

50
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,963
Piper, you never know when
an earthquake is going to strike.

51
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,047
I guess not.
I guess I will reschedule then.

52
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,009
- Phoebe, we need to talk.
- Phoebe,

53
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,127
- earthquake drill tomorrow at 3.
- Okay, but if you need me there by 3,

54
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,439
you have to loan me your car.
I have class afterwards.

55
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:45,442
That's fine. Just try not to leave
my gas tank on empty this time.

56
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:49,045
I left your gas tank empty once, okay?
Get over it. Let it go.

57
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,205
- I'm sorry, what were you saying?
- Twice.

58
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,445
- Actually, if we could...
- Oh, and, Pheebs,

59
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:57,726
I need the car back by 5 because I
have a photo shoot at P3 tomorrow.

60
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:00,562
P3? Did you forget
to inform the owner of P3?

61
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:03,448
I'm sorry, but my location
fell out at the last moment,

62
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:05,685
and I couldn't find you.
I thought you'd say yes.

63
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,642
Of course you did. And did you forget
about the homeowners' meeting

64
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,277
- that's at our house tomorrow?
- I totally spaced.

65
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,201
- Pheebs, will you cover for me?
- No way.

66
00:05:13,369 --> 00:05:15,280
In the last one,
it took them two and a half hours

67
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,280
to decide where to put
the garden gnomes.

68
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:18,882
All right, do you want
the car or not?

69
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:21,165
- I hate you.
- No, you don't. You love me.

70
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:26,483
I'd love to get back to work.
Okay, you two kids behave.

71
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,885
Sorry about that. Sister stuff.

72
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:34,563
You know, there's a fine line
between love and hate.

73
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:38,004
So, what did you wanna talk about?

74
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,966
Actually, I have to go.

75
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:44,125
- Wait, what?
- I'm sorry, Phoebe.

76
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:45,961
It's just this...

77
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:49,442
...big case I've been working on.
I think I just had an epiphany

78
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:51,520
on how to win it.

79
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:56,117
Forgive me.

80
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:10,487
Tell the Triad I've figured out
how to destroy the Charmed Ones.

81
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:25,200
No, I'm planning on getting to P3
early to confer with the stylist.

82
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:27,041
All right, I'll see you there. Bye.

83
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:29,803
- Hey, where's Phoebe?
- I'm here.

84
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,881
- Do you guys know if Cole called?
- Not since the last time you asked.

85
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:34,846
Okay, I need some sisterly advice.

86
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:37,040
Is he doing
the "blow her off after sex" thing,

87
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,688
and I'm just not reading the signs?

88
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:41,768
Probably not, since the signs
Prue read as an empath

89
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:43,157
prove that he loves you.

90
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,565
Okay, well, supernatural guarantees
aside,

91
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:48,448
I am getting the feeling
that he is avoiding me.

92
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:51,846
I mean, I have no idea
where we stand.

93
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:55,564
Well, maybe it's got something to do
with whatever he's hiding from you.

94
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,522
Demon!

95
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,688
Piper, watch out.

96
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:06,677
Excuse me.

97
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:11,442
Piper, now.

98
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:16,608
You got skin.

99
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,882
Hey, Leo, do you think you could
make yourself look like Brad Pitt?

100
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:24,517
All right, guys, that was good.

101
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:26,964
Although, Phoebe, I think you need
more force on your kick,

102
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:29,245
and, Piper, less hesitating
on the slicing and dicing.

103
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:30,478
Should we try it again?

104
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:34,648
No, I'd like to have a boyfriend left
when this is over.

105
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:36,408
Okay, where are your keys, Prue?

106
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:39,043
Hey, don't forget to pick up food
for the homeowners' meeting.

107
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,086
Okay, now how am I possibly
gonna pick up food

108
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:42,921
when I have to get your car back
right away?

109
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:45,728
Well, I can't do it.
I have to prep for my shoot.

110
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:49,440
What? Don't look at me.

111
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:56,561
I guess I'll reschedule
my doctor's appointment again.

112
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,241
You're cute.

113
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:08,719
Have you ever destroyed siblings?
Sisters?

114
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,641
Sisters.

115
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:13,323
I pit nations against each other.

116
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:16,248
I start wars, riots.

117
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:21,279
I've reviewed your résumé, Andras.
Rather unfocused, actually.

118
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,440
My needs are very particular.

119
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,283
I can infect anybody.

120
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,041
Anybody who's angry.

121
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:32,083
That's your way in, through anger?

122
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:34,968
I see it in my victims.

123
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,921
It envelops them.

124
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:39,649
Then I turn that anger into rage.

125
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:44,727
Rage that continues
until they commit an act of violence.

126
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:48,529
Think you could work your magic
on the Charmed Ones?

127
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:50,959
You said sisters, not witches.

128
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:53,724
But they are sisters
first and foremost.

129
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:56,961
And that, I believe,
is their Achilles' heel.

130
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:00,807
Break that bond, and we break
the very foundation of their powers.

131
00:09:00,969 --> 00:09:04,200
Without their powers,
they're defenceless.

132
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:07,359
Which sister shall we start with?

133
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:12,325
The most vulnerable.

134
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,647
The youngest.

135
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:17,760
Class went late, and then
I had to go to the library

136
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:19,840
to get a book for psych class,

137
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:22,483
so I'm running a little late,
but I will be there.

138
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,607
Yeah, very funny, I was born late.

139
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:29,205
I promise I'll be there, okay?
I'll be home...

140
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,327
- soon. Gotta go. Bye.

141
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:36,799
- What are you doing here?
- I got a break in my case,

142
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:39,437
decided to take the afternoon off.

143
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:43,281
Well, that must have been quite
an epiphany you had last night.

144
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:45,883
Yeah, it was.

145
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,681
I came to apologise, Phoebe,
for walking out on you so abruptly.

146
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:52,884
That was rude.

147
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:55,680
Yeah, it was rude.

148
00:09:55,889 --> 00:10:00,485
I'd love to make it up to you. I made
early dinner reservations at Risso's.

149
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:03,682
I have to get Prue's car back.

150
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:05,808
I was hoping we could talk.

151
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:08,206
About what?

152
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,919
About the other night,
you and me, where we stand.

153
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:15,687
I would like to.

154
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,921
I actually would really like to,
but I promised Prue

155
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:23,287
that I'd do the homeowners'
meeting tonight, so...

156
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,842
That's all right. I understand.

157
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:33,520
It was worth a try.

158
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:44,560
Cole...

159
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:47,800
...I could probably get Piper
to handle the meeting.

160
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah?
You sure she won't be angry?

161
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,528
Oh, she's gonna be furious,

162
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:54,840
but she'll just suppress it
and take it out on me later.

163
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:58,962
You pick me up in an hour?

164
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:01,607
I'll be there.

165
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:28,484
- A restraining order?
- Oh, yes, yes, a countersuit,

166
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:32,881
- and my son is a lawyer.
- Your son is a fool, probably.

167
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:36,317
Oh, watch the...

168
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:39,643
Prue!

169
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:42,761
Welcome to Prue's world
of cluttered photography.

170
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:44,760
I can't believe
I got roped into this.

171
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:47,483
How did you get roped into heading
the refreshment committee?

172
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:50,083
- They didn't have time.
- And you do?

173
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:53,366
Well, my doctor's appointment
doesn't count as high priority.

174
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:56,647
Well, couldn't you make something
simpler? You know, chips and dip?

175
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,080
Leo, I was a chef.
I can't make chips and dip.

176
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:03,366
Maybe you need to tell your sisters
how you feel. Next time, just say no.

177
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,520
Okay, Leo, you obviously
do not have sisters.

178
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:07,998
One minute you're arguing about
something, and then suddenly

179
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:11,479
you're arguing about who stole
whose Malibu Barbie in 1979.

180
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,566
- Hey, is Phoebe home yet?
- No.

181
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:16,806
And where...?
Where is all the mineral water?

182
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:19,807
- There's some down in the basement.
- I'll get it.

183
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:28,479
It's our property, it's our money,
and we are building a fence.

184
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:31,607
Goat-cheese pizza and
onion tartlets for the vegetarians.

185
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:34,846
- Thank you, dear.
- We've had enough of your snooping.

186
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,802
- Snooping?
- Snooping.

187
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:39,967
The chicken satay has peanuts,
in case anybody's allergic.

188
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:42,085
Oh, thank you very much.

189
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:43,477
Phoebe.

190
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:47,646
- Nice of you to show.
- Piper...

191
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:50,727
Look, we have talked to a lawyer,
and according to the bylaws,

192
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:52,800
- we have the right to...
- I need a huge favour.

193
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:54,960
- Can I talk to you upstairs?
- Oh, no, you don't.

194
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:57,198
Phoebe.

195
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:00,367
Phoebe, this is not fair.

196
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:02,639
I know it's not,
but the last thing I expected

197
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:05,482
was for Cole to ask me out, okay?

198
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:07,008
So could you please cover for me?

199
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,769
I already rescheduled
my doctor's appointment twice.

200
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:12,688
Well, Leo was a doctor
before he died.

201
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:14,766
- That's really not the point.
- I know.

202
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:16,681
And I would never ask,
but this is important.

203
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:19,761
He wants to have the talk.
You know, are we a couple,

204
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:23,121
are we a one-nighter, are we friends,
are we friends that had a one-nighter?

205
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:24,324
Okay, I get it.

206
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,168
Ever planning on unfreezing
the neighbours?

207
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:28,717
Piper, just this once.

208
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:31,443
You know how much I want
this relationship to work.

209
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:34,645
Well, I guess I don't have
much of a choice.

210
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:42,007
You are so helping me
run this meeting.

211
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:46,041
- They're calling.
- No, no, no. No, Leo.

212
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:49,806
You chicken.

213
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:54,206
You can't put a fence up right
between the neighbours like that.

214
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:09,647
Andras.

215
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:13,367
If Phoebe's right, Piper will
be primed and ready for you.

216
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:15,048
I thought we were starting
with Phoebe.

217
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:17,928
We did. I did.

218
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:22,720
She's the reason Piper's angry, and
she'll be the reason Prue gets angry.

219
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:26,040
You just make sure you're
there to capitalise on that.

220
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:30,728
Don't you need me to enrage all three
of the sisters for your plan to work?

221
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:36,677
You infect Piper and Prue,
I'll bring Phoebe back home.

222
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:39,317
They'll blame her for everything.

223
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:42,084
Your legend is well-deserved,
Belthazor.

224
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:46,479
You know, for someone
about to score

225
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:49,686
one of the biggest victories
in centuries...

226
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,080
...you don't seem very happy
about it.

227
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:55,080
Just do your job.

228
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:06,405
Your fence will block the sun
from my flowers.

229
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,725
Well, then I suggest you take it up
with the sun.

230
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:11,238
- Oh, great. Great idea.
- Okay.

231
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:14,606
Why don't you build a shorter fence
or move your flowerbed?

232
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:18,205
No, it is not my azaleas
that are the problem here.

233
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:21,645
- Then we'll see you in court.
- Okay, okay.

234
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:24,448
- Everybody, please try to calm down.
- Bye, honey.

235
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:26,486
Phoebe, Phoebe. Phoebe!

236
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:29,157
- Those are my earrings.
- Okay.

237
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:31,246
Hey!

238
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,879
All right. Everybody shut up.

239
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:39,604
I have had it
with your petty problems

240
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:42,237
and your stupid fence
and your stupid flowerbed.

241
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:45,521
There are bigger problems
in the world to worry about.

242
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:47,680
Just get a life and grow up.

243
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:50,563
- You can't speak to us like that.
- Oh, yeah?

244
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:56,279
Everybody out of my house. Get out
of my house before I throw you out.

245
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,207
- With pleasure.
- Go on!

246
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:00,007
They should build a fence
to keep you in.

247
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,000
- Good idea.
- I'll speak to your sister

248
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,080
- about the way you behave.
- Better idea.

249
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:06,042
Move it, move it, move it.

250
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,001
And stay out.

251
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:34,962
Wait, you actually wore
a penguin costume?

252
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:37,085
- Yes, and l... Yes.
- No.

253
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:39,683
And I handed out
balloons to kids.

254
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:42,363
I was 15, leave me alone.
I needed a job.

255
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,561
Bet you were cute.

256
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:46,799
- I had to do this walk.
- No, no. Don't...

257
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:49,403
Yes, I had to do the walk.

258
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:50,797
Like this.

259
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:01,567
You've come a long way,
haven't you?

260
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:04,640
Yeah.

261
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:06,561
Yeah, I think I have.

262
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:11,437
And of course, I'm still living
with my two sisters,

263
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,201
and still going to college, you know.

264
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:15,041
And eventually,
I'd like to work past that.

265
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:18,519
You don't like living
with your sisters?

266
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,042
It's more out of necessity.

267
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:26,483
But it... You know, enough about me.

268
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,365
Tell me about you. Am I
the only person with a past here?

269
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:34,161
Mine's not very interesting.

270
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:38,165
More secrets.

271
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:42,082
I don't like to talk about
my past much. Or my family.

272
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:45,525
I lost them a long time ago.

273
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:48,199
Oh, I'm sorry.

274
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:50,647
I know how that feels.

275
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:53,680
I never knew my mother.

276
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:56,647
And my father left
when I was really little.

277
00:17:57,129 --> 00:17:59,324
So we were raised
by my grandmother.

278
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:01,998
And she's not with us anymore.

279
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:04,878
- But you still have your sisters.
- Yeah.

280
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:08,528
And I thank God for them every day.

281
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:11,283
I don't know what I would do
if I lost them.

282
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,167
You okay?

283
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:21,399
Phoebe, there's something
I have to tell you.

284
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,041
I'm a terrible dancer.

285
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:30,641
You're a terrible dancer.

286
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:38,399
Something tells me that's not
what you were gonna say.

287
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,247
Come on.

288
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:47,525
- Come on.
- No. No, really, I can't...

289
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:49,441
Okay, look, if we're not
gonna talk about us,

290
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,565
- No.
- and we're not gonna talk about you,

291
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:53,924
- we're gonna dance. Come on.
- I can't.

292
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:57,764
You can. Why would you bring me
here if you're not gonna dance?

293
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:17,766
I'm sorry I didn't make it.
No, I didn't forget.

294
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:19,760
I loaned my car to someone,
and obviously...

295
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:24,238
They obviously forgot to fill the tank.
Keep it down, will you?

296
00:19:24,449 --> 00:19:27,407
All right, look, one more chance
is all that I'm asking for.

297
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:30,163
- Where's Phoebe?
- The little witch is not home yet.

298
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:34,885
No, tomorrow at P3
will not be a problem.

299
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,517
- Okay.
- Actually, excuse me.

300
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:39,481
Hi. Actually, you know what? It is.

301
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:45,206
Okay, all right. Do you have any idea
who that was?

302
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:46,968
I could care less.

303
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:48,921
- What is your problem?
- You are.

304
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:51,324
Get your own damn club,
and keep your paws off of mine.

305
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:53,918
Okay, whoa. Obviously,
somebody needs a Midol.

306
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:56,597
And I am so sick of all
your stuff laying around.

307
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:59,442
If you can't put your equipment
away, then I will.

308
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:10,157
Who the hell do you think you are?

309
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:24,282
I had a great time tonight.

310
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:27,200
Better than being
at the homeowners' meeting?

311
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:29,527
A little.

312
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:31,842
Okay, you're married.

313
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,004
- What?
- That's the big secret, you're married.

314
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:37,723
You have three kids and two dogs
and a really cute cat, right?

315
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:40,727
- And I'm the seven-year itch?
- You found me out.

316
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:43,927
Can't get anything past me.

317
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:46,683
No, I guess not.

318
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:52,724
About the other night.

319
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:57,884
Are you sorry that we?

320
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:00,761
Not at all.

321
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:03,440
Are you?

322
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:05,727
Depends on what happens next.

323
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:09,044
Too bad you can't predict the future.

324
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:11,605
Who says I can't?

325
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:32,447
Are you sure you don't
wanna come in?

326
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:36,167
Better get back to the case,
you know?

327
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:39,368
Right.

328
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:48,525
- Phoebe.
- Yeah.

329
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,046
Goodbye.

330
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:55,280
Night.

331
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:27,599
"Sure, you can use P3 for a photo
shoot." Hello. Remember me?

332
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:29,521
Oh, poor Piper.
Well, you know what?

333
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:31,964
- The martyr routine's getting old.
- Hey, what's going on?

334
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:33,118
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

335
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:35,928
You know what? Sorry I didn't check
with you about your stupid club,

336
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:38,080
but I was too busy being
concerned about the Triad.

337
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:40,922
Oh, right, without the mighty
Prue Halliwell, we'd all be dead.

338
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:43,887
- Get over yourself, Prue.
- Sisters, what's gotten into you two?

339
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:47,405
By the way, you owe me for a car tow
and a tank of gas, you little leech.

340
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:49,759
Sorry, is it Gang Up on Phoebe Day
and nobody told me?

341
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,085
Newsflash, the world does
not revolve around Phoebe.

342
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:55,042
Yeah, so while you get to spend
the night screwing the DA,

343
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,922
we are stuck picking up your slack.

344
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:00,161
What's the matter, Prue, jealous?

345
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:03,527
All work and no play making
you even more boring?

346
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,601
Oh, yeah, there's a lot
to be jealous of.

347
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:09,045
Jealous that I'm still in school,
jealous that I'm still unemployed

348
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:11,638
and jealous that I am still
living off of my sisters?

349
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:13,561
Grams said you'd never
amount to anything.

350
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:15,282
I am so sick of the fact

351
00:23:15,489 --> 00:23:18,162
that I have been saddled
with the two of you my entire life.

352
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:19,927
- Whatever, I'm leaving.
- Oh, sure.

353
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:21,238
You're such an immature brat.

354
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:23,479
You leave every time
you can't hack something.

355
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:25,441
There's nothing keeping
me here, now is there?

356
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:28,362
Oh, well, I see that you inherited
Dad's talent for bailing.

357
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:31,561
That's because the two of us couldn't
deal with living with the two of you.

358
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:34,158
Well, at least I'm not so stupid
I had to do college twice.

359
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:37,759
Well, at least I actually had
the courage to go away to college.

360
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:40,403
What's the matter, Piper,
the real world too much for you?

361
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:44,079
I am so sick of the two of you
ganging up on me and judging me.

362
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,564
I am so sick of saving your asses.

363
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:49,283
I'm sick of being taken for granted,
and those are mine.

364
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:52,168
Bitch.

365
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:34,877
- Here.
- Sorry.

366
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:36,482
I'll get it.

367
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:38,082
Thanks.

368
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:44,878
- What's wrong?
- You tell me.

369
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:48,728
- Well, we had a little...
- Tiff.

370
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:51,284
Must have been more than little,
because they felt it.

371
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:54,482
- What do you mean, they felt it?
- Whatever happened

372
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:57,641
- severed the power of three.
- Leo, that's impossible.

373
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:01,885
Freeze this.

374
00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:09,002
- What happened to our powers?
- That's what we have to figure out.

375
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:10,761
Let's start with your little tiff.

376
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:15,082
Well, that's a bit of an
understatement. It was big.

377
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:16,802
How big?

378
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:19,603
Do you remember Pearl Harbor?

379
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:21,928
Okay, so, what triggered it?

380
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:24,518
I don't know.
Just little things, I guess.

381
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,078
I really didn't want to do
this stupid meeting and...

382
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:30,207
My car ran out of gas. And because
of that, I missed my job.

383
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:33,082
- That's it?
- Yeah, I mean, it's weird.

384
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:36,207
We were angry, but we
shouldn't have been that angry.

385
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:40,601
- It was almost like something...
- Something sort of came over us.

386
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:42,646
Yeah, like, something like Belthazor.

387
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,881
It doesn't track.
No matter what he does,

388
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:46,801
he doesn't have the power
to take away yours.

389
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:51,287
So back to your argument.
You yelled, and you threw stuff?

390
00:25:51,489 --> 00:25:53,081
Well, we did a little bit
more than that.

391
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:55,679
We used our powers.

392
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:58,641
On each other?

393
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:00,925
All right, well, then
that's what happened.

394
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:03,643
Your powers are rooted
in your bond as sisters.

395
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:06,443
Using them against each other
must have severed that bond.

396
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:09,643
All right, you need to repair
the damage to your relationship fast,

397
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:12,039
because without your powers,
you are extremely vulnerable.

398
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:13,881
- You need to get Phoebe...
- Phoebe's gone.

399
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:15,603
Gone? Where?

400
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,328
Cole?

401
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:43,088
Cole?

402
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:00,157
Hi.

403
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:02,640
Phoebe, what are you doing here?

404
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:07,527
I don't know.

405
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:11,486
I was just walking around and...

406
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:14,078
I'm sorry, I know it's really late.

407
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,766
Can I come in?

408
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:22,728
Yeah.

409
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:24,762
Sure.

410
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:33,248
I had nowhere else to go.

411
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,241
It's okay.

412
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:38,885
I'm glad you came here.

413
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:42,127
What happened?

414
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:45,761
After...

415
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:48,638
After you dropped me off...

416
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:54,766
...my sisters and I
got into a huge fight.

417
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:58,404
It was horrible.

418
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:08,565
You're safe here.

419
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:18,444
Nothing. I can't find her. We don't
even have basic powers anymore.

420
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,201
I cannot believe this is happening.

421
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:23,202
What I don't understand is how
could Belthazor make us that angry?

422
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,645
- That's not his power.
- No, it's not, but it is his.

423
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:33,239
"Andras, the spirit of rage,

424
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:35,764
uses anger as a portal
to enrage his victims

425
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:38,159
until they commit
a grievous act of violence."

426
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:40,240
Yeah, but that doesn't
really explain everything.

427
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:42,764
I mean, even if our fight
was supernaturally amped,

428
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,920
Andras magnifies anger into rage,

429
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:46,886
he doesn't just create it
out of thin air.

430
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,203
So we gave him the opening.

431
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:51,922
And he took full advantage.

432
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:58,007
I was just so angry.

433
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,160
And I said such horrible things
to them.

434
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:04,561
And l... I didn't even
really mean any of it.

435
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:17,328
I'm sorry.

436
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,042
No.

437
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:20,767
Please.

438
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:25,318
Let me get you a tissue. Here.

439
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:40,246
The things that were said,

440
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:43,242
I don't even know
where they were coming from.

441
00:29:43,569 --> 00:29:47,687
I mean, I guess it's issues,
you know, that were underlying

442
00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:50,198
that we never really dealt with,
and then...

443
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,767
...now all of a sudden, just exploded.

444
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:58,166
Nothing ever happened
like that before?

445
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:01,241
Oh, no. Not like that.

446
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:06,519
I mean, we used to fight all the time
when we were little, you know?

447
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:12,366
But since we moved in together,
we just...

448
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:15,277
We got really close, you know. We...

449
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:18,845
We've been through
so much together.

450
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:29,767
Thank you for listening to me.

451
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:37,045
And thank you
for being there for me.

452
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:09,967
I can't.

453
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,927
I can't.

454
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,642
What do you mean?

455
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,165
Oh, Phoebe.

456
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:23,600
You need to go home. Now.

457
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:28,081
What? Why?

458
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:31,241
Because you're...

459
00:31:31,569 --> 00:31:33,525
...vulnerable right now.

460
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,322
I don't...

461
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:39,958
We shouldn't do this.

462
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:47,359
You need to go home.

463
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:52,805
You need to go and figure out
what happened.

464
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:00,837
You're right.

465
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:04,128
I do.

466
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:22,967
Thank you.

467
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:33,881
You're welcome.

468
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:44,718
So the rumours are true.
You've fallen for a witch.

469
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:48,638
- What are you doing here? Get out.
- The great Belthazor.

470
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:50,248
Who would've ever thought?

471
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:54,197
I can hardly wait to see what the Triad
will do when I tell them you failed.

472
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:57,048
I'll kill you before
you ever get the chance.

473
00:32:57,249 --> 00:32:58,477
Yeah?

474
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:01,527
Then you really are a traitor,
aren't you?

475
00:33:05,969 --> 00:33:07,482
Pissed off, are you?

476
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:11,246
Good. Because there's something
you don't know about me.

477
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:15,241
I can possess my victims too.

478
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:43,080
Now, let's go finish
what we started, shall we?

479
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:47,078
Yeah.

480
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:51,718
Well, if you hear from her,
just tell her to call home, okay?

481
00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:54,528
It's an emergency. Thanks.

482
00:33:54,729 --> 00:33:57,197
So she's not at the club, and none
of her friends have seen her.

483
00:33:57,409 --> 00:33:59,127
- Did you try Cole?
- No answer.

484
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,524
If something happens to her,
I'll never forgive myself.

485
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:04,362
- Nothing is gonna happen.
- Leo, something happened to Grams,

486
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:07,168
something happened to Mom.
It kind of runs in the family.

487
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,519
- Phoebe, thank God.
- Has the tribal council spoken?

488
00:34:14,689 --> 00:34:16,964
Am I booted off the island?

489
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,807
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

490
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:22,079
Where were you?

491
00:34:22,249 --> 00:34:26,037
I was at Cole's. And after
a lot of talking and a lot of tears,

492
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:28,723
he convinced me to come home
and deal with what happened.

493
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,198
- Belthazor is what happened.
- What?

494
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,322
Abbreviated version, he used
some underling spirit to enrage us.

495
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:39,448
And when we fought, we lost
our powers. No more triquetra,

496
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:42,243
- no more power of three.
- We have no powers?

497
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:46,004
- But that means that...
- That he's gonna try and come kill us.

498
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:50,198
Which, when you didn't come home,
we thought that he had already...

499
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:53,125
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

500
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:56,882
So, what do we do,
a spell, a vanquish, a potion?

501
00:34:57,089 --> 00:34:59,045
You need to try and restore
your bond as sisters.

502
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:04,443
I'll give you some privacy.

503
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:10,847
- A potion would be easier, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

504
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:18,009
Phoebe, Grams didn't say
you'd never amount to anything.

505
00:35:18,169 --> 00:35:20,763
That was just me being mean.

506
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:24,480
She was... Is very proud of you.

507
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:26,803
Well, we all know that sometimes

508
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:29,244
I'm not the most responsible person
in the world.

509
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:32,798
No, Phoebe. That's all
kind of ancient history, isn't it?

510
00:35:33,249 --> 00:35:36,321
I mean, you've grown up a lot, and I'm
sorry if I don't treat you like you have

511
00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:38,639
- all the time.
- It's okay.

512
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:42,007
- And since Mom died...
- You did take care of us.

513
00:35:42,169 --> 00:35:44,763
And you do still look
out for us all the time.

514
00:35:44,929 --> 00:35:47,318
And we don't always say thank you.

515
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:49,639
Sometimes we take you for granted.

516
00:35:50,689 --> 00:35:53,681
I don't think I'm the one who's
been taken for granted around here.

517
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:00,162
You know, who needs Oprah
when we can do it ourselves?

518
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:05,962
Do you think we have
our powers back?

519
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:12,727
All right, no. You try.

520
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:15,768
- Oh, mine aren't working either.
- We worked on our issues.

521
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:20,965
- Leo!
- No, wait. You guys run.

522
00:36:21,169 --> 00:36:22,443
- I'll hold him off.
- No, Prue.

523
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:24,406
We're in this together,
no matter what.

524
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:29,440
Look, the book.

525
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:40,679
- Okay, that's new.
- Demon with demon filling.

526
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:44,759
Nobody crosses me.

527
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:53,965
Okay, positions.

528
00:36:54,969 --> 00:36:56,561
Hey.

529
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:01,247
Piper.

530
00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:06,801
Piper, the knife.

531
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:40,403
- He's gone.
- At least for now.

532
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:43,759
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Good thing I'm already dead.

533
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,045
- Did you get him?
- Oh, yeah.

534
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:50,484
I got a slice.

535
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:52,726
The other white meat.

536
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:54,402
Better him than me.

537
00:37:54,569 --> 00:37:56,878
Well, at least now we could
work on a vanquishing spell.

538
00:37:57,089 --> 00:37:59,808
Well, we better hurry
before Belthazor's encore.

539
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:44,008
Hey, how did the photo session go?

540
00:38:44,209 --> 00:38:45,801
Not as good as if
it had been done here,

541
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:47,800
but definitely better
for our relationship.

542
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:49,721
Well, next time
just give me some warning,

543
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:51,561
and I'll be happy
to accommodate you.

544
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,801
Oh, I promise. By the way,
how was your doctor's appointment?

545
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:58,405
It was fine. Everything was normal
except my stress level.

546
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,321
Oh, I don't mean to stress you out
even more,

547
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:01,922
but I ran into Allen and Claire,

548
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:04,723
and they said they worked
everything out with Mrs. Snyder.

549
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:09,366
- What did you say to them anyway?
- Oh, nothing, I just spoke my mind.

550
00:39:10,209 --> 00:39:11,881
Maybe you should handle
all the meetings.

551
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:13,602
No. Absolutely not.

552
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:16,045
Wow, you're getting good
at saying no.

553
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:17,757
Thank you.

554
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,967
Anyway, I think it's good that we
got everything out on the table.

555
00:39:22,049 --> 00:39:23,767
And for the sake
of innocents everywhere,

556
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:27,126
I think we should always
just tell each other how we feel.

557
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:30,483
Well, not always.
We might kill each other.

558
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:33,959
Okay, then most of the time.

559
00:39:34,129 --> 00:39:37,201
Just enough to keep demons
away from splitting us up.

560
00:39:37,729 --> 00:39:39,321
I agree with that.

561
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:48,844
- Haven't heard from Cole yet, huh?
- No.

562
00:39:49,009 --> 00:39:51,921
I still can't figure that guy out.

563
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,761
But I will.

564
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:02,200
I warned you, Belthazor.

565
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:05,363
I warned you what would happen
if you failed us.

566
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,242
He's done more than fail us.

567
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:10,407
He's betrayed us.

568
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:13,968
You've betrayed The Source.

569
00:40:14,169 --> 00:40:16,080
You showed sympathy
to the witches.

570
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:20,478
And squandered
a golden opportunity.

571
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:27,366
You are allowed one final statement.

572
00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:34,959
I've got nothing to say.

573
00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:38,204
Except...
