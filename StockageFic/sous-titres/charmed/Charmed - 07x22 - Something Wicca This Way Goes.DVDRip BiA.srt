1
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,131
How do we know Zankou's
not here waiting for us?

2
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,258
Magic School is protected from him.

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,093
Leo!

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,930
Still, now that Zankou's
got the Book of Shadows...

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,974
He can't use all of its powers,
not without ours. Leo?

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,561
But he could use it to get our powers.
It's been done before.

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,730
As long as we're here, we're safe.

8
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,024
- What's wrong?
- How are the boys?

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,945
- They're sleeping, why?
- Zankou's got the Book of Shadows.

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,154
What? How?

11
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,740
As soon as we figure it out,
we'll let you know.

12
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,992
- He broke us down.
- How does it explain...

13
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,746
Our powers are tied to the Book,
our emotions are tied to our powers.

14
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:41,166
- By making us vulnerable...
- He made the Book vulnerable too.

15
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,585
He knew us a little better
than we thought.

16
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,504
What is he really after?

17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,799
What he's always after. Power.

18
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,635
The Nexus.

19
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,655
It's good to be back.

20
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,270
Okay, here you go.

21
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,773
How close are we?

22
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,026
We'd be a lot closer
if we could use our powers to open it.

23
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,946
The Nexus will view that
as a threat, destroy us all.

24
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,407
Remember, it's neither good nor evil.

25
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,827
It's just sheer, unadulterated power,

26
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,539
the kind the Charmed Ones
have been harbouring far too long.

27
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,791
Now it's my turn to play.

28
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:32,462
What will be your first move?
Once you possess it, I mean.

29
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,423
Oh, I don't know.

30
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,011
I'll have full access to the Book of
Shadows, of course, which means...

31
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,305
...l'll have ultimate power.

32
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,892
I hope I don't get bored.

33
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,602
The Nexus, My Lord.

34
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,313
Step back.

35
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,806
It is done.

36
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,602
Master. What are your orders?

37
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,033
What happened?

38
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,828
The sisters... they cast it
out of me with a spell!

39
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,540
From the Magic School? Lmpossible!

40
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,834
Nothing's impossible there!

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,461
- Where are you going?
- The Book of Shadows!

42
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,713
To find a way to stop them!

43
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,720
I think it worked.

44
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,599
- How do you know?
- If he'd already tapped into the Nexus,

45
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,520
he would have broken in by now.
Good thing you remembered that spell.

46
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,522
We can't just keep casting it.

47
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,608
He's gonna figure out a way
around it sooner or later.

48
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,027
We have to get the Book back
before he does.

49
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,947
- Okay, any ideas?
- No, I was hoping you'd have some.

50
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,156
Me? Why me?

51
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,952
Because you're the only one that still
has any confidence around here.

52
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,037
That's just 'cause I'm a good actor.

53
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,541
I hope you can fool the Book.
Unless we get our confidence back,

54
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,835
and fast, it may not let us get it back.

55
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,672
If Zankou gets the Nexus first,
there won't even be a point in trying.

56
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,049
We can't let that happen.
If he succeeds,

57
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:45,429
everything we've done means nothing,
and I'm not willing to live with that.

58
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,765
- Well, you might not have to.
- Then we go down fighting.

59
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,685
Which brings us back
to how do we stop him?

60
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,605
Okay, let's think about this
for a second.

61
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,233
We know Zankou
as well as he knows us, right?

62
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,776
Yeah, so?

63
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:04,448
So, what is the one thing that Zankou
wants more than the Nexus?

64
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,367
- Our heads on a platter?
- Exactly.

65
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,328
He hates us. He wants to kill us.

66
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,539
So why don't we give him a reason?

67
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,668
You know, piss him off enough so that
the focus is off the Nexus and onto us.

68
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,880
Could buy us time to get the Book back.
It just might work.

69
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,133
Yeah... unless he kills us first.

70
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,812
You Inspector Sheridan?

71
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,397
Yeah, who are you?

72
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,399
Agent Keyes, Homeland Security.

73
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,819
- You called, didn't you?
- Yes, yes.

74
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,155
I was not expecting you until tomorrow.

75
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,242
Let's just say I was anxious
to hear what you had to say.

76
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:54,164
All right. What do you know about
what happened to your Agent Brody?

77
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,459
- You tell me.
- He disappeared.

78
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,087
I think I know who knows why.

79
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,716
The same people who know
what happened to three other cops

80
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,887
who were killed or mysteriously
disappeared in the past seven years.

81
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,515
Inspectors Trudeau,

82
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:15,519
Rodriguez and Davidson.

83
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,646
Then there are the civilian cases,

84
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,440
including one of their sisters,
Prue Halliwell.

85
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,526
That's it?

86
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,864
That's it? Are you kidding?
What, you need more?

87
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,408
Okay.

88
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,369
How about I think they tried
to make me disappear too?

89
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,664
They put me in a coma,
tried to get me to forget what I knew.

90
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:39,543
Actually, Brody's the one who
put you in the coma, on my orders.

91
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,921
- What?
- They knew you were onto them.

92
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,757
We didn't want you
messing up our investigation.

93
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,218
- How dare you!
- Easy, Inspector.

94
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,929
This is bigger than you think,
much bigger.

95
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,639
Besides, I am here, aren't I?

96
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,558
- With Brody's tranq gun?
- No.

97
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,769
With answers.
The ones you've been looking for.

98
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,647
Okay.

99
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,151
Do you believe in the paranormal,
Inspector?

100
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:08,238
That there may be forces,
powers that exist beyond our own?

101
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,159
That's what the Halliwells
are involved in.

102
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,454
We want to blow the doors wide open
on that secret of theirs.

103
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,046
What are you looking for?

104
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:28,217
A reversal spell, to stop them
from keeping me from the Nexus.

105
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,094
Even if you find one, it might not work.

106
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,640
You said yourself that without
full access to the Book, that it...

107
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,392
I know what I said.

108
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,436
Perhaps a potion...

109
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:46,443
Why not just keep trying
to take in the Nexus? Outlast them.

110
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,364
After all, they can't keep pulling
it out of you, timing it just right.

111
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,283
Sooner or later,
you'll have the power long enough

112
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,663
to break through the protection of the
Magic School. Then you can kill them.

113
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,998
You don't know them like I do.

114
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,293
You can't take them head-on,
it doesn't work.

115
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,546
That's how demons die.

116
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,007
But not this demon. Not this time.

117
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,469
This is no time for personal vendettas.

118
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,806
I think your focus should be
the Nexus, not the witches.

119
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,558
Are you challenging me?

120
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:22,271
You brought me on as your counsel.
I'm merely acting as such.

121
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,190
If you are displeased, then...

122
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:29,736
No. No, you served me well,
and will continue to do so.

123
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,697
And to that end, go to the kitchen

124
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:36,994
and bring me up some mandrake,
henbane and some hemlock root.

125
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,915
- I'm making a potion.
- To do what?

126
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,584
To steal their powers.

127
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,254
There are other ways of gaining
full access to the Book of Shadows.

128
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,148
Wasn't there a confidence spell
in the Book of Shadows?

129
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:10,110
Yeah, remember we cast it
on that waiter at Quake?

130
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,989
Wow, Quake. That was a long time ago.

131
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:18,660
Maybe we should cast it on ourselves.
We could use a little confidence.

132
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,456
- But that won't piss off Zankou.
- It might help us get the Book back.

133
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:26,335
What if we... switched bodies
with him instead?

134
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,837
- Can't, he'd be in Magic School.
- Oh, right.

135
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,007
How about a love spell?
We can make him fall for one of us.

136
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,968
- Sorry, I'm taken.
- Yeah, well, I'm not.

137
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,222
Yeah, but you're not
that desperate. Are you?

138
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,141
Those demons have a way
of keeping you warm at night.

139
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,810
But that's only because
they have fire balls.

140
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,814
"Hear secret thoughts,

141
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,275
stretch the imagination..."

142
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,905
What if we turn you into a banshee again
and turn you loose on him?

143
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,449
Too much screeching,
it's hard on my voice.

144
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,243
Hey, I have an idea.

145
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,371
What if we humiliated him
and turned him into an animal,

146
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:05,082
like we did that one time
to everyone at P3?

147
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,667
That spell backfired.

148
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,127
Yeah, well, beggars can't be choosers.

149
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:14,007
Phoebe, Piper! Come here.
I think I got something.

150
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,937
What are they all doing here?

151
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,398
Reinforcements.

152
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,204
- You knew, didn't you?
- Knew about what?

153
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,707
About the Halliwells,
who they really are.

154
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,959
I don't know what you're talking about.

155
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:52,045
Were you gonna keep your mouth shut
even if I got killed?

156
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,965
- Hey, Inspector, listen...
- You listen to me!

157
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:58,260
I'm not busting you
because I can't prove that you knew.

158
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,889
I can't believe that you didn't tell me
and let them put me in a coma!

159
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,976
Hey, hold it! I helped find you, okay?
I'm the one who saved you.

160
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,770
You need to come in here
and you need to help us.

161
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,273
- "Us", who's "us"?
- Homeland Security.

162
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,193
They're all over it.
It's a federal case now.

163
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,029
Is something wrong?

164
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:18,363
No.

165
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,033
Morris, you can't run
from this anymore.

166
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,910
You can't protect them anymore.

167
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,953
Darryl, who is it?

168
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,789
I really don't have a choice.

169
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:32,085
Then you'd better not warn them
that we're coming or I will bust you!

170
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,173
Was that them?

171
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,218
No, it was... Sheridan.

172
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,386
Is everything okay?

173
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,683
It's not my problem, right?

174
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,728
They're on their own.

175
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,110
Presto!

176
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,613
Hand me one of those vials,
if you would.

177
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,448
How do you know it will work?

178
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:05,452
I don't. But I assume if it's in
their venerable Book, it should.

179
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,788
But they're hiding in the Magic School.

180
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,707
How are you gonna get close enough
to use it on them?

181
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,835
They're not gonna stay in for long.

182
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,797
It's not their style. As I was saying?

183
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,467
What the hell?

184
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,593
- Now!
- Something wicked in our midst

185
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,845
In our home where he exists

186
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,931
Are you all right?

187
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,858
Well, don't just stand there!
Kill them all!

188
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,197
The Book.

189
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,949
They're after the Book! Stop this!

190
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,413
Reverse the spell from whence I fell

191
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:39,713
Hurry, get to the Book. Go, go, go!

192
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,509
What happened?

193
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:48,013
It wouldn't let me take it.
We should have cast a confidence spell.

194
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,556
You're trespassing.

195
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:12,037
I failed you. Forgive me.

196
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:14,206
Actually, it was a complete success.

197
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,458
After all, we still have the Book.

198
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,961
And as an added bonus...

199
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,296
...I now have one of their powers.

200
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,470
Does it hurt?

201
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:32,516
Not any more than usual.
This is getting old.

202
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,477
- You're lucky to get out of there.
- Tell me about it.

203
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:38,772
He threw something at me,
maybe a potion or something.

204
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,733
- Did it do anything?
- I don't think so.

205
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,695
The magic from your Book
is not available to him yet.

206
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,030
"Yet" being the operative word.

207
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,909
Well, we wanted Zankou to focus on us.
Now, how do we survive that?

208
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:54,538
- You gotta get the Book back.
- We tried, but it won't let us take it.

209
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,790
Maybe he cast a protection spell on it?

210
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,751
Or maybe the Book
doesn't remember who we are.

211
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,296
Maybe 'cause we don't
remember who we are.

212
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:06,008
You've gotta remember.
You gotta go back, try again, together.

213
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:10,137
Leo's right, you have to get the Book
back, if only to destroy the Nexus.

214
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,181
Excuse me?

215
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:16,560
There's a spell in the Book you've never
used called "How to Banish a Suxen".

216
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,938
- A Suxen?
- Nexus, spelled backwards.

217
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,441
It was put in a long time ago
as a last resort,

218
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,444
in case we lost control of the Nexus,
to keep it from evil.

219
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:29,531
But if we destroy the Nexus,
good won't have access to it either.

220
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,241
We won't have access to it.

221
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,413
I don't think the Elders think we'll
be around long enough to worry.

222
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,791
Not necessarily.
We're simply taking precautions.

223
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,793
Including, let me guess,

224
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,588
sealing yourselves off from us
in case we fail.

225
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,300
Be well.

226
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,428
Excuse me!
That's what you're leaving us with?

227
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,683
- Now what?
- You can't just give up, that's what.

228
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,560
- Leo...
- Look, I mean it.

229
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,605
Your plan is working.
You got Zankou off the Nexus.

230
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,316
You need to distract him long enough
to get the Book.

231
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:05,609
He's too powerful.

232
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,111
The hell he is!
You guys are the Charmed Ones!

233
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:11,823
No one is more powerful.
How many times have you proven that?

234
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,743
You can't just give up.
You have a legacy to carry on,

235
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,371
to pass on to the next generation,
to our boys.

236
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,624
- To your future kids.
- A bit wordy.

237
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,752
Well, you know him with the exposition.

238
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,671
It doesn't mean he's not right.

239
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,674
The question is, what's our next move?

240
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:32,094
We can't ask the leprechauns
and the trolls for more help.

241
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:35,389
No, but maybe we could ask some bats.

242
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:45,190
- Do I need to replace you?
- No. I can still fight.

243
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,150
I just don't know why we have to.

244
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,485
Meaning?

245
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:52,865
Meaning Zankou has left us
vulnerable to attack for no reason!

246
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,158
- Are you questioning him?
- Aren't you?

247
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:59,580
You know he should have taken in
the power of the Nexus hours ago.

248
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:04,710
But instead, he's given the witches an
opening and we've lost demons, friends!

249
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:08,547
Hold your tongue, Salko.
Or you'll lose more than that.

250
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,427
Send the others away.

251
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,388
They're no longer needed.

252
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:18,932
You're going after the Nexus?

253
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:24,062
Yes... but only after I get the
other sisters' powers. I set a trap.

254
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:32,029
- Was I not clear?
- Perfectly.

255
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,447
Away!

256
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:41,455
Do you really think they'll leave
the safety of the Magic School?

257
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,790
- I know they will.
- How do you know that?

258
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,211
Now that I have Phoebe's powers,
I know what they'll do next.

259
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,881
They will not humiliate me again.

260
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,060
- There you go.
- Thanks.

261
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:04,728
I'll get it for you.

262
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,065
SFPD, this is...

263
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,984
- Well?
- The judge denied our request

264
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:14,321
- for a tap. He wanted more evidence.
- If we had more evidence,

265
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:15,989
we wouldn't need the tap.

266
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,116
We gotta get in there.

267
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:21,453
Call the AG. We need to speak
to him. We'll circumvent this.

268
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,250
- You going to claim they're terrorists?
- I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

269
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,503
Then let me go in.

270
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,171
Put the camera on me.

271
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:35,133
No offence, Inspector,
but I've got better trained agents.

272
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,804
Nobody the sisters know.
They'll let me in, they'll have to.

273
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,598
I'll get you your evidence,
in living colour.

274
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,183
- How?
- I'll provoke them.

275
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,519
Shouldn't be hard.
They hate me already.

276
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:50,315
If they've got these powers, as you
say, I will make them use them.

277
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,610
I'm not willing to risk it.

278
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,279
Maybe you're not, but I am!

279
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,032
You can do whatever you want with them.

280
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,995
You can expose them, hide them,
dissect them, I don't care.

281
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:05,914
I just want to be the one to bust them.

282
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,719
Okay, now what?

283
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,346
- We draw out the queen.
- How?

284
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:28,145
Okay...

285
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,984
Okay, ladies, a little bit
of help here, please.

286
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,695
Bats!

287
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,827
Who are you?

288
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,040
- Stop the attack!
- Then we'll kill all your vampires.

289
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,793
Cease!

290
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:55,088
What do you want?

291
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,591
Actually, your help.

292
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,301
We have something in common.

293
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:03,013
Neither one of us wants a certain demon
to take over the Underworld.

294
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,640
I'm listening.

295
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,517
If you help us stop him,

296
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:09,895
you can keep the Underworld
in disarray, like you like it.

297
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,981
- We'll grant you immunity.
- Immunity?

298
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,692
From us.
We'll never come after your family.

299
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,362
Better, you won't have
to answer to Zankou.

300
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,407
- Interested?
- Very.

301
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,619
Okay. Then follow us.

302
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,873
Fools.

303
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,462
What took you so long?

304
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:36,713
Where's the queen?

305
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,383
Oh, she betrayed you.
I got to her first.

306
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,720
I knew you were coming,
thanks to your premonition powers.

307
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,395
And now I have yours.

308
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:57,442
Looking for this?

309
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:08,871
Why didn't you kill them
when you had the chance?

310
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:13,250
Because I don't have
all their powers... yet.

311
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,965
Okay, easy, easy. Sit down right here.

312
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:23,218
A little help down here, please!
A little healing!

313
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,804
They're not coming down.
We're on our own now.

314
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,765
Yeah, two powers down.

315
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:32,102
Something tells me we're not
getting out of this one, girls.

316
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,862
Sorry.

317
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:45,991
Why does Zankou keep picking on me?
Why can't he attack one of you two?

318
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,785
Makes you feel better,
I think I'm gonna be next.

319
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:52,498
He must have gotten the potion
from the Book to steal our powers.

320
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:56,376
He's two-thirds of the way there,
unless he's got enough to get in here.

321
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,922
He has more access to the Book.
He might figure out a way soon.

322
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:03,091
We wanted him to come after us.
Looks like we got our wish.

323
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,180
- I should get Wyatt to heal...
- I don't want to traumatise him again.

324
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:10,432
He's gonna be traumatised soon enough.

325
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,976
I mean, who are we kidding?
We're screwed.

326
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,979
If we're going down,
we are not going down alone.

327
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:19,483
- We can't think like that.
- Leo, come on, it's over.

328
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,320
He's got our house, he's got our
Book, he's got two of our powers.

329
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:26,907
The only question is whether or not
we can take him down with us.

330
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,036
I can't believe we're
having this conversation.

331
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:32,371
Well, believe it.

332
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,082
How do we do it?

333
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:38,460
We've gotta get that spell
that destroys the Nexus.

334
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:40,712
And how is that gonna destroy Zankou?

335
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:43,340
We let the Nexus take in Zankou first.

336
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:47,177
And then cast the spell,
hit two birds with one stone.

337
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,096
Don't you mean five?

338
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:51,765
We're gonna have
to be in there to say the spell.

339
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:55,894
- Can't we say it from here?
- Not and get the timing right, no.

340
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:59,857
Well, it's been...
nice knowing you ladies.

341
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:05,153
What was that?

342
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:11,326
So close.

343
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,579
There must be another way in.

344
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,667
You're wasting valuable time.

345
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,295
You need to take in the Nexus, now.

346
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:25,048
No, I need to get into Magic School
and get their last power.

347
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,217
Listen to me!

348
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,678
This is a trick!

349
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:33,473
They're drawing you to them
so you won't go after the Nexus!

350
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,018
Don't you see that? They're playing you!

351
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:40,230
- You're gonna get us killed.
- I know what I'm doing.

352
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,191
No, you don't.

353
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,576
And I had such high hopes for you.

354
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,555
Do you have picture?

355
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:17,267
Yeah, we're good. You be careful.

356
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:18,977
Don't worry.

357
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,831
Okay, hold hands, hold hands.

358
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,874
What are you running from?

359
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,337
Darryl!

360
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:48,298
Leo? Where did you come from?
How did you get here?

361
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:50,676
Help from Magic School.
We need to talk.

362
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:52,803
Listen, Leo, I'm done talking, man.

363
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,640
It's not just about the girls.
It's about Sheridan.

364
00:25:57,975 --> 00:25:59,268
What about Sheridan?

365
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:03,188
I know she's investigating the girls.
But keep her away from the house.

366
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,190
Something big is gonna go down.

367
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:07,860
Are they okay?

368
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,152
Leo, what is it?

369
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,322
You're stuck in the middle of this
and for that I'm sorry.

370
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,325
But we need you to keep them
away from the house,

371
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,286
for everybody's sake.

372
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:20,914
I gotta go.

373
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,583
Take care.

374
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:26,378
Hey, Leo...

375
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:31,550
- Sheila, baby...
- No, Darryl, you promised.

376
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:34,803
Baby, I can't just
leave them high and dry.

377
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:40,309
Look, there is nothing
more important to me

378
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,227
than you and those kids, nothing!

379
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:46,440
If we're about building a better future
for our family, I have to help!

380
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:49,443
Isn't that what they're fighting for?

381
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:55,574
Please, promise me
this will be the last time?

382
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:58,535
I promise.

383
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,839
Hey, what the?

384
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,801
- What's going on? Who are you?
- Who are you?

385
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,846
She asked you a question!

386
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:20,057
Victor. Victor Bennett.

387
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,018
Do you think it's really him?

388
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:26,563
If it was Zankou,
he would have attacked us by now.

389
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:30,692
What?

390
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,362
Sorry, Dad, it's the only way
we could be sure.

391
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:36,490
We didn't want Zankou
to know we were coming.

392
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,826
Zankou? Who is Zankou?

393
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,786
Long story.

394
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,080
It's safe!

395
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,125
Hey.

396
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:50,754
- What the hell is going on?
- Thank you, sweetie.

397
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:52,589
Is the guest bedroom that way?

398
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:54,508
Yeah.

399
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,468
Come on, baby.

400
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:02,349
Look, Dad, we're running out of time.

401
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:06,687
And there's no gentle way to break
this to you, so I'm just gonna say it.

402
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,730
We're in some serious trouble.

403
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,608
What kind of trouble?

404
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,777
The kind we can't get out of.

405
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:19,158
Here is the deed to P3
and the house, already signed.

406
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:22,786
Bank accounts, power of attorney
and the schedule for the boys.

407
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:25,080
What? I'm not gonna take that.

408
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:27,791
Dad, you have to. We need you to.

409
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,293
You're all we have.

410
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,086
We can't explain everything.

411
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:35,007
You just need to know
this is our only choice. Please!

412
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:38,093
For them.

413
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:42,764
I don't understand. Are you saying
I'm never gonna see you again?

414
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,475
No, never say never.

415
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:48,937
Not in this family.

416
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:58,906
Hey.

417
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,699
Hey. How'd it go?

418
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:03,160
As well as can be expected.

419
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:07,122
You know, we're doing the right thing.

420
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:09,082
I hope so.

421
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:14,087
Hey buddy, can I see you
for two seconds?

422
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:18,175
Come here, come here.
Just two seconds, come here. Listen.

423
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:22,137
I want you to know that Mommy
will always be close, okay?

424
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,556
I'll always be with you.

425
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:27,267
Okay, give me a hug.
Quick, quick, quick.

426
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:36,151
I love you so much.

427
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:37,694
We have to go, you guys.

428
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,613
Okay.

429
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,698
Be a good boy.

430
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,537
Baby, come here!

431
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,833
Be a good boy for Grandpa, okay?

432
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,543
My sweet baby.

433
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,004
Okay.

434
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:14,189
Let's get this over with.

435
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:31,206
I don't think anybody's home.

436
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:34,293
Get out of there, Inspector.
We'll try again later.

437
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,087
Let me just check the attic.

438
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:41,091
No! I don't like it. Just turn around.

439
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:43,177
Look, it'll just take a second.

440
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,053
No, Inspector.

441
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,055
Damn it.

442
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,398
I'm sorry, I was looking for Phoebe.

443
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:58,400
Who are you?

444
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:02,029
Get out of there, Inspector.

445
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,740
I'm Inspector Sheridan. Who are you?

446
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:06,158
How'd you get in here?

447
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:08,327
Damn it, Sheridan, go! Now!

448
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:10,662
I... I should be going.

449
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:12,664
You're not going anywhere.

450
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:16,418
What are you waiting for?
Go! Go! Go!

451
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:18,879
No!

452
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:20,255
What the?

453
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:23,967
Call FBI, SWAT, Special Forces, Hazmat,
everybody, we're going in.

454
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,136
Go! Go!

455
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:32,226
We only have one shot. We can't miss.

456
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:36,063
We gotta get to the Book and convince it
that we believe in ourselves.

457
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,023
- We do, don't we?
- Absolutely.

458
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,609
Just feels kind of strange,
doing it this way.

459
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:44,363
I wish we'd learned how to do it
earlier. It would have come in handy.

460
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:48,742
Prue was really protective of it. I'm
just glad she showed Leo how to do it.

461
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:56,375
So this is Magic School. How quaint.

462
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:59,002
- What took you so long?
- Patience is a virtue.

463
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:03,507
I can't begin to tell you how long I've
been looking forward to this moment,

464
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:08,178
a moment no demon
has ever enjoyed... until now.

465
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:09,471
Book!

466
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:15,269
Must we go through this?

467
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,249
Paige, get out of here!

468
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:38,792
No, not without you two!

469
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,544
Inseparable to the end.

470
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:43,255
But first things first.

471
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,385
Your power, please.

472
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,015
What's happening?

473
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:02,608
What?

474
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:09,865
The astral projecting worked.

475
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,075
Thank you, Prue.

476
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:13,327
The Book.

477
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:22,252
Okay, this may be
the last time we have to say this.

478
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:23,962
I'll hold you to it.

479
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:26,215
The power of three will set us free

480
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,467
The power of three will set us free

481
00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:31,428
The power of three will set us free

482
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:44,191
What?

483
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:02,292
Move, move!

484
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:26,525
All right, nobody gets in or out,
you got that?

485
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:30,404
Nobody! I want this place
completely surrounded, over!

486
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,043
- What happened?
- I don't know.

487
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,213
If they come before we get Zankou,
it'll be a blood bath.

488
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,340
Come on, we've gotta find that spell.

489
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:57,723
I underestimated you.
It won't happen again.

490
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,395
What the hell was that?

491
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:07,316
It's probably the same thing that got
Sheridan. Everybody, listen up.

492
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:10,527
On my command, we storm the place.
Everybody in position.

493
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:13,197
I wouldn't go in just yet if I were you.

494
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:24,750
You're too late.
You can't take the Nexus.

495
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:29,421
It's been in me. It knows me now.

496
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:31,465
I should have done this before.

497
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:02,746
You can't stop me now.

498
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:05,249
- No?
- Watch us.

499
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:07,376
From ancient time this power came

500
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:09,461
For all to have, but none to reign

501
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:13,966
Take it now, show no mercy
For this power can no longer be

502
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:24,017
This is it!

503
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:39,575
Holy God.

504
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:41,869
Aren't you glad I told you to wait?

505
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,668
Yeah, this way.

506
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:56,216
Upstairs, up the stairs. Follow me.

507
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:03,640
- Follow me upstairs.
- Watch your backs, team leaders.

508
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:06,643
Nobody goes in any room alone.

509
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:21,283
Air's good. It's all clear.

510
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:26,079
- What happened?
- I don't know yet.

511
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:33,295
See anything?

512
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:36,048
- Nothing yet.
- Check that out.

513
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:45,307
My God.

514
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:48,519
Looks like a bomb went off in here.

515
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:50,604
House secure, nobody's inside.

516
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:53,607
Copy that. What do you have?

517
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:56,568
I have some hydrogen isotopes...

518
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:58,570
...plasma...

519
00:37:58,737 --> 00:37:59,988
...no uranium.

520
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:02,032
Damn. Nothing.

521
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,826
Thank God nobody was in here.

522
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,286
Who said nobody was?

523
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:09,122
Your man said the house was secure.

524
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:12,417
But the Halliwell sisters were inside.
I saw them myself.

525
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:13,627
What?

526
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:16,171
We'd have spotted them if they'd left.

527
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:18,507
There was no way they got out alive.

528
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:28,016
There's gotta be another way
out of here.

529
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:35,190
Oh, dear God, please.

530
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:49,121
- I gotta get through. Coming through.
- Where do you think you're going?

531
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:50,789
- It's my house.
- You got ID?

532
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:52,624
- No.
- You're not getting past.

533
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,836
- It's my wife!
- You're not getting past! Understand?

534
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:59,214
Yeah.

535
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:06,805
- What's going on?
- What? I don't know.

536
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:10,475
Boy, I sure hope nobody died in there.

537
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:12,269
What?

538
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:16,940
Do we know each other?

539
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:19,234
Yeah, I think so.

540
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:20,861
After all...

541
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:22,946
...we're married.

542
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,001
What?

543
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:37,961
It's all part of the plan.

544
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:40,506
- Plan? What plan?
- Our plan to die.

545
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:43,759
It's the only way to get our lives back,
our normal lives.

546
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:47,095
And to stop everybody from
coming after us, including them.

547
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:48,472
- But...
- No, no buts.

548
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:51,975
We're free. Nobody knows
we're alive, not even the demons.

549
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:55,729
They think we died with Zankou.
They were just our astral selves.

550
00:39:57,397 --> 00:40:01,568
Sweetie, we can start all over again.
No more demon fighting, ever again.

551
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,988
- Unless the demons figure it out.
- Which may be never.

552
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:09,243
- I don't know what to say.
- Just say you're okay with it.

553
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:13,205
So we can get the next generation
ready, to pick up where we left off.

554
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:14,414
How do I do it?

555
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:17,000
You don't, we do.

556
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,086
We'll make you good-looking.

557
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,180
Cute. I can live with that.

558
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:02,588
Well, all right!

559
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:05,424
All right.
