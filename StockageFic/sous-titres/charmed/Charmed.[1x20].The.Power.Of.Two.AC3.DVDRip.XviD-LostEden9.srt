1
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,258
Prue, have you seen my purse?

2
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,177
In the kitchen.
Have you seen my keys?

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,971
They're by the TV.

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,435
I can't find my plane ticket.

5
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,606
- Did I give it to you?
- Maybe you packed it.

6
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,775
I didn't pack it. I just saw it.

7
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,706
- I can't believe it. It worked.
- Found it.

8
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,876
Didn't you hear me looking for this?
What are you doing on the furniture?

9
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,212
No, you don't understand. I've been
practicing how to call a premonition,

10
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,799
and I did it. I saw a future event
on command.

11
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,845
Oh, and that's the good news. The bad
news is I saw you missing your flight.

12
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:59,059
Oh, great. If I don't get to Honolulu for
the convention, my boss will fire me.

13
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,602
We can't let that happen,

14
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,104
especially since my job's hanging
by a thread as it is.

15
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,815
- Since when?
- Oh, since all the demon-hunting

16
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:10,236
- time-off I've been taking lately.
- I am so behind. I didn't go shopping

17
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:15,200
or pay the bills or call the cable guy
or cancel my hair appointment.

18
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,160
Don't worry about it, sweetie,
I'll do it.

19
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,579
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I mean, you've got time, right?

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,999
Okay, so listen, we have stopped
Phoebe's premonitions

21
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:26,961
from coming true before.
Hopefully we can do it again. Let's go.

22
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,588
Okay, but wait, wait.

23
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:34,260
I just realized the two of you haven't
really ever been alone together.

24
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:38,389
Piper, we're big girls now. I don't think
we need you as a buffer anymore.

25
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,057
Well, what about demon stuff?

26
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:43,019
What if something happens
and you need the power of three?

27
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,022
Well, then the power of two
will just have to do.

28
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,150
- Good one.
- All right, let's go.

29
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,319
Hey, Phoebe,
will you pick up my dry cleaning

30
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:54,113
on the way back from the market,
please?

31
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,074
Yeah, and talk to the gardeners
about the weeds.

32
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:01,120
- And light bulbs, we need light bulbs.
- Sure, I'll just add it to my list.

33
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,332
- Great, thanks. Bye.
- Go, go.

34
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,754
I'm not even married,
and already I'm a housewife.

35
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,634
Hello. Hey, Marianne.

36
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:19,388
Oh, jeez, I completely forgot
about Alcatraz.

37
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:23,017
No, I can't go.
I have a million errands to run.

38
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:27,479
You know what, I'll be right over.

39
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:38,032
You don't seriously plan
on spending the rest

40
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:39,742
of eternity marooned here, do you?

41
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,245
I'll find a way off this rock
on my own, don't worry.

42
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:47,082
Who are you kidding, Jackson?

43
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:49,752
You've been stuck here ever since
they executed you.

44
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,922
Thirty-six long years,
trapped between life and death.

45
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:55,758
Big deal.

46
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,596
I've learned how
to do things in that time,

47
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:06,101
break the physical plane,
prepare for my revenge.

48
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:09,062
Revenge, how mortal.

49
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:11,106
Go to hell.

50
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,443
That's what I do, only never alone.

51
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:18,780
I ferry souls there, every one I can
get my little hands on, so to speak.

52
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,199
Yeah, well, you're not
gonna get your little hands

53
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,368
on this one, lady, so just forget it.

54
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:26,246
Don't worry, Jackson.
I don't want your soul.

55
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:31,209
I want a witch's.
They're prize catches. Trophies.

56
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:33,003
So, what's that got to do with me?

57
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:38,341
If you let me get you off the island
to get your revenge,

58
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:40,010
witches will try to stop you.

59
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:45,098
And the only way they can do that
is to become vulnerable to me.

60
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:47,392
Then I'll have them right
where I want them.

61
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:52,564
Speaking of witches.

62
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:55,984
Twenty-eight inmates died here,
nine while attempting to escape,

63
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:57,902
and four by execution.

64
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:02,699
Legend has it that one of them
still haunts the prison to this very day.

65
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:05,827
The ghost of Alcatraz,
believed to reside in this very cell.

66
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:09,998
- The ghost, oh, jeez.
- Let's see if he's in, shall we?

67
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:23,052
Now, if you listen closely, you can
actually hear the ghost's cries.

68
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:28,182
There, hear him?

69
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:29,851
What an idiot.

70
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,230
Look at him as your
"get out of jail free" card.

71
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:39,277
- Oh, my God.
- Marianne, call 911, quick.

72
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:43,573
What did you do? Who are you?

73
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:46,200
- You can see me?
- Forget her for now.

74
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:49,537
There's your ride off the island.
Hop in.

75
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:53,791
Oh, no. No, what are you...? Don't...

76
00:04:58,462 --> 00:05:02,425
Hope you enjoyed the tour. See you.

77
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:41,690
Bye.

78
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:56,538
In all honesty, Prue, if it weren't
for you, I'm not sure the auction house

79
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:58,957
would've been able
to stave off bankruptcy.

80
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:02,127
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't thank me yet.

81
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:05,547
Now, I have tolerated
your unexplained absences

82
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:08,508
and the endless family emergencies,

83
00:07:08,717 --> 00:07:12,387
but no more. Buyers interested in
purchasing Buckland's will be visiting

84
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:15,557
in the next two days, and it's important
we make a big impression.

85
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,311
It's important that you make
a big impression

86
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,065
if you expect to keep your job.
Do I make myself clear?

87
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:26,234
Perfectly.

88
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:28,903
I'm sorry, Prue, but your sister's
on the phone.

89
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:30,905
I'll call her back.

90
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:33,658
She says it's an emergency.

91
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:37,829
Hey, have you ever heard of
the ghost of Alcatraz?

92
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:40,581
Are you kidding me? This is why
you pulled me out of a meeting?

93
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:44,377
<i>No, Prue, you don't understand.
I think the ghost really exists.</i>

94
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:48,047
- Did you see it?
- No, of course not,

95
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:51,467
I mean, how could I?
I wasn't at Alcatraz.

96
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:53,886
I had way too much work
around here to do.

97
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:56,430
So then what makes you think
that there was a ghost?

98
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,270
My friend saw it. Marianne.
You know Marianne.

99
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:05,106
Actually, she thinks she saw
two ghosts.

100
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:08,025
<i>Or the other one may be something
else. She's not really sure.</i>

101
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:10,319
- Phoebe.
- What? Witches aren't the only people

102
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:13,322
that can see ghosts.
Normal people can too.

103
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:17,201
<i>Anyway, I did some research,
and I found out that some evil spirits</i>

104
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,037
need a dead body to transport them
across water.

105
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:23,708
Okay, look, I'm really sorry that
the furnace exploded,

106
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:26,085
but you're gonna have to handle it
on your own, okay?

107
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:28,254
Okay, but if this ghost is on
the mainland...

108
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:30,589
Don't forget to buy tampons
at the market.

109
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:32,633
Hello?

110
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:34,927
Just:

111
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,889
Singed eyebrows.

112
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,147
You take some of the old case files
home with you by any chance?

113
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:49,275
No. Why?

114
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,193
Missing a couple.

115
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,113
Hope the captain's
not reviewing them.

116
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,241
You wanna talk about it?

117
00:08:59,535 --> 00:09:01,495
Talk about what?

118
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:04,289
About why you've been walking
around here like a zombie lately.

119
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:06,417
Like ever since you ran into
Prue again.

120
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:09,628
Come on, what's up?

121
00:09:10,337 --> 00:09:11,922
I wish I could tell you.
I really do.

122
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:15,133
I just have to work things out
on my own first.

123
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:21,223
Okay, you guys are the experts on
the freaky cases. Figure this one out.

124
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:25,644
Victim was stabbed 13 times
in the chest, circular pattern.

125
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:28,981
CSI combed the scene and, other than
the knife, found no evidence.

126
00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:31,817
Except, check this out.

127
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:34,152
Solid thumbprint.

128
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,321
Yeah, but we didn't get it
from dusting.

129
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,533
- We got it from fluoroscoping.
- Ultraviolet fingerprint.

130
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:41,993
- Never heard of that.
- We ran the print.

131
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:45,580
This is where it gets freaky.
It matches up to Jackson Ward,

132
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:49,501
the serial killer that was executed
at Alcatraz 36 years ago.

133
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:53,004
- You sure about this?
- Checked it twice.

134
00:09:53,213 --> 00:09:56,800
Dead guy's prints on a murder
weapon. It's gotta be a mistake.

135
00:09:57,926 --> 00:09:59,970
Can I borrow this?

136
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:02,722
Whoa, where are you going?

137
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:07,519
Phoebe, I'm home.

138
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,277
Phoebe.

139
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:18,780
Phoebe, you didn't go
to the market yet?

140
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:22,283
Oh, no. I sort of got sidetracked
with this ghost research.

141
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,828
Besides, there isn't enough money
in the household account.

142
00:10:25,286 --> 00:10:27,747
You should've told me.
I would've had some transferred in.

143
00:10:27,914 --> 00:10:31,668
- What about the dry cleaning?
- I will go tomorrow, I swear.

144
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:33,920
I wanted to wear that suit
to work tomorrow.

145
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:38,675
Look, I know that I promised, but this
just sort of seemed more important.

146
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:45,515
We're not gonna get into
a fight already, are we?

147
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:48,101
I mean, I wouldn't wanna
prove Piper right.

148
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:59,278
- Andy, hi.
- Hi.

149
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:04,242
I was wondering if I'd see you again.
I thought maybe you were mad at me.

150
00:11:04,784 --> 00:11:08,287
No, I just needed some space.

151
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:10,540
It's one thing to suspect
what your secret was.

152
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:13,251
It's another thing to actually see it
with my own eyes.

153
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,878
So does that mean that maybe
you're okay with it?

154
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:20,883
Actually, I'm here on a case.
The kind of case where, frankly,

155
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:25,554
before, I'd probably be looking for
a more logical explanation.

156
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:27,431
Well, come on in.

157
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,104
So, what's the case?

158
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:36,440
The son of a former DA
was brutally murdered.

159
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:38,442
The only quote-unquote
"evidence" points

160
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:40,444
to the last man executed
on Alcatraz

161
00:11:40,653 --> 00:11:43,614
- before it was closed down.
- Jackson Ward.

162
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:46,909
- How'd you know that?
- Yeah, how did you know that?

163
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:48,994
I told you, I was trying to figure out

164
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:51,080
who the ghost of Alcatraz was,
remember?

165
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:53,457
Jackson Ward's name
was at the top of the list.

166
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:56,961
- Ghost?
- Yeah. Hey, what's that?

167
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:00,631
Ultraviolet fingerprint. Although,
technically, there's no such thing.

168
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:05,260
Could be the ghost's ectoplasm.
It's outside the visual spectrum.

169
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:08,597
<i>- Book of Shadows.
- Ectoplasm.</i>

170
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:13,936
Yeah, it's the ghost's skin. Hey, do you
have a picture of this Ward guy?

171
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,524
Yep, that's him.

172
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,362
Exactly how Marianne described
him to me.

173
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:25,447
- Amazing.
- Very.

174
00:12:25,656 --> 00:12:28,909
And what about this former DA's son?
Did Ward know him?

175
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:31,411
Ward knew his father.

176
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,665
He was the prosecutor
who convicted him.

177
00:12:35,123 --> 00:12:37,501
Coincidence? I think not.

178
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:40,128
It's gotta be the ghost who
got off Alcatraz.

179
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:42,881
You know, speaking of coincidences,
don't you think

180
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,342
it's an awfully big one that your friend
saw this ghost?

181
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:47,219
Prue, if we've learned
anything by now,

182
00:12:47,385 --> 00:12:51,181
- it's there are no coincidences, right?
- Right.

183
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:52,891
Right.

184
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:56,061
Andy, are you okay?

185
00:12:56,686 --> 00:13:01,358
I don't know. I'm just getting used to
the idea of demons and witches.

186
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:03,526
I don't know if I'm ready for ghosts too.

187
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:06,488
- You ain't seen nothing yet.
- Pheebs.

188
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:09,366
If you're right, if it is the ghost
of Ward who's the killer,

189
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,744
how do I stop him from
killing again?

190
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:36,309
Judge Renault.

191
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:40,396
Long time no see.

192
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:48,363
You could've shown some mercy,
given me life in prison,

193
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,531
but you wanted me put to death.

194
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:05,630
What's going on?

195
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:10,301
Who's there?

196
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,015
Do you have any idea how long
it takes to die in a gas chamber?

197
00:14:16,182 --> 00:14:22,021
How much you suffer, what a cruel
and horrible death it is?

198
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:32,323
No.

199
00:14:41,832 --> 00:14:44,001
I helped you get your revenge.

200
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:47,421
Now it's your turn to help me
get a witch.

201
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,218
Are you kidding, lady?
I'm just getting started.

202
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:07,024
Thirteen stab wounds, circular pattern,
just like the other victim.

203
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:08,984
Matches Jackson Ward's M.O. too.

204
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:11,653
Must be a copycat killer.

205
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,365
How would he know? The M.O.
Was never released to the public.

206
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:18,243
Can I see that?

207
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:21,121
Already dusted for prints. Nothing.

208
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,499
- Did you fluoroscope it?
- What?

209
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:35,761
- What the hell is that?
- Don't ask.

210
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,057
Ten bucks says it matches Ward's.

211
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:43,560
Andy, don't go jumping off
the deep end on me, okay?

212
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:46,938
Jackson Ward is dead,
been that way for a long time now.

213
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:49,691
Well, somebody's going around
killing people, or the descendants

214
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:53,278
- of people who put him away.
- Where are you going?

215
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,949
Look, have someone put together
a list of potential victims.

216
00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:00,285
Anybody who had anything to do
with his conviction.

217
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:02,954
Andy, wait. Wait.

218
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:15,383
I'm sure Prue will be here shortly.
She has a lot of...

219
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,594
...family emergencies.

220
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,181
- Claire, I am so sorry.
- Let me introduce you.

221
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,641
This is Mr Yakihama,
head of Acquisitions.

222
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,312
Mr Yakihama, this is Prue Halliwell,
one of our top specialists.

223
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:30,523
- Hi, nice to meet you, sir.
- Nice to meet you too.

224
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,777
I trust everything's all right
with your family?

225
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:37,655
- Excuse me, Prue.
- Not now, Monique.

226
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:41,326
- May I help you?
- Yeah, I need to see Ms Halliwell.

227
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:43,077
It's police business.

228
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:47,498
Excuse me.

229
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,627
Are you trying to get me fired?

230
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:54,589
I think Jackson Ward
has killed again, Prue.

231
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:58,801
Great. That's great. Why don't you
just wait here a second.

232
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:02,513
I'll take care of everything. Hi.

233
00:17:12,106 --> 00:17:15,860
- Phoebe?
- Yeah, I'm up in the attic.

234
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,992
<i>- I always wondered what was up here.
- Prue. The Book...</i>

235
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:27,038
No, it's okay. I already told him about it.
Look, Jackson Ward has killed again.

236
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,957
We have to figure out a way to stop
him. Have you found anything?

237
00:17:30,124 --> 00:17:32,543
Not really. I mean, there's
just so many references in here.

238
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,005
There's ghosts, poltergeists,
evil spirits, phantasms.

239
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:39,216
We are not dealing with
a typical demon.

240
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:44,430
Yeah, well, there has to be something
in here about vanquishing an evil spirit.

241
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,558
Well, actually, there is one spell,

242
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:49,560
but I don't think we're gonna
wanna use it.

243
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,353
Why not?
If it needs the power of three,

244
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,855
we can always call Piper, right?

245
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:54,398
No, that's not the problem.

246
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:57,860
The problem is an evil spirit can't be
vanquished on the physical plane,

247
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:00,529
only the astral plane. His plane.

248
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,323
Okay, so then how do we
say the spell?

249
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,826
Well, our spirits would have to say it.

250
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,997
Meaning one of us would have
to die for it to actually work.

251
00:18:10,998 --> 00:18:13,417
- Keep looking.
- Right.

252
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:20,716
I've always believed there was another
world behind or beyond this one.

253
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:27,473
I even sort of believe in demons, but I
have never in my wildest dreams...

254
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,184
I could never have imagined
that this existed.

255
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:33,270
Yeah, neither did we.

256
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:35,856
But we've come to believe

257
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:39,610
that there's a reason for why that world
was opened up to us.

258
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:42,154
Which means there's probably
a very good reason

259
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,780
why it was opened up to you too.

260
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,326
Welcome to our little shop
of horrors.

261
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:52,247
- Are you doing that?
- No, it just sometimes does it on its...

262
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:57,794
...own.
- "The Truth Spell"?

263
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:02,507
It's weird that it would open up to that
page with Andy standing right here.

264
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:06,803
Okay, you know what,
it has to be a mistake, Phoebe.

265
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:11,725
Or maybe there's a reason, Prue.

266
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:18,648
- You did what last year?
- Look, I just wanted to see

267
00:19:18,815 --> 00:19:20,942
how you would react to finding out
I was a witch.

268
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:23,570
So you cast a truth spell on me?
Why didn't you just ask?

269
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:25,905
Oh, because I was afraid you'd
freak out on me.

270
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:28,199
Which is exactly what you did,
by the way.

271
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,577
You just don't remember.
Part of the spell.

272
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:33,288
Wait a minute.
My reaction to your being a witch

273
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,623
isn't the reason we stopped seeing
each other, is it?

274
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,333
You wanted to stop seeing me first.

275
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,544
Because you wouldn't say what
your secret was.

276
00:19:39,752 --> 00:19:42,797
Yeah, which turned out to be a good
thing, considering how you reacted.

277
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:45,425
- Freaked out.
- Kind of like what you're doing now.

278
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:47,010
You haven't answered my question.

279
00:19:47,177 --> 00:19:49,929
Did that have anything to do with why
we stopped seeing each other?

280
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:51,764
Sort of.

281
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,852
- Okay, yeah, it did.
- And just out of curiosity,

282
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:58,021
how much time did you give me
to react anyway?

283
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:00,606
- Why, what difference does it make?
- How much time?

284
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:03,192
A minute... or two.

285
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:04,986
- A minute?
- Or two.

286
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:08,239
It was a 24-hour spell, all right?
I was against the clock.

287
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:10,658
That's what you based your entire
decision about us on?

288
00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:13,745
I've had a week to react to it this time.
I still don't know how I feel.

289
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:15,288
You should've given me more time.

290
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:17,206
I think I deserved that.
We deserved that.

291
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,918
Hey, you guys, since we don't know
how to vanquish the ghost,

292
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:25,256
we have to try to stop him
from killing his next...

293
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,175
...victim.
Am I interrupting something?

294
00:20:28,342 --> 00:20:30,344
No, we're done.

295
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:33,097
What do you mean, stop him from
killing his next victim?

296
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:36,851
- How do we do that?
- I have a power too, you know.

297
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,449
Excuse me.

298
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:53,284
Inspector Andrew Trudeau.

299
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:57,455
I need the murder weapon
for case R-13658.

300
00:20:57,997 --> 00:20:59,707
Sign that. I'll go get it.

301
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:19,143
Thanks.

302
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:31,530
Yeah, you told me to call
if Trudeau showed.

303
00:21:31,738 --> 00:21:33,740
Yeah.

304
00:21:33,907 --> 00:21:35,242
He just left.

305
00:21:39,746 --> 00:21:41,957
Did you get that list of potential
victims yet?

306
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:44,209
Still working on it.
It's a lot of names,

307
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:47,087
especially when you add
in the descendants.

308
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:50,340
- Where you been?
- You don't wanna know.

309
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:53,468
Really? Try me.

310
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:55,512
Maybe later, okay? Look, I gotta go.

311
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,724
I'll take what you've got so far,
check back with you later.

312
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:02,561
We're partners, Andy.
That means we work together.

313
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:07,190
I know. But this is an exception.

314
00:22:09,568 --> 00:22:11,570
Inspector Morris?

315
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:14,739
Inspector Rodriguez and Anderson,
Internal Affairs.

316
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:17,826
We need to talk to you about
your partner.

317
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay, I got it.

318
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:28,128
That's what Ward used
to kill the judge.

319
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:30,171
How exactly is this gonna
work again?

320
00:22:30,338 --> 00:22:32,132
Well, I've been practicing calling
my power,

321
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:34,718
and if the psychic energy is strong
enough on this,

322
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:36,928
I should be able to see
a future event.

323
00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:39,305
Hopefully, Jackson Ward's next victim.

324
00:22:39,514 --> 00:22:43,143
If we're lucky.
It doesn't always work.

325
00:22:51,693 --> 00:22:53,778
Oh, my God.

326
00:22:53,987 --> 00:22:55,446
Are you all right?

327
00:22:55,613 --> 00:23:00,535
I didn't just see it, Prue, I felt it.

328
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:03,454
Her pain, her terror.

329
00:23:04,414 --> 00:23:07,166
Any one of these look familiar?

330
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:22,306
Iris Beiderman.

331
00:23:22,473 --> 00:23:25,935
The foreperson on the jury
that convicted him.

332
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:42,827
- You again.
- "You again"? You two have met?

333
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:44,537
Knife!

334
00:23:44,745 --> 00:23:48,207
- Where is he? Is he still here?
- Yeah, he's right there.

335
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,751
Point him out, Prue.

336
00:23:50,918 --> 00:23:52,920
You can't keep saving her forever.

337
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:56,465
- Prue, what's going on?
- Or the others.

338
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:59,844
Or yourselves.

339
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:01,929
Prue.

340
00:24:16,026 --> 00:24:17,486
I cannot believe you lied to me.

341
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:20,656
And I cannot believe I had to hear
about it from a ghost.

342
00:24:20,823 --> 00:24:22,992
I already apologized for that, okay?

343
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:25,202
I don't understand why you
couldn't tell the truth.

344
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:28,205
Especially about something as stupid
as going to Alcatraz.

345
00:24:28,414 --> 00:24:31,500
I didn't tell you the truth
because I knew you'd go ballistic,

346
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:34,044
and I thought that I would save
myself the drama.

347
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:36,171
Why would I go ballistic over that?

348
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:38,715
Come on, Prue, give me a break.
Just admit it.

349
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:41,969
- Why are you really mad at me?
- Because you lied to me.

350
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:44,763
No, you're really mad at me because,
as far as you're concerned,

351
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,517
I was slacking off yesterday, which is
pretty much what I do every day, right?

352
00:24:48,684 --> 00:24:50,018
Where is this coming from?

353
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:52,271
From the fact that I know that you're
really pissed

354
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:55,274
because I didn't do the grocery
shopping or pick up your dry cleaning

355
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,484
or whatever else you put
on that stupid list.

356
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:00,028
I am sorry that I ask you to do things
around the house

357
00:25:00,195 --> 00:25:02,572
because I have to work.

358
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:04,574
See? Time it, ladies and gentlemen.

359
00:25:04,741 --> 00:25:08,954
It took a whole 60 seconds before
the W-word reared its ugly head.

360
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:11,873
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about how you and Piper

361
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,417
just automatically assume that I'll take
care of the house

362
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:16,920
- because I don't have a real job.
- That is not true.

363
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:20,924
Oh, no? Prue, when was the last time
you went grocery shopping

364
00:25:21,132 --> 00:25:25,011
or vacuumed the house or waited all
day for the cable guy to show up?

365
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:29,766
Which, by the way, if I were paid by
the hour, I'd be a millionaire by now.

366
00:25:29,975 --> 00:25:32,269
I cannot believe how you're turning
this around.

367
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:34,562
And I cannot believe
how you're pretending

368
00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:37,190
- that you don't have a problem.
- I don't.

369
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:41,820
Okay, well, you know what? You just
proved my point, my other point,

370
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:46,074
which is I get absolutely no credit
for all that I do around here.

371
00:25:46,282 --> 00:25:48,034
It's just assumed that I'll do it.

372
00:25:48,243 --> 00:25:51,538
Like that crack that you made
to Piper yesterday morning.

373
00:25:51,704 --> 00:25:54,457
"Don't worry, Piper, Phoebe will do it.
She's got time."

374
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:57,877
- You do.
- Yes, and that is exactly my point.

375
00:25:58,044 --> 00:25:59,879
My main point.

376
00:26:00,046 --> 00:26:04,551
You're mad at me
because I don't work.

377
00:26:08,096 --> 00:26:10,390
Okay, maybe you're right.

378
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:14,519
And that's why I lied to you.

379
00:26:18,898 --> 00:26:21,317
- Hello.
- Hey, Phoebe. How's it going?

380
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:23,694
Hey, Piper, how's Hawaii?

381
00:26:23,861 --> 00:26:26,823
I don't know. I haven't stopped working
since I got off the plane.

382
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:29,033
<i>- Sure, rub it in.
- Excuse me?</i>

383
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,952
Nothing. Hey, can I call you back?

384
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,079
I'm in the middle of something
right now.

385
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:36,290
Sure. I just wanted to make sure
you guys were all right.

386
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:37,792
- Here you go.
- Do you miss me?

387
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,294
<i>- More than you know, sweetie.
- Good. I love you.</i>

388
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:43,172
<i>- We love you too. Bye.
- Bye.</i>

389
00:26:48,135 --> 00:26:49,845
Why didn't you tell her
about Jackson Ward?

390
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:55,851
Why worry her? The power of three
can't vanquish him. It's up to us.

391
00:26:57,645 --> 00:27:01,440
Look, Phoebe, obviously, we have
some issues to deal with,

392
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:04,318
but they're not gonna be
resolved overnight.

393
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:07,947
So in the meantime, we need to figure
out a way to stop Jackson Ward

394
00:27:08,114 --> 00:27:11,116
before he hurts any more innocent
people, okay?

395
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:13,786
I agree.

396
00:27:13,953 --> 00:27:19,959
Okay. So did we actually just reach
a compromise?

397
00:27:26,924 --> 00:27:29,051
- Wait a sec.
- You got it.

398
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:33,222
We're gonna put you up in a hotel
for a little while,

399
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,975
under police protection, at least until
we catch whoever's trying to hurt you.

400
00:27:37,142 --> 00:27:39,436
Okay?

401
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:41,730
Okay.

402
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,238
I'm not crazy, am I?
You saw it too, didn't you?

403
00:27:49,404 --> 00:27:51,907
Yeah, I did.

404
00:27:52,074 --> 00:27:55,536
But let's just keep it our little secret
for now, okay?

405
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,717
- Who was that?
- Someone who got attacked.

406
00:28:10,926 --> 00:28:15,305
Attacked? By who? Why?

407
00:28:15,764 --> 00:28:20,102
Iris Beiderman, the jury foreperson
who helped convict Ward.

408
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,853
Now, how about that?

409
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,022
- Look, Morris...
- Don't "Look, Morris" me, man.

410
00:28:24,189 --> 00:28:26,608
You go flying out of here with that file,
you just come back

411
00:28:26,775 --> 00:28:30,111
with somebody in that file who just
happened to have been attacked.

412
00:28:30,737 --> 00:28:32,656
Wanna tell me what's going on?

413
00:28:32,822 --> 00:28:36,660
I told you, I can't, okay? I'm sorry.

414
00:28:36,826 --> 00:28:40,413
Fine, whatever. It's your funeral.

415
00:28:40,914 --> 00:28:43,500
What's that supposed to mean?

416
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:45,251
They told me not to
say anything to you.

417
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:48,171
- Who did?
- Internal Affairs.

418
00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:50,215
They got you in their cross hairs.

419
00:28:50,423 --> 00:28:53,635
Interviewed me for over two hours.
Wouldn't tell me what it was about.

420
00:28:53,843 --> 00:28:57,097
Asked a lot of questions about you.

421
00:28:58,723 --> 00:29:01,559
Watch your back, bro.

422
00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:06,648
Well, it's the same story.
One of us has to literally die

423
00:29:06,814 --> 00:29:09,609
in order to vanquish
the evil spirit.

424
00:29:10,068 --> 00:29:12,278
- Any volunteers?
- Actually, maybe.

425
00:29:12,445 --> 00:29:16,032
But before that, we need to figure out
a way to find Ward first.

426
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:18,117
We can't count on your seeing
his next victim,

427
00:29:18,284 --> 00:29:21,287
even though Andy left us the
letter opener to try.

428
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:23,831
Wait a minute. I think that there's
something in here

429
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:25,958
about luring evil spirits.

430
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:28,294
A potion.

431
00:29:29,754 --> 00:29:31,547
"To lure an evil spirit.

432
00:29:31,714 --> 00:29:34,175
Mix equal parts of mercury and acid
with the blood

433
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:37,929
of one of the spirit's victims,
then pour it over his grave."

434
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:39,514
Okay, that's disgusting.

435
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,682
We can get the blood
from the letter opener,

436
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:43,726
but how are we gonna find
Ward's grave?

437
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:45,686
You know what? I read on the Web:

438
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:49,690
"His ashes were interred at his family
mausoleum in Palo Alto."

439
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:51,984
Great, it just might work.

440
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:57,573
Yeah, but if it does work,
he'll be coming after us.

441
00:30:06,082 --> 00:30:07,708
I hate cemeteries at night.

442
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:12,046
I hate cemeteries at day.
What was that?

443
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:15,466
Probably a zombie or a vampire.

444
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:18,761
Great, where's Buffy when you
need her?

445
00:30:18,928 --> 00:30:21,722
Okay, perfect. There it is.
"Jackson Ward."

446
00:30:21,931 --> 00:30:24,558
Do you have the picture?

447
00:30:27,102 --> 00:30:29,021
"Hey, Jackson, let's party"?

448
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:32,733
Okay, well, I couldn't think
of anything else to write.

449
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,862
- Could we just do this and hurry?
- Okay.

450
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,246
- Okay. All right, let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

451
00:31:13,357 --> 00:31:17,527
- What's happening?
- Witchcraft. Sucks, doesn't it?

452
00:31:19,071 --> 00:31:21,656
You should've helped me get
to them before, when I asked.

453
00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:25,118
- How do I get them now?
- Visit your grave.

454
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:05,700
<i>Hi, we're not home.
You know the drill.</i>

455
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:08,495
Prue, it's Andy.
I gotta give you something.

456
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:12,123
Gotta get it out of here.
I'll explain when I get there.

457
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:17,545
Inspector Trudeau? Internal Affairs.
Let's talk.

458
00:32:25,553 --> 00:32:27,972
Series of women murdered
with an occult knife.

459
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:31,893
Prime suspect missing.

460
00:32:32,226 --> 00:32:34,979
Series of victims with curious holes
burned into their foreheads.

461
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:37,857
Prime suspect missing.

462
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:42,612
Victims found in a locked room with
every bone in their bodies broken.

463
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:46,824
Victims literally scared to death.
The list goes on and on.

464
00:32:46,991 --> 00:32:49,493
You know what they all have
in common?

465
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,663
- We've been through this already.
- They're all unsolved cases, Trudeau.

466
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:57,209
- And they're all yours and Morris'.
- We've solved plenty of other cases.

467
00:32:57,418 --> 00:32:58,919
But you haven't solved these.

468
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:01,422
So the question is why?

469
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:08,346
- What are you hiding?
- I'm not hiding anything.

470
00:33:20,274 --> 00:33:21,775
You guys spy on your wives too?

471
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:23,611
Why did you check the murder
weapon out?

472
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:25,571
- I was following a hunch.
- Really?

473
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:29,408
Or were you following a ghost?
Word's out, Trudeau.

474
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:33,704
You specialize in the...
What did Inspector Blakely call it?

475
00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:37,750
- The freaky cases.
- The freaky cases.

476
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,295
You're a good cop.
I've seen your jacket.

477
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:43,672
Up until last year, you were headed
for captain.

478
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:47,634
Now you've got all these weird,
unsolved cases.

479
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,431
What happened to you, man?
What changed?

480
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:57,352
Are you covering for somebody?
Is that it? Morris, maybe?

481
00:33:57,978 --> 00:34:01,857
- Don't hang this on Morris.
- Then who do we hang it on?

482
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:05,777
Look, I told you my story.
You don't believe me,

483
00:34:05,986 --> 00:34:08,906
you take my hardware right now
and you charge me.

484
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:16,163
Otherwise, drop dead.

485
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:30,510
Maybe it didn't work.
Maybe he's not coming.

486
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:34,014
Well, at least if he is coming,
we are definitely ready for him.

487
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:39,102
- What exactly is that?
- One killer cocktail, literally.

488
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:41,229
A little bit of oleander,
some jimsonweed,

489
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:44,774
bloodroot, among other things.
Stops the heart immediately.

490
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:47,861
Okay, you're scaring me.
Where did you learn to do that?

491
00:34:48,028 --> 00:34:51,948
<i>- The Book of Shadows.
- Where, under "Dr Kevorkian"?</i>

492
00:34:52,115 --> 00:34:53,867
Whoever takes it
can be revived with CPR.

493
00:34:54,034 --> 00:34:55,744
The only catch is it has to be done

494
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,996
within four minutes to avoid
brain damage.

495
00:34:58,163 --> 00:35:00,206
Okay, Prue, that's a pretty big catch.

496
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:03,043
Yeah, well,
it's the only way to say the spell.

497
00:35:03,209 --> 00:35:06,629
It's the only chance that we have of
sending Ward where he belongs.

498
00:35:06,796 --> 00:35:10,550
But who does it?
How do we decide that?

499
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:12,302
I'll do it.

500
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:14,846
No.

501
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:22,395
Call it. Heads or tails.
And no fair, using your power.

502
00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:25,023
Tails.

503
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:30,028
- I win.
- You mean you lose.

504
00:35:30,486 --> 00:35:35,366
- Oh, well, only if you don't revive me.
- No pressure.

505
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:40,455
Phoebe, I have total confidence in you.

506
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:45,626
I'm scared, Prue.
I mean, I'm really scared.

507
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:49,630
- I think we've gone too far this time.
- We're doing what we have to do.

508
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,216
I wish Piper were here.

509
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:56,971
The swing vote,
the voice of reason.

510
00:35:57,138 --> 00:36:00,975
Look, Phoebe, I never realized
how much I probably

511
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:03,060
do take you for granted, and not just

512
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,354
for what you do
around the house, either.

513
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:10,234
Sure. You're just saying that because
you're about to die.

514
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:14,488
No. You were right about last night.
I was upset because I thought

515
00:36:14,655 --> 00:36:17,450
that you were slacking off.
But the truth is, you weren't.

516
00:36:17,616 --> 00:36:21,078
You were trying to find out who
the ghost was, and thank God you did.

517
00:36:21,287 --> 00:36:24,123
Yeah, but I totally overreacted.
I'm the one that's upset with myself

518
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,417
- for not working for a living.
- You do work.

519
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:32,256
I know, Prue. I work around the house.
But I want a job. I want a real job.

520
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:36,218
And you will find one,
when you're ready.

521
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:41,557
I can't remember the last time
we talked like this.

522
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:50,190
<i>Hi, we're not home.
You know the drill.</i>

523
00:36:52,151 --> 00:36:56,447
<i>Prue, it's Claire. You're late.
You're fired.</i>

524
00:36:57,072 --> 00:36:58,490
Phoebe, duck!

525
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:03,871
Okay, Prue, I got him.
You just hurry!

526
00:37:20,929 --> 00:37:23,890
You're making this too easy, lady.

527
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:38,321
What the hell's going on?

528
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:43,160
<i>Ashes to ashes, spirit to spirit
Take his soul, banish this evil</i>

529
00:37:45,954 --> 00:37:47,664
No!

530
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:50,292
Prue, are you home?

531
00:37:56,381 --> 00:38:00,552
<i>Ashes to ashes, spirit to spirit
Take his soul, banish this evil</i>

532
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,179
Prue?

533
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:08,101
Prue.

534
00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:13,440
<i>Ashes to ashes, spirit to spirit
Take his soul, banish this evil</i>

535
00:38:13,648 --> 00:38:15,567
Prue.

536
00:38:19,237 --> 00:38:20,738
Come on.

537
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:25,577
Andy, don't, not yet.

538
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:34,252
This is even better.
Now I get to kill a cop too.

539
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,130
Andy, behind you!

540
00:38:44,554 --> 00:38:49,559
<i>Ashes to ashes, spirit to spirit
Take his soul, banish this evil</i>

541
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:05,074
- Who are you?
- I was hoping

542
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:07,034
to take you or your sister.

543
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:09,954
But it looks like your soul is safe.

544
00:39:10,663 --> 00:39:12,915
For now.

545
00:39:15,793 --> 00:39:18,254
Come on.

546
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:22,091
Slow breaths.

547
00:39:27,721 --> 00:39:31,433
- Am I alive?
- Yeah, you are. Thank God.

548
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:37,189
What happened?

549
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:40,234
Is the ghost toast?

550
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:51,787
I'm sorry, Prue,
but I've made up my mind.

551
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:55,916
Claire, you cannot fire me, okay?
I love this job. I need this job.

552
00:39:56,125 --> 00:40:00,421
I told you I wouldn't tolerate any more
unexplained absences.

553
00:40:00,587 --> 00:40:02,965
Excuse me, Ms Pryce.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

554
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:05,551
I just wanted to stop by
and say thank you.

555
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:10,806
- Thank you, inspector? For what?
- For letting us borrow Ms Halliwell.

556
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:14,184
See, an Asian gang was smuggling
exotic jewellery antiques.

557
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:16,979
She helped us set up a sting,
bust their operation.

558
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:21,316
Really? Prue never mentioned
any of this to me before.

559
00:40:21,483 --> 00:40:23,360
Well, she couldn't compromise
her cover.

560
00:40:23,568 --> 00:40:25,737
You're welcome to call my superior,
Inspector Morris,

561
00:40:25,904 --> 00:40:28,115
and file a reimbursement claim,
if you'd like.

562
00:40:28,281 --> 00:40:31,034
No, that won't be necessary.

563
00:40:31,201 --> 00:40:34,371
Soon as you're done here,
we need to talk.

564
00:40:34,538 --> 00:40:37,082
I think I'm more than done here.

565
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:40,252
Oh, Prue.

566
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,422
Don't forget about our lunch
with the investors.

567
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:50,554
- Wouldn't want you to be late.
- I won't be. Thanks.

568
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:59,271
- I cannot believe you did that.
- Least I could do.

569
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:01,106
After all,
you did help us bust somebody.

570
00:41:01,273 --> 00:41:04,442
- Sure, he was already dead, but still...
- Well, thank you.

571
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:06,695
You're welcome.

572
00:41:11,157 --> 00:41:17,705
Listen, Prue, I've done some thinking
about the truth spell,

573
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:23,002
and I'm still kind of trying to sort
my feelings out.

574
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:27,799
But I've kind of come to the conclusion
that no matter whether I had a minute,

575
00:41:27,966 --> 00:41:31,636
a month or a year to think about it,

576
00:41:33,972 --> 00:41:36,724
it wouldn't change the truth.

577
00:41:38,184 --> 00:41:42,563
It may sound boring, but I know that
someday I want to have a normal life

578
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:48,945
to come home to. You know,
with a white picket fence,

579
00:41:49,112 --> 00:41:53,032
a two-car garage,
a screaming kid.

580
00:41:54,992 --> 00:41:58,162
But no demons.

581
00:42:00,665 --> 00:42:05,044
Maybe it's because of all the evil I deal
with every day on the job. I don't know.

582
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:09,590
You don't have to explain.
I understand.

583
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,844
Believe me, I wouldn't wanna come
home to it either, if I could avoid it,

584
00:42:14,011 --> 00:42:15,596
but I can't.

585
00:42:16,305 --> 00:42:17,765
You can.

586
00:42:36,492 --> 00:42:39,495
So did you burn Andy's file like
he suggested?

587
00:42:39,662 --> 00:42:41,705
Yeah, and you should've seen it.

588
00:42:41,872 --> 00:42:45,125
Turns out he knew a lot more about us
than he was letting on.

589
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:47,670
Still doesn't explain how he could
hear a ghost.

590
00:42:48,128 --> 00:42:50,047
- What do you mean?
- When you were a spirit,

591
00:42:50,256 --> 00:42:51,548
you said you yelled out to him,

592
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:53,676
and that's what made him
turn around in time.

593
00:42:53,842 --> 00:42:56,887
- How could he hear you?
- I don't know.

594
00:42:57,054 --> 00:42:58,889
- Hi.
- Piper.

595
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:01,350
I thought you weren't coming
back till tomorrow.

596
00:43:01,517 --> 00:43:05,979
I took an earlier flight. I had this terrible
feeling that you guys were...

597
00:43:06,688 --> 00:43:08,232
What?

598
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:11,777
Oh, I don't know,
at each other's throats, maybe.

599
00:43:11,944 --> 00:43:13,737
- Us?
- Are you kidding?

600
00:43:13,904 --> 00:43:15,489
Never.

601
00:43:15,656 --> 00:43:17,491
So nothing happened
while I was gone?

602
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:20,744
Just, you know, the same old
boring stuff.

603
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:23,163
- Hey, you need a hand?
- That would be great. Thanks.

604
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,332
Sure.

605
00:43:25,499 --> 00:43:28,335
It's good to see you.
