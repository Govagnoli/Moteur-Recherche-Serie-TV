1
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,389
Come on, I know we can
figure this out.

2
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,184
We've been saying that
for three weeks now.

3
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,603
Lady, can I get a little help
over here, please?

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,523
Okay, but you don't have to yell at me.
I feel bad enough as it is.

5
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,026
Look, it's not your fault that the
demon is one step ahead of us.

6
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:29,321
Yeah, but if I hadn't lost my powers,
we would've found him by now.

7
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:33,992
Well, you did, so we just have
to keep doing what we're doing.

8
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,577
You mean,
what you've been doing.

9
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,246
Which is pretty much everything.

10
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,874
You're like the last sister standing.
I don't know how you're doing it.

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,168
I've just been taking lots of naps.

12
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,753
Yeah, I've noticed.

13
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:50,717
You know, part of me just thinks we
should let him do his thing, you know?

14
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,179
I mean, a demon killing other demons.
Is that so bad?

15
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,891
Well, it is when we don't know
who it is or why they're doing it.

16
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,603
It could be some sort of power base
coming along to take us on.

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,188
Yeah.

18
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,982
Should we get Piper
out of Magic School?

19
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,568
No. She's safe there,
she stays.

20
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,320
There's just no rhyme or reason
to his attacks, you know?

21
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,031
They're just wacky.

22
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,788
My gut says he's gonna go after
the Smoker Demons tonight.

23
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,749
- Why?
- Because Mercury is in retrograde,

24
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,211
and that is when they surface.

25
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,547
That's an interesting theory.

26
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:33,010
Yeah, well, all I know
is that the sooner we nail this guy,

27
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:36,638
the sooner I get back to my naps.

28
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,217
Dear God.

29
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,470
Not quite. Guess again.
Run!

30
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,600
Potions worked pretty well.

31
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,728
But I still don't know why we didn't
use it on the old man instead.

32
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,064
Because we were told not to.

33
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,149
Now let's just get
out of here before...

34
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,445
- They show up.
- Nuns?

35
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,115
I don't think so.

36
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,332
Weapon thingy.

37
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,217
Thanks for saving my life again.

38
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,135
Yeah, no problem.

39
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,389
Well, at least we got a good look
at who's behind this.

40
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,225
And better yet...

41
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,185
...a clue to find them.

42
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,563
Yeah, they gotta be working
for someone else.

43
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:11,483
I mean, what powerful demons do you
know that would dress that tacky?

44
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,693
Good point.

45
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,904
- I'll go check the Book of Shadows.
- No. You've done enough already.

46
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,449
I wanna do it. You just go home
and relax, take a load off.

47
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:24,121
Okay. If you insist, l...
I think I will.

48
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,675
Candles.

49
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:45,100
A perfect man, I summon now

50
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,644
Another way I don't know how

51
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,483
Bring him now into the light

52
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,653
Come back to me, Mr. Right

53
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,166
Welcome back.

54
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:42,801
"Dear Sad in San Jose, try Viagra."

55
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,012
Horrible.

56
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,268
- Long night?
- Leo! Yeah. Hey.

57
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,563
I'm just working on trying
to find that mystery demon.

58
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,774
Trying to come up with
some summoning spells.

59
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,651
- Any luck?
- No, but I gave that thing

60
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,153
that they threw at us to Chris,

61
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,406
hoping he could get a lead with the
underworld contacts, you know?

62
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,289
"Dear Sad in San Jose, if your husband
is impotent, try a cold shower..."

63
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,458
- Nice spell.
- Give me that.

64
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,960
- Don't ask.
- I'm asking.

65
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,339
What's the matter?

66
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,468
I don't know, I just feel like
I can't do anything anymore.

67
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,470
And I'm beginning to think
that maybe I relied

68
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,430
on my powers more
than I realized.

69
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,350
No, your advice comes from your
heart, not from your powers.

70
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,978
Besides, you were an advice columnist
long before you were an empath.

71
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,688
Yeah, and before that, I was a witch.

72
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,358
And before that, I don't remember
what the hell I was.

73
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,443
I'm afraid I'm right back
to where I started.

74
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,613
Just because you don't have your
power doesn't mean you're not a witch.

75
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,449
You can still write spells,
make potions, kick ass.

76
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,287
You'll find your way again,
you just have to be patient.

77
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,998
- You promise?
- I promise.

78
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,710
And it wouldn't hurt to rely
on Paige for a while.

79
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,337
She relied on you for years.

80
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,006
Where is she, by the way?

81
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,550
She's sleeping, don't wake her.

82
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:08,720
She's exhausted. She was tossing
and turning all night last night.

83
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,891
Quiet, if my sisters find out, they'll...

84
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,685
Kill you. I know.

85
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,521
Don't worry.

86
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,439
So, what did that throwing
thing look like?

87
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,108
It's not in the Book, I checked.

88
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,069
Besides, I really wanna do this
without your help, okay?

89
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,238
Well, I came down here to help,
remember?

90
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,739
At least until the baby's born.

91
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,908
And what's gonna happen
after the baby's born?

92
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,578
- What do you mean?
- Between you and Piper.

93
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,080
Have you guys even discussed it?

94
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,498
Not exactly.

95
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:41,211
Okay, not at all. It's just...
Things keep getting in the way.

96
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,714
Well, Leo, you can't just
get the woman pregnant

97
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,090
and pretend nothing happened.

98
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,508
I'm not, okay?

99
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,886
It's just... It's complicated.

100
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,847
But it's not gonna get any less
complicated after Chris is born.

101
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,351
- You talking about me?
- No, your foetus.

102
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,354
- You find something?
- Not something. Someone.

103
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,107
- Demonatrix.
- What you do in your spare time...

104
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,650
The weapon belongs to a group

105
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,321
of deadly assassins
known as Demonatrix.

106
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,074
Find out who they work for?

107
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,619
- No, but, Leo, check this, it's...
- Dad.

108
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,621
Would it kill you to call him "Dad"?

109
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:19,666
Apparently this demon gives
his assassins vanquishing potions.

110
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,085
Charmed Ones vanquishing potions.

111
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,295
What?

112
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,880
- How is that possible?
- The Book?

113
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,924
- They wouldn't be able to get it.
- Then how?

114
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,385
Well, one of them must read minds,
like the telepath did at Magic School.

115
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,930
- Magic School.
- Mom. I better go check on her.

116
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,681
No, we'll go. You get underground,

117
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,558
follow the assassins to the demon.

118
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,060
- But...
- We'll take care of it.

119
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,187
We'll make sure nothing
happens to her. I promise.

120
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,818
I'll go wake up Paige.

121
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,743
Just a minute.

122
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,622
Sweetie, I'm sorry to wake you up.

123
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,291
Oh, no, I'm fine.

124
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,918
I'm fine, yeah, I'm up.

125
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,838
Leo and I are gonna go to Magic
School and check on Piper.

126
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,298
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

127
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,676
Don't worry. We'll let you know
if we need you.

128
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,928
- We'll call you, okay?
- Okay.

129
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,597
Okay, go back to bed.

130
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,808
My thoughts exactly.

131
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,689
I really, really do have to go.

132
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:28,110
She said not to worry about it.
So don't.

133
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,279
- I can't help it.
- Yes, you can!

134
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:34,032
That's why you made me.
To focus on yourself for once.

135
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,826
But I still have responsibilities.

136
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,203
Yes, to yourself as well.

137
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,206
To your raison d'etre.

138
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:46,128
Which, if you keep ignoring, you're
gonna be useless to your sisters.

139
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,176
I think I made you
with too many pheromones.

140
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,138
No, you made me to understand you,

141
00:09:56,305 --> 00:10:01,727
to pamper you,
to fill your every neglected need.

142
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:05,063
- Yeah, but what I really need is...
- A vacation.

143
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:11,653
Driving through Tuscany. Topless.

144
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,282
- Topless?
- Not you, the Porsche.

145
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,452
With the wind in your hair,
the sun on your face.

146
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,747
Free, unburdened, loved.

147
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,833
Okay, keep going.

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,587
Someday, I promise, I'll take
you away from all this.

149
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:32,799
But right now, you need to eat.

150
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,179
Voilá, just the way you like it.

151
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,432
Wait a second, you can do magic?

152
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,852
I can do everything that you
made me do. Remember?

153
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:49,149
Well, then. I don't mind if I do.

154
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,492
Three weeks ago I came to you.

155
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,745
And what did...? What did I say?

156
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:07,167
What was the first thing I told you?

157
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,921
Anyone? No?

158
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,424
Let me remind you.

159
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,636
Trust me!

160
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,472
Trust in me,

161
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,352
and my raison d'etre.

162
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,480
But one of you did not.

163
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,858
I specifically told you:

164
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,695
The Smoker Demons would make their
move when Mercury was in retrograde.

165
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:39,449
And I told you the sisters
would figure that out.

166
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,786
I'm sorry, Vincent. You know
that I live only to please you.

167
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,663
Shut up.

168
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:53,839
What once resided in this place
Shall soon be gone with no haste

169
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:58,802
Make this girl age in time
As punishment for her heinous crime

170
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,768
Well...

171
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,313
...any questions?

172
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:13,358
No? Good.

173
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,444
To reiterate...

174
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,033
...I don't want the sisters finding me.

175
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,868
Especially Paige.

176
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,328
Not until I'm ready.

177
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,337
Which demon are we after next?

178
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,756
Not a demon.

179
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,133
A Porsche.

180
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,262
Sorry, Piper, it must be checked out.

181
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,431
- Can I come down now?
- Not yet.

182
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,684
Check Lozordo's Book of Prophecies,
volume one.

183
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,520
Okay.

184
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,815
Levitating, not my favourite.
It's very...

185
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,901
...high.

186
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,278
- Surprise!
- Hey!

187
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,656
Hi, I didn't know
you guys were coming.

188
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:05,118
- Is something wrong?
- No, why would something be wrong?

189
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,579
Does something have to be
wrong for me to come visit?

190
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,414
Usually.

191
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:13,210
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Good, you found it. Float on down.

192
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,588
Oh, the good old days.

193
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,465
We don't wanna worry her,
remember?

194
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,842
Yes, I know it.

195
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,679
- So, what you been doing?
- Oh, you know, same old, same old.

196
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:26,181
Trying to figure out
who turns Wyatt evil.

197
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,683
By the way, have you seen Chris?

198
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,352
Yeah, we have him working
on something.

199
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,271
But nothing big,
nothing to worry about.

200
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,148
Just your everyday demon stuff.

201
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,859
Okay, well, if you see him,

202
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,361
tell him I'd like to talk to him
when he has a chance.

203
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,989
- Where are you going?
- To pee.

204
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,074
Where do we start?

205
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,659
Sigmund, is Gideon around?

206
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,411
He's conferring with the other Elders,

207
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,038
which, if I may say so,
is where you should be too.

208
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,665
Can I help you?

209
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,711
Just trying to get a premonition,
see if you're legit.

210
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,130
You don't have premonitions anymore.

211
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:00,048
It doesn't hurt to try.

212
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,303
Sigmund, have you noticed
any breaches in security?

213
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,763
Students, teachers,
anyone suspicious?

214
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,266
- None that I know of. Why?
- Never mind.

215
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,102
Just keep an eye out around Piper.

216
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,896
Of course.

217
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:16,773
Do you believe him?

218
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,233
No reason not to,

219
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,361
which means the demon could be
tapping into your mind or Paige's.

220
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,072
All right. I'll go back to the house
and keep an eye on Paige.

221
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:27,326
You stay here and maybe
you and Piper can talk.

222
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,749
- What are you doing?
- Trying to orb.

223
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,336
- You don't orb.
- Now is not the time to rub that in.

224
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:40,297
A little help here, please.

225
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,802
Hey, where did she go?

226
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,305
Back to work. Deadlines.

227
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,309
Can I help?

228
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:02,611
The Carrera S4. Excellent choice.

229
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:06,573
Turbo styling, all-wheel drive,
zero to 60 in under five seconds.

230
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,285
You wanna feel the wind in your face?
This is definitely the car for you.

231
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,663
- May I?
- Oh, absolutely.

232
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,332
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to put that out first.

233
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,125
Of course.

234
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,919
Thank you.

235
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:31,849
Beautiful, isn't it?
No other car sounds like it.

236
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,602
She'll love it. We'll take it.

237
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,021
Excellent. Cash or lease?

238
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:44,194
- No. We'll just take it.
- What?

239
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,365
No! Rolls.

240
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,830
I told you, we don't hurt innocents.

241
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,456
Well, that's a new one.

242
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,877
You!

243
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,376
Stop him! He's trying to steal it!

244
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,256
- Don't move.
- Unbelievable.

245
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,430
I promise I will have the column
in by the deadline.

246
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,307
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm finishing up.

247
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,353
I gotta go. Ticktock, ticktock.

248
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,272
- Finally. Where have you been?
- Jail.

249
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,982
- What?
- Don't worry. It's fine.

250
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,985
Nobody saw me orb out and I talked
to Darryl. He's gonna cover for me.

251
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,570
How did you end up in jail?

252
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,073
Let's say I had a little run-in
with our mystery demon.

253
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,367
And when I say run-in,
I mean literally.

254
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:17,079
The guy, he tried to run me over
with his Porsche. Not cool!

255
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,958
A demon that drives a Porsche?
That's different.

256
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,835
So is one who can orb
and saves innocents.

257
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,796
Forget tapping into us.
It sounds like he wants to be us.

258
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,966
- Why?
- Why else? To kill us.

259
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,470
- Did you find him? Where is he?
- Yeah. He's here.

260
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:37,724
- Here? Where here?
- Paige.

261
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,435
Paige, are you oka...?

262
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,063
- What are you doing?
- You?

263
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,109
Just napping?

264
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,868
Paige, I don't even
wanna talk about this!

265
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,953
I mean, how could you
do such a thing?

266
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,247
Oh, what, like you've never
conjured stuff before?

267
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,834
Yeah, well, never for myself
and never a sex toy!

268
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,211
- I am not a sex toy.
- Quiet, you.

269
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:09,214
- Well, we did it for Piper before.
- Yes, but that was different.

270
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:13,135
We were trying to convince her to not
give up on love. We were desperate.

271
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,137
Well, maybe I am too.

272
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:17,806
Excuse me, shouldn't we be focusing
on the bigger issue here?

273
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,353
- How long has this been going on?
- About three weeks.

274
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,023
- Three weeks!
- Give or take.

275
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,735
You're the one who kept telling me
I needed a break.

276
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,820
Yes, but I meant take a day off,
you know,

277
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:35,115
go to the spa, have a pedicure,
get a massage!

278
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,284
I massage her.

279
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,246
Breathe. Okay, what I
wanna know is,

280
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,916
how come when we were scrying
for the demon, we got him?

281
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,084
- I don't know.
- You might wanna know

282
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,754
because he looks a lot like
the guy who just tried to kill me.

283
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,839
What? Now, that is impossible.

284
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:54,760
Didn't the demon start killing the
other demons around the same time?

285
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:58,430
I'm telling you, there is no way he's
a demon, I made him to be good.

286
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,391
Well, maybe you also made
one to be bad. I don't know.

287
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,102
- No!
- How do you explain the scrying, then?

288
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,605
And the fact that he makes potions
and has your powers?

289
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,941
Talk about your
personal-gain consequences.

290
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:13,153
Personal gain. I am so tired... If I hear
those two words again, I tell you what...

291
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,783
Nevertheless, it's there for a reason.
It's why Phoebe lost her powers.

292
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,202
Whose side are you on?

293
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:23,664
I know what you know, Paige.
And we both know they're right.

294
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,750
Well, did you conjure him
or clone him?

295
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,043
Okay, this is so stupid.

296
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,879
Why don't we just un-conjure him
so they'll both go away?

297
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:33,507
I can't. I make him to last
for 24 hours.

298
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,092
The spell's not done yet.

299
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,221
Great, so how long
do we have to wait?

300
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,557
Like till after midnight.

301
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,644
Well, let's just hope we find him
before he finds us.

302
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,524
Maybe that's another one of your
suitors you've conjured

303
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,776
for your own personal
gain and pleasure.

304
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,319
Oh, I hope so.

305
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:55,863
No offence.

306
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:01,285
Hey, Darryl,
now's not really a good time.

307
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,078
I'm here about Chris.

308
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,622
Yeah, he told me you covered for him,
that was great.

309
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,585
- I'm taking him back.
- What?

310
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,129
Wait, what's going on?

311
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,630
- Take him back to county.
- Hey!

312
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,966
- A little help, please?
- What do you want me to do?

313
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,802
- Let's go.
- Chris, don't worry, we'll figure it out.

314
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:22,097
- Darryl?
- No.

315
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:25,517
Don't even ask.
This time it's by the book.

316
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:27,603
- Do you understand?
- Why?

317
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:31,523
Why? Because I almost got killed
covering for you last time, that's why.

318
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,360
Okay, but we always
almost get killed.

319
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:38,655
Well, last time was different.
Way different.

320
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,490
I'm not going through that again.

321
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:46,121
I'm not putting my family through
that again. You understand?

322
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:47,998
We'll just have to get him
out ourselves.

323
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,792
And risk exposing magic?
I don't think so.

324
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:55,047
Listen to me, Phoebe.
I'm not covering for you anymore.

325
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:58,133
I mean it.

326
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,058
Could this day get any worse?

327
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,567
- Well?
- The car is waiting for you.

328
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,611
As you wish.

329
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:21,323
It's beautiful this time of year, isn't it?
In Florence.

330
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,659
As good a place as any
to kill a Charmed One.

331
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:26,870
It's not for killing one.
It's for loving one.

332
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,122
For loving Paige.

333
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,583
But I thought you said that...

334
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,460
That's for after.

335
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:35,504
When she's by my side.

336
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:39,216
When I can give her what she wants
more than anything.

337
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:43,428
Freedom, independence, power.

338
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,390
But doesn't she already have power?

339
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,267
Not the kind that gives
her independence.

340
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:55,274
Still, with all due respect,
how do you know what she wants?

341
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:58,026
Because it's what I want.

342
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,444
We are one and the same.

343
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:03,198
I exist solely to please her.

344
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,076
And I intend on doing exactly that.

345
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:07,452
How will you get to her?

346
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,747
I won't have to.

347
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:11,957
She'll come to me.

348
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:17,212
After all, she knows my every move.

349
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,938
What?

350
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,442
Nothing.

351
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:44,281
What?

352
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:46,158
Nothing.

353
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,869
I mean, thanks for helping with this.

354
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,371
Well, he's my son too.

355
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,040
Yeah, what about your other son?

356
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:54,791
How are you and Chris
getting along?

357
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,586
- Better?
- I hope so. I don't know.

358
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:00,130
I mean, it is so hard
for me to wrap my mind

359
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,758
around the idea
that he has issues with me

360
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:06,303
because he hasn't even technically
been born yet.

361
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,597
Well, that's our boy.

362
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,391
And hopefully you'll get
a second chance with him.

363
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:13,977
Hopefully.

364
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:17,439
What about with you?

365
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:25,822
I mean, we haven't even really talked
about us since we, well, you know.

366
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,325
Yeah, I do know.

367
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,249
- Have you thought about it?
- Of course. I have. A lot.

368
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:39,545
But honestly, I can't even go there.

369
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,339
I mean, it's not an option, is it?

370
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,049
You're still an Elder.

371
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:49,096
Hey, I'm not interrupting, am I?

372
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:52,140
Actually, kind of.
As a matter of fact, you are.

373
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:53,892
- Could you...?
- Sorry.

374
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,145
See, I had to talk to Leo
about something real quick.

375
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,856
- Come with me.
- All right, that's it.

376
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,608
- What is going on?
- Nothing.

377
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:05,153
Come on, I'm pregnant, not stupid.
What is it?

378
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,408
Well, we didn't want to alarm you.

379
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:13,745
But there is a demon consolidating
powers using Charmed knowledge.

380
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,456
- What?
- Yeah, and see the problem is,

381
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,543
I kind of conjured him,
the Mr. Right version of him, and...

382
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,505
Wait, wait. Mr. Right, as in,
my Mr. Right?

383
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:27,092
No, that would be gross.
My Mr. Right.

384
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,886
- There are rules.
- Oh, please. Listen.

385
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,804
You're confusing me.
That's not why I'm here.

386
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,056
I came to tell you that Chris
has been arrested.

387
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,726
- But it's a long story.
- Did you call Darryl?

388
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,394
Yes, that would be
the other problem

389
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:39,229
because Darryl arrested him.
Longer story.

390
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:41,940
Okay, take me home.

391
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,984
No, no, no. It's too dangerous.
You stay here.

392
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,945
No, I can't stay here when all hell
is breaking loose there.

393
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:49,489
Stay here, you save one son,
I'll go save the other.

394
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,667
Can I come in?

395
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,754
Shouldn't you be off peeling Paige
a grape or something?

396
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:07,925
She doesn't like grapes.
Actually, she's not back yet.

397
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:10,969
What are you doing?

398
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,555
I'm making a vanquishing potion
for your evil twin.

399
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:16,225
- Or at least I'm trying to.
- Maybe I can help.

400
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,727
No, I think you've done enough
already, thank you.

401
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,188
Okay.

402
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:25,108
Look, I know you're mad at her and me
and you have every right to be.

403
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,277
I know.

404
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,238
But you know Paige.

405
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:33,200
She doesn't think it's fair for magic
to take away so much,

406
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:34,785
without ever giving anything back.

407
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:37,788
- Yeah, but that still doesn't justify...
- I know. It doesn't.

408
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,082
She was going crazy.

409
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,583
She was overloaded.

410
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,252
She didn't wanna complain.

411
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:46,922
She didn't want you to have to feel
guilty for having lost your powers.

412
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:52,469
Just don't stay mad
at her too long, okay?

413
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:54,930
It hurts her, Phoebe.

414
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:57,933
She looks up to you.

415
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,476
A lot more than you know.

416
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:02,771
- Really?
- Yeah.

417
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,693
I think you're missing one key
ingredient for this potion to work.

418
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,322
My blood. After all, it's his too.

419
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,450
- Ouch, doesn't it hurt?
- No.

420
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,369
I only feel what Paige feels.

421
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:20,122
After all, I'm not real.

422
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:26,753
Although the more I come back,
the more I wish I was.

423
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:32,593
Phoebe, I thought about it, and I
just wanted to say that you're right...

424
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,556
Stop. You apologized already.
It's okay.

425
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:43,020
Okay, so we have the potion,
all we need is the demon.

426
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:45,105
Any idea who he'll go after next?

427
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:47,065
- Kimoto Demon.
- Kimoto Demon.

428
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:52,112
- I like the way you think.
- Right back at you.

429
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,041
Looks like we're too late.

430
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:07,294
Actually, you're right on time.

431
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:10,672
- So glad you could make it.
- Paige, throw the potion.

432
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,841
You wouldn't hurt me, would you?

433
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,220
- Paige.
- Give me that.

434
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:23,477
Sorry. Paige didn't conjure me
to go away until it's time.

435
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,941
You can't resist me, remember?

436
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,826
What's going on?

437
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,703
Where am I?

438
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,456
You're home, Paige.

439
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,464
"Use my blood," you said.

440
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,466
"It's his blood too," you said.

441
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:56,385
How was I to know
the potion wouldn't work?

442
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:57,594
I thought you knew him.

443
00:27:57,761 --> 00:28:00,013
No, I said I knew Paige.
There's a difference.

444
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,015
What? Testicles?

445
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,142
I thought you guys were like
three peas in a pod.

446
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:07,271
No, Paige is real, we're not.
Remember?

447
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:11,275
He's right. She didn't make them
vulnerable. She didn't want them to go.

448
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,652
Until it's time.

449
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:15,320
We have to find her
before midnight.

450
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,114
God knows what he'll do
to her by then.

451
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:20,450
He won't hurt her. He loves her.
That much I know.

452
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,995
- That's why she went with him.
- But why is she staying?

453
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:25,998
Why hasn't she orbed out of there?
She may want a lot of crazy things

454
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:27,749
but she'd never
wanna be with a demon.

455
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:31,211
Don't count on it. Paige has
a dark side like everybody else.

456
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:34,798
He's appealing to that.
To what she secretly wants.

457
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:38,552
- And what is that?
- To be free, independent.

458
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:41,013
To be able to use her magic
without fear of consequence.

459
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,432
That's extremely seductive to her.

460
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,352
- And so are those pheromones I bet.
- Especially when used by evil.

461
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,521
We gotta figure out a way
to vanquish this guy.

462
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:52,566
Yeah, but how?
She made him invincible.

463
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:53,901
Then why not make him real?

464
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:56,570
Break our magical bond.

465
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:59,323
I'm sorry?

466
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,408
It's what Paige would do
if she was here.

467
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:05,329
I mean, I know it's a wacky,
but it might work.

468
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:07,164
It would make him
vulnerable to a potion.

469
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:10,834
Guys, this is not Pinocchio.
We can't just make things real.

470
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,295
You're not making things real.
Just him.

471
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,881
And he's already halfway there
just by being conjured.

472
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:20,344
I know you can do it, Phoebe.

473
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:23,472
Thanks, Paige.

474
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:26,183
- Still, it doesn't help us to find her.
- But maybe we can.

475
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,143
Or maybe Chris can,
like he did before.

476
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,895
Have you forgotten he's in jail?

477
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:32,356
Not for long he's not.

478
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:38,820
Well, looks like I'm the last sister
standing now. You, come on.

479
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,870
It's an exact duplicate.

480
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:48,789
Exactly as you know it.

481
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:54,837
Of course, given time, I can
re-create the entire house. For you.

482
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:02,261
Well?

483
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,555
What do you think?

484
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:08,141
My head's still spinning.

485
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:11,562
It's hard for you to accept when good
things happen to you. I know.

486
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:14,690
But this is everything you've
ever dreamed about,

487
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:15,899
wanted.

488
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,987
Instead of fighting you,
the demons will bow down to your feet.

489
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:25,159
Instead of reining in your powers,
you can use them at will.

490
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:26,994
You're free...

491
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,912
...unchallenged...

492
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,622
...loved.

493
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:33,250
- Why, Vincent?
- You don't remember?

494
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:39,047
The name of your first love.
A boy who promised you the world.

495
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:40,674
Now you've got it.

496
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:48,223
- But, what about my...?
- Your sisters.

497
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:50,267
They're a burden, aren't they?

498
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:55,814
Forever forcing you to sacrifice
yourself, your needs for them.

499
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:58,233
You're right. It's not fair.

500
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,652
No, it's not.

501
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:03,155
And unfortunately,
unless we do something,

502
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:04,948
they'll try to stop us, won't they?

503
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:18,879
We need to talk.

504
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:22,758
Hello, Leo, I knew you'd show
up sooner or later.

505
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:27,638
Darryl, Paige is in trouble.

506
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,432
A demon took her
and I need Chris to help find her.

507
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:32,184
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

508
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,102
What is that supposed to mean?

509
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:36,438
Exactly what it sounds like.

510
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:39,566
Look, I told the girls
and now I'm telling you.

511
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,860
I'm not doing any more.
Forget it.

512
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:44,571
- Look, I understand...
- No, hey!

513
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:46,615
You don't understand.

514
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:48,116
It's over, Leo.

515
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:52,830
One of those beings
who erase memories

516
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,582
allowed me to remember
what happened after last time.

517
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:58,752
I changed. I saw the light.

518
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,338
This is your fight. It's not mine.

519
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:03,340
Well, I am fighting to try
and save my sons.

520
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:04,883
All right, they are in trouble.

521
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,010
Wyatt might be in trouble too.
You're a father.

522
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:10,639
I'm a cop! And all I know is...

523
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:16,645
All I'm supposed to know is,
Chris got caught stealing a car.

524
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:18,188
That's it.

525
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:21,567
Son or no son, he's busted.

526
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:25,154
Sooner or later they are gonna figure
out who he is and then what, huh?

527
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:29,324
That's not my problem.

528
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:32,202
Excuse me.

529
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:51,138
- It took you long enough.
- Not so loud.

530
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,432
- I'm getting you out of here.
- Great.

531
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,852
- So Darryl's gonna cover?
- Forget about Darryl. Come on.

532
00:32:57,019 --> 00:33:00,856
We're just gonna orb out of here?
What about exposure?

533
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:03,317
Right now I'm more worried
about them exposing you.

534
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,360
- Yeah, but...
- Look, son,

535
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:09,448
I'm not gonna let you hang here.
Come on, you got an aunt to save.

536
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,372
Thanks, Dad.

537
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,423
- Does that mean it's done?
- Or overdone.

538
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,427
- I'm not so sure about this.
- Well, why don't we try it out?

539
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:32,846
- On me.
- Are you kidding?

540
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,056
It might kill you.

541
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:36,391
Well, then at least
you'd know I was real.

542
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:40,562
Look, if it works on me,
it's gonna work on him, right?

543
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,860
Okay.

544
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,202
- How do you feel?
- Alive.

545
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,795
- What are you doing?
- Seeing how much I feel.

546
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:07,631
Ow!

547
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:10,300
"Ow" is good, though, right?
"Ow" means you're...

548
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:15,055
I'm real! I can't believe it.

549
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:16,431
This is amazing.

550
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:19,518
You have no idea what
you've done for me, Phoebe.

551
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:21,520
I hope you didn't trick me
into doing that.

552
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:26,441
No, but I did help you realize you're
not as powerless as you thought.

553
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:33,323
- Chris, you're out!
- Yeah. Thank God.

554
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,450
So how's that potion coming?
Did it work?

555
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:38,328
- Perfectly.
- Okay, great.

556
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:40,414
Chris has an idea
on how you can find Paige.

557
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:42,249
- Me?
- You're gonna have to sneak in.

558
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:45,961
And then once you're in, we'll bring you
the potion that makes the demon real.

559
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:49,548
And how exactly
am I gonna sneak in?

560
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:03,729
- You're right on time.
- My aim is to please.

561
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:05,772
- Where's Paige?
- Coming.

562
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:07,649
You know that she can't
be a part of this.

563
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:09,484
At least not directly.

564
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:13,655
- They are, after all, still her sisters.
- I understand.

565
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:20,078
Paige, what are we doing here?

566
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:22,539
You know how I've always
felt tied down?

567
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:25,209
Well, I thought you'd like
to know how that feels.

568
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,252
Rope!

569
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:30,672
What the hell are you doing?

570
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:34,635
Paige.

571
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,559
Paige?

572
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:50,567
Leo?

573
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:51,985
Chris?

574
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:58,826
I missed.

575
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:12,005
- It's just me, it's Phoebe.
- Phoebe?

576
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:14,675
Are you here to save me or kill me?

577
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,593
I haven't decided yet, turn around.

578
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:21,598
Okay, is there a plan involved
in any of this?

579
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:24,977
Well, there was until Chris and Leo
didn't respond to your call.

580
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:26,603
Great.

581
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:30,941
Something's wrong,
I can't sense her.

582
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:32,484
- I'm going back.
- You can't.

583
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:34,403
Leo, she needs the potion,
all right?

584
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,029
It's too dangerous.
I'm not risking you too.

585
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:39,324
Phoebe will figure it out,
she always finds a way.

586
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,661
Let me see if I can get a clear shot.

587
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:45,038
And risk exposing the baby,
absolutely not.

588
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:49,251
This is what we'll do. I am going
to go after the two on the right first.

589
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:52,713
- Okay, then what?
- Then go after the two on the left.

590
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,173
Oh, sure.

591
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:55,924
- Okay, ready?
- No.

592
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,134
- Go!
- No!

593
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:12,774
Hey, not bad for a chick
who can't levitate.

594
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:15,611
- We're not done yet.
- You said you didn't have the potion.

595
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,279
We don't need it.

596
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:25,412
All right, break it up, you two!

597
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,540
Phoebe! I'm impressed.

598
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:31,251
- I underestimated you.
- Really?

599
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:34,630
Well, that means she did too, and I'm
not quite sure how I feel about that.

600
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:36,340
Blow him up.

601
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:39,051
You can't, I'm not real. Remember?

602
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:43,639
I'm betting on if Mr. Right is real,
then so are you. Just do it.

603
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:55,108
What are you wearing?

604
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:07,120
- Dada.
- Hey, slugger.

605
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:10,499
How's your Mommy doing?
Is she all right?

606
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:16,505
As long as one of her sisters doesn't
try to kill her again, she'll be fine.

607
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:19,132
Well, now you know why
we didn't tell you about it.

608
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:22,386
I'm glad you did. Otherwise,
I would be totally in the dark

609
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:23,804
when Paige kidnapped me.

610
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:28,350
- Have you forgiven her yet?
- No, not to her face anyway.

611
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:31,270
But that's okay.
She can suffer a little bit.

612
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,356
So, what's going on with Chris?

613
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:36,942
The car salesman dropped
the charges.

614
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:40,445
He had a sudden loss of memory.

615
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:43,490
- Wouldn't testify. Go figure.
- Leo.

616
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:46,451
Magic was already exposed,
so I had to do something, right?

617
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:53,792
- You know, you're a good father.
- Yeah?

618
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:57,671
Thanks.

619
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,215
I hope you say that again
in 23 years.

620
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:04,720
I wonder where we'll be then.

621
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:09,266
Me too.

622
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:28,202
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, how you doing?

623
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:30,162
How's the column? Did you finish?

624
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:32,706
I did, just barely.

625
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:36,126
But at least Sad in San Jose
won't be so sad anymore.

626
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:39,505
See, you didn't need your powers
to give good advice.

627
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:42,508
Wait a second, you didn't get
your powers back, did you?

628
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:45,511
No. And I'm not in any
hurry to either.

629
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:50,015
I think we've both been relying on our
powers a bit too much, don't you?

630
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:53,644
Oh, subtle, very subtle.
That's what I like about you.

631
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:57,564
All the same, I'm not entirely sure
what I was thinking.

632
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,858
Well, you were thinking
that you needed a break.

633
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,152
And those needs came
from a real place,

634
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:05,697
you just have to figure out a way
to honour them without using magic.

635
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,535
Got any advice for him?

636
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:12,371
No, you're on your own
with that one.

637
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:17,376
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

638
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:21,880
- Hey.
- Hey.

639
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:23,090
You all set?

640
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:27,052
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure.

641
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,554
I'm a little nervous.

642
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:30,472
Well, don't worry.

643
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,891
Leo will take good care of you.

644
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:37,062
He's the best. And he's come and
gone from this world several times.

645
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:40,065
So have I. Thanks to you.

646
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:42,401
Well, don't thank me just yet.

647
00:40:42,568 --> 00:40:47,656
If you're anything like me, and I have
a sneaking suspicion that you are,

648
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:50,784
you might get into a little
bit of trouble out there.

649
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,662
Well, if I'm anything like you,
I can handle it.

650
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:54,872
Right?

651
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:02,629
Will I ever see you again?

652
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:07,551
Only if you get in too much trouble.

653
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,896
Well...

654
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:21,106
- Take care.
- Take care.
