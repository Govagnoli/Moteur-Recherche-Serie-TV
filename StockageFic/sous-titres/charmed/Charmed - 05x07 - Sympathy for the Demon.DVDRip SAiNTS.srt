1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:10,511
I'd like to draw your attention
to exhibit W, the delivery manifest.

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,389
You'll find it on page six
of your documents.

3
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,809
As you can see, the manifest refers

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:22,272
to a shipment made on
September 5th of last year.

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,650
I don't know what
this demon's trying to prove.

6
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,113
Excuse me, did you say something?

7
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,743
No, please continue.

8
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,337
The shipping director, Mr. Peters

9
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:49,508
is responsible for the items
on this manifest,

10
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,345
including 48 barrels of toxic waste.

11
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:57,599
Trying to deny what he is,
like we don't know.

12
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,936
You give us all a bad name.

13
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,106
What the hell is going on here?

14
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,111
It's called a deposition?

15
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,282
- You all right, Mr. Turner?
- I'm sorry, excuse me.

16
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,927
Check out the demon.

17
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,682
What'd you say?

18
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,727
You're an embarrassment to us all,
you know that.

19
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,647
Just leave me alone.

20
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,359
Give it up, Cole.
You can never be good.

21
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,621
Are you okay, man?

22
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,181
Phoebe, thank God.

23
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,266
I need your help.

24
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:25,020
I think I'm going crazy, or somebody
is messing with my mind.

25
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,731
Slow down. Tell me what happened.

26
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,320
I was just deposing a witness for
a chemical-dumping case and I went...

27
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,956
Final divorce papers.
I need you to sign them.

28
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,876
- That's why you're here?
- Yeah. It's finally over, officially.

29
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,838
- Because you're evil.
- No, you're wrong.

30
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,006
No, I'm right.

31
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,175
You've always been evil
and you always will be.

32
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,511
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

33
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,305
Cole, don't fight it. It's who you are.

34
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,225
I'm not evil, damn it! I'm not evil!

35
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,027
Lauren?

36
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,202
What's happening to me?

37
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:27,541
Oh, you know
what's happening to you.

38
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:32,379
You are evil, Cole.

39
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,217
You're evil, Cole.

40
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,095
It's your worst fear.

41
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,514
And it's true.

42
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,539
Okay, 16th time is the charm.

43
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,252
- Damn it.
- What's going on, Paige?

44
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,338
Just trying to conjure up some doves.

45
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,423
Down here in front
of all the windows, huh?

46
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,717
Yeah, well, the attic
was feeling a little cramped.

47
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,303
I thought a change
of scenery might help.

48
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,432
Prue's animal-conjuring spell, huh?
That's a tough one.

49
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,352
Yeah, tell me about it.
How long did it take her to get it down?

50
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,271
A couple days, at least.

51
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,356
Oh, good, then I don't feel so bad.

52
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,109
- What's going on, Paige?
- Nothing.

53
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,611
Paige?

54
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,363
Promise you won't tell
Piper and Phoebe?

55
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:22,614
Yeah.

56
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,618
Okay, Prue was this awesome
witch with a full-time job,

57
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,205
and I quit my job to be a full-time witch
and I still haven't reached her level yet.

58
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:33,417
Which makes me feel
incredibly frustrated and lame.

59
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,919
I thought you were done
comparing yourself to Prue.

60
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,546
Yeah, so did I.

61
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,798
It's just these past couple of days,
for some reason,

62
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,552
I've been feeling a little insecure.

63
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,430
And this stupid spell
isn't helping any.

64
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,017
Come on, now.
Give me a dove, any dove.

65
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,604
- Nothing.
- Hi.

66
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,773
I am off to yoga and then to
the salon for a manicure and pedicure.

67
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,776
There's a cherry pie cooling on
the counter, and I will be on my cell.

68
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,278
Prenatal police, lady.

69
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,864
Put the mug down,
step away from the coffee.

70
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,908
It's herbal tea.

71
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,159
I am on a natural high.

72
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:10,078
This is the first morning in months
where I kept my breakfast down.

73
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,040
Hey, congratulations.

74
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:16,001
Goodbye, morning sickness,
hello, second trimester.

75
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,628
I feel wonderful.

76
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,838
And so I was thinking, you know,
when I get back,

77
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,634
maybe we could start
practicing for the new kid.

78
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,929
I'm still here, thanks.

79
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,185
Spider, get it, get it, get it!

80
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,107
Okay, you can handle demons
and warlocks, but not spiders?

81
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,736
Jinxed. I should have known
this was gonna happen.

82
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,112
What are you talking about?

83
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,865
It's the story of my life.
When everything is going great

84
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,326
something inevitably
happens that will ruin it.

85
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,286
A little spider did all that to you?

86
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,955
Oh, you just wait. You will see.

87
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,751
Oh, please.
Please, you gotta help me.

88
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,214
See?

89
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,135
Did they follow me?

90
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,638
- Who?
- Cole, maybe you should...

91
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,766
Stay away from me!

92
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,897
- Got him.
- Cole, what are you doing?

93
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,776
You're with him.

94
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,741
What is wrong with you?

95
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,372
I'm sorry. I didn't hurt anyone, did I?

96
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,251
You could have.
Lucky for you, I'm already dead.

97
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,550
- It's getting worse.
- Worse? What is getting worse?

98
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:51,597
My powers. At first I was imagining
that I was using them...

99
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:52,848
...and now I really am.

100
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,183
Using them against what?

101
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:58,854
Well, demons.
Or at least that's what I thought.

102
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,274
Someone is messing with me
somehow, making me see things.

103
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,859
You guys have gotta help me.

104
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:07,112
Otherwise, I might
really hurt someone.

105
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,046
Thanks.

106
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:34,306
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

107
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,808
I don't know. You just seemed
a little nervous, that's all.

108
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:40,187
Oh, really, do I?
I seem nervous, huh?

109
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,231
No, I mean...

110
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,943
Yeah, well, maybe just a little.

111
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,320
You have to understand,
it's been a really long time

112
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:52,491
since I've been out on a third date,
let alone a first or a second one.

113
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,451
Well, there's not much
of a difference really.

114
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,453
Except for the kiss, of course.

115
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,038
- The kiss?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

116
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,707
Third date, mandatory.
You probably forgot.

117
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,294
- Well, thanks for reminding me.
- You're welcome.

118
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,258
Hey, how long were you married?

119
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,178
Not long, but we were
together for two years.

120
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:17,307
In the beginning it was great,
it's just the end was...

121
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,767
...hell.

122
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,061
Yeah, I had the same
experience with my ex.

123
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,522
No, I'm pretty sure you didn't.

124
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,901
Well, you know, because
every situation's so different.

125
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,947
He didn't treat you right, did he?

126
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:38,620
Hey, I'll treat you right.

127
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,459
Hi.

128
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:46,837
Bad time?

129
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,635
All I've got to say
is this better be good.

130
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,639
You've gotta be kidding me.

131
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm sorry, Phoebe,
it's really important.

132
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,269
Desperate demons
call for desperate measures.

133
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:05,522
I think that someone
is trying to drive me crazy.

134
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,192
- Well, that makes two of us.
- No, you don't understand.

135
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,820
I don't know what's real anymore,
what's going on in my mind.

136
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,991
I almost killed my secretary today.
And then Leo.

137
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,245
This could be your worst fear
come to life, Phoebe.

138
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:26,293
Cole dragging you back
into his world of evil.

139
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,967
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,679
But, Cole, I'm not gonna allow you
to drag me back into your world of evil.

141
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,933
I need to figure out what is going on
before somebody gets hurt.

142
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:45,687
Careful, it's another one
of his tricks to get you back.

143
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,732
How do I know this isn't just another
one of your tricks to get me back?

144
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,692
My tricks?

145
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:57,991
This is no trick. I am seriously
afraid of what I might do,

146
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,078
and I am begging you
for your help.

147
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,247
I'm sorry, Cole, I can't.

148
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,501
I have to draw the line sometime,
and I'm gonna draw it right now.

149
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,221
Listen, far be it for me to take his side,
but what if he's telling the truth?

150
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:20,681
I agree.

151
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,767
If there's a demon out there powerful
enough to mess with Cole's mind...

152
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,602
Then it's his problem.

153
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,021
It's not ours
and it's not mine anymore.

154
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,148
Now, if you'll excuse me,

155
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:35,445
I'm gonna go back outside and try
to salvage what is left of my date.

156
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,666
Now what? We can't just
sit around here and do nothing.

157
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,460
No. Unfortunately,
Cole is really powerful,

158
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,381
and if some demon is trying
to manipulate him...

159
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,801
Helping Cole could bring
your worst fears to life.

160
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,723
Maybe it's better to just let it go.

161
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,601
Hello, you were saying?

162
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,061
On second thought,
maybe we should just let it go.

163
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,147
- Let it go?
- Yeah.

164
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,941
It wouldn't be the first time
Cole's been less than honest with us.

165
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,444
Maybe Phoebe's right.
It's not really our problem.

166
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,947
Yeah, it's not our problem
until he hurts us.

167
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:22,826
- True.
- He'll ruin everything, remember?

168
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,705
He's brought you nothing
but misery in the past.

169
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:30,000
But then again,
why should we trust him?

170
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,669
I mean, he's brought us
nothing but misery in the past.

171
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,046
What's wrong with you?

172
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,715
This Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Piper...
Make up your mind, lady.

173
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,051
Look, all I know is
the more I think about it,

174
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,594
the more I agree with Phoebe.

175
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,889
We don't need to look for trouble.
Trouble comes to find us anyway.

176
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,558
- But...
- Paige, look, two against one, okay?

177
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,312
And you're always the one.

178
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,111
Barbas, careful!

179
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,657
Shame if you fell
after all these years.

180
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,622
I will not fall, but I will rise.

181
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,916
So the witches are gonna
do what you want?

182
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,126
In time.

183
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,380
Oh, the Charmed Ones
are not your ordinary witches.

184
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,258
Yeah, I know.

185
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:23,345
I know, it's just how much time?

186
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,556
I mean, you've been
working on them for weeks.

187
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,599
I don't mean to rush you
or anything,

188
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,727
but I'm really hot,
like all the time.

189
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:35,399
Patience. Or have you forgotten?

190
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:39,611
I can summon your fears to life
even down here.

191
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:43,031
Forgotten? No, sir.

192
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,159
I'm the one you've been
practicing on, remember?

193
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,620
But I gotta say,

194
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:54,543
the deal was, if I taught you
how to project out from down here,

195
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,295
then you'd help me escape.

196
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,839
You'll be rewarded
for your service.

197
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,302
Oh, yeah? That's good.

198
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,220
That's good,
because, you know,

199
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:08,932
this whole eternal banishment thing
is really starting to get me down.

200
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,564
The Charmed Ones
are in conflict even now.

201
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,232
Soon they'll break.

202
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,151
When they do,

203
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:23,530
they will provide me
with more than enough power

204
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:30,245
to free the two of us
from purgatory forever!

205
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,633
I talked with the Elders.

206
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,178
They don't know of any demon
powerful enough to manipulate Cole.

207
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,680
Oh, the Elders don't know anything?
What a shock.

208
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,517
- Is there anything in the Book?
- No.

209
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:55,062
I think your sisters
might be right on this one.

210
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,147
No, Cole is in trouble, Leo.

211
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,150
He might not be an innocent,
I won't go so far as to call him that,

212
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,402
but something is after him.

213
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,321
My instincts haven't let me down yet.

214
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,198
Your sisters have good instincts too.

215
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:09,284
Yeah, I know there's three of us,
I've been outvoted,

216
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,245
and I don't want
to go up against them,

217
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:15,207
but what's the harm in following up
with a little magic on my own?

218
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:19,503
Well, as your whitelighter,
I would say go with your instincts.

219
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:24,258
- Okay.
- But as your brother-in-law,

220
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,803
going up against your sisters
is pure suicide.

221
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,597
Great. You really helped
clarify this issue.

222
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:39,356
It's only the fear that
you aren't good enough,

223
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:43,527
that you're not worthy
of the power of three.

224
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:47,072
Oh, go on, prove yourself.

225
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:51,577
Save Cole the same way
Phoebe did before.

226
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:54,997
Your sisters will be so proud.

227
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,758
Cole?

228
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,180
Cole?

229
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,185
Cole?

230
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,983
- Don't move, demon!
- Cole, it's me! It's Paige!

231
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,112
- Who sent you? Answer me!
- Damn it, you idiot!

232
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,784
Oh, God.

233
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:36,121
Oh, God, I'm so sorry, Paige.
Are you okay?

234
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:39,708
Yeah, no thanks to you.

235
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,338
I don't know who I am anymore.

236
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:49,468
Well, I think I have
a solution for that.

237
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:54,181
- What do you mean?
- Power-stripping potion.

238
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,141
It's the same stuff
Phoebe used on you.

239
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:59,436
I made some adjustments
to compensate for your added powers.

240
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,356
You want to take away my powers?

241
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,233
I'd have no way to defend myself.

242
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:08,445
Yeah, you also wouldn't be able to hurt
anybody else, including Phoebe.

243
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:15,035
You fear hurting Phoebe even more
than you fear remaining forever evil.

244
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:19,832
Protect Phoebe.
Strip your powers.

245
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,587
Let's do it.

246
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,410
Barbas.

247
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,290
- Who's Barbas?
- The demon of fear.

248
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,710
Oh, I'm so much more
than that now.

249
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:08,922
Looking for this?

250
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,268
Very cool powers.

251
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:25,480
I can hardly wait until I have
full control over them.

252
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:31,361
Paige, thank you very much
for setting me free.

253
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:35,991
Your sisters will be so proud of you.

254
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,920
Barbas? You couldn't have
brought back Andras or Shax

255
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,214
or somebody
we could actually vanquish?

256
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,382
Okay, heal now, yell later.
Cole's injured.

257
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,093
- Leo can't heal evil.
- He's not evil anymore.

258
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,596
The potion worked. I've stripped him
of his demonic powers.

259
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:58,889
And gave them to Barbas.

260
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:03,101
Listen, I really don't need
a lecture right now.

261
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:06,104
No, you really do, because you
have no idea what you've done,

262
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,023
and now we have
a serious problem.

263
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:09,858
Guys.

264
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:19,660
Great, he's not evil,
but we still have a serious problem.

265
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:22,246
- What happened?
- The worst demon we ever faced

266
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:26,041
tricked you and Paige into freeing him,
and now he has your powers.

267
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,876
I'm really sorry.

268
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:31,421
I think we should give Paige a break.
She was just acting on her instincts.

269
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,257
Paige, we know you're really sorry,

270
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,968
and it's not the fact that you
screwed up that we're upset about.

271
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,928
It's the fact that
you didn't listen to us.

272
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,972
We just have a lot more experience
than you do.

273
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,557
We've been at this a lot longer.

274
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:47,437
Fine. What does this Barbas do?
What's his thing?

275
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:51,525
- He brings really bad things to life.
- Your worst fears, to be exact.

276
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:55,737
Who knows what we can expect now
that he has Cole's demonic energy.

277
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,198
I'll do everything in my power
to help you guys find him.

278
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,660
Unfortunately, anything in your power
right now is not a whole hell of a lot.

279
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:06,582
I'm the only one who knows how my
powers work, how he might use them.

280
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:07,875
He's got a point.

281
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,003
- What's he gonna do next?
- Get even, what else?

282
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,964
Actually, I'm a little worried
he didn't try to do that already.

283
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,050
That's funny. That didn't occur to me
as something to worry about.

284
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,344
Well, if I'm right,
you've got bigger problems.

285
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:23,223
If he gains control of my powers,
he might try to use them

286
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,059
to reorganize the underworld,
become the next Source.

287
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,480
You have to get to him before he does
or he'll be impossible to stop.

288
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:49,291
Looks like the underworld has been
spruced up a bit since my damnation.

289
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:53,170
Very smart, operating above ground.

290
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:58,383
It's like hiding out in plain sight.

291
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,886
Still, maybe it would be better

292
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:04,640
to unite the leadership
in a more traditional setting.

293
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,767
You know, for appearances.

294
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,061
Oh, I'm not interested in appearances.

295
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,814
I am only interested in...

296
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,776
...the Charmed Ones.

297
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:21,949
Why focus on them when you can
take over the underworld?

298
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:26,954
Because those witches banished me
to a fate worse than death.

299
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,207
And the only thing
that kept me going

300
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:36,004
was the sweet thought
of repaying the favour with interest.

301
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,258
With all due respect,

302
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:43,971
if those witches were powerful enough
to defeat you before...

303
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,182
I spared you down there,

304
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:51,854
so do not try my patience up here.

305
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:59,027
All I'm saying is maybe it would be
better to solidify your power base first.

306
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:05,242
Where'd you learn to do that?

307
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:08,120
Oh, apparently it's one
of my new powers.

308
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:13,208
Only seems to happen
when I get very angry.

309
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,545
Perhaps you're right.

310
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:19,506
I've been seeking my revenge
for so long,

311
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,133
what's a little while longer?

312
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,219
So summon the leaders.

313
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,349
I'll summon the leaders.

314
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:35,856
There has to be a vanquish for him
in here somewhere.

315
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:38,775
We've never been able to
vanquish him, just neutralize him.

316
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:42,571
Actually we didn't, Prue did.

317
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:48,368
Well, maybe you can just do whatever
Prue did to banish him last time.

318
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,121
- It won't work.
- Prue didn't banish him with a spell,

319
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,915
she banished him
by conquering her fears.

320
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:56,335
Well, conquering fears isn't gonna
vanquish him anymore anyway.

321
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,253
Not with my powers inside him.

322
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,340
Okay, you know what,
time's up, let me look.

323
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:06,386
Oh, okay. Apparently saying
"I'm sorry" 112 times didn't work.

324
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,889
Maybe 113. I am sorry.

325
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,974
Paige, I'm not trying
to make you feel bad.

326
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:14,061
It's just, you know, you pulled me away
from my third date with Miles.

327
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:16,021
A third date.

328
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,148
A hundred and fourteen, I'm sorry.

329
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,775
Shouldn't you guys
give Paige a break?

330
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:22,778
She had good intentions.
That's gotta count for something.

331
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,949
Thank you, I think.

332
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:30,661
- Where'd that come from?
- The only place it could, his heart.

333
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:34,706
- Cole's good now.
- Well, it doesn't change anything.

334
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,376
Doesn't it? You're the only one
who has seen that side of me.

335
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,837
- The side you fell in love with.
- Please don't go there.

336
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,297
And more importantly,
since you don't have any powers,

337
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,216
maybe Leo should take you
someplace safe.

338
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:46,260
No, you'll need me to fight Barbas.

339
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,679
If Cole is good,
doesn't that make him an innocent,

340
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:51,890
and doesn't that mean
that we need to protect him now?

341
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:57,729
She's right, you should go.

342
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,565
Please.

343
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,699
Okay, well, there's nothing in here.

344
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:11,952
We're gonna have to figure out a way
to vanquish Barbas on our own.

345
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:15,497
Well, we could use the crystal cage
like we did with the Source.

346
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:17,124
If they have the same powers.

347
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,584
Actually, that might work.

348
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,419
We just have to find a way
to get him here.

349
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:23,422
- I can write a spell.
- Well, that shouldn't be too hard.

350
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,591
All we have to do is remind him
of how he hates us,

351
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:26,884
and he should come running.

352
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,887
I could modify the astral
projection spell, try to get him here.

353
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:32,806
I'll orb him.

354
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,933
No, Phoebe should go.

355
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:40,981
Only because I've already overcome
my deepest fear

356
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:43,650
the last time Barbas attacked.
He can't hurt me.

357
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:45,903
What was your fear?

358
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:47,988
Losing a sister.

359
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:01,043
So any questions?

360
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,963
You bring us to the former
Source's home

361
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:10,052
and tell us to unite
under your leadership

362
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:13,222
because you have so many powers,

363
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:17,434
yet we haven't seen a single one
of these fantastic abilities

364
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,311
you claim to have.

365
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,902
Any more questions?

366
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:29,488
Whoa, déjá vu.

367
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:33,033
Hey, how you doing?
Don't we know each other?

368
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,122
- I'll take her out.
- No, no, no, this witch is mine.

369
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,291
I know your fears.

370
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,627
Really? You sure about that?

371
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:50,676
Oh, what's the matter?
Lost your touch?

372
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,013
And you want this guy to be
your new leader?

373
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,352
It's pretty hard
to rule the underworld

374
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,229
if you kill everybody,
don't you think?

375
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:08,443
It's a trap.
Don't be a fool, let it go.

376
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,738
I can't.

377
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:15,492
Incoming.

378
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:27,129
- Paige.
- Got it!

379
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:31,175
- Prudence, Penelope, Patricia
- Melinda, Astrid, Helena

380
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,509
Laura and Grace

381
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,803
Halliwell witches
Stand strong beside us

382
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,556
Vanquish this evil
From time and space

383
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,860
I guess you wanted me.

384
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,909
Well, now you have me.

385
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,085
And now I've got you.

386
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:19,014
Okay, the windows in our rooms
are all bricked over too.

387
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:21,183
All the windows downstairs
were the same.

388
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,520
- We're trapped.
- Like hell we are.

389
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:35,572
Okay, on second thought...

390
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,574
Leo!

391
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,244
My guess is, if I can't get out,
he is not getting in.

392
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:44,206
- Well, I can get out.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

393
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,628
I can't get out.

394
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,422
- We can't get out.
- Okay, well, let's not panic.

395
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,842
That's what Barbas wants us to do
is panic, right?

396
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,220
Why doesn't he just kill us and get
it over with if that's what he wants?

397
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,055
Because he wants us
to suffer, that's why.

398
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,390
A little mental torture.

399
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:07,521
- Guys?
- What's the matter?

400
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:09,690
Don't you see it?

401
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:13,861
The walls are moving in on me.

402
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:16,154
Hey!

403
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,158
Help! Get me out of here!

404
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:22,619
- Is she claustrophobic?
- I don't know, is she?

405
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:25,414
Paige, it's just a hallucination.

406
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:27,457
Yeah, it's not real, honey.
You're okay.

407
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,214
What, what, what?

408
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:39,595
Tarantulas.
Lots and lots of tarantulas.

409
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,347
No, there's no tarantulas.
This isn't real.

410
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,183
You're hallucinating, remember?

411
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:45,684
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

412
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:49,146
I had to talk to you.
I had to tell you the truth.

413
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:51,315
This isn't real. This isn't happening.

414
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:54,109
I'm evil, Phoebe. You know
that's why you're drawn to me.

415
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:59,698
Okay, people, time to get over
our fears right now!

416
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:02,284
Easy for you to say.
You're not facing killer spiders!

417
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:04,328
Neither are you.

418
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:19,259
- Good girl.
- Paige, it's all in your head.

419
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:24,515
Don't be afraid.
You're gonna be okay.

420
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:27,559
- I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid.
- You'll be okay.

421
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:33,148
I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid.

422
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,582
- I did it.
- Yeah.

423
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:53,460
He's not done. He can't be.
He's just playing with us.

424
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:55,003
We need a plan.

425
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,172
Why don't I strip his powers
like I stripped Cole's?

426
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:59,174
I don't think that'll
solve the problem.

427
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:01,301
Those powers have
to find a new demon home.

428
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,762
Unless we give them back to Cole.

429
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:06,348
No, no, we cannot
give them back to Cole.

430
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:07,558
Why not? They're his.

431
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,393
No, he knows what it's like
to be good now.

432
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,520
Giving them back to him
would be completely unfair

433
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:12,855
and probably a death sentence.

434
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:15,941
He's the only one
that knows how to control them.

435
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:17,985
Anybody got any better ideas?

436
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:22,406
Let's go make the potion.

437
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:29,329
- Leo, what happened?
- Barbas, he attacked us.

438
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:30,581
What, where?

439
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:33,292
Downstairs. I orbed in with Cole,
and the windows bricked over.

440
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,544
- You left him down there?
- Yeah, I came up for help.

441
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,255
Besides, Cole knows Barbas' powers,
so he can get away from them.

442
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:40,424
- Not for long.
- We need him.

443
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:44,511
I'll go. You guys make sure
that potion's done.

444
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,471
Do you think it's a good idea
to split up?

445
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,265
What if that's exactly
what Barbas wants?

446
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,475
Do we have a choice?

447
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:55,189
Okay, let's get this over with.

448
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:09,286
- Where did you leave Cole?
- He was just here.

449
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:14,750
- Do you hear that?
- What?

450
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,044
Footsteps.

451
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:20,255
Grams, I love it!

452
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,927
I love my doll.
It's just what I always wanted!

453
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,803
Do you see her?

454
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,555
- Who?
- Me.

455
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:31,183
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

456
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,352
You know, your father
helped pick this out.

457
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,313
- Hey, I thought I heard a little Piper.
- Daddy!

458
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,273
Happy birthday.

459
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,944
- Piper, what are you seeing?
- It's okay.

460
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,488
I remember this.

461
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:48,742
- Happy birthday.
- Daddy!

462
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:56,291
Hell-spawned demon creature,
death fire shall take your very breath.

463
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:03,549
Oh, sweetheart, are you all right?
Did that bad man hurt you?

464
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,551
- No.
- Oh, baby.

465
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,512
- Penny, I told you.
- Oh, Victor, don't start.

466
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,057
If my girls are raised around this,
it'll destroy their lives.

467
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:14,142
Oh, don't be overdramatic.

468
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:18,188
A demon tries to kill my daughter,
and I'm being overdramatic?

469
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:21,024
If they're brought up around this evil,
they'll always live in fear.

470
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:24,361
They'll never be happy.
How can you put them through this?

471
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,283
See, even your daddy knew.

472
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:32,578
Your happiness can never last.

473
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,999
You know, I am so sorry.
I never meant for any of this to...

474
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:39,334
It's okay, sweetie, just forget it.

475
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,879
Let's concentrate on
finding a way out of here.

476
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:45,382
Will you pass me the mandrake root
while you're over there?

477
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:53,765
- Did you find it?
- Yes, exactly what I was looking for.

478
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,563
Where's Paige?
What did you do to her?

479
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,440
What are you talking about?
I'm right here.

480
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:06,570
You were right.
I couldn't read your fears.

481
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:10,782
But I can now.

482
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,409
What have you done to my sister?

483
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:17,956
Same thing I did with your other sister.
Killed her with her fears.

484
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:19,666
Oh, God, it's Barbas.
He's tricking you.

485
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:27,591
It's me, Paige. You're hallucinating.

486
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:34,348
This time I'm gonna
vanquish you for good.

487
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:47,194
She's a little girl, for God's sake,
your own granddaughter!

488
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:48,612
How can you allow this?

489
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,782
Because she's a witch.
That's who she is.

490
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,367
Besides, she has me
to keep her safe.

491
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:55,452
You didn't keep her
very safe tonight, did you?

492
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:57,579
Please stop fighting.

493
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:00,040
How are my girls gonna
find happiness living like this?

494
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:02,334
With demons breaking
down the door every night?

495
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:07,339
Your greatest fear
was born in this very moment.

496
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:14,721
Tonight your daddy left
and never came back.

497
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:17,975
And ever since this moment,

498
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:24,439
when you experience happiness,
tragedy follows.

499
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:30,195
Leaving you destined
to a lifetime of pain.

500
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:36,076
A pain that continues
on and on,

501
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:39,371
even into the next generation.

502
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:46,044
No, no.

503
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:50,090
Oh, please, no. Not the baby. No.

504
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:56,763
Phoebe, it's me, it's your sister!

505
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:02,311
Come on, finish it. Please?

506
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:06,190
You can do it, I know you can.
Come on, kill me!

507
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:37,429
No! Paige! Leo! Leo!

508
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:39,765
He can't hear you.

509
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:42,476
Piper!

510
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,812
There's nobody
who can save her now.

511
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:50,317
Come on, you know.

512
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:54,571
This really doesn't
have to be so difficult.

513
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,827
You already overcame your fears.
Losing your sister, remember?

514
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:04,081
Oh, wait.

515
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:09,253
But that's not your
deepest fear anymore, is it?

516
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:15,217
No, it takes somebody really evil

517
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:18,136
to kill with a vengeance like that.

518
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:22,641
That's who you are.

519
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:26,353
Why don't you just accept it?

520
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:33,110
It's kind of like your greatest fear
just sort of came to life.

521
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:56,216
Playing on an expectant mother's
fears. That was a good one.

522
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:58,010
But not that good.

523
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:06,351
- What happened?
- I thought that she was him.

524
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:08,145
Oh, no.

525
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:14,985
The only way we can save her
is if you overcome your fears.

526
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:16,653
Tell me what you're afraid of.

527
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:20,741
- I'm evil.
- What?

528
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:25,078
No, you're not.
This was an accident.

529
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:30,083
I have known you your entire life.
There is not a mean bone in your body.

530
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:33,504
And you need
to believe that right now.

531
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:41,303
- But...
- No! Not a chance in hell.

532
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:52,689
Leo.

533
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,777
Paige.

534
00:38:03,826 --> 00:38:06,036
Good, you're back.

535
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,580
What are you doing?

536
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:14,336
I am making sure that I do not
get caught unawares again.

537
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:17,548
Barbas, please, I beg you.

538
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:21,552
Forget the witches.
You can deal with them later.

539
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:26,390
Well, the witches may
be able to avoid their fears,

540
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:31,562
but they will not be able
to avoid my new power.

541
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:33,438
Listen to me.

542
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:35,983
The demonic leadership
is backing you.

543
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:38,193
The underworld
is yours for the taking.

544
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,947
I do not care about the underworld.

545
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:46,160
I care only about my revenge.

546
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:49,288
Oh, and in regards to that,

547
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:52,666
I need you to hurl a fireball at me.

548
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,084
What?

549
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:56,837
I need to test my new power.

550
00:38:57,045 --> 00:39:00,048
- I don't...
- Do it.

551
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:14,646
Finally, he shuts up.

552
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,527
Paige, you're okay, thank God.

553
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:21,862
What happened?

554
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,865
Good thing we were already trying
to orb in when the barrier came down.

555
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:27,493
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

556
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,786
- You're suffocating me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

557
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,875
I hate to break this up,
but Barbas will be back soon.

558
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,337
- I'm ready.
- Are you?

559
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:42,090
To take evil back, no.
But I'm not doing it for me.

560
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,979
Miss me, my babies?

561
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:03,737
I'm a very quick study.

562
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:05,948
What do we do?

563
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:09,284
- Still alive, I see.
- You leave her alone.

564
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,375
Naughty, naughty, naughty.
Wait your turn.

565
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,377
Paige, orb the potion.

566
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,463
- It's in a puddle.
- You can do it. Prue did.

567
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:25,217
Aye, there's the rub.

568
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:27,928
You're no Prue, are you?

569
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:34,184
Potion!

570
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:07,301
Looking for this?

571
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:07,486
To our fourth date.

572
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:10,489
Hey, does anything happen on the
fourth date that I should be aware of?

573
00:42:10,656 --> 00:42:13,992
Well, just the fact that we made it past
our third date that I'm talking about.

574
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:16,912
Oh, why? You didn't think we would?

575
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,375
I don't know, it seemed like last time
you got distracted halfway through it.

576
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:24,837
You know?
I mean, we didn't even kiss.

577
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:28,799
Better?

578
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:30,676
You're taking a pretty
big risk, aren't you?

579
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:32,970
I am not afraid.

580
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:38,934
You better stop that.

581
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:40,978
Stop what? Laughing?

582
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:43,313
Yeah, you wouldn't want
to experience actual happiness,

583
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,941
seeing how every time you're happy,
your world crashes.

584
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,736
Well, I'm not so worried
about that anymore.

585
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,446
Really?

586
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:53,532
Yeah, my world has crashed before.

587
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:56,118
And then somehow
everything is okay.

588
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:59,371
So why not enjoy it while it lasts?

589
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:02,374
Like...? Like them?

590
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,835
Exactly like them.

591
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,964
You know, I'm just worried
about Paige.

592
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:11,675
She was kind of feeling
left out by you two.

593
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:16,555
Oh, I think Missy Paige
will be just fine.
