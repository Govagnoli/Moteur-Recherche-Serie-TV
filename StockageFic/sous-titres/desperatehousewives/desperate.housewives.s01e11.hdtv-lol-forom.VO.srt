1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,600
<font color=yellow>Previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,200
I am just trying to move on with my life.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,200
Are you having an affair with my husband?

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,100
<font color=yellow>Suspicion ended in tragedy.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,100
I'm here to see Rex Van De Kamp.
Apparently, he had a heart attack.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,900
<font color=yellow>Trust...

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,400
It kills me that I'm putting you through this.

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,500
<font color=yellow>was put on trial.

9
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,200
Bring me the passport, and Mr. Solis can visit his mother.

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,200
<font color=yellow>And ex-husband

11
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,000
You walked out on your family.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,203
<font color=yellow>was replaced.

13
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:24,800
She is out there throwing herself at Mike Delfino

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,100
<font color=yellow>And everyone

15
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,700
Wow, your own personal nanny? Smell you.

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,300
<font color=yellow>was getting in over their heads.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,200
<font color=yellow>Edie Britt could never understand
why she didn't have any female friends.

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,200
<font color=yellow>Of course, she always tried to tell
people she didn't need any,

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,600
<font color=yellow>but the truth was

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,800
<font color=yellow>it bothered Edie that other women didn't seem to like her.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
<font color=yellow>Even after moving to Wisteria Lane...

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,100
oh, and be careful. There are breakables in there.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,600
<font color=yellow>Edie couldn't understand why
her neighbors kept their distance.

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,700
<font color=yellow>And then she met Martha Huber.

25
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,500
Hola.

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,100
<font color=yellow>Within five minutes, Mrs. Huber managed to
disparage what Edie was wearing.

27
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,000
No

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,500
<font color=yellow>In fact, whenever they got together,
Mrs. Huber insulted her.

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,100
<font color=yellow>She made fun of everything from Edie's makeup...

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,500
<font color=yellow>to her taste in men.

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,400
<font color=yellow>Yes, Martha Huber could be cruel,
offensive, and downright mean,

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:42,200
<font color=yellow>but Edie didn't care, because she was
the first real friend Edie Britt had ever had.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,300
<font color=yellow>But now Martha Huber was missing.
She had vanished without a trace,

34
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,600
<font color=yellow>and Edie was not embarrassed to admit
she needed her back.

35
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,900
Edie?

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,900
I'm Felicia Tilman,

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,500
Martha's sister.

39
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,100
Really?

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,800
What's wrong?

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Oh, nothing's wrong. It's just that Martha
always said how alike you two were.

42
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,700
I just don't seethe family resemblance.

43
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,000
It's there. It just takes a while to become apparent.

44
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,300
Do you have the key to her house?

45
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,400
I do. After the police kicked the door in,
they put on this temporary lock.

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,700
Oh, and by the way, the neighbors
are coming over at noon.

47
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,400
We're going to organize and hand out flyers.

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,900
the key?

49
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,400
Oh, right.

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
You know, I can only imagine how worried you must be.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,900
I'm not worried, Edie.

52
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,100
Martha and I have a very intense bond.
We were connected at the most primal level,

53
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,900
and a few days ago, I felt this sensation in my soul.

54
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,000
That's when it first dawned on me that something
had happened to my sister,

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,200
and then when she didn't arrive
at my home as scheduled,

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,400
well, that's when I knew she was dead.

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Oh, honey, no. You mustn't think like that.

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,900
Martha's only missing.

59
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,800
No, Edie. She's dead.

60
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,700
But she's my sister, and I'm going to find out
exactly what happened to her.

61
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,300
Look, Felicia, it's natural to freak out
when a loved one's missing.

62
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,300
Loved one?

63
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,200
Oh. Edie, let me be clear about this --

64
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,200
I hated Martha.

65
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,700
She was a wretched pig of a woman, and the day
she died, this world became a better place.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,800
<font color=yellow>It was in that moment that Edie finally
saw the family resemblance.

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,000
<font color=F62B97>Episode 11 : Move On

68
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
<font color=yellow>Mrs. Huber was missing.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,600
<font color=yellow>The words echoed down Wisteria Lane until every last
resident was aware of her disappearance.

70
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,700
<font color=yellow>By noon, dozens of neighbors had gathered.

71
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,800
<font color=yellow>Some came to volunteer.

72
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
<font color=yellow>Some came in sympathy.

73
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,400
<font color=yellow>And some came to learn exactly what the police knew

74
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,900
<font color=yellow>and what they didn't.

75
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,400
& nbsp;

76
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,600
So I'll need you to pass out flyers.

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,700
Put them in the mall, the park, anywhere you think
Mrs. Huber might have been seen.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,200
We need to jump on this. Time is of the essence.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Edie, would you like to say something?

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,100
On behalf of Martha and her sister Felicia,

81
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,000
I'd like to thank you all for coming here today.

82
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,600
You know, my last conversation
with Martha was one of anger,

83
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,400
and I'll never forgive myself for the things that I said.

84
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,200
I lay awake at night thinking about it.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,400
I don't know how she did it, but Edie
managed to make this all about her.

86
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,700
She's a talented girl, our Edie.

87
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,200
Has anybody talked to Bree? How's Rex doing?

88
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,100
She's bringing him home from the hospital today.

89
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,300
Boy, I don't know how he had a heart attack.
He was so young.

90
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,600
Hey, how creepy is Mrs. Huber's sister?

91
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
I know.

92
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,700
The way she was talking about Mrs. Huber,
it was like she was already dead.

93
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,900
You don't think she's...

94
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,900
oh, no. I'm sure she's fine.
We're talking about Mrs. Huber.

95
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,000
She's like a roach.

96
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,500
I just wanted you to know that everyone on Wisteria Lane
is praying for your sister's safe return.

97
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,400
Oh, I seriously doubt that.

98
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,300
What do you mean, you're not taking care of him?

99
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,200
Dad's being released today.
He's got to have a place to recuperate.

100
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, then, he can go to a motel,
because he is not allowed back in my house.

101
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,300
I thought you two were getting along. What happened?

102
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,900
T hat's...

103
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,100
between your father and me.

104
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,600
You're so selfish.

105
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,500
You know, I am so looking forward to the day that
I get to put you in a nursing home.

106
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,300
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Andrew,

107
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:32,000
but my plan is to have an embolism and to die young.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,700
Yeah, well, we're all rooting for you,
but you might not be so lucky.

109
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,600
Andrew.

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,400
You want to see how long I can hold a grudge?

111
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,000
Go ahead and abandon my father,
because I promise you, you'll be sorry.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,200
You wouldn't be saying that if you knew what --

113
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,700
knew what?

114
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,100
Well, come on, tell me, because I'd love to
know what my father did that was so awful.

115
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Fine. I will see him through this, but after that,

116
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,500
your father can rot in hell for all I care.

117
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,200
We're not like other families, are we?

118
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,700
No. We're not.

119
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,200
Gabrielle, it's not my fault that
your bank accounts are frozen.

120
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,500
I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying fix it.

121
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,300
Well, I wish I could, but the folks at the justice
department aren't very sympathetic.

122
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm running out of money.

123
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,000
In a couple of weeks, I'm going to be screwed.

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Why don't you hock some of your jewelry?

125
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
There's a lot of stuff you never wear,
and most of it's ugly.

126
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,700
Don't you have a toilet to scrub?

127
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm just so angry with Carlos.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,500
What was he thinking, exporting goods
made from slave labor?

129
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,700
Why couldn't he have embezzled like
other white-collar criminals?

130
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,900
All the justice department wants is to make sure
that Carlos doesn't skip the country.

131
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,800
Now, if he's released on bail,

132
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,200
I can argue that he needs money to live on, and they'll
probably unfreeze one of the smaller accounts.

133
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,800
But they won't release him on bail
until they get the passport.

134
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,500
Exactly.

135
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,800
You haven't found that yet, have you?

136
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,400
<font color=yellow>Gabrielle wanted her old lifestyle back, no question.

137
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,500
<font color=yellow>But she wanted Carlos to suffer
for his betrayal even more.

138
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,700
I'm still searching.

139
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,400
Well, in that case, you might want to
think about looking for a job.

140
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,700
So I had a really good time.

141
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,400
Yeah, I bet you did.

142
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,300
Gotcha.

143
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,500
Hey. Is this a bad time?

144
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,000
For you? Of course it is.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,303
That's cute. Tax stuff. I need your signature.

146
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:30,800
We've been divorced over a year.

147
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,500
2003.

148
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,800
Well, please, just come on in.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Uh, Mike, I don't think you've officially
met my ex Karl Mayer.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,400
Oh, hey. Mike Delfino.

151
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,800
Right. The plumber.

152
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:50,300
Yeah, I don't have the right washer for this faucet, so I'm
just going to go across the street and get it.

153
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,600
So he seems okay.

154
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,800
Yeah, he is.

155
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
So what do you want me to sign?

156
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,900
Oh. I see.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,500
By the way, Julie told me about her birthday plans.

158
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,100
Yeah, we're going to a restaurant downtown.

159
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,700
A guy who plays piano and a open Mike.

160
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,600
Julie got a bunch of her girlfriends together,
and so we're just going to make a night of it.

161
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,800
Julie loves to sing. It sounds nice.

162
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Here you go.

163
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,600
All righty.

164
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Give my best to Brandi.

165
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,700
Actually, uh...

166
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,700
we're not together anymore.

167
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
You're not?

168
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,500
What happened?

169
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,600
I caught her in bed with another guy.

170
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,500
Go ahead. Do your happy dance. You deserve it.

171
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,400
No, no, really. I'm -- I'm sorry that
you had to go through that. I am.

172
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,000
Uh...

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
it's just really hard for me right now.

174
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,200
Thanks.

175
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,400
try ripping up old photos. It helps.

176
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, have fun this weekend.

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,900
Let me knowhow the party goes.

178
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,500
Karl...

179
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,400
do you want to join us?

180
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,900
Susan...

181
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,000
you're the best.

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,700
Ooh, well... yeah, I am the best, aren't I?

183
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,000
You know, if we're going to buy a water heater,
we should talk about it.

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,200
We could go to the mall tomorrow. They're having a sale.

185
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,100
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

186
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Well, I'm just trying to plan my day.

187
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,800
Please, honey, I'm so tired.

188
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,900
Okay.

189
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,400
- Hon?
- Hmm?

190
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,500
Did you set up the coffee maker?

191
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,600
Oh, no.

192
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,600
You know what? I'll do it in the morning.
I promise, I'll get up early and do it.

193
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,100
- Tom...
- mm.

194
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,700
Tom...come on.

195
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,900
Thanks.

196
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,800
Yeah.

197
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,900
C laire?

198
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,800
I'm -- I'm, uh...

199
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,200
wow, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were up.

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,400
Yeah, I- I thought you were sleeping.

201
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,000
I was just going upstairs.

202
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Do you want me to make the coffee?

203
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,100
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah.

204
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,300
I'm just going to, um, I'm just,
you know, go back up to my room.

205
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,600
Okay.

206
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,200
All right.

207
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
Good night.

208
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,300
Good night.

209
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,600
Also, you know, if we go to the mall,
we can go to the shoe store.

210
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,300
You said you wanted new running shoes.

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,300
What?

212
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh.

213
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,100
<font color=yellow>The next morning, while the search for
Martha Huber continued,

214
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,800
<font color=yellow>Lynette discovered a little family secret --

215
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,600
<font color=yellow>one she wasn't even looking for.

216
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,000
Good morning.

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,900
Morning.

218
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,000
Want some coffee?

219
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Uh, yeah, thanks.

220
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,700
I didn't want to come down till Tom left for work.

221
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
I'm still a little embarrassed.

222
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,300
About what?

223
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,800
Oh, he didn't tell you?

224
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,300
Well, actually, it's kind of funny.
Um...I was doing some laundry,

225
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,000
and I noticed that the robe I was wearing
had some baby food on it,

226
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,700
so I threw it in, figuring I could dash upstairs
while everyone was asleep,

227
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,500
and then I ran into Tom

228
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,800
while I was totally naked.

229
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And so, Claire, when did this incident occur?

230
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,400
I don't know. It was pretty late.

231
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,700
I think he might have come down to
make coffee or something.

232
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,300
You don't say.

233
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,500
Wow.

234
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,300
Wow.

235
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,000
Wow. Well, this is certainly impressive.
I can definitely get you work as a model,

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,900
but you do realize it's different from the runway
work you did in New York and Milan.

237
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,900
Of course. I made $10,000 a day.

238
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,200
I don't expect to --to make that here.

239
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,100
Well, that's good, because you won't.

240
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,800
Yeah. So what do you got?

241
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,700
Well, there is something.

242
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,800
Uh, they need a model to demonstrate the
new buick lacrosse at the fairview mall.

243
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,400
It's just going to be you and the car on
a revolving platform. 300 bucks for the day.

244
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,200
Uh, what else do you have?

245
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,300
Sure.

246
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Um... ooh. Can you swing a sword?

247
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Sci-fi convention needs someone
to dress up as a warrior princess.

248
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
A warrior princess?

249
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,400
Mr. Gibb, I am a professional model.

250
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,200
Look at this bone structure.

251
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,000
This face is a cash cow.

252
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And if you don't have the vision to take advantage
of that, then maybe I'm at the wrong agency.

253
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,400
Hey, look, honey,

254
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,800
I'm the only modeling agent in a 100-mile radius.

255
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,100
I book women for boat shows and garden tool expos.

256
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,500
If you don't like it, move back to the city.

257
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,200
This, um, buick thing...

258
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,600
does it include lunch?

259
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,400
Just so you know,

260
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,100
I really am grateful for everything you're doing for me.

261
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, I don't need your gratitude.

262
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You're only here because your children
are master extortionists.

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,400
So you didn't tell them about --

264
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,100
your adultery? No, I decided to keep
that little gem all to myself.

265
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,500
Listen, I know this is a real imposition --

266
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,800
yes, it is.

267
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,100
The doctor said you could be here for weeks.

268
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,000
Would it make you feel any better
if I told you I'm sorry for what I did?

269
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes, it would...

270
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,100
if I still felt anything for you.

271
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,500
But as it stands, the place you used to occupy
in my heart is very much empty now.

272
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,700
You must still feel something for me.

273
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,800
And why do you think that?

274
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,600
Oh, come on. Bree, look at this.

275
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,500
You're using the good china,freshly pressed napkins,
flowers from the garden.

276
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,700
This tray was prepared with loving care.

277
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,500
Do me a favor, Rex --

278
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,500
please don't mistake my anal retentiveness
for actual affection.

279
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,800
Hold on a sec.

280
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,400
Okay. Now I'm good.

281
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,600
What?

282
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,900
You're just --god, I love you.

283
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,200
Oh.

284
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Well...that's great.

285
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,900
Wait, look, that just kind of popped out.

286
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,300
No, no, it's fine. It just kind of caught me off-guard.

287
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,700
I mean, I want to say it back.

288
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,100
Yeah, but you're not ready. It's okay.

289
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,300
You're not mad, are you?

290
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,100
No, god. We haven't even been dating that long,
and you've got other issues. I get it.

291
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,300
Good.

292
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,900
Issues? What kind of issues do you think I have?

293
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,200
You know, I retract my earlier statement.
I no longer love you.

294
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,100
In fact, I just think of you as a really good buddy.

295
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,800
No. No, no, no, no. You obviously think
you have some insight into my soul,

296
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,700
so please go ahead. Dazzle me.

297
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,600
Your divorce left you hurt and vulnerable.

298
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,300
Big insight. The postman knows that.

299
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,100
And there's a chance you might still
have feelings for your ex.

300
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,600
What?

301
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,400
I loathe Karl,

302
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
and the postman will back me up on that, too.

303
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm sure part of you does hate him, but, well,
maybe part of you is still hung up on him.

304
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,400
Where are you getting this?

305
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,600
Well, he broke up with the woman he left you for,

306
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,900
and what was the first thing you did?
You hugged him

307
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,900
and invited him to a party.

308
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.

309
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,300
The analysis part of this evening is now over.

310
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,100
Hey... you asked.

311
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,000
Well, you know what?

312
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,100
You're going to come to julie's party tomorrow night,

313
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,800
and you're going to see Karl and I together,

314
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,400
and you're going to understand once and for all
that I have no feelings for him whatsoever.

315
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,500
Well, actually, I have tickets to a basketball game --

316
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,900
well, actually, you're coming to the party tomorrow,
and that's the end of it.

317
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,700
This is what I get for saying "I love you."

318
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,600
What?

319
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,000
Nothing.

320
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,100
There you go.

321
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,500
Hello, George.

322
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Mrs. Van De Kamp. You're looking lovely today.

323
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,100
You always say the nicest things.

324
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,100
Well, it's, uh, it's true.

325
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,800
Listen, I have a prescription here for Rex.
I don't know if you heard, but he had a heart attack.

326
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,100
I had no idea. Is he okay?

327
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,600
Oh, yes, he'll --he'll live, but, uh, the doctor says
he's at risk for something called pericarditis.

328
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,800
Do you know anything about that?

329
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,900
It's an inflammation of the membrane
that surrounds the heart.

330
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,600
It'll take a few months to make sure it doesn't develop,
but he'll need constant care.

331
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
So I hear.

332
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
<font color=yellow>As the words "constant care" echoed in her head,

333
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,100
<font color=yellow>Bree caught a sickening glimpse into her future...

334
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,500
okay, here we go.

335
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,100
<font color=yellow>Which prompted her to seek an old-fashioned remedy.

336
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,300
George, would you go out to dinner with me?

337
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,200
Um, y-you mean like a date?

338
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,600
Yes. I think it would be fun.

339
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,900
What about your husband?

340
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,200
Oh, him.

341
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,300
Well, we're separated.

342
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:35,500
<font color=yellow>In spite of Mrs. Huber's disappearance,
life on Wisteria Lane started to return to normal

343
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,400
<font color=yellow>until an intriguing discovery was made
on a dirt road next to the interstate.

344
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,000
This is officer burton.

345
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,100
I have an abandoned vehicle registered to a missing
person. One Martha Huber. Please advise.

346
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:58,100
<font color=yellow>As news spread of this mysterious development,
everyone in the neighborhood decided to band together

347
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,400
<font color=yellow>to show their support and to look for clues...

348
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,100
<font color=yellow>or worse.

349
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,200
I'm keeping my eyes on the horizon.

350
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,900
Please tell me if I am about to step on a body part.

351
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,800
It's a search and rescue, not recover.
We don't know if she's dead.

352
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,400
Yeah, people fake their own abductions all the time.

353
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Could we talk about something else,
something less depressing?

354
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,300
Well, here's something -- Mike told me he loved me.

355
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Oh, my god!

356
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,100
Over here! They found the body!

357
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,200
No, I'm sorry! False alarm! We didn't find a body.

358
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,300
Uh, Susan just had some really good news.

359
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,700
- Sorry.
- It was nothing. False alarm.

360
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,400
Well, doesn't that figure.
Susan always finds a way to make it about her.

361
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:45,300
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you
the fabulous buick lacrosse.

362
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,900
It -- it has expertly crafted interior,

363
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,500
peaceful, quiet tuning, and ultra sonic rear parking assist.

364
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,800
Observe the remote activation feature.

365
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:13,300
Uh, and it also has a lot of other exciting,
good, cool car things.

366
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,700
Tom, Lynette. What are you doing here?

367
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,400
We're buying a new water heater. Um, how about you?

368
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,800
Just doing a little shopping,
trying to get my mind off things.

369
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,900
Hey, Gabby, you need help?
It looks like you're stuck here.

370
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,100
Oh, I guess I am.

371
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,800
- No worries. I got it.
- Guess I got too close to the turntable.

372
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,500
I'm a sucker for these buicks.

373
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,000
Come on, you bastard.

374
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You know, with their, uh, perfectly crafted
interior and peaceful, quiet tuning.

375
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,700
Uh-huh.

376
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,800
Little formal for the mall.

377
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,400
Oh, uh, you know, I-I wanted to match
the shoes to the dress.

378
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
This is, uh, sarah,

379
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,900
my shopping buddy. We like to hitthe boutiques together.

380
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,700
Okay, well, you gals, um, shop your little hearts out.
See you later.

381
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,400
Bye.

382
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,000
Wow. Look at you. You going out?

383
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,100
Not that it's any of your business, but, um, I have a date.

384
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
A date? What kind of date?

385
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,300
Rex, I don't want to say anything that might upset you.

386
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,000
The doctor says any undue stress could
cause another heart attack.

387
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:55,600
It's a romantic date with a single, attractive man,
and I intend to french the hell out of him.

388
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,900
Oh, right on time.

389
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

390
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,600
In my spare time, I garden. I thought you might like these.

391
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,300
Oh, my. They're exquisite.

392
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,000
Compost and eggshells?

393
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,200
Yes.

394
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,400
Oh. Come on in.

395
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,100
Thanks.

396
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,600
George, you remember Rex.

397
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,600
Uh, I thought you said you were separated.

398
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Oh, we are, emotionally. Physically, he just lives here
because his mistress refuses to care for him.

399
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,200
Would you like a drink?

400
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,500
Uh, no, I-I'm fine, thanks.

401
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,800
Rex, say hello to George.

402
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,100
Hello, George.

403
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,400
Hello, Dr. Van De Kamp.

404
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,100
I'm going to go put these in water.

405
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,600
George, why don't you have a seat,
and I'll be right back?

406
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,600
So, uh, how's your heart, Dr. Van De Kamp?

407
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,800
- Better. How's the pharmacy? - Busy. It's busy.

408
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,200
Is something funny?

409
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,900
It's -- it's nothing.

410
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:14,500
See, I, uh...I recently engaged in
some extracurricular activity,

411
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,100
and now bree's doing anything
she can to make me suffer

412
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,300
All you can do is laugh.

413
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,800
Yeah. I-I guess.

414
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,700
Oh, these flowers are stunning.
They're the best ones I've ever gotten.

415
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,600
Shall we?

416
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,700
Well, it was nice talking to you, Dr. Van De Kamp.

417
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,300
Please. You're dating my wife. Call me Rex.

418
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,100
That salesgirl that sold us the water heater --
she had a cute figure.

419
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,400
Yeah, I guess. I didn't notice.

420
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,000
Oh, how can you say? She was so your type--
big breasts, really curvy.

421
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,100
What are you doing?

422
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,400
Nothing. I'm just saying you prefer women who are
really curvy, women like that salesgirl or Claire.

423
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,100
There's only one type that I prefer.

424
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,000
You.

425
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Aw, you kissed me as though that would
end this conversation, and it so won't.

426
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,700
Why am I in trouble? I haven't done anything wrong.

427
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,900
The only reason you made love to me the other night
was because you had just seen claire naked.

428
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
aw, crap.

429
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,300
Claire is a great nanny. It would be stupid
to lose her over something like this.

430
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,500
You and I have had crushes before.
We always tell each other.

431
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,100
We laugh about it. It's no big deal.

432
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,000
What worries me about this is you're denying
you're obviously attracted. Why?

433
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,700
I'm not denying anything.

434
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,300
Oh, so you are attracted to her.

435
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,500
I didn't say that.

436
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,800
What are you doing?

437
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,700
We are not going anywhere until you confess
you have the hots for our nanny.

438
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,500
Tom, it's okay. She's attractive.

439
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,300
Men by nature are drawn to fertile young women
with whom they can plant their seed.

440
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,300
It's the basic flaw of your gender.
I get it. Just do me the honor of --

441
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,900
we'd all like to get out of here. Is there a problem?

442
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,300
My husband won't admit that he has lust in his heart.

443
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,200
Can you give us a minute?

444
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,600
Lynette, Claire is attractive, yes.

445
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,300
But I am not attracted to her.

446
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,800
Look, if I thought for even a second that
there was any danger in having Claire around,

447
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,300
I'd be the first to get rid of her.

448
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,400
It's you. You're the one.

449
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,100
You always have been, and you always will be.

450
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,200
All right. Hold your water.

451
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,500
<font color=orange>Then as a coda, we drink ice cream soda
here down at the old five and dime, yeah

452
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,600
yay. Oh, you guys were fantastic.

453
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,000
Thank you.

454
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,700
Um, they've got a dance floor upstairs,
and we're going to go check it out.

455
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,000
Okay. Have fun.

456
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Edie. Over here.

457
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,500
What the hell is she doing here?

458
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,200
What, I don't get to bring a date?
I heard you were bringing him.

459
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,100
Of all people, you pick that tired piece of --

460
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,200
- Edie. - Hi, Susan.

461
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,400
Oh, thank you so much for the invite.

462
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,400
God knows I needed something to
get my mind off poor Martha.

463
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,800
A kiss for the birthday boy.

464
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,700
Um, Edie, it's not his birthday.

465
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh. Oh.

466
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,800
Thank you, George. That was a lovely evening.

467
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,300
The pleasure was mine.

468
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:46,500
There's nothing better than great conversation
with a beautiful woman over a delicious meal.

469
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,300
Well, I guess I should go inside.

470
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,800
I'm glad we did this.

471
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,500
Me too.

472
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,500
Andrew. Where did you come from?

473
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,100
I was just on my wayback from brian's house.
What's going on here?

474
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,500
Oh, uh, you remember Mr. Williams, our pharmacist.

475
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,800
- Hey there.
- How's it going?

476
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,200
What are you doing in his car?

477
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,800
We're just, um, talking.
Mr. Williams took me out to dinner.

478
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,100
You mean like on a date?

479
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,000
Well, um...

480
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,200
Yes.

481
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,800
You are aware that she's married, right?

482
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Andrew, your father and I are separated, and you know it.

483
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,400
I don't care. Couldn't you at least wait
until he was out of the house?

484
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,000
The only reason he's still in the house is
because you insisted I care for him.

485
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,200
So -- so what, what are you guys going to do now?

486
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Are you -- are you two going to have sex?

487
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,400
- No, we are not going to have sex.
- Why not?

488
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,300
Because I don't commit adultery like your father.

489
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,600
That's right. Your father had an affair, I found out about it,
and I'm just trying to move on with my life.

490
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,900
You should watch out for her. She's a liar.

491
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,400
Andrew...

492
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,100
<font color=yellow>In spite of her mounting debt,

493
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,600
<font color=yellow>Gabrielle was determined to prove she could
get along just fine without Carlos's money.

494
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,800
<font color=yellow>It wasn't until the electricity went out

495
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,500
<font color=yellow>that she finally began to see the light.

496
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,600
Mr. Hartley, it's Gabrielle Solis.

497
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,500
I need you to start working on releasing Carlos on bail.

498
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,800
I just remembered where I put his passport.

499
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,700
<font color=orange>But I, I took the sweet life

500
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,600
<font color=orange>never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet

501
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,000
<font color=orange>I spent my life exploring the subtle whoring

502
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,300
<font color=orange>that costs too much to be free

503
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,600
<font color=orange>hey, lady

504
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,200
<font color=orange>I've been to paradise

505
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:35,300
<font color=orange>but I've never been

506
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:43,200
<font color=orange>to me

507
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,200
Oh, thank you.

508
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Damn, woman. You were good.

509
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yes. All right, you're next, susie Q.
What you going to sing?

510
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,800
Yes

511
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,600
You sing?

512
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,000
Only when I'm alone.

513
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,400
Come on. We're among friends.

514
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,500
I don't think so.

515
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,600
Well, I, for one, would love to hear your voice.

516
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,300
Give it up, plumber. She's not budging.

517
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,200
You want to hear me sing?

518
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Yeah.

519
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,900
Okay.

520
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,200
What's it going to be? I'll tell the piano player.

521
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
"New york, new york."

522
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,500
Oh, I am so excited to hear you.

523
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,200
Oh, but doesn't it just figure?

524
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
What do you mean?

525
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,000
You have to get up in front of a room
full of people dressed like that.

526
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,700
I hope they don't turn on you.

527
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,500
I think I'll take my chances, sort of like
you did on those high notes.

528
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,700
I'm going to get us two more.

529
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,300
That's a great idea.

530
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,000
So that Mike -- he seems pretty even-keeled.

531
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,800
Yeah. He's a great guy.

532
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,500
But you know, I mean, he's a little buster brown.

533
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,600
Don't you ever worry you're going to get bored?

534
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,100
Thanks for your concern, Karl. I'm fine.

535
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,900
Go figure.

536
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,400
Even though our marriage was crazy
at times, it never got dull.

537
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Yeah, that part when you slept with
your secretary was really exciting.

538
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,500
I know. How many times do I have to hear it?
It was a mistake.

539
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:14,000
But don't I ever get credit for the 13 loyal
years beforehand?

540
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,100
You must not be counting
the Hendersons' christmas party.

541
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,600
Edie, not now.

542
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,200
Oh, what's the big deal, Karl?
Your marriage is history anyway.

543
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,700
Edie.

544
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,400
It was nothing, really.
Basically, we both got plastered on eggnog,

545
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,100
and we found ourselves standing under the, uh, mistletoe,

546
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,100
and we were like, "okay, well, what do we do now?"

547
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:42,300
So I smiled, and he smiled, and then Karl
reached over and started feeling me up.

548
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,200
- Susie, that's not how it happened.
- All right, Susan, come on, you're up.

549
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,900
What?

550
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,500
This is --it's so silly.

551
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,200
Susie --

552
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,000
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Susan Mayer.

553
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,400
<font color=orange>Start spreadin' the news

554
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,100
<font color=orange>I'm leavin' today

555
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,700
<font color=orange>I wanna be a part of it

556
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,500
<font color=orange>new york, new york

557
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,300
<font color=orange>these vagabond shoes

558
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,100
you're an ass, you know that?
No, keep playing.

559
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,600
<font color=orange>Are longing to stray

560
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,400
there's a word, you know, right?

561
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,700
<font color=orange>And get around the heart of it

562
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,500
<font color=orange>new york, new york

563
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,400
<font color=orange>I wanna

564
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,300
just tell you that the affair was one thing.

565
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,600
I mean, I forgave you, because on some small level,

566
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,200
I thought that you were in love with her,

567
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,200
and now I find out that you were
just groping people at parties.

568
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,500
<font color=orange>Top of the heap

569
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,900
Karl, don't you turn away from me. Look at me!

570
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,100
You know, what else were you doing during our marriage?

571
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,500
How many other women were you sticking it to?

572
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:06,700
As god is my witness, it will snow on the hills of hell
before I ever feel sorry for you again!

573
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,800
<font color=orange>New york

574
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:26,000
<font color=yellow>As the police interviewed the residents of Wisteria Lane
about the mysterious disappearance of Martha Huber,

575
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,200
<font color=yellow>my husband Paul reasoned it would only be a matter of
time before their digging would begin to yield answers.

576
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,400
<font color=yellow>Since he knew the police had no suspects,

577
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,900
<font color=yellow>he decided to point them towards
the most logical candidate.

578
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:16,100
<font color=yellow>You see, if there's one thing Paul understood
about the suburbs, it was this --

579
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,300
<font color=yellow>no one's ever more suspicious

580
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:25,500
<font color=yellow>than a new neighbor who's just moved in.

581
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,600
Parker's getting sniffly.

582
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,000
Yeah, I noticed that, too.
I hope he's not coming down with a cold.

583
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,500
He doesn't have a cough yet,
but he sort of has this post-nasal drip thing happening.

584
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,200
I'll make an appointment for him.

585
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,700
I always say it is better to be safe than sorry.

586
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,700
Little kids get sick, and it's -- sorry --out of control...

587
00:35:50,700 --> 00:36:01,800
man, kids with these colds,
it's just -- just this vicious cycle.

588
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,500
Um, um, Claire?

589
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,000
We have to make some changes.

590
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,000
What are you doing?

591
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,900
I'm packing up your father's things
for when he eventually moves out.

592
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,000
Well, here. Let me help you.

593
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,100
Look, I-I talked to dad,

594
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,000
and it turns out you were telling the truth.

595
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,100
Oh, andrew, I'm so sorry that I said anything.

596
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,800
No, you know, I'm glad you did. Now I know.

597
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,900
There comes this point in every boy's life.

598
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,500
What, finding out his dad's screwing around?

599
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,100
No.

600
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,500
That his father's only human.

601
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,900
Listen, why are you taking care of him?

602
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,900
Is it because of what Danielle and I said?
Because you can forget that.

603
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,400
I'll help you take his stuff out on the street if you want.

604
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,200
That's sweet, but I'm taking care of him
because it's the right thing to do.

605
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,400
Why are you being such a push over?

606
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,500
I mean, he cheated on you.

607
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,200
He's a jerk.

608
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,700
Andrew...

609
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,400
you will not speak that way about your father in front of me.

610
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,400
Why the hell not? I mean, for once, I'm actually on your side.

611
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,100
Yes, I'm angry with him.

612
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,300
I am going to divorce him. I may even marry somebody else.

613
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,700
But make no mistake about it, your father
is and always will be the love of my life.

614
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,600
He gave me the best18-year marriage that...

615
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,500
I could have ever hoped for.

616
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,800
And for that, you will respect him.

617
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,200
Okay

618
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,500
What is it? I'm really, really busy.

619
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,900
I came by to apologize.

620
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,900
Oh. Well, in that case, come on in. I'm not doing anything.

621
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,900
I can't believe Edie brought the whole thing up.

622
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,500
Susan... I-I am so sorry.

623
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
I-I thought I was done hurting you.

624
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,100
Yeah, me too.

625
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,800
And just so you know,

626
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,600
I'm sorry for flipping out.

627
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,300
I shouldn't let you get to me like that.

628
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
What?

629
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,800
I do still get to you, don't I?

630
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,700
That's the difference between the plumber and me.

631
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,400
No, don't get me wrong, he's a good guy.
I mean, I like him.

632
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,800
But I'm betting that you two don't
have what we had together.

633
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,600
There was always a spark between us.

634
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,500
A spark?

635
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,100
Look, what I'm trying to say is
he must seem really safe after me.

636
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,100
A moray eel would seem safe after you.

637
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,700
That's what I'm talking about -- that great
back-and-forth, the joking around...

638
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,500
we still argue and push each other's buttons.

639
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,200
News flash --I hated all of that.

640
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,800
Come on, you have to admit when it was good,

641
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,100
it was the best.

642
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,000
What are you saying?

643
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,400
Let's give this another shot.

644
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,900
You want me back?

645
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
Yeah.

646
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah. I realize now

647
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,500
that you were the woman that was meant for me.

648
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,400
Wow.

649
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,200
W-w-- just so we're clear,

650
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:08,900
so -- so you want to move back in here and -- and be
faithful to me and love me with all your heart and soul?

651
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,500
Absolutely.

652
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,000
Oh, my god. This is so wonderful.

653
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,900
Yeah. I know, I know.

654
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,800
I want to kiss you.

655
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,500
Oh, god. No, Karl. Um, no,

656
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:28,400
what I meant by wonderful was that I wondered inside if I
still had feelings for you,
if deep down, I still loved you.

657
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,100
And?

658
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,500
And --

659
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,300
There's nothing there.

660
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,300
Come on. You've got to feel something.

661
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,400
Well, actually, I do, yeah. Excuse me.

662
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,000
Oh, my god.

663
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,900
Susan.

664
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,800
Mike, guess what.

665
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,300
I love you.

666
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,400
Are you sure?

667
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,300
Yes.

668
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,800
Did I come at a bad time?

669
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,100
Um, they're just asking some
questions about Mrs. Huber.

670
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,200
I love him. You can write that in your little book.

671
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,600
<font color=yellow>We are all searching for someone,

672
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,900
<font color=yellow>that special person who will provide us
what's missing in our lives.

673
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,500
<font color=yellow>Someone who can offer companionship...

674
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,900
George? Hi, it's me -- Bree.

675
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,600
I was wondering, are you free next saturday?

676
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,100
You are? Oh, that's wonderful.

677
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,500
<font color=yellow>Or assistance...

678
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,600
hi. I understand your agency handles nannies.

679
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,600
I need someone experienced and preferably unattractive.

680
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,400
<font color=yellow>Or security.

681
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,700
Hi, honey. Did the lawyer tell you the good news?

682
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,200
You're going to make bail. I found your passport.

683
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,100
<font color=yellow>And sometimes, if we search very hard,
we can find someone who provides us...

684
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,200
well, I just called to say hi, and I love you.

685
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,300
<font color=yellow>With all three.

686
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,200
All right, all right. Enough already.

687
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,600
<font color=yellow>Yes, we're all searching for someone,

688
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,000
<font color=yellow>and if we can't find them,

689
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,900
<font color=yellow>we can only pray

690
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,000
<font color=yellow>they find us.

691
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,600
What you got, boy?
