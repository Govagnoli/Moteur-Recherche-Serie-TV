1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,850
previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,590
why on earth would you let
 them finger paintbefore breakfast?

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,680
It's my job to clean
 that up,so it's my call

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,030
Some households reversed roles

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,130
Let's give thisanother shot

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,600
Some old flames...

7
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,310
- you want me back?
 - Yeah

8
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,550
Were put out

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,660
It has to be
 somethingyou're ingesting

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,160
Who prepares your meals?

11
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,410
I understand you've
 been havingsome marital problems

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,870
And while some learn to forgive...

13
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,450
deirdre got pregnantbefore
 I went to jail

14
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,990
Zach is your son,isn't he?

15
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,100
Yep

16
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,800
Others could not bring
 themselves to forget their past

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,900
The remarkable thing about danny farrell

18
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,880
was that he had only
 been a paperboy for six months

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,760
and in that time,he had become the
 enemy of every woman on wisteria lane

20
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,440
If there was a puddle
 on someone's property...

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,750
he found it

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,990
If a new rosebush
 had just been planted...

23
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,430
he destroyed it

24
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,990
If a cat was enjoying
 a moment in the sun...

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,550
he ended it

26
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,750
People wondered if
 danny would ever change

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,350
They should have talked to susan mayer

28
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,230
She could have told them...

29
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,200
obnoxious boys tend
 to become obnoxious men

30
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,580
just like the one...

31
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,570
she had been married to

32
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,350
Hey!

33
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,700
Carl,I see you
 Just stop right there

34
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,800
Hey,susie Q.

35
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,000
What are you doing?

36
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,260
I'm justgettin' the paper

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,200
That's edie's paper
 and this is edie's house

38
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,790
Do we have to do this now?
 I haven't had my coffee yet

39
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,910
Did you spend the nightwith edie?

40
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,920
Oh,my god

41
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,290
Susie,just calm down

42
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,010
You are forbiddenfrom ever seeing
 her again.Do you hear me?Forbidden!

43
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,210
We're divorced
 You can'ttell me who I can date

44
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,800
I live on this street
 Yourdaughter lives on this street

45
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,970
I will not have you
 flauntingyour sexcapades in front of us

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,830
- Sexcapades?
 - Forbidden

47
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,560
I would love to continue this
 but it's time for breakfast

48
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,980
and edie is making mea frittata

49
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,680
Oh! Well,I just bet she is

50
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,060
Mrs. Mayer,I gotta talk to you

51
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,920
Oh,now is not a good time,danny

52
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,850
You're a month behindin your payments

53
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,430
I'll take care of it,I promise

54
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,120
My dad says
 if you readsomething and don't pay for it

55
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,310
that's the same as stealing

56
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,400
Hi,ida
 Can we talkabout this later?

57
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,500
I just found out
 my exis dating my neighbor

58
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,030
and I'm really ticked off

59
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,880
Save it!I provide you a service
 and I deserve to be paidfor that service

60
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,600
Yes,the women of wisteria lane
 believe danny farrell to be the enemy

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,750
Deadbeat!

62
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,690
they also believed the
 enemy of my enemy is my friend

65
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,360
Beautiful lawns...

66
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,670
spacious homes...

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,900
happy families...

68
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,030
these are the hallmarks of suburbia

69
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,400
but if you look beneath
 the veneer of gracious living

70
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,750
you will see a battle raging...

71
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,920
a battle for control

72
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,810
You see the combatants everywhere...
 engaged in their routine skirmishes...

73
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,410
Fighting fiercely to have
 dominion over the world around them

74
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,050
all the while knowing...

75
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,700
it's a battle they will lose

76
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,880
Oh,hey,honey,just stick that anywhere
 I'll take care of it

77
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,960
It's really pilin' up

78
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,940
Oh,don't worry
 I have a system

79
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,010
Really?

80
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,500
Yeah,every two days,I clean

81
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,390
Two days

82
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,610
Yeah,I let the mess
 accumulate for two days

83
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,000
and then I clean until it's sparkling
 and then the cycle starts all over again

84
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,290
And why...

85
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,810
have I never seen the sparkling part?

86
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,250
Well,because by the time
 you get home from work

87
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,190
the boys have
 messed everything up again

88
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,800
See? That's what I would
 call a flaw in the system

89
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,140
What are you doin'?

90
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,600
I think I'm asking
 you to clean the house

91
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,950
Really?'Cause it sounds
 to me like you're criticizing me

92
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,970
No

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,120
No,no,no,no. No

94
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,590
I'm not saying
 it has to be sparkling

95
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,950
How many times did I come home to
 a mess and I never said a word?

96
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,800
Please,don't take
 this the wrong way

97
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,210
I think you are
 doing a terrific job

98
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,430
but let's be clear
 When you came home,it was to clutter

99
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,560
I mean,come on,this is...

100
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,600
more than that

101
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,900
Look at him,just chatting away

102
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,880
So inconsiderate

103
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,920
Phyllis,we've only been
 waiting here for two minutes

104
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,440
I told you when we left
 the house that I needed to eat

105
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
I have low blood sugar

106
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,840
Do you wanna see me keel over?

107
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,040
No... in theory

108
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,870
Here you are

109
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Thank you

110
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,340
By the way
 mrs.Van de kamp

111
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,100
I heard about
 your husband's passing

112
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,780
I'm so sorry.Dr.Van de kamp was
 one of my favorite customers,truly

113
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,580
That's very sweet of you
 Thank you

114
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,870
I'm not just being polite
 Mrs. Van de kamp

115
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,160
How are you feeling?

116
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,110
Well,mr. Pashmutti...

117
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,690
we're holding up as best
 we can under the circumstances

118
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,480
I'm sorry
 This is rex's mother,phyllis

119
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,790
I'm so sorry about your son

120
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,270
Thank you.You know
 the hardest thing is to lose a child

121
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,930
I can't even imagine

122
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,000
Come on,phyllis
 Let's get you something to eat

123
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,760
We had no warning
 I was doing dishes when I got the call

124
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Really?

125
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,680
Phyllis,there are
 people waiting,so come on

126
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,560
Excuse me.I--I'm so sorry
 but my son just passed away

127
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,650
Oh,I'm so sorry

128
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:23,790
Thank you.I mean I was telling
 Mr.Pashmutti here my life is--is over

129
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,730
my life is over

130
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,810
This is ridiculous
 you know that?

131
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,260
Pen

132
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,190
Don't you think I have better things
 to do than to bring you checks every day

133
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,570
checks that I could
 be signing at home?

134
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,690
This one's dry

135
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,130
You know,taking away my access
 to our account,that's just vindictive

136
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,220
Thank you

137
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,150
Do you knowhow long it takes me
 to schlep out hereto this hellhole?

138
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,400
Exactly. It's the only way
 I can guarantee you'll come and visit me

139
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,070
That's ridiculous.You're my husband. I love you

140
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,760
Obviously,I would come visit

141
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,350
I thought it was obviousthat when
 you love someone you wouldn't have an affair

142
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,540
I was wrong,wasn't I?

143
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,080
I'm getting really tiredof this song,carlos

144
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,020
Isn't it about timeyou forgave me?

145
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,530
You want my forgiveness,you got it. My trust...

146
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,260
that you're gonnahave to earn

147
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,510
Be careful,carlos

148
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,850
Up until now I've been really
 lonelyin that big bed of ours

149
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,410
but when you're rude to me
 itmakes me wanna be not so lonely

150
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,770
Comments like thatare exactly why
 you'll never againhave access to my money

151
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,410
Why are all rich men jerks?

152
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,850
The same reasonall beautiful women are bitches

153
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,780
So same time tomorrow?

154
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,230
Sure,baby

155
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,850
What do you mean,you know?

156
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,400
I mean,I know

157
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,960
What are you saying
 that your father actually told you

158
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,380
he was gonna be having a
 onenight stand with edie britt?

159
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,580
Uh,mom,this wasn'ta one night stand

160
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,720
He's been going out with
 Mrs. Britt for a few months now

161
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
What?

162
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,520
How could you not
 tell me that?We share everything

163
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,920
That's what we're known for
 That's our thing

164
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,670
Because I knew you'd wig out

165
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,580
Besides,haven't you always told
 me to respect people's privacy?

166
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,160
Oh,I've neverapplied that concept
 to your father's sex life and you know it

167
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,610
Are you done?

168
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,710
No! I have not even
 begunripping into edie britt yet

169
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,650
Oh,that peroxide vulture

170
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,310
I just know as sureas I am standing here

171
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,110
that she went after your
 fatherjust to tick me off

172
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,260
- Wrong again
 - What?

173
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,970
He asked her out

174
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,200
You lie

175
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,480
It's true.He called her

176
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,270
the day aftermy birthday party

177
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,150
The one at the piano bar?

178
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,340
Yeah

179
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,490

180
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:46,820
Oh,your fatherjust came over
 that day and told me some stuff

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,090
You know,some stuffthat
 I haven'T...and can't tell you

182
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,560
Wait. Whatever happened
 to"we share everything"?

183
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,930
Isn't that our thing
 what we're known for?

184
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,690
Um,actually,I think what
 we'reknown for is sharing clothes

185
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,400
Yeah.I thinkthat's our thing

186
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,510
why does he keep doin' that?

187
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,240
He knows it's annoying

188
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,710
He's just tryingto get to us

189
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,940
Yeah,well,it's working

190
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,990
Knock it off,down there
 do you hear what I'm saying?

191
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,790
Matthew. Matthew!

192
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,450
Sit down

193
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,530
You knowwe don't talk to him

194
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,120
That's partof his punishment

195
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,190
How can you just sit herehour
 after hour and listen to that?

196
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,120
Well,that's part of mine

197
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,380
carlos,what is thisbig emergency?

198
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,700
I had to cancel my
 hairappointment with eduardo today

199
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,420
Baby,what is it?

200
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,070
I'm completelyfreaked out

201
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,400
Why?

202
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,500
There's this guy,his name's richie

203
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,480
and he's beensaying some stuff to me

204
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,860
and I'm gettin' worried

205
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,830
Honey,you and your macho pride

206
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,250
Just tell him you're flattered
 but you don't swing that way

207
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,390
He's not hitting on me
 you idiot,he's threatening me

208
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,220
Really? How?

209
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,350
He saidhe's gonna beat me up
 unless I come upwith some money

210
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,280
Well,how much money?

211
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,550
$7,000

212
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,430
- $7,000?
 - Keep your voice down

213
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,460
Why would he thinkyou
 have that kind of money?

214
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,820
Because yesterday
 in a visitingroom filled with criminals

215
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,020
my wife referred
 to meas a rich man

216
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,220
Oh,right. Sorry

217
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,440
That's why I needed
 you to bring the checkbook

218
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,370
He's actually willing
 to take a check?

219
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,330
No

220
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,600
You're gonna take the
 money to his girlfriend

221
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,540
and if she doesn't get
 itby tomorrow,I'm screwed

222
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,430
Honey,I thinkthis is a mistake

223
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,800
If we give in to extortion

224
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,880
the guy's just gonna
 keepcoming back for more money

225
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,190
What choice do I have?

226
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,330
You're a strong guy.You went to college
 on an athletic scholarship,for god sakes

227
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,200
Yeah,it was for golf

228
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Oh

229
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,230
You have all my pants

230
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,460
Yeah,I know.Come on in

231
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,670
I,uh,thought when I tookmy stuff back to my house

232
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,650
I got everything

233
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,270
Oh,it's fine.They're in the garage

234
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,400
So how have you been doing?

235
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,480
Good. Um...I'm,uh,good.

236
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,910
I got a question for ya

237
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,250
Sure,what is it?

238
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,600
- Where are we now?
 - Where are we?

239
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:31,620
Yeah. We're notmoving in together
 and we're not broken up,so where are we?

240
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,690
I don't know

241
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,390
Since the guywho held me hostage
 turned out to be your son

242
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,540
I think logic dictatesthat I should move on.

243
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,020
The problem is...
 I'm crazy about you

244
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,050
So...

245
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,710
so I'm thinking we shouldkeep it casual

246
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Casual

247
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,690
What the hell does that mean,exactly,um,casual?

248
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,450
well,I-I don't--I don't think
 there'sanything wrong with us

249
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,450
seeing a movieonce in awhile

250
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,860
A movie. Okay.Is that it?

251
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,790
Jogging?

252
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,830
There's no lawagainst jogging.

253
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,440
Anything else?

254
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,410
Shopping. That's casual.That's fun

255
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,610
Anything else we can do?
 Anything at all?

256
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,610
brunch

257
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,060
Brunch would be nice

258
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,330
Sounds good to me

259
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,890
All I can do is
 take itone day at a time.

260
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,000
yes

261
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,920
Oh,okay. Well...

262
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,030
thanks so muchfor calling.

263
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,860
Who was that?

264
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,160
Oh,someone namedalan hanley

265
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,120
My electrician?

266
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,210
Why were you on the phone
 sobbing to my electrician?

267
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,550
Oh,he called to
 offer youhis condolences

268
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,380
Then why didn't youput me on?

269
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,560
Oh,well,we got to talking
 and then he had to go

270
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,110
He--he had some very
 beautifulthings to say about rex

271
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,770
for god sakes,phyllis
 don't you ever worryabout dehydration?

272
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,850
Are you sayingthat I am too emotional?

273
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,990
I'm saying that even
 italianstake a break now and again

274
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,370
My son is dead.I'm grieving

275
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,320
So am I,but no onewould ever
 know it with your incessantcaterwauling

276
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,500
Bree!

277
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,520
People want to knowhow
 I'm doing,but the minute they ask you

278
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,670
you jumpinto the spotlight
 and they forget all about me

279
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,140
I need consoling,too,phyllis
 Have you ever thought of that?

280
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,740
I'm sorry

281
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,850
It won't happen again

282
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,150
Thank you

283
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,860
Of course,if you didn't
 constantlysuppress your emotions

284
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,500
people wouldn't forgetto console you

285
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,190
Excuse me?

286
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,700
Well,it's true
 You're stoicto the point of being cold

287
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,350
I am not cold. I just--well
 I don't likepublic displays of emotion

288
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:40,110
Well,that's fine,but people
 wonder why they haven'tseen you cry

289
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:46,650
I mean,some peopleactually
 wonder if you truly mourn rex

290
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,410
People have said that?

291
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,350
A few,yes.

292
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,050

293
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,660

00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:31,910
Oh,I see. Well,uh,your boyfriend
 asked my husband to give this to you

299
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,900
It's a sort of favor

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,710
It's all there. $7,000

301
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,630
Son of a bitch!

302
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,460
Oh,don't eventhink about it

303
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,790
hello...is there a problem?

304
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,740
- Let me ask you a question?
 - Okay

305
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,820
This might seemkind of weird

306
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,730
but what do you thinkof my breasts?

307
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,320
Excuse me?

308
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,790
I mean,how do theylook to you?

309
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,860

310
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,510
Thank you.I like too

311
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,840
You're right.That was weird

312
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,540
You have no idea
 what this money is for,do you?

313
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,150
No.No. You--you seem
 to have everything you need

314
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,420
Richie wants meto get a boob job

315
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,850
He wants 'em bigger

316
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,490
He's obsessedwith huge breasts

317
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,330
So are you gonna do it?

318
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,640
I told him if he came upwith the cash,I would

319
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,850
I just never thought the
 moronwould actually come up with it

320
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,770
Not that it's any ofmy business
 but it's your body

321
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,660
I wouldn't change anythingunless
 I really wanted to

322
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,590
But if I don't do it,he'll leave me

323
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,140
Honey,he's in jail.How far is he gonna go?

324
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,050
Maybe it's time you stood upfor yourself

325
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,420
Tell him you don't needthe surgery

326
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,000
It's worth a shot

327
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,520
There you go.I am so proud of you

328
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,980
when lynette went back to work,
 she was aware her new job would be demanding

329
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,270
What she hadn't anticipated...

330
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,930
was the night shift

331
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,270
Hey,honey,I thought
 I heardyou come in about an hour ago

332
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,090
I did. I had to loadthe dishwasher

333
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,590
You didn'thave to do that

334
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,200
Yeah,I sorta did

335
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,050
I'm sorry.I've justfallen
 behind on my housework

336
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,220
I just had so many errandsto run today

337
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,300
But I'll make up for
 ittomorrow,okay? I promise

338
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:08,050
That's the beautyof
 my system--it's flexible

339
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,210
You know,for the sakeof our marriage
 please don't mentionthe system again

340
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,370
I said I'm sorry

341
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,660
What in the world?

342
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,080
No,no,don't touch that
 Don't touch that

343
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,000
Um,penny had a little
 spitty-uppy on the sheets

344
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,160
And youdidn't change them?

345
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,550
The towelis very clean

346
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,150
Oh,that's disgusting

347
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,680
No,it's justa little spit
 a little milky spit upon the sheets

348
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,200
Please,I made a judgment call
 Please respect that

349
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,520
No,I can't respect that
 and do you know why?

350
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,160
It's stupid
 I'm gonna getnew sheets

351
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,690
We are not changingthe sheets

352
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,620
Why are youyelling at me?

353
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,200
I am not yelling at you
 and this is not about spit up

354
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,700
Of course it is
 No,it isn'T.It's about control

355
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,640
And as you and I both know
 youhave some issues in this area

356
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,120
Why are you fighting
 so hardto sleep on baby vomit?

357
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,390
I am fightingfor a principle.

358
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,360
Being too lazy to
 changethe sheets is not a principle

359
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,500
You know what?
 You're not gonna win this one

360
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,600
So you'd better
 justcrawl back into bed

361
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,450
and let's go to sleep

362
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,870
No,tom!

363
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,250
Tom,no!
 I'm gonnachange the sheets!

364
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,900
Oh,come on!No,you come on!

365
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,670
Just get up!Get up!

366
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,350
That's it!All right,fine!

367
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,840
Fine! Fine! Fine!

368
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,500
Normally lynette would
 have spent a sleepless night

369
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,980
telling herself she
 didn't have control issues

370
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,060
but she couldn'T

371
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,590
She was too busy figuring out
 how to bend tom to her will

372
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
hello?

373
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,890
Hi

374
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,650
Welcome to the promised land

375
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,940
Go on.There

376
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,130
Good job!

377
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,580
betty?Betty?

378
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,290
Oh,betty
 can I ask you a question?

379
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,520
Of course.It's susan,right?

380
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,800
Yes,hi.I was just wondering,

381
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,670
are you having some
 remodelingdone on your house or something?

382
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,360
No. Why?

383
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,720
Well,I work at home

384
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,180
so I'm home a lot working

385
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,770
And I just keep
  hearingthese noises lately

386
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,150
it's hard to concentrate

387
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,390
Well,I haven'tnoticed anything.

388
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:12,130
Really? It sounds likeit's coming from your house.

389
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,700
You know
 it's likea clanging--clanging

390
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,190
there! There
 that was it.Did you hear it?

391
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,850
Oh,yes
 Matthew's very handy

392
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,850
He's always doingprojects around the house

393
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,440
I guess I just don't noticethe noise anymore

394
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,100
Even at 2:00 in the morning?

395
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,770
Cause that's kind ofhard to miss

396
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,490
I'm so sorry

397
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,570
Matthew is somethingof an insomniac,susan

398
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,630
But I will talk to him
 and we'll put a stop to it

399
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,420
Afternoon,Mrs. Mayer

400
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,560
Hi,matthew

401
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,100
Well,it was nice chattingwith you,susan

402
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,450
This is my third
 phone call,mr. Flannery

403
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,580
And if someonedoesn't call me back soon
 I'm going to be irritated

404
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,470
Is everything all right?

405
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,950
That darn insurance
 companyis dragging its heels

406
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,440
on paying rex's policy
 and I don't understand why

407
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,300
Well,he died unexpectedly

408
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,250
And that brings
 upa lot of questions

409
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:22,320
It's probably easier
 when peopleare just diseased

410
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,100
Probably

411
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Hi

412
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,710
- Hi
 - Oh,hi,lynette

413
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,780
I'm sorry.Am I interrupting?

414
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,180
No,no,not at all

415
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,200
I saw you walk inand I've been
  meaning to callsince the service

416
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,420
but work's been so crazy
 so...how are you doing?

417
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,530
I'm all right

418
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,210
well,you look amazing

419
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,350
Do I?

420
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,600
Absolutely

421
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,090
well,I can't imaginewhat
 you're going through

422
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,340
phyllis?

423
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,900
You're going to have to stop that

424
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,060
I can't help it

425
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:14,150
When people talk about rex
 I-I...I just get emotional

426
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,370
Well,I'm very sorryfor
 your loss,too,phyllis

427
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,200
He was my firstborn

428
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,830
I don't know what
 I will do without him

429
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,130
Oh,I'm so sorry

430
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,140
is she gonna be okay?

431
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,950
yeah.Sure.Hold on a second

432
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,880
there we go.Feel better?

433
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,180
Lynette,you were saying?

434
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,840
I forgot

435
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,690
That's all right
 It wasreally sweet of you to stop by

436
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,110
Okay

437
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,970
So,are we ready to order
 or do you needa little more time?

438
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,800
I've been in the
 insuranceindustry for 15 years

439
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,750
I've never receiveda
 phone call like this

440
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,240
I'm having second
 thoughtsabout rex's death

441
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,460
I've known rex and
 breefor nearly 20 years

442
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,050
And I've never hadany reason to suspect

443
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:32,130
they were anythingbut
 a happy,loving couple

444
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,520
which is whythis seems so strange

445
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,910
I found it in rex's roomafter he coded

446
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,150
"I forgive you"?

447
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,570
George,what are youdoing here?

448
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,920
I'm here to kidnap you

449
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
What?

450
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:23,600
Get your purse
 I'm gonna take you bowling

451
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,460
I-I don't know how to bowl

452
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,640
Or to the moviesor for a frozen
 yogurt Whatever you want

453
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,890
thank you,but I just couldn'T

454
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,730
bree,I'm sure you haven'
 tgone anywhere in weeks

455
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,370
You gotta get out and
 do things.It'll help. Trust me

456
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,990
I do.I'm just...

457
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,840
I'm just not ready yet

458
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,460
But it was very sweet
 of youto think of me

459
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,880
Well,you know,I tried

460
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,210
And I appreciate that

461
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,250
It's all right

462
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,950
Let it out

463
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,820
You want me to
 die in here,don't you?

464
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,380
Carlos,what happened?

465
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,550
What do you mean
 "what happened?"

466
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,590
You talked rita out
 of taking the money

467
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,570
Is that what richie said?

468
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,450
Yeah,the subject came
 upin between kidney punches

469
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,600
Well,it's not my fault
 She didn't want the money

470
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,390
Why wouldn't she want $7,000?

471
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,180
Because it's
 for a boob job

472
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,900
- So?
 - So her boobs are fine

473
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,990
And,honestly,what he's doing
 to her self-esteemis just cruel

474
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,280
I feel sorry for her

475
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,860
Please,you don't care about
 herself-esteem any more than I do

476
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,030
You just didn't want to 
give upall that money

477
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,700
Well,I do think it's sillyto
 give someone $7,000 if they don't want it

478
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,310
Listen to me
 you're gonna go back there

479
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,700
you're gonna put
 that moneyin rita's hands

480
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,700
and you're gonna convince
 herthat life is not worth living

481
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,520
unless she has jugsthe size of texas
 Do I make myself clear?

482
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,880
I just realized rita
 and ihave a lot in common

483
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,200
Please don't tell me you have
 low self-esteem cause if I laugh now

484
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,260
I'm gonna crack the
 one good ribthat I have left

485
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,800
We are both controlledby our husbands

486
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,300
which is idiotic
 becausethey're both behind bars

487
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,400
We should have all the power

488
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,900
I am not tryingto control you

489
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,480
I just don't wanna
 end upin the morgue

490
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,710
This isn't about that

491
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,480
Gabrielle,the morphine's wearing off

492
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,310
I really don't have timefor these games

493
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,580
Me either,carlos

494
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,570
And if you expect me to go back and
 sweet talk herinto getting the operation

495
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,360
I can't show up empty-handed

496
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:43,970
Fine,bring me the checkbook
 I'll make out a checkfor some cash

497
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,150
See I was thinking
 I'd be writing the checks

498
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Gabrielle--

499
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,400
careful,carlos
 you're notin a position to argue

500
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,820
Whoo-hoo!Susan!

501
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,940
Hey,edie

502
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,610
- So,How much do you hate me?
 - What?

503
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,830
Oh,karl said that you know
 allabout our dirty little secret

504
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,880
- Yes,yes,I do
 - Well,I feel awful

505
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,000
I should have told youthat I was doing your ex

506
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,200
Well,it would've beenthe classy thing to do

507
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,590
Well,etiquette is a lost artfor a lot of people

508
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,950
You've gotta believe me,I never
 ever thoughtanything would happenwith us

509
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,450
But on our first date
 karl took meto a mexican restaurant

510
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,550
You know what I get
 likewhen I drink tequila

511
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,400
A couple of shootersand
 my bra unhooks itself

512
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,190
Circumstances beyondyour control
 I get it.So if you'll excuse me

513
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,870
Hey. Hey,hey

You can skate offinto

Well,that's good to know.

521
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,830
I probably shouldn'ttell you this,but...

522
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,500
while we were in my jacuzzilast night...

523
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,490
karl said it was
 the best sexhe's ever had

524
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,230
bar none

525
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,600
Actually,I'm gladthat you shared that
 because here'sa tidbit for you

526
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,680
Karl said he's stillin love with me

527
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,570
Edie,what are you doing?

528
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,450
You are a lying liar

529
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,570
We're in the middleof the street
 Would you get out of here?

530
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,690
Karl never said that

531
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,450
Okay,karl asked meto get back
 together the day afterjulie's birthday

532
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,080
I said no
 which I'm guessingis the reason

533
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,740
for the now legendary
 tequilabra-popping incident

534
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,500
Please let go

535
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,400
Oh,no.We're not finished here

536
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,170
Well,yes,we are.I'm gonna go

537
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,370
You don'thave the guts

538
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,660
In five seconds,I'm gonna punch it

539
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,870
Yeah?I'll key your car!

540
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,000
Not if you're
 suckingmy exhaust,you won'T

541
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,050
Take back what you said!

542
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,820
No,I won't!

543
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,250
Admit it,you'd do anything
 to destroy my happiness!

544
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,700
Edie,for god's sake

545
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,680
Why would I care if you
 end upwith a man I despise?

546
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,420
Cause you and mikeare finished

547
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,940
Yeah,word's out

548
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,600
And now that youcan't be happy
 you don't wantanyone else to be,period

549
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,300
Edie,come back here!
 We're not finished yet!

550
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,260
So you'd say the abuse starteda
 few years into your marriage?

551
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:02,750
It started so slowly
 I didn't realizewhat was happening

552
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,500
I mean,he'd slap
 meover some little problem

553
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,650
But he'd always apologize

554
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,610
Then it got worse

555
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:17,690
And one day,eight years ago
 my sonspilled soda on our new carpet

556
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,180
Before I could moveto protect him

557
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,400
virgil had knocked himon
 the ground and began kicking him

558
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:28,550
I wanted to protect my baby
 but I didn't get there in time

559
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,530
What happened to your son?

560
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,230
Well,he died

561
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,250
I came across one ofhis
 baby pictures last weekend

562
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,780
That's when the
 nightmaresstarted again

563
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:46,680
The last doctor I saw said
 thatI needed to let go of my guilt

564
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,330
and then I wouldstart sleeping again

565
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,950
Of course
 that's easier saidthan done

566
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,090
And I am getting so tired

567
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,660
I'm gonna start youon nitrazepam

568
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,630
That shoulddo the trick

569
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,790
Thank you

570
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:09,330
I certainly hope your
 husbandwas punished for what he did

571
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,850
Oh,there was retribution

572
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,510
I made sure of that

573
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:31,990
Where are youoff to?

574
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,480
I'm,I'm going
 to seerex's lawyer

575
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,180
We're going to go over
 somedetails involving rex's will

576
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,310
Phyllis...

577
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,050
obviously,I'm just
 mortifiedover slapping you

578
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,820
I've--I've just been ina weird
 place since rex's death,but...

579
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,650
that's no excuse

580
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,890
I'm very,very sorry

581
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,030
No need to apologize

582
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,540
You're family
 All's forgiven

583
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,440
Really?

584
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,790
It's been a difficult
 timefor all of us

585
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,070
I totally understand

586
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,820
Now,go

587
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,030
You don't want to be late
 foryour meeting about rex's will

588
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,150
Claims.This is joe flannery

589
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:52,300
Hello,could I speak to someone about the
 death benefits for rex van de kamp,please?

590
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,850
This is his mother

591
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,650
Yes,we've already spokento
 his wife several times

592
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,890
We are moving
 as quicklyas we can

593
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:04,880
Are you aware that
 mydaughter-in-law has a boyfriend?

594
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,200
I'm listening

595
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,330
Control--

596
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,190
it's extraordinary the
 tactics people employ to obtain it

597
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,410
Some rely on deception

598
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,500
While others engage
 in outright trickery

599
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:34,100
Then there are those
 who resort to extortion

600
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,020
Why do we fight
 so hard for control?

601
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,520
because we know to lose it

602
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,620
is to put our fate
 in the hands of others

603
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,840
And what could be more dangerous?
