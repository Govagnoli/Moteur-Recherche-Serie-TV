1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:01,201
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...

2
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:03,234
I'm granting you
temporary custody

3
00:00:03,267 --> 00:00:06,067
until we can get a straight
answer from the birth father.

4
00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:09,067
Gabrielle got exactly
what she wanted.

5
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:10,767
If Edie doesn't know,

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,234
then that means that you just
cheated on her with me.

7
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:15,101
Susan got fooled again...

8
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:18,034
I'm also a member
of S.A.

9
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:19,934
And Bree got too much...

10
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:21,568
Sex addicts anonymous.

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,239
- ... information.

12
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:28,660
Karl Mayer didn't pray often,
but when he did,

13
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:31,161
it was usually to ask
for God's help

14
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:33,167
in breaking up with a woman

15
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,167
and to spare him
the nasty drama

16
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,767
that usually accompanied

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,568
such callous
and unexpected departures.

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,468
Over the years, Karl had
dumped dozens of women,

19
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:49,267
and not one of them
had ever seen it coming.

20
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:52,867
Every retreat was always
meticulously planned,

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,334
right down to
the personalized stationary,

22
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:58,334
hence his record
of successful getaways

23
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:02,834
from women who did not
want to see him go.

24
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:06,600
So when he decided
to break up with Edie Britt,

25
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,800
Karl prayed to God yet again
to help him avoid

26
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:12,367
all the unnecessary drama.

27
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:14,000
Unfortunately for Karl...

28
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:19,867
God was in the mood...

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,000
to be entertained.

30
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:46,834
Come on!

31
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:50,067
- What the hell is this?
- Edie, baby, calm down.

32
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,067
"Let's be honest
with ourselves, Edie.

33
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:54,434
We haven't been happy
in a long time"?

34
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:57,167
Who are you to tell me
I haven't been happy,

35
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:01,434
you miserable son of a bitch?
I have been ecstatic!

36
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:04,067
Okay. I-I'm the one
who hasn't been happy, then.

37
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:06,900
- Then why did you propose to me?
- I don't know.

38
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:09,468
I have told every woman
in this town

39
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:13,101
that we are getting married,
and all you have to say to me

40
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,468
- is, "I don't know"?
- Oh, what else do you want me to say?

41
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:17,401
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:20,000
What's going on?
Is there someone else?

43
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:26,534
Oh, my God.

44
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:38,468
Oh, crap.

45
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,967
Come on, come on, come on!

46
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:10,034
As he sat there,
Karl couldn't help but wonder

47
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:12,834
why God had forsaken him.

48
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:17,167
It never occurred to him
that God...

49
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:19,167
might be a woman.

50
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,168
2x20:
It Wasn't Meant to Happen

51
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:26,534
God,
grant me the serenity

52
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:28,701
to accept the things
I cannot change,

53
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:31,034
the courage
to change the things I can

54
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,534
and the wisdom
to know the difference...

55
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:36,367
The members
of the Fairview chapter of A.A.

56
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:39,401
ended every meeting
with a prayer.

57
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:41,534
And while most
were asking God for help

58
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:44,367
in resisting temptation,

59
00:03:45,134 --> 00:03:49,634
Bree Van De Kamp was busy thinking
thoughts that were downright sinful.

60
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:51,634
...with him in the next.
Amen.

61
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:54,200
Keep coming back.
It works if you work it.

62
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,234
Amen.

63
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:59,200
I think
you'd love the opera.

64
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:02,933
The music and the voices...
It's just all so... passionate.

65
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:07,567
Yeah, a 300-pound soprano
seducing balding tenors.

66
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,967
- That'd be hot.
- You making fun of me? Huh?

67
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:14,367
- Bree...
- Yes?

68
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:15,833
Maybe a little bit.

69
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:21,900
What's going on here?

70
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,067
Claude?

71
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,067
We made plans, remember?

72
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,434
I'm sorry.
I was just about...

73
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,933
Yeah, I saw what you
were just about to do.

74
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:32,234
I'm sorry, Peter,
but, uh, who is this?

75
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:34,567
This is Claude.
He's my sponsor.

76
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,467
Oh, your A.A. sponsor?

77
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:40,401
No.
I'm his other sponsor.

78
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:42,134
For my sex addiction.

79
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,567
Oh.

80
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,734
Damn it, Peter.
What did I tell you?

81
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:47,833
Avoid lust triggers.

82
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,601
And what is she?

83
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:51,933
Come on,
don't do this, man.

84
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:54,567
She's a lust trigger.
A lust trigger!

85
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:56,900
Um, excuse me.
I don't know what that means,

86
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:59,067
but could you please
stop saying it?

87
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,634
Where's your chip?
Give it to me.

88
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,234
Do you remember how low
you'd sunk when we met?

89
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:08,234
This represents
12 months of hard work,

90
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,401
not giving in
to your urges.

91
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,734
Now if you wanna
blow all that on this woman,

92
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:18,401
just tell me now so I can stop
wasting my time working with you.

93
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:29,100
I don't want to blow it.

94
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:33,701
Good.

95
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,867
Then tell
the pretty lady good-bye

96
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,334
and that you can't
socialize with her anymore.

97
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:43,434
And do it quick.
I'm hungry.

98
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:48,200
Bad news.

99
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:50,200
Ed wants us
to push through tonight

100
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:52,800
and finish
the Edelstein realty pitch.

101
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,833
But  we're not presenting
for another two weeks.

102
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:56,833
Why don't we start tomorrow?

103
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:59,601
- But how would that help Ed avoid
his marital problems?
- What?

104
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:02,534
Oh, he's right. I hear Ed
fighting with Fran on the phone

105
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:05,534
- every day through the office walls.
- That would explain all our working hours.

106
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,034
Yeah, but you lucked out, Scavo.
Darlene talked him into cutting

107
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,067
the people who have kids
in day care loose.

108
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,467
Hey, great. Let's go
before he changes his mind.

109
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:14,800
But  that doesn't include you,
Miss senior V.P.

110
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,134
- Ed wants you in the conference room now.
- You're kidding!

111
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:20,367
You're his security blanket, Lynette.
He stays, you stay.

112
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:23,034
Jerry, can you help me
get the kids down to the car?

113
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,167
- Oh.
- Yeah.

114
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,534
- Thanks, Jer.
- Sure.

115
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,067
- Lynette?
- Yeah?

116
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,067
Get those mock-ups together,
will you?

117
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,434
Jerry, I didn't know
you had a kid.

118
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:38,567
Y-yeah, um, out of wedlock.

119
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:40,434
Oh.

120
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,467
So... see you in the morning.

121
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:49,768
I'm sorry I'm late.

122
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,000
- What's going on?
- Karl broke up with Edie.

123
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:56,234
Oh, my God.

124
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,534
Yeah, apparently,
he was seeing someone.

125
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,701
Really?

126
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:02,034
Did he say who it was?

127
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:04,467
I know who she is.

128
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:07,401
She's a man-eating,
scum-sucking ho-bag.

129
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:09,601
No, he did not say.

130
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:12,234
You know,
when Karl dumped you,

131
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,734
I thought
that it was all your fault.

132
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,734
Yeah, I figured that...
you were a nag or bad in bed.

133
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:21,634
But now I... now I see that
you were just a victim, too.

134
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:24,301
We have a bond, Susan.

135
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:26,967
It's like we're sisters.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,867
There's even
a pretty one and an ugly one.

137
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,167
Edie!

138
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,567
No, I'm just saying
that Karl screwed us both.

139
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:36,833
Yes, like you
wouldn't believe.

140
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:41,334
Guys, I'm all for bashing exes, but let's save
a little of our hate for his partner in crime...

141
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,167
- the other woman.
- Mm-hmm.

142
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,833
Yeah! You know, they're always
coming up with these excuses

143
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:47,167
to justify
being a home-wrecker.

144
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,009
Exactly! Like,
"he wouldn't have been with me

145
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:50,900
if he was gettin' it
at home."

146
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:52,901
Yeah, "honey,
you're the love of my life.

147
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,567
she's just the runner-up."

148
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:56,867
Oh, look, the baby's
doing something really cute.

149
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:01,967
She's sleeping.

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,567
Like an angel.

151
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:06,734
Look, I think we all know
that Karl is a dog.

152
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:08,967
I mean, but let's face it...
if these tramps

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,200
weren't laying out the buffet,
he wouldn't be chowing down.

154
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:13,167
Well, every situation
is different,

155
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,967
and it's hard to judge
until we know all the details.

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Which... obviously I don't know,
because how would I know?

157
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,933
She's a slutty, slutty whore.
Absolutely.

158
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:27,100
Yeah.

159
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:33,601
Are you sure she needs that?
I just put sunscreen on her.

160
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:36,267
Yes,  she needs the bonnet.
It completes the outfit.

161
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:38,167
Oh, for God's sakes, Gaby.

162
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,501
She's never too young
to start accessorizing.

163
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:42,768
Besides, all the neighbors
are out today,

164
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,967
and I want them to see how happy
we are and wish they were us.

165
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:53,967
Hey.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,867
Uh, the baby's a beauty.

167
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,668
We think so,
but we're a little biased.

168
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:02,034
Oh, wow,
she's got my eyes.

169
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:03,900
Huh?

170
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:06,401
Oh, I'm Dale.

171
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:09,367
Dale Helm.
I'm the baby's birth father.

172
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:14,501
Uh, well, hi, Dale.

173
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:16,434
Nice to meet you.

174
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:18,434
A lot of people
have been looking for you.

175
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:21,067
Yeah, I know,
lawyers and stuff.

176
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,734
I got kinda held up in Florida
longer than I thought.

177
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:25,334
Spring break, right?

178
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,668
Yeah. Oh, man,
we were wasted 24/7.

179
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,933
Then I got the message
and just thought

180
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:34,367
my friends were messing with me.
Those buttwads!

181
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,601
Ahem.

182
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:38,734
Well, it's a good thing
he's here.

183
00:09:38,768 --> 00:09:40,867
We can take him
to the lawyer's office,

184
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,867
and you can sign over
full custody to us.

185
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,567
Okay.

186
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:47,933
Yeah, uh,
the thing about that is,

187
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,301
I'm gonna want the baby.

188
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:59,720
Come on, you guys.
We don't have to make this ugly.

189
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:02,720
You're trying to take our baby!
How is it not gonna be ugly?

190
00:10:02,753 --> 00:10:04,720
Just keep walking, Gaby.
Don't engage him.

191
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:09,054
- Listen, Mr. Solis...
- No, you listen! We were granted custody.

192
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:11,321
If you want her,
you talk to the judge.

193
00:10:11,354 --> 00:10:15,653
- Hey, what is the holdup?
- They told me I gotta talk to a judge.

194
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:18,753
- What the hell are you doing here, Frank?
- It's his baby. Give it to him!

195
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:21,154
- Like hell!
- Hey, Mrs. Solis, can I see the baby?

196
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,087
- No!
- Dale, just do it already!

197
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:26,454
- I'm not just gonna kidnap it.
- Why not? They did!

198
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:29,987
It is your baby.
Just take it!

199
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,588
Try it.

200
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,154
Frank?

201
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,954
Get in, you moron.

202
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:40,521
Anyways, it looks like

203
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:42,254
- you're doing a good job with her.
- Dumb-ass!

204
00:10:42,287 --> 00:10:44,054
She seems clean.

205
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:57,421
And like I said,
we have been very happy here,

206
00:10:57,454 --> 00:10:59,454
and I'm sure you will be, too.

207
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:01,753
- Well, we just love it.
- Yeah.

208
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:05,653
Once the stairs are repaired,
I'll show you the basement.

209
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:07,854
What's going on?

210
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:09,354
The house just sold.

211
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:11,954
Start packing.

212
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:14,954
Why don't you just
put Caleb in an institution?

213
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:18,854
- It's where he belongs anyway.
- My mom would never let strangers take care of him.

214
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,087
Then why don't you call the police?
Then it's not up to her.

215
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:25,687
If I call the police,
my mom and I go to jail with Caleb.

216
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,920
We've been hiding a murderer.
Now, look, if we...

217
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,287
If we do move, I promise
I will call you every day.

218
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:33,354
I don't need a phone buddy.
I need a boyfriend!

219
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:36,620
- Would you calm down, please?
- Don't tell me what to do!

220
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:38,854
- You know, I could go to the police myself!
- Danielle...

221
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:40,887
I just...
I love you so much.

222
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,221
I would do anything
to keep you here.

223
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:46,521
Yeah, I see that now.

224
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:50,421
You can't leave me alone here.
You have to think of something.

225
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:56,720
Don't worry.

226
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:58,254
I will.

227
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:55,187
Oh, my God!

228
00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:07,588
Ed? Hey, I'm so sorry,

229
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,321
but obviously that was just
meant for Tom's eyes only.

230
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:13,421
Honest mistake.
Don't even worry about it.

231
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:15,254
Okay.

232
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:17,787
Thanks. Well, I'm gonna
go back in my office

233
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,054
and continue to feel like
a huge pervert.

234
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:23,887
At least you and Tom
have a love life.

235
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,387
Well, we do the best we can
given the circumstances.

236
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:30,387
Better than Fran and I.
We're dead in that department.

237
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:33,321
I don't wanna
bore you with the details.

238
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,854
I appreciate that.

239
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,887
You know, Ed...

240
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,454
I  don't wanna pry
into your personal business,

241
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,653
but if you are having
problems in that area,

242
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:48,154
you don't have
to be resigned to it.

243
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:50,987
What are you suggesting,
hookers?

244
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,020
No, Ed Ferrara
doesn't pay for sex.

245
00:13:53,054 --> 00:13:57,854
I mean, you and Fran
could spice it up a bit.

246
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,620
You know, get the old juices
flowing again.

247
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:03,121
Oh, I see.

248
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:05,121
Kinda like, uh...

249
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:07,653
"I'd like to lick you
from head to foot."

250
00:14:07,687 --> 00:14:09,720
Okay, well,
that wasn't my best work,

251
00:14:09,753 --> 00:14:11,687
but you can't deny results.

252
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,920
IMing works,
and when I go home tonight,

253
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:18,653
Tom and I are going to...

254
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:20,653
Okay, well,
I'm gonna be exhausted,

255
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:23,720
so I'll probably just lay there.
But trust me,

256
00:14:23,753 --> 00:14:26,454
Tom is gonna go to town.

257
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:28,454
It's something to think about,
Lord knows.

258
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:30,454
You know what
the sad truth is?

259
00:14:30,488 --> 00:14:33,321
I have been thinking
about hookers.

260
00:14:33,354 --> 00:14:35,221
Okay!

261
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:37,387
Uh, well,
I hope that helped.

262
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:40,121
And I'm just gonna
go back and finish

263
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:43,588
so we can all get
out of here.

264
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,587
Let me guess.
You're not here for a bear claw.

265
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:53,687
No, I'm not.

266
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:55,921
You're wasting your time.

267
00:14:55,954 --> 00:14:58,021
Look, you don't have
to worry about Peter,

268
00:14:58,054 --> 00:15:00,021
not while he's with me.

269
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:01,487
Yeah? Why is that?

270
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,487
Because when it comes to sex,
I have an unwavering moral compass.

271
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,354
Truly. A man could
beg and plead all day long,

272
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:12,320
and it wouldn't make
any difference.

273
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,454
So, since I have
such strong self-control,

274
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:16,821
there's really no reason
for us to end our friendship.

275
00:15:16,854 --> 00:15:18,821
The guy's a ticking bomb.

276
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:20,320
You have no idea

277
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:23,021
the kind of depravity
that comes with this disease.

278
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,287
Waking up in a stranger's bed
every morning...

279
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,787
cruising the park at night,

280
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:28,687
looking for somebody
to get off with,

281
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:31,487
compulsive masturbation
every chance you get!

282
00:15:36,754 --> 00:15:40,621
Look, for guys like
Peter and me,

283
00:15:40,654 --> 00:15:42,787
there's no beauty
in the sex.

284
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:45,387
It's an empty and ugly compulsion.

285
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,021
Well, I am sorry,

286
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:50,687
- but the Peter I know has a little more s...
- Hold up.

287
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,721
Claude, I need some...
I need some help.

288
00:15:57,754 --> 00:16:00,487
What are you doing here?
Are you using?

289
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,921
No,  but I bought a bag.

290
00:16:02,954 --> 00:16:05,687
You're an embarrassment to me.
Give.

291
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:11,554
There's a meeting over
on 10th street. You go there.

292
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:13,187
You call me after.

293
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,187
I'm sorry.

294
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,220
Get the hell out of my shop.

295
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
I'm also a sponsor
at cocaine anonymous.

296
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:24,921
Well, aren't you
the renaissance man.

297
00:16:24,954 --> 00:16:26,754
Are we done here,
princess?

298
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:30,554
Not yet. You obviously have an
encyclopedic grasp of everything depraved.

299
00:16:30,587 --> 00:16:33,021
But clearly, you don't have
the slightest idea

300
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:35,153
about the power
of a loving relationship.

301
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:39,487
This is all you are to Peter.

302
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,621
Something to satisfy
his addiction.

303
00:16:41,654 --> 00:16:44,120
Well, I think Peter is
a better man than you do,

304
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,821
- and I am not gonna let you keep us apart.
- Try and stop me.

305
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:49,354
Peter does everything
I tell him to do.

306
00:16:49,387 --> 00:16:53,821
That's the one thing
you can depend on with addicts:

307
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:56,320
They're weak.

308
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,487
Excuse me.

309
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:08,887
Excuse me.

310
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:10,520
May I ask you something?

311
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:12,921
Yes,  ma'am?

312
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:16,320
If a citizen,
an ordinary citizen like myself,

313
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:20,621
knew of someone holding
a significant amount of drugs,

314
00:17:20,654 --> 00:17:24,621
what would my responsibilities be,
you know, under the law?

315
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:35,220
What's all this?

316
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,220
And this one,
I ran out and got

317
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:39,420
the day I found out Karl
was doing it with his secretary.

318
00:17:39,454 --> 00:17:41,220
I think you'll find this
particularly helpful.

319
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:43,220
It's got a chapter called,

320
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:45,587
- "Revenge: you're only hurting yourself."
- Yeah, you know,

321
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:48,253
I'm just really not
into the whole reading thing.

322
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,153
Oh. Well, um, why don't
we get you out of here?

323
00:17:51,187 --> 00:17:53,153
Let's go see
a feel-good movie.

324
00:17:53,187 --> 00:17:55,921
Why are you
being so nice to me?

325
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:58,887
Well, I just wanna help.
So how about that movie?

326
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:01,320
You know how I like to heal?

327
00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:03,787
I get hammered.

328
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:06,120
Uh... well, um...

329
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:09,821
then I should just go and let
you get started with that.

330
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:12,153
Do you really wanna
help me? Good.

331
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:14,153
'Cause I'm gonna need
a designated driver.

332
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:15,887
Oh! Uh...

333
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:17,887
Okay.

334
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:21,754
How could he be arrested
for cocaine possession?

335
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:23,754
Claude swore he was clean.

336
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:25,754
It's just awful, isn't it?

337
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:30,021
I mean, you never know what
people are doing behind your back.

338
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:32,920
Would you like some milk
with your cookies?

339
00:18:32,954 --> 00:18:34,287
Thanks.

340
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,954
It's just, you know...

341
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:37,954
 He was he best sponsor
I've ever had,

342
00:18:37,987 --> 00:18:40,321
and I don't know
what I'm gonna do now.

343
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:42,887
Well, I have been doing
some thinking and...

344
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,321
here's a thought:
Why don't I be your sponsor?

345
00:18:46,354 --> 00:18:48,620
You gotta be kidding.

346
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,720
You don't know squat
about sex addiction.

347
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,387
Well, cravings are cravings,

348
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,754
and all you really need
is a friend to call

349
00:18:54,787 --> 00:18:57,021
when you start having
inappropriate thoughts,

350
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,021
and I can be that friend.

351
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,687
Well, there's more
to it than that.

352
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,587
Claude rescued me from some
pretty nasty scenes over the years.

353
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,387
Well, if you were in trouble,
I could handle it.

354
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,353
How can you be so sure?

355
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:13,654
Because I can be very strong

356
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:16,520
for those people
that I really care about.

357
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,487
How can you have
any feelings for me at all?

358
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,487
I mean, you've only known me
for a few weeks.

359
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Yes, and in that time,

360
00:19:27,554 --> 00:19:31,687
I've come to learn that
you're good and kind and smart.

361
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,254
And, yes, you have a little problem
that you need some help with,

362
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:38,987
but I'm willing
to be there for you.

363
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:41,021
So what's the big deal?

364
00:19:43,054 --> 00:19:45,021
If you saw me at my worst,

365
00:19:45,054 --> 00:19:47,288
you might not like me so much.

366
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,754
Peter,
let me be your rock.

367
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:54,687
Taking care of people
is what I do best.

368
00:19:56,787 --> 00:19:58,453
Drink your milk.

369
00:20:09,854 --> 00:20:11,387
Ah-ah-ah. Mmh-mnh.

370
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,387
I asked for extra spicy.

371
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,620
I'm pretty sure
you said medium.

372
00:20:15,654 --> 00:20:18,087
Are you? Well, maybe
if you'd written it down,

373
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:19,654
you would've spared yourself

374
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,921
the walk of shame
back to the kitchen.

375
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:26,654
Edie, why are you
torturing that girl?

376
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:30,054
That is her. That is the one
that Karl is in love with.

377
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:31,921
We have been here
a million times,

378
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:34,087
and you should see the way
that she flirts with him,

379
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:36,420
and when she comes back here,
I am gonna shove this pitcher

380
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:37,787
in her perky little mug,
and when she's...

381
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,121
Okay, let's not make a scene.
It's not worth it.

382
00:20:40,154 --> 00:20:41,754
For the sake of argument,

383
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:43,854
let's... let's... let's say
that it's someone else.

384
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:48,587
You know, probably it would be
a vulnerable, lonely woman

385
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,587
who Karl
just took advantage of,

386
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,320
and what if...

387
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:56,387
this poor, confused soul
begged your forgiveness?

388
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,087
What would you say?

389
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:02,987
I'd say...

390
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:05,453
"too little,
too late, bitch,"

391
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:07,987
and then I'd kick her.

392
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,221
Oh.

393
00:21:09,254 --> 00:21:11,587
Yeah, but you don't have
to worry about that,

394
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,453
- because I'm positive it's her.
I mean, who else could it be?
- Yeah.

395
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:17,487
Karl's office is all guys,
and then the only women he sees

396
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,254
are me, Julie,

397
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:22,188
that... that lesbian that does
his taxes and you.

398
00:21:24,188 --> 00:21:26,188
You know what?

399
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,787
It is her.

400
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,854
Really? Why?

401
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:34,121
She just...
spit in your wings.

402
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:37,487
You got my back?

403
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Uh... sure?

404
00:21:41,353 --> 00:21:42,921
Here you go, extra spicy.

405
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:51,554
You did that on purpose.

406
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:58,353
You are going to pay!

407
00:21:58,387 --> 00:21:59,954
- Oh!
- Whoa!

408
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,453
Fight, fight!

409
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,387
Get off me, you!
Get off me!

410
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,987
Mayer! Four on one!

411
00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:09,288
A little help!

412
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:20,587
So, uh, when we leave...

413
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,587
who you gonna miss
the most?

414
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,654
I don't know.

415
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:27,320
Yeah, you do.

416
00:22:27,353 --> 00:22:29,320
You said good-bye
to her yet?

417
00:22:29,353 --> 00:22:31,520
No.

418
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:34,487
Look, man, it's...
it's okay if you like her.

419
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,687
You know, I think Danielle
really likes you, too.

420
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Really?

421
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:42,921
Yeah, she told me she'd be really sad
if you left and didn't say good-bye.

422
00:22:42,954 --> 00:22:48,188
You know, I think that she might
even want you to give her a little kiss.

423
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:51,921
But Danielle doesn't even
like me in her room.

424
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,587
She gets mad.

425
00:22:55,954 --> 00:22:57,453
Yeah.

426
00:22:57,487 --> 00:23:00,854
I talked to her about that.
She feels really bad.

427
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:03,055
But you know what?
She told me,

428
00:23:03,154 --> 00:23:06,487
if you come in her room again,
she won't get mad.

429
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:16,121
And, Caleb,

430
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:20,387
she's gonna act like she
doesn't want you to kiss her...

431
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,021
but she does.

432
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,821
Dale Helm,

433
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:34,487
like all the students
at Parsons Christian Academy,

434
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,320
was taught that his future
was safely in God's hands.

435
00:23:38,354 --> 00:23:40,754
What he didn't know

436
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:47,088
was that Gabrielle Solis
was about to force a fumble.

437
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:02,253
All right, guys,

438
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:05,187
you all know next week
we're playing the Falcons!

439
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,054
And we're gonna fry up
those birdies for dinner,

440
00:24:09,088 --> 00:24:11,988
'cause we're the Huskies!

441
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:13,520
And who are the Huskies?

442
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:17,220
God's team! God's team!
God's team!

443
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:18,754
God's team! God's team!

444
00:24:18,787 --> 00:24:21,654
God's team! God's team!
God's team!

445
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:24,220
God's team! God's team!

446
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:26,520
What are you doing?
You can't be here.

447
00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:27,588
Let's talk turkey.

448
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,887
What is it gonna take
for you to give up the baby?

449
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:30,288
It's not gonna happen, okay?

450
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,288
I gotta get back. I'm the
quarterback. It doesn't look right.

451
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Okay, no, no!
Wait, what about a car?

452
00:24:35,353 --> 00:24:39,187
Or college? Tuition's a killer
these days. I could help you out.

453
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,487
I don't need help.

454
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,587
You hear those cheers?
Those are for me.

455
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,654
Last game,
I threw 246 yards.

456
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:49,321
With stats like that, I can get
into the college of my choice.

457
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,787
So why do you
want to be a dad?

458
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,720
These are your glory days.
A baby would ruin your life.

459
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:57,887
Oh, I know. But Frank said once I get
the baby, he's gonna take it off my hands.

460
00:24:57,921 --> 00:24:59,754
But it's not even his.

461
00:24:59,787 --> 00:25:01,754
Libby dumped him.
He thinks that if he has the baby

462
00:25:01,787 --> 00:25:04,187
and she sees him
acting all mature,

463
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:06,321
- she'll take him back.
- No, no, no.

464
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:09,021
I am not letting that idiot use
my baby as a bargaining chip.

465
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:11,553
Hey, it's out of my hands!

466
00:25:11,587 --> 00:25:15,087
No, it doesn't have to be, okay?
Just do the right thing

467
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:18,121
- and sign the release form.
- Look, I'm really sorry.

468
00:25:30,054 --> 00:25:31,620
Before we adjourn today,

469
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:34,921
let's take a moment
to bow our heads.

470
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,887
Hello, everyone.

471
00:25:56,921 --> 00:26:01,388
I'm Gaby Solis,
class of '94. Whoo-hoo!

472
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:08,254
I just wanted to give God
a big shout out

473
00:26:08,288 --> 00:26:10,154
for this amazing season.

474
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:14,254
The man upstairs has definitely
been on your side,

475
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:17,921
and you wanna know why?
Because you boys live clean.

476
00:26:17,954 --> 00:26:20,654
You keep your noses up,
you stay out of trouble,

477
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:23,820
and you don't go around
getting strippers pregnant.

478
00:26:23,854 --> 00:26:26,154
And that's a good thing,

479
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:28,254
'cause if one of you
caused a scandal like that,

480
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:30,654
not only would that guy
get kicked off the team

481
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:32,620
and lose
all of his scholarships,

482
00:26:32,654 --> 00:26:35,687
but God would drop
your school colors so fast,

483
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,687
it'd make your head spin!

484
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,720
And then the football season
would go to hell.

485
00:26:40,754 --> 00:26:43,054
No pun intended.

486
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:44,553
So my point is,

487
00:26:44,587 --> 00:26:47,654
do the right thing,
and no one gets hurt.

488
00:26:53,587 --> 00:26:55,354
Signed, sealed, delivered.

489
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:58,720
Lily's ours.

490
00:26:58,754 --> 00:27:01,354
So what do you think?
Are you staying late again,

491
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:04,354
or can I finally have dinner
at home with my wife?

492
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:07,121
God, I don't know.
I'm gonna go check with Ed.

493
00:27:07,154 --> 00:27:08,654
Okay.

494
00:27:08,687 --> 00:27:11,954
Hey, any luck
with that IMing thing?

495
00:27:11,987 --> 00:27:13,487
No, not really.

496
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,654
I was online chatting
with Fran a while ago,

497
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:17,654
and I asked her
what she was wearing,

498
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:19,654
and she said,
"a yellow blouse."

499
00:27:19,687 --> 00:27:21,654
Okay, that's good.
Then what?

500
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:25,054
Then... yeah, that's it.
I just kinda blocked.

501
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:27,354
- You blocked?
- Yeah, I didn't know what else to say.

502
00:27:27,388 --> 00:27:29,520
You're an award-winning
copywriter, Ed.

503
00:27:29,553 --> 00:27:31,087
You get paid to write.

504
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:32,987
Yeah, jingles for oatmeal,
not soft-core porn.

505
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:34,987
For God's sakes,
it's not brain surgery.

506
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:37,221
- Is she still online?
- Yeah, I think so.

507
00:27:40,854 --> 00:27:47,054
"I love the way that blouse
clings to your body."

508
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,187
"Are you joking?"

509
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:52,687
mnh-mnh-mnh.

510
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,388
"Nothing funny about
those beautiful breasts."

511
00:27:58,754 --> 00:28:02,754
"Yeah? What did you want
to do to me?"

512
00:28:02,787 --> 00:28:04,288
Uh...

513
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,453
Ed, your conference call's ready.

514
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:13,453
Oh God, I almost forgot
about that.

515
00:28:13,487 --> 00:28:15,453
Okay, I gotta go take this,

516
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,720
but you keep going,
'cause you're doing great.

517
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:19,654
No, Ed, I'm not
doing this for you!

518
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:20,754
- Just...
- What?

519
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,921
"Touch every inch of your body

520
00:28:38,954 --> 00:28:42,587
until you're trembling."

521
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:50,954
"Oh, yeah.
I'll bite you good."

522
00:28:55,154 --> 00:28:56,420
"Hell, yeah.

523
00:28:56,453 --> 00:29:02,654
First, I want you
to touch yourself."

524
00:29:05,288 --> 00:29:07,754
"Oh, yeah!"

525
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:16,587
"I'm on my way."

526
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:27,520
Hello?

527
00:29:27,553 --> 00:29:29,954
Bree, it's Peter...

528
00:29:29,987 --> 00:29:31,987
and I'm in trouble.

529
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:45,954
Hi, I'm... I'm looking for,
um, Peter McMillan.

530
00:29:45,987 --> 00:29:47,954
I'm not sure I know him.

531
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:50,321
You should ask my wife.
She organized the party.

532
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:52,487
Hey, Judy, get over here
and act like a hostess!

533
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,021
Come on in!
Come on, come on, come on.

534
00:30:02,354 --> 00:30:05,553
Hey there.

535
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:07,587
Things are just
getting started.

536
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,820
After you take off your clothes,
feel free to jump right in.

537
00:30:10,854 --> 00:30:12,321
No, no, I'm... I'm good.

538
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:14,820
I'm just, um, here
to pick up my friend Peter.

539
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,487
He's locked himself in your bathroom,
and I'm here to take him home.

540
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,654
Oh, yeah, that guy.
We were wondering about him.

541
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:22,353
The bathroom's over there.

542
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,121
Hey, is that
your natural color?

543
00:30:25,404 --> 00:30:27,737
Yes, it is.

544
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,637
Beautiful.
I wish mine would do that.

545
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,637
This is out of a bottle.

546
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:35,137
Yes, I'm aware of that.

547
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,737
Peter?

548
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,537
Peter, it's Bree.
Are you in there?

549
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:48,237
What are you doing here?

550
00:30:48,271 --> 00:30:50,570
I'm a sex addict.
What do you think?

551
00:30:50,603 --> 00:30:53,438
You can't possibly be turned on
by what's going on out there.

552
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:57,770
- Disgusting, isn't it?
- Yes. Why would you wanna
come to a place like this?

553
00:30:57,804 --> 00:31:00,637
I didn't.
I wanted you to come.

554
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,837
I can't make you
not have feelings for me,

555
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:06,670
but I can show you who I was,
what my life was like.

556
00:31:06,704 --> 00:31:08,704
Well, that's not
your life anymore.

557
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:10,338
But it could be.

558
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:12,470
If I slip again, this is exactly
where you could find me,

559
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,804
or someplace worse.

560
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:15,937
Then what would you
think of me?

561
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:17,438
- Peter...
- Bree...

562
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,404
it's dangerous to care about me.

563
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:21,404
A lot of people have
over the years,

564
00:31:21,438 --> 00:31:23,438
and they all end up
getting hurt.

565
00:31:24,837 --> 00:31:26,804
Rex said
he'd always be faithful.

566
00:31:26,837 --> 00:31:28,804
George said
he'd never hurt me,

567
00:31:28,837 --> 00:31:32,670
and as it turned out,
they were both liars.

568
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:35,171
So as long
as you're honest with me,

569
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:38,637
you'd be amazed
at what I can put up with.

570
00:31:39,904 --> 00:31:41,503
Now let's go home.

571
00:31:50,974 --> 00:31:53,107
Hey there.
Did you have a late night?

572
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:54,607
I hope.

573
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,307
It was horrible.

574
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:59,607
The whole thing
blew up in my face.

575
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,474
Why would you tell my wife
to bite my nipple off?

576
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:05,508
I didn't!

577
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,007
I didn't.
Why would she... oh!

578
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:09,940
The honeymoon thing.

579
00:32:09,974 --> 00:32:12,374
Yeah, and it hurt
like hell then, too.

580
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:16,907
And it didn't take her long to figure out
that I let a stranger seduce her online.

581
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,274
Oh, God!

582
00:32:18,307 --> 00:32:20,774
She was so mad, she locked
herself in the bathroom

583
00:32:20,807 --> 00:32:22,274
and called a divorce lawyer.

584
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,374
You're getting divorced?

585
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:27,374
I spent two hours pleading with
her through the bathroom door,

586
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:29,807
begging her
not to leave me, and...

587
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,408
we finally managed
to come to terms.

588
00:32:32,441 --> 00:32:36,174
- What kind of terms?
- I promised her I would fire the person who did it.

589
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:38,341
You're gonna fire me?

590
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:41,174
No, of course not.
You're too important here.

591
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:43,640
I'm gonna fire Tom.

592
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:45,874
I told her it was him
that sent the IMs.

593
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:49,074
- What?!
- I told her that he had
a problem with boundaries.

594
00:32:49,107 --> 00:32:51,807
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna do this,

595
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,807
but my marriage
was on the line.

596
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,307
You can't make my husband
your scapegoat.

597
00:32:57,341 --> 00:32:58,840
I won't let you.

598
00:32:58,874 --> 00:33:00,740
I don't have a damn choice.

599
00:33:00,774 --> 00:33:02,807
I can't be divorced, Lynette.

600
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,207
I can't.

601
00:33:06,974 --> 00:33:08,441
He's under contract.

602
00:33:08,474 --> 00:33:10,441
If you just fire him,

603
00:33:10,474 --> 00:33:13,107
he'll sue you, and I'll back him up.
You need cause.

604
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:15,640
Well...

605
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:17,840
I guess
I'll have to find cause.

606
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:23,174
It shouldn't be too difficult
if I look hard enough.

607
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:40,807
Hey, how's the eye?

608
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,807
Oh, it's still a little red,

609
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,974
but think I got
all the hot sauce out.

610
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:46,207
That's good.

611
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:48,807
So, um...
you know the other day

612
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,307
when I said that thing
about us being sisters?

613
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:53,940
Well, when I said it
I really didn't mean it.

614
00:33:53,974 --> 00:33:55,907
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

615
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,607
No, I mean, I really
didn't mean it. But, um...

616
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,207
now I do.

617
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:04,074
Thank you.
Thank you for having my back.

618
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,441
So do I have to worry about you
attacking any more waitresses?

619
00:34:13,474 --> 00:34:16,307
Nah,
my bar brawlin' days are over.

620
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:24,740
Oh, you know, I-I've gotta go.
I have a meeting.

621
00:34:24,774 --> 00:34:26,774
I'll talk to you later.

622
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,340
Are you Oliver?

623
00:34:33,374 --> 00:34:35,340
You must be Edie.
Pleasure to meet you.

624
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:36,941
Oh, likewise.

625
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,707
I hear you're one of the best
private detectives in town.

626
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:41,207
I do what I can.

627
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,240
Well, come on in.
Let's talk.

628
00:34:43,274 --> 00:34:47,008
Um... basically, I just
want you to trail my ex.

629
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,040
He, uh... left me
for another woman,

630
00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:53,574
and I wanna nail that ho
to the wall.

631
00:35:04,507 --> 00:35:05,507
Caleb?

632
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:08,008
Hey, come on, buddy,
wake up.

633
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,107
Caleb?

634
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,641
It's time.

635
00:35:37,774 --> 00:35:39,774
Get away from me!

636
00:35:51,741 --> 00:35:53,607
Get away from her!

637
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:58,274
Danielle, I want you to pick up
the phone and call the police.

638
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,607
- No!
- What?

639
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:06,073
Matthew and his mother
have been protecting Caleb.

640
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:08,073
They're in as much trouble
as he is!

641
00:36:08,107 --> 00:36:09,707
I don't care.

642
00:36:09,741 --> 00:36:11,707
Mom, please! I love him.

643
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:13,974
Please.

644
00:36:19,274 --> 00:36:21,240
If I hadn't been
in the house,

645
00:36:21,274 --> 00:36:24,307
he could've raped her...
or worse.

646
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,307
He's locked
in his room now, so...

647
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,774
Needless to say,
the agreement between us is off.

648
00:36:29,807 --> 00:36:32,140
Caleb is dangerous,
and I want him put away.

649
00:36:32,173 --> 00:36:35,040
If he is not gone by tomorrow,
I am calling the police.

650
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:37,040
He will be. I promise you.

651
00:36:37,073 --> 00:36:38,974
Can I go check on Danielle?

652
00:36:39,008 --> 00:36:40,707
Yes.

653
00:36:45,407 --> 00:36:48,641
Betty, I am serious.

654
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:51,240
Either you do something,
or I will.

655
00:36:54,674 --> 00:36:57,507
Bree, stop worrying.

656
00:36:57,541 --> 00:37:00,607
I understand
what needs to happen now.

657
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,641
Danielle?

658
00:37:16,407 --> 00:37:18,507
Did it work?

659
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,874
Perfectly.

660
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:22,474
You did great.

661
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,870
Um, so I got some rates

662
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:31,571
on some mental hospitals
around here,

663
00:37:31,604 --> 00:37:32,870
and there's one called
Silvercrest

664
00:37:32,903 --> 00:37:34,371
which actually seems okay.

665
00:37:34,404 --> 00:37:36,371
Put this ham in the fridge,
will you?

666
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:38,404
I think I'll make it
for dinner.

667
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:41,170
Uh, mom, I know you don't wanna
talk about this, but we have to.

668
00:37:41,204 --> 00:37:43,637
Mrs. Van De Kamp
is gonna call the police.

669
00:37:43,671 --> 00:37:46,704
I promised myself I would never
institutionalize your brother.

670
00:37:46,738 --> 00:37:49,471
- Mom!
- How long do you think
it'd be before he'd act out,

671
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:51,137
maybe even hurt somebody?

672
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,838
A couple of days? A week?

673
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,838
Then they'd throw him
in a straitjacket

674
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,104
and drug away
what's left of his mind.

675
00:37:58,137 --> 00:38:01,137
He'd spend the rest of his life
at the mercy of strangers.

676
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,270
But if we don't send him
to a hospital,

677
00:38:03,304 --> 00:38:05,270
he's gonna end up in prison,

678
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:08,104
- and don't you think that's worse?
- Yes, of course I do.

679
00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:10,671
So what the hell
are we gonna do?

680
00:38:15,371 --> 00:38:18,037
Phenobarbital?

681
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,903
It's easy.

682
00:38:19,937 --> 00:38:21,437
It's painless.

683
00:38:21,471 --> 00:38:26,070
It's just a few extra drops.
He simply falls asleep.

684
00:38:29,738 --> 00:38:32,637
Caleb was meant for a better
world than this, Matthew.

685
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:39,237
It's time to give your brother
the peace he deserves.

686
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:54,237
Who's the pretty girl?

687
00:38:55,804 --> 00:38:57,937
Oh, looks like
it's daddy's turn.

688
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,437
- I got her.
- Yes.

689
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:00,970
Oh, yes.

690
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,804
- Mrs. Solis?
- Yes?

691
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:08,637
We have a court order to take
the Collins baby into custody.

692
00:39:08,671 --> 00:39:11,270
No, no, no,
that's a mistake.

693
00:39:11,304 --> 00:39:12,937
No, we...
we have the paperwork.

694
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,771
The birth father
signed away his rights.

695
00:39:14,804 --> 00:39:16,870
It's the birth mother
who's protesting.

696
00:39:16,903 --> 00:39:18,070
What?

697
00:39:18,104 --> 00:39:20,637
Until the adoption
is legally finalized,

698
00:39:20,671 --> 00:39:23,304
the birth mother
can still change her mind,

699
00:39:23,337 --> 00:39:25,104
and... she has.

700
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,237
No, no,
no, no, no, no!

701
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,003
Gaby, wait.

702
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:42,504
You? You don't even
wanna be a mother!

703
00:39:42,537 --> 00:39:46,070
Well, look, Frank quit
usin', and, uh, he got

704
00:39:46,104 --> 00:39:49,270
a good job down at the plant.
He's really stepped up.

705
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,070
So?!

706
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:54,704
Well, so we're gonna give
the whole family thing a shot.

707
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:57,671
Well, I'll totally give you
all your money back.

708
00:39:57,704 --> 00:40:00,903
I don't want my money back.
I want my baby!

709
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,637
Come on, let's go.

710
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:07,003
Carlos!

711
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,504
No!
Carlos, what's happening?

712
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:11,671
No, no, no, ma'am, You don't understand,
You don't understand.

713
00:40:11,704 --> 00:40:13,771
This is our baby!

714
00:40:13,804 --> 00:40:16,704
No, we've been... we've been
feeding her, and we...

715
00:40:16,738 --> 00:40:18,504
we've been bathing her,

716
00:40:18,537 --> 00:40:21,137
and we wake up in the middle
of the night and we rock her,

717
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,637
which is crazy,

718
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:24,637
'cause if you knew me,
I don't do that.

719
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:26,204
I don't do that.

720
00:40:26,237 --> 00:40:28,804
And... and my husband...
my husband, he sings to her.

721
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:32,070
He sings,
so you can't take her away.

722
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:35,437
It's too late. We've already
fallen in love with her!

723
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:45,337
Carlos, do something!

724
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:50,237
No, you can't go!
You can't... you can't take her!

725
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,003
You can't take her!

726
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:54,003
No!

727
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:56,537
She's our baby!

728
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:59,304
She's our...

729
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:01,537
No!

730
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:03,070
Please!

731
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:06,537
There is a prayer intended
to give strength to people

732
00:41:06,571 --> 00:41:11,771
faced with circumstances
they don't want to accept.

733
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:13,771
The power of the prayer

734
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,237
comes from its insight
into human nature...

735
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:19,304
- We ask God
to grant us the serenity

736
00:41:19,337 --> 00:41:21,537
to accept the things
we cannot change...

737
00:41:21,571 --> 00:41:23,537
- ... because so many of us

738
00:41:23,571 --> 00:41:27,804
rage against the hand
that life has dealt us...

739
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,838
- ... the courage
to change the things we can...

740
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,903
- ... because so many of us
are cowardly

741
00:41:34,937 --> 00:41:38,937
and afraid to stand up
for what is right...

742
00:41:41,237 --> 00:41:44,304
- ... and the wisdom
to know the difference.

743
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:48,204
- ... because so many of us
give in to despair...

744
00:41:49,571 --> 00:41:54,237
when faced
with an impossible choice.

745
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,237
The good news
for those who utter these words

746
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:01,671
is that God will hear you
and answer your prayer.

747
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:10,237
The bad news is that sometimes
the answer is no.
