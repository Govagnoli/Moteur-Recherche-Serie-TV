1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,050
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,610
i'm going to
be a stay-at-home dad.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,800
Some reversed roles...

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,250
- i've been thinkin' about you.
- So you came to ask me out?

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,680
Some were welcomed in...

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,850
'cause i'll say yes.

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,480
I've moved on.
You should do the same.

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,310
Some were shn the door...

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,480
will you marry me?

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,110
And some...

11
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,410
Never got the chance...

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,150
To find out
what they really wanted.

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,450
Betty applewhite
was a gifted woman.

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,010
Everyone had always said so
ever since she was a child.

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,050
Her first piano teacher
praised her dexterity.

16
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,880
Her first college professor

17
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,550
applauded
her sense of rhythm...

18
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,110
Her first symphony conductor
hailed her dramatic flair...

19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,350
But betty was no longer
a concert pianist.

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,780
She was now just a woman
with a secret,

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,720
one she was determined to keep
by any means necessary.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,380
I'm not a bit surprised that someby broke into gabrielle's house.

23
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,380
Wisteria lane
is an easy target.

24
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,550
It's not like the police
patrol around here.

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,310
We still have
the neighborhood watch.

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,350
Oh,the neighborhood watch
is a joke.

27
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,880
When was the last time
any of you went on patrol,huh?

28
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,680
Now i put security lights
on my house.

29
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,380
I say it's time that we hire
professional security.

30
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,180
Well,that sounds expensive.

31
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,430
Could you really put a price
on your kids' safety?

32
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,250
Well,you probably could.

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,580
Look,mcclusky,i am as worried as everybody else in this neighborhood,

34
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,440
- but i just...
- We've got to stop this.

35
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,690
- and say what,we're against security?
- But if they find caleb first...

36
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,920
- hush,matthew.I'm trying to think.
- I'm not talking about a bunch of vigilantes,

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,720
i'm taing about trained men
who know when to shoot.

38
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,480
do we really need
professional security?

39
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,370
Are you all gonna wait
until somebody else is attacked?

40
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,780
I think it's time to take a vote
on armed security.

41
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,490
let's vote now.

42
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,500
I've had enough.
All those in favor...

43
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,580
Oh,sorry. Things were
just getting so dramatic.

44
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,000
Wow,you're really good.

45
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,450
- We were taking a vote here.
- She was a concert pianist.

46
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,750
Well,i dabbled a bit.

47
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,450
Yes,betty applewhite
was a gifted woman...

48
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,980
and the greatest
of all her gifts...

49
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,580
was her timing.

52
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,680
Once they've suffered
a miscarriage

53
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,790
Some women sit alone
in the dark for hours.

54
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,170
They refuse to go out
in the light of day,

55
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,550
afraid to face the possibility
that life will go on.

56
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,150
They hold onto reminders
of their unborn child

57
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,350
and dream
of what might have been.

58
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,550
Yes,this is how some women react
when they've suffed such a loss.

59
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,610
Gabrielle solis
was not one of those women.

60
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,710
Hi,guys.

61
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,070
Hi,honey.
Hi.

62
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,800
How are you?

63
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,510
I'm fine. Thank you
for the messages.

64
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,410
I'm... i'm sorry i haven't
had time to return calls.

65
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,110
We all cleared
our schedules.

66
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,750
We thought maybe
you could use some company.

67
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,890
So we're going to
go to my house.

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,020
I made banana bread,
and we'll put on a fresh pot,

69
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,300
and just
talk about anything.

70
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,190
That sounds so nice.

71
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,840
It's just
i'm booked solid today.

72
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,400
My head's gonna explode.

73
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,610
Can i take a rain check?

74
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,070
Sure.

75
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,130
Thanks.

76
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,700
Thanks for understanding.

77
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,820
Okay,well,uh,i will call you tonight and we'll figure out a time later in the week.

78
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,640
Well,i'll tell you what,

79
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,520
since it's my schedule
that seems to be the problem,

80
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,250
why don't i just figure out
a time and call you?

81
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,630
Okay.

82
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,980
I st... i have so many errands to run
and a llion things to return.

83
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,410
Oh,honey,there's no reason why
you and carlos can't try again.

84
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,270
You'd be an amazing mother.

85
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,250
You should hold onto
that stuff for a while.

86
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,680
Yeah,you know,i would,

87
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:23,040
but the store has this strict
30-day return policy.

88
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,530
Carlos,what happened?

89
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,550
I've had a rough couple days.

90
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,290
After you told me
about the...

91
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,810
the baby...

92
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,880
i kind of lost it.

93
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,170
Carlos,your hands.

94
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,760
I ripped my mattress open.

95
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,790
Jeez,how are you
feeling today?

96
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,550
They're injecting me
with this tranquilizer thing.

97
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,560
I think it's doing the trick.

98
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,260
we never even
talked about names.

99
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,350
I had my top five
all picked out.

100
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,290
Honey.

101
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,230
- You want to hear 'em?
- No,i'm good.

102
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,330
But you never
thought about names?

103
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,460
Oh,well,it was a little soon
for that,don't you think?

104
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,840
I mean,how can you name
something the size of a walnut?

105
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,400
Is this new?

106
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,840
Do you like it?
I picked it up on the way here.

107
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,890
You just lost a baby.

108
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,130
We all grieve differently.

109
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,970
You seem to be
takin' it pretty well.

110
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,250
I go shopping,you rip toilets
out of the wall...

111
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,690
- different strokes.
- Are you even sad?

112
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,430
Oh,please.
What do you think?

113
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,560
Honestly? I don't know.

114
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,950
Of course,i'm sad.
It's a sad situation.

115
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,140
Now let go of me.

116
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,630
- Oh,man.
- Honey,are you okay?

117
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,390
I think my tranquilizer's
wearing off.

118
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,110
Well,let's
get you another round.

119
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,650
Hey,mike.

120
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,690
So my mom's wedding's
in a couple days,

121
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,270
and i know you sent back
that little card

122
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,470
saying you were coming
and that you preferred beef,

123
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,710
which,actually,i changed to fish for you 'cause i tasted the beef.

124
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,480
Anyways,i know that was
before we,you know.

125
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,780
Send your mom my apologies,

126
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,900
but i won't be attending.

127
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,760
I hope that's not just because
of us not being us anymore.

128
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,300
I mean,we could be together
at a wedding,

129
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,720
and it wouldn't
have to be weird.

130
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,290
It'd be weird.

131
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,370
Of course. Yeah,i see that.

132
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,780
So what have you been
doing lately?

133
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,170
Oh,just the usual.

134
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,380
Well,i've been
writing a book.

135
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,360
It's sort of
autobiographical.

136
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,700
It's really been forcing me
to reexamine

137
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,110
some of the different things
that have made me me,

138
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,150
like the fact that
my mother had me so young,

139
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,110
and i never knew my dad.
Big stuff like that.

140
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,830
I told you
about my dad,right?

141
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,590
He... he was a merchant marine,

142
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,990
and his platoon was killed
in the battle of hanoi?

143
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,610
- That's strange.
- Why?

144
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,280
Well,hanoi wasn't enemy territory.
There wasn't a battle there.

145
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,820
Are you sure?
That's what my mom said.

146
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,090
I'm pretty sure,yeah.

147
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,070
The merchant marines
don't fight.

148
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,450
They deliv supplies
on ships.

149
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,160
Oh. Well,clearly i have
more research to do.

150
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,590
So what do you think?

151
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,890
My life story... would you
rush out and buy a copy?

152
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,530
- Susan...
- yeah?

153
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,180
You really need
to step back.

154
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,760
Porter,preston,what have i told you
about playing outside after dark?

155
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,350
It's not dark.

156
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,680
Does your dad know
you're out here?

157
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,670
Don't worry,
i've been watching 'em.

158
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,190
They keep setting off
my motion sensors.

159
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,410
I ought to send you
half my electric bill.

160
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,500
You do that.
Okay,guys,come on over here.

161
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,250
On the sidewalk.

162
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,050
Stay there.
Not on the street. Thank you.

163
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,210
Hey.

164
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,210
Hi,babe.

165
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,210
I'm home.

166
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,800
Could you come here a sec?

167
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,560
Sure. What's up?

168
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,450
Block me,come on!

169
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,970
Damn,they must have
snuck out again.

170
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,840
Again? How often
does this happen?

171
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,490
Boys,get in here now!

172
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,600
Honey,you know
how slippery they are.

173
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,270
It's like trying
to herd cats.

174
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,890
Tom,it's 9:00 at night.

175
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,540
Guys,upstairs now.
Let's go.

176
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,370
Into pj's,into bed.
Honey,they're fine.

177
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,570
You just...
you worry too much.

178
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,220
And for good reason.

179
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,980
Someone could have
driven off with them,

180
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,310
and you wouldn't have
even noticed.

181
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,950
They were in the front yard.
God,when i was their age,

182
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,940
i used to hop on my bike,
disappear for hours.

183
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,550
My mom never batted an eye.

184
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,850
Yeah,well,
that was a different time.

185
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,340
You have to be more vigilant.

186
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,220
There was a break-in
on this street.

187
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,630
I was at the neighborhood
watch meeting,remember?

188
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,870
I'm sorry. I've been
doing this for seven years.

189
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,530
Trust me. You have to have eyes
in the back of your head.

190
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,310
The two in front
work just fine,thanks.

191
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,210
Really?
Where's penny?

192
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,110
See? Right where
i left her.

193
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,460
bree van dekamp
to wed george willams

194
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,440
How did this
get in the paper

195
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,410
l-i was going to call you.

196
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,450
We discussed this.
We agreed to go slowly.

197
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,740
L-i was going to call
and cancelfter our talk,

198
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,540
but things just got so hectic,
l-i forgot.

199
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,160
Rex has only been dead
for seven weeks.

200
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,110
So?

201
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,910
So i don't want every woman in this town talking about me behind my back.

202
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,890
I'm sorry,
but isn't the damage done?

203
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,890
Well,fortunately,people only read the announcements

204
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,520
when there's nothing in the front page,

205
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,060
and the headline today was about
some catastrophic flood in sri lanka.

206
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,050
Oh,so we lucked out.

207
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,550
Yes,we did.

208
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,370
Now when the time comes to go public with our relationship,

209
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,960
i need you to discuss it
with me first.

210
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,310
I'm the bride,after all.
It's only...

211
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,050
appropriate.

212
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,480
Okay.

213
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,030
I will need you
to wear that ring,though.

214
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,210
The ring?

215
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,070
You're not wearing it.
Where is it?

216
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,210
- It's in my purse.
- Oh,good.

217
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,320
Please put it on.

218
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,170
But if people see it...

219
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,200
they'll assume that you're
wearing your wedding ring.

220
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,290
Oh. Maybe,but why risk it?

221
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,610
Because a ring tells would-be
suitors a woman is spoken for.

222
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,570
A naked hand
invites unwanted attention.

223
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,950
Here. Let me.

224
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,350
Uh,will that be all,
mrs. Van de kamp?

225
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,980
Uh,yes,i think so,
mr. Williams.

226
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,660
Hi.

227
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,780
Oh,my god!

228
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,090
What do you want?!

229
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,520
Hey,hey,it's cool!

230
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,670
No,it's not cool!
Who the hell are you?!

231
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,110
- Carlos sent me!
- I'm gonna call the police!

232
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,930
Name's hector.
I met carlos inside.

233
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,240
Inside what?

234
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,150
You mean...
you mean,in prison?

235
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,140
He told me what happened,asked me to come by and keep an eye on you.

236
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,500
- Can i come in?
- No! No,you can't come in!

237
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,360
I brought a cooler.
I'll camp out here.

238
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,560
No! I can take care
of myself,okay?

239
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,310
Okay.

240
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,470
Okay?

241
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,390
Yeah,l-i get it.
You need your space.

242
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,760
Yes. Yes,i do.
I need my space. Thank you.

243
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,080
Come here. I want
to show you something.

244
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,680
- Come here.
- Hi,guys.

245
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,410
I thought
about what you said.

246
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,280
Don't want you to worry.

247
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,280
So i had a little talk
with the boys.

248
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:41,820
Okay,guys,what do we do if a stranger asks us to take a ride in their car?

249
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,350
- Porter.
- We run away and call 9-1-1.

250
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,390
Good man.

251
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,110
Right,but what
if that stranger says,

252
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,110
"hey,i know
your mommy and daddy"?

253
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,340
- What,preston?
- Still run away.

254
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,210
Yes. Okay...

255
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,360
- can i ask a question?
- Yeah,by all means.

256
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,860
What if the stranger
is nice and not scary?

257
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,820
Yes?

258
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,400
Run away
and call 9-1-1.

259
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,890
So what if the stranger says

260
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:16,690
they're going to take you to the circus for pizza and elephant rides?

261
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,920
Don't look at your dad.

262
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,120
Eyes on me.
What are you gonna do?

263
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,870
What are you gonna do?

264
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,720
We...

265
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,240
run away?

266
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,890
Yes! Snap.

267
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,080
Okay,to the kitchen.

268
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,370
We are havin'
ice cream tonight.

269
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,780
Your smiling like that
actually meant something.

270
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,700
Lynette,come on. We worked on
this all afternoon. They get it.

271
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,320
Give me a break. You know
our kids. I love them dearly,

272
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,620
but that goes in one ear
and out the other.

273
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,140
I'm gonna havesome ice cream.

274
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,900
Tom,you're not
off the hook here.

275
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,050
Lynette,i can
keep my children alive.

276
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,580
When you left this morng,
there were four.

277
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,740
When you came home,
there were still four.

278
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,670
When you come home
and there are only three,

279
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,090
then you get to lecture me.

280
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,160
Excuse me.

281
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,030
- Are you bree van de kamp?
- Uh,yes,i am.

282
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,440
My name is leila mitzman.
I hope i'm not interrupting.

283
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,760
Can i help you?

284
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,730
This may sound odd,
but i felt i should see you.

285
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,760
I read in the paper that you're
engaged to george williams.

286
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,670
Oh,well,that announcement
was a bit premature.

287
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,680
But you and george
are involved...

288
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,270
in a romantic
relationship?

289
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,720
Yes.

290
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,870
Then we need to talk.

291
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,600
We'd been dating for six months
when he asked me to marry him.

292
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,130
From the moment i said "yes,"
george got so possessive,

293
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,980
and when he found out my ex lived just down the street,

294
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,220
george accused me of seeing him
behind his back.

295
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,980
And then one night,
i got a call from the police.

296
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,930
Someone had set
my ex's car on fire.

297
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,110
I could never prove anything,

298
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,610
but i knew it was george.
I left him the next day.

299
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,270
Well,i don't know
what to say.

300
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,460
I know. It's upsetting.

301
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,760
Yes,it is...

302
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,170
to have a complete stranger
come into my home,

303
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,340
drink my tea,

304
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,160
and then try to turn me against one of the sweetest men i have ever known.

305
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,160
Honey,you got to trust me.
George is a whack job,

306
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,920
and you should get
while the getting's good.

307
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,330
I think it's time
for you to leave.

308
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,140
One time,i was talking
to a guy at a bar,

309
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,370
and when we got home,
george slapped me.

310
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,430
What do you say to that?

311
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,060
I say,given your overall demeanor
and your freewheeling use of epithets,

312
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,120
i'm willing to bet
that he was provoked.

313
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,400
When i read that
you were engaged to george,

314
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,670
i felt it was my duty
to let you know he's crazy.

315
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,760
But now that i've met you,

316
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,190
i can see
it's a match made in heaven.

317
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,670
I'm here. Hi,morty,
reverend hopkins.

318
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,130
I'm sorry i'm late
to your rehearsal.

319
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,880
Oh,it's okay. It's all right.
You're here now.

320
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,110
It's fine.
Go in front of me.

321
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,350
Okay,reverend,hit it!

322
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,790
Mom,can i ask you
a question?

323
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,110
You've got to march,susie.
Got to march.

324
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,390
Oh. I was just
researching my book,

325
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,760
ani found
the strangest thing.

326
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,700
No one with my father's name
was ever a merchant marine.

327
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,160
Oh,did i say merchant?

328
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,110
Well,i just meant
the regular marines.

329
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,690
Oh,well,yeah,i thought
you probably did.

330
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,380
So i checked that,too,
and he wasn't there,

331
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,990
and so i called the v.a.,

332
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,270
and there is not a single record of anyone named harrison ross in vietnam.

333
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,700
This is not the time,susie.

334
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,510
What's... what's the holdup,
ladies?

335
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,030
Well,i'm sorry
to upset you,mom,i just...

336
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,680
don't you think
that's weird?

337
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,000
What's... what's weird?

338
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,010
Well,there's no record of anyone with my dad's name in the armed services.

339
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,560
Oh,well,there it is.

340
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,650
There what is?

341
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,070
Morty,just go on
back up there.

342
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,930
Look,i'm... i'm not gonna say that i knew this would happen,

343
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,490
but i knew this would happen.

344
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,870
Mom,ieed answers.

345
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,860
Do you have to do thisow?

346
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,840
You are ruining
my wedding rehearsal.

347
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,500
Well,you've been married four times.
I think you got it down.

348
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,620
I will nottand here
and be attacked!

349
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,690
Mom,

350
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,620
What do you want me to say?

351
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,960
You want me
to say i'm a bad mother?

352
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:41,280
Fine! I'm a bad mother!
Are you happy now?

353
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,750
Mom! Mom.

354
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,050
Mom.

355
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,010
Yes,yes,l-i know
what i'm getting into.

356
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,500
Morty? Morty,
have you seen my mom?

357
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,920
Yeah. Yeah,
she seemed,uh,

358
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,000
she seemed pretty upset.
L-i think...

359
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,510
i think she took a cab home.

360
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,860
You need... you need a ride?

361
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,930
I need to you tell me
the truth about my father.

362
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,850
Hop in.

363
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,960
When,uh,
when i was in korea,

364
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,900
i was stationed
outside of,uh,pusan,

365
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,820
and we'd,uh,we'd... we'd get these...
these passes,you know,

366
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,990
and we'd...
and we'd go into town,

367
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,420
and,you know,we'd have a...
have a few beers,

368
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,290
and we used to call it r and r
in... in military lingo.

369
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,730
Yeah,well,i know
what r and r means.

370
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,610
So what does this
have to do with my father?

371
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,460
Well,that's...
that's what i'm getting to.

372
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,730
Um,a-anyway,there were
these... these young ladies.

373
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,260
Professional...

374
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,290
ladies if... if you know
what i mean.

375
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,150
Morty... can... can we just
move this along?

376
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,880
O-okay. Long story short,
l... it's just i never figured

377
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:59,160
that my first time with a woman
would... would be in an alley...

378
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,590
behind a korean noodle stand with...

379
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,630
with my fatigues down around my... my ankles.

380
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,960
Okay,again,w-what does this
have to do with my father?

381
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,510
We... we've all done things
that,uh,you know,

382
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,390
thate're ashamed of.

383
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,370
I mean,you know,we all...

384
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,620
we all have secrets.

385
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,840
Your... your... your father
wasn't a war hero.

386
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,500
And he... he wasn't
in viet... vietnam.

387
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,380
Well,why would
my mother tell me that?

388
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,840
Uh,sophie wasn't...
wasn't married to your father.

389
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,570
I'm... i'm not...i'm not sure
she even...she even knew his name.

390
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,680
Are you saying that i'm the result
of my mother having a one-night stand?

391
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,820
Well,like l... like i said,
we've all,y know,

392
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:56,770
we've... we've all done things
that we're...that we're ashamed of.

393
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,860
George.

394
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,910
Bree. This is a surprise.

395
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,830
I'm sorry to drop by
unannounced,

396
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,810
but i just had this disturbing visit from an old friend of yours,

397
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,090
a leila mitzman.

398
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,220
She,uh,shouldn't have
contacted you.

399
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,750
Well,she did,and she said some pretty horrible things about you.

400
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,670
You should know that
she's a renowned liar.

401
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,580
That's what
i thought at first,

402
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,890
but then having had time
to think about it,

403
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,480
i can't understand
why she'd go to so much trouble.

404
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,710
I mean,what would
her motive be?

405
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,020
She's obsessed with me.
She still wants me.

406
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,180
Wasn't it obvious?

407
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,060
No.

408
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,760
The woman is absolutely
certifiable.

409
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,410
What's more,
i can prove it.

410
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,190
Leila was a customer here.

411
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,660
Even though
she's no longer welcome,

412
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,350
we still keep
her prescriptions on file.

413
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,630
"Fluoxetine,100 milligrams."

414
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,350
"Risperidone,250 mil"...
i'm sorry. What is this?

415
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,320
One is an antidepressant
for mood swings.

416
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,570
One is an antipsychotic
to control hallucinations.

417
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,970
Like i said,
she's a very troubled lady.

418
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:25,030
Well,then why did you
date her in the first place?

419
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,450
In the beginning,you're blind
to the flaws,right?

420
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,260
That's true...
in the beginning.

421
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,240
So we're good?

422
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,140
yeah,
of course we are.

423
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,860
Your mail came.

424
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,590
You said
you were leaving.

425
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,470
No,i said
i was giving you space.

426
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,030
I did. I was watchin' you
from my car.

427
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,750
Look,the guy who broke in
stole ice cream.

428
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,280
I don't think
i'm in any danger.

429
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,350
So you can go.
I don't need you.

430
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,540
Carlos says you do.

431
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,170
Where are you going?

432
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,320
Shopping... not that it's
any of your business.

433
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,240
- You sure like to shop.
- Yes,i do.

434
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,540
That's all i've seen you do
the past day and a half.

435
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,850
Uh-huh.

436
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,880
All that shopping must be
making up for something.

437
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,750
Excuse me?

438
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,610
You know,
carlos has your number.

439
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,210
He says you're
one tough cookie.

440
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,900
So tough,you don't have to
deal with your feelings.

441
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,410
He's a perceptive man.

442
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,480
He thought i was cheating
with two gay guys.

443
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,120
Are you sure you want
to go with perceptive?

444
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,490
Well,let's see.It's been what,a week
since you lost your baby?

445
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,200
Yeah,so?

446
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,480
So i never heard
of shopping out the pain.

447
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,110
Why is everye
on my back about this?

448
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,670
I will deal
with my loss my way,okay?!

449
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,700
Where are you going?

450
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,330
Ah,i,uh,i just thought i would go out and look some more...

451
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,600
- i'm gonna try the park.
- In the middle of the night?

452
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,510
Well,yeah. Well,he hasn't really been showing his face in the daylight,has he?

453
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,610
Or would you rather
we just let caleb run loose?

454
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,450
He could be in trouble...

455
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,770
or hurting another girl.

456
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,030
He didn't hurt
mrs. Solismatthew.

457
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,150
He was just hungry.

458
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,850
Yeah,well,i wasn't
talking about mrs. Solis,

459
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,830
but you know that.

460
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,330
So are you still going to be
my matron of honor?

461
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,340
Of course i am.

462
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,460
I'm not
gonna pretend like i'm not still a little freaked out.I am.

463
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,120
But i did a lot of thinking
about it this morning,

464
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,370
and l-i think i understand.

465
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,900
You wanted to protect me,

466
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,600
and you thought
i needed a hero.

467
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,730
I had one. You.

468
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,930
I was always so worried
i would screw you up.

469
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,530
Well,i am screwed up,
but it wasn't your fault...

470
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,760
entirely.

471
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,460
Hey,stu.

472
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,660
You busy?

473
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,500
No,just updating my blog.

474
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,620
'Cause i've got an important
assignment for you.

475
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,130
Great. I'm really ready to take on more responsibility around here.

476
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,940
Yeah,i applaud that,
but what i need

477
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,750
is for you to help me
to prove a point...

478
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,650
to my husband.

479
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,080
Oh. You want
to make him jealous.

480
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,140
Uh,no.

481
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,140
Actually...

482
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,950
i need you to kidnap
my children.

483
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,460
Stop hitting me!

484
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,370
Okay,so what am i
supposed to be lookin' at?

485
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,420
Just wait for it.

486
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,010
Okay,he he comes.

487
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,300
What's goin' on?

488
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,100
I'm just trying
to prove a point.

489
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,010
Hi...

490
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,820
little boys.

491
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,140
Hell,who is that?

492
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,560
It's... it's just stu
from our office.

493
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,100
You guys want
to go for a ride?

494
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,050
And is he abducting
our kids?

495
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,120
Maybe.

496
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,530
this is crazy.

497
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,220
Why? Are you worried
they might get in?

498
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,210
We can go
to the,uh,carnival.

499
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,190
You like carnivals?

500
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,590
We're not allowed
to talk to strangers.

501
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,970
Run,boys.

502
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,200
So,uh,

503
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,430
why don't you boys
get in the car...

504
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,800
run away. Run.

505
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,570
Get in the car,
and i'll give you some candy.

506
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,610
Yeah! Candy!

507
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,200
Why aren't they running away?

508
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,230
Well...

509
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,900
this is not the time
to be smug.

510
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,920
Clearly our sons are...

511
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,540
idiots.

512
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,690
Okay,okay,jeez.

513
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,130
Hi.

514
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,190
Hi.

515
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,310
oh,my god!

516
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,980
Run,kids,run! Run!
No,you don't.

517
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,780
You pervert! Oh,no,
you're not goin' anywhere!

518
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,860
Oh! Aah!

519
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,750
Um,a-anyway,after...
after we... we wrap this shindig,

520
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,240
i'm whisking my new bride,
uh,away

521
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,430
on a 4-month cruise
around the world.

522
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,860
L-i would have been happy
with a-a weekend in vegas,

523
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,080
but you know...

524
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,150
Anyway,here... here she is.

525
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,550
My,um,my beautiful bride.

526
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,850
I want to thank everyone
for coming,

527
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,990
and especially my morty,

528
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,000
who's helped me be a bter person.

529
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,520
And i want to thank...

530
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,040
my amazing daughter susan,

531
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:36,080
and tell her how much i appreciate her love and respect...

532
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,240
because
i'm a horrible person,

533
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,750
and she deserves
so much better than me.

534
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,430
- Honey,honey.
- No,nono,no,no.

535
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Susan needs to know the truth.

536
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,800
Your father...

537
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,900
was not a one-night stand.

538
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:11,790
He was 33,
and he was married...

539
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,450
and he was my boss.

540
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,820
When i told him i was pregnant,

541
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:25,040
he broke it off,and he never
spoke to me again.

542
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:31,590
But he gave me my beautiful,
incredible daughter,

543
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,220
and for that,
i want to thank addison prudy.

544
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,590
Oh,my god.

545
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,290
Do you know where he is?

546
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:47,600
I have no idea. I swear,
if i knew,l-i wouldell you.

547
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,000
Uh,i know addison prudy.

548
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,990
He runs the feed and supply
store at third and sutherland.

549
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:00,500
Uh,prudy's
a fairly common name of... so.

550
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,620
Is that him?

551
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,890
Yes.

552
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,100
Are you saying that all this time
my father has been alive,

553
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:18,260
and just right across town running thsupply and feed store?

554
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,160
susan...

555
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,030
i can't belie this!

556
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,210
Is something wrong?

557
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,360
You've been so quiet
all evening.

558
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,700
No,no,i'm just tired,
that's all.

559
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,710
Care to dance?
It might pep you up.

560
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,410
I don't think so.
But thank you,though.

561
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,410
Bree,where is your ring?

562
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,850
Oh,um,the...
the stone is loose.

563
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,090
So i'm gonna take it
to the jewelers.

564
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,800
But don't worry,
it's safe.

565
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,090
This isn't about leila,
is it?

566
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,580
No. No.
It's like i told you,

567
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,240
the stone could just pop off
at anyecond.

568
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,520
Well,i don't care.
Please put it on.

569
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,490
What?

570
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,410
I want you to wear it.

571
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,400
Well,i'm sorry,
but i'm not going to.

572
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,190
Why not?

573
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,620
Because i don't
feel like it.

574
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,730
And this is the last time we're
gonna talk about this,okay?

575
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,560
Excuse me,ma'am.

576
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,780
We don't allow members
of zeta beta kappa in here.

577
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,800
Ty! Ty grant.

578
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,540
Oh,hi!
What are you doing in town?

579
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,710
Visiting my folks.

580
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,140
Oh,my goodness.
Oh,george,this is ty grant.

581
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,130
We used to date in college.

582
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,350
Ty,this is george,um...

583
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,900
he's a good friend of mine.

584
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,330
Actually,we're engaged.

585
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,110
Bree,you look fantastic.
You haven't aged a day.

586
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,530
Ty,would you like
to dance?

587
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,160
Sure. I'd love to.

588
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,160
Let me take your coat.

589
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,520
need to cut in.

590
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,410
George,would you please
sit down?

591
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,540
You're being rude.

592
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,840
Am i in the middle
of something?

593
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,090
Well,at least
put on the ring.

594
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,990
No.
George,i don't want to.

595
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,250
We are engaged.
You have to wear it!

596
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,850
Hey,knock it off,man.
George,stop it.

597
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,790
I'm sorry.

598
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,450
I just...

599
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,670
we're engaged.

600
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,930
See,the thing is,
i don't think we are anymore.

601
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,060
Bree.

602
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,680
Please...
you should go.

603
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,760
I'm really sorry.

604
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,080
Oh,hi.

605
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,430
Right over there,sir.

606
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,560
Management likes us to keep
the nice cars out front.

607
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,170
Afternoon.

608
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,540
- New hairdo?
- So what if it is?

609
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,640
It looks nice,that's all.

610
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,530
You know,
i also got a facial,

611
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:37,730
and later on i'm gonna get a pedicure
and an eyebrow wax, so there.

612
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,010
It'sine with me.

613
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,240
No,it's not,because i know
what you're thinking.

614
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,190
Yeah?
You know what?

615
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,370
I am tired of you judging me.

616
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,340
What is it gonna take
to get rid of you,hmm?

617
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,860
What's your last name?

618
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,840
Ramos.

619
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:54,780
Ramos. Here is $1,000.

620
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,510
I won't tell carlos
you didn't stick around.

621
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,180
It'll be our little secret.

622
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,300
I just got out of prison.

623
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,810
I'm not exactly set up
with a bank account.

624
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,400
Can we go to your bank
and cash this?

625
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,150
And then you'll leave?

626
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,160
Hey,it's a grand.

627
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,460
Buckle up.

628
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,360
You don't have
a-a window thingy.

629
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,670
Nope.

630
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,330
You don't have
a door handle either.

631
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,810
Nope.

632
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,150
But i do have
a confession to make.

633
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,500
Carlos didn't really send me
to protect you.

634
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,750
Go figure.

635
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,710
No one else in the park.

636
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,060
We got it all to ourselves.

637
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,990
Perfect.

638
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,510
Why don't you go find us
a good spot?

639
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,270
I gotta get something
out of the trunk.

640
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,620
Hey,where the hell
you goin'?

641
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,510
You're not gonna kill me?

642
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,930
I hadn't planned on it.

643
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,910
Besides,if i was
gonna kill you,

644
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,560
i wouldn't use a balloon.

645
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,040
It would take too long.

646
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,720
What am i supposed to think?
You lie about protecting me

647
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,020
and then you lock me in that
heap without door handles

648
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,540
so i can't get out.

649
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,170
Carlos sent me
to help you with your grief.

650
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,620
You're kidding,right?

651
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,440
No.

652
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:59,120
Look,i know
a little somethin' about loss.

653
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,400
It can take you
to some real dark places,

654
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,980
especially if you don't
face it head-on,

655
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:08,150
like 17 years
in a 6x10 prison cell.

656
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,800
Dark.

657
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,790
What's this for?

658
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,520
The balloon represents
the spirit of the life lost.

659
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,400
By lettin' it go,

660
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,690
you're acknowledging
the pain you feel

661
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,200
and releasin' it
at the same time.

662
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,790
Okay,that's ridiculous.

663
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,180
Besides,i don't feel
what you think i'm feeling.

664
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,320
Then it should be
real easy.

665
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,230
Fine,if i do this,
will you go?

666
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,760
Yeah.

667
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,320
Okay...
should i say something?

668
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,430
If you want to.

669
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,750
Not really,no.

670
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,480
It's cool.

671
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,280
Anytime.

672
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,060
This is stupid.

673
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,060
I didn't even want
this baby.

674
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,730
Yeah.

675
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,590
And i would've been
a terrible mother.

676
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,790
If you say so.

677
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,570
If it was a boy,
i was gonna name it charlie.

678
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,140
Yeah?

679
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,710
And a girl,aurora.

680
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,780
Those are nice names.

681
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,890
Yeah.

682
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,050
Thank you.

683
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,960
What is it,boy?

684
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,930
What's goin' on out here?

685
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,620
- Call the police.
- You need me to zap him?

686
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,250
Just call the police.

687
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,550
Is that the guy
who broke into your house?

688
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,260
Uh,i don't know.
I can't see him.

689
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,240
Yeah,that's him.

690
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,920
In a world filled
with darkness,

691
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:24,620
we all need some kind
of light.

692
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,200
Whether it's a great flame
that shows us

693
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,580
how to win back
what we've lost,

694
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,650
or a powerful beacon

695
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,940
intended to scare away
potential monsters...

696
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,640
two,four,six,eight...

697
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:44,280
or a few glowing bulbs
that reveal to us

698
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,910
the hidden truth
ofur past...

699
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:54,790
we all need something
to help us get through the night...

700
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:03,190
even if it's just
the tiniest glimmer of hope.
