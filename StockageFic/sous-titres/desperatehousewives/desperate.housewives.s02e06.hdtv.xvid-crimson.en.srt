00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,170
Desperate Housewives

4
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,740
to make those dreams come true.

5
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,260
Aah! Oh. Watch it,susie.

6
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,440
Mom,why don't you
just go see a dressmaker?

7
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,040
Wait.
I have the perfect idea.

8
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,580
You get in the dress
and I'll pin it.

9
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,050
We wear the same size.

10
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,290
- Since when?
- Since forever.

11
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,520
You have to leave,though.

12
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,660
You can't stay.

13
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,080
You can't see susie
in a wedding dress,

14
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,480
not until your big day.

15
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,250
Mom!

16
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,320
No,it's not a problem.

17
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,240
I can see her in it.

18
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,440
- You can?
- You can?

19
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,810
I assume you wanna pick out your own wedding dress when we get married,right?

20
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,650
that sounds like
a proposal.

21
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,000
Did it?

22
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,940
Yeah,it did.

23
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,040
Huh. What do you know?

24
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,510
Are you planning
to pop the question?

25
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,530
Well,if she knows it's coming,

26
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,120
the question won't really pop,

27
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,410
now will it?

28
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,200
He's right,mom. I want it
to be just like you do--

29
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,470
you know,on your own terms,

30
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,610
and you get down on one knee
and the whole production.

31
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,670
That's the plan.

32
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,860
Well,then I can wait.

33
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,610
I can wait.

34
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,030
I'm a good waiter.

35
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,470
Good.

36
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,690
I'm just wondering if there's
a ballpark of how long

37
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,510
I will have to wait--

38
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,500
a week,a month,after lunch?

39
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,810
Again,you're not waiting
for the pop.

40
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,630
Right,right. I'm sorry.

41
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,050
Oh,mom.

42
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,140
So the hives occurred
right after you kissed george?

43
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,320
Yes.It was the strangest thing,

44
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,190
and so inconvenient.

45
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,880
To be honest,

46
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,070
I think we were about to
make love for the first time.

47
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,090
Bree,have you considered the idea
that your subconscious mind

48
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,590
was trying to sabotage
your evening with george?

49
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,170
Actually,

50
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,030
I have not considered that
because that's idiotic.

51
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,270
You don't think being with george
made you feel a bit guilty?

52
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,610
Why should I feel guilty?

53
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,360
Perhaps you felt you were
about to commit adultery.

54
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,560
Dr. Goldfine,rex is dead.

55
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,740
You can't cheat on a corpse.

56
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,100
Well,maybe that's not how
you really feel deep down.

57
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,750
Oh,so you think I'm crazy?

58
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,630
You say you got
a case of hives for no reason.

59
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,140
I think there is a reason,

60
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,500
and it's probably
a psychosomatic one.

61
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,630
You can think
whatever you want,

62
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,680
but to be honest,I don't
believe in the subconscious.

63
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,120
Every time you've said "rex"
in this session,

64
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,580
you've stroked the place where
your wedding ring used to be.

65
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,070
Why did you do that?

66
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,790
Let's talk about monday.

67
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,930
We are re-pitching
to the kamarov people.

68
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,370
Lynette,you'll be on point.

69
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,140
Great. Great. No problem.

70
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,380
And can you do me a favor
and maybe not wear the green suit?

71
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,240
Um...

72
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,600
I... wasn't planning to,

73
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,790
uh,but... why?

74
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,210
The fabric. It just has
this quality to it,

75
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,030
like you could--

76
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,200
I don't know--

77
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,040
wipe it clean
with a damp cloth.

78
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,780
I'll just wear
a different suit,then.

79
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,810
Great.

80
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,730
Like what,you think?

81
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,130
Another suit.

82
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,460
I have other suits.

83
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,900
And if by other suits,you mean the gray one,

84
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,010
then of course you do.

85
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,220
No,actually,I have quite a few others.

86
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,950
Uh,the blue one
and,uh...

87
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,100
what's wrong with the blue suit?

88
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,650
Stu,would you liketo tell lynette
what's wrongwith the blue suit?

89
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,760
No. That's cool.

90
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,520
Stu... come on.

91
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,580
Do the thing--

92
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,900
the thing that you didat lunch.

93
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,150
"Look at me. I'm lynette.

94
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,650
"I've got food stainseverywhere."

95
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,690
All right. So if I getmy blue suit dry-cleaned,

96
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,880
will that be acceptableto everyone?

97
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,390
The pants also havea split seam in the back.

98
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,720
Excuse me.

99
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,530
Hello,david.

100
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,460
What the hell is this?

101
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,490
I thought i told you
to dress maternal.

102
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,260
Yes,you did,and i considered
it for about a second.

103
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,550
What happened?

104
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,000
David,i know you're
the lawyer and all,

105
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,360
but trust me,it's never a smart
strategy to cover this up.

106
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,620
We've got 40 minutes
before the pre-trial hearing.

107
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,230
- Let's go home and get you changed.
- What?

108
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,460
You want to get your husband
out of jail?

109
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,820
You gotta dress like
a pregnant,suffering wife,

110
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,840
- not the cover of "vogue."
- David.

111
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,290
- Louis,what are you doing here?
- I need a favor,david.

112
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,180
If this has to do with lifting
my client's restraing order,

113
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,860
the answer's the same one
you got last week.

114
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,780
You don't understand.
I love crystal.

115
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,860
Yeah,we all love the pretty
ladies at the stop n' shop,

116
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,780
but now you' gotta love her
from 50 yards away.

117
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,680
You turned her against me

118
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,250
If it wasn't for you,we'd be together.

119
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,230
Louis,crystal hired me to keep you away from her.

120
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,490
She doesn't want to see you.

121
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,190
Oh,yeah,then why did
she ask for my phone number?

122
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,990
She's a cashier.You paid by check.
It doesn't make you special.

123
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,410
Don't walk away from me.
We're having a conversation!

124
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,840
Louis,this is your problem.

125
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,270
You're creepy!
Nobody likes you.

126
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,300
What you call a conversation
the rest of us call harassment.

127
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,410
You want a friend,
get a hamster.

128
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,130
David!

129
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,590
call the police!

130
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,190
stay there!

131
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,570
That's right,you better run,

132
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,800
'cause i'm gonna get some bullets for this thing and come after y!

133
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,290
Freeze!

134
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,560
Hey,everything's cool.

135
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,480
Are you okay?

136
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,100
weeds are a common annoyance
of life in suburbia,

137
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,330
and no matter how hard
we try to get rid of them...

138
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,500
they always tend to crop
back up.

139
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,290
A-are you seeing this?

140
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,120
I don't believe him.
He is so brazen.

141
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,060
He's just mowing the lawn
like nothing ever happened.

142
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,320
What should we do?
Should we call the police?

143
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,500
Well,susan did say that he murdered mrs.
Huber,so my vote would be yes.

144
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,230
Oh,my god,susan's home.

145
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,050
Has she seen paul yet?

146
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,890
I think so.

147
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,340
Hello,susan.

148
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,910
Oh,my god. Paul.

149
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,550
Need some help
with those bags?

150
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,020
Why... are you doing here?

151
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,340
This is where i live.
I came home to find my son.

152
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,580
- Here you go.
- No,don't come near me.

153
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,150
- I'm just giving you back your pie filling.
- I don't want my pie filling.

154
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,040
- oh,come on. Just take it.
- No,stop!

155
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,190
Put that pie filling down.

156
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,410
Slowly.

157
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,420
- I'm calling 9-1-1.
- You don't want to do that.

158
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,570
Oh,i think i do.
You're a cold-blooded murderer.

159
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,510
Susan,how can you believe that?
We've been neighbors for years.

160
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,690
Ladies,good to see you.

161
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,810
Paul,
we've called the police.

162
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,600
You didn't really need
to do that.

163
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,030
We know what you did
to mrs. Huber.

164
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,630
Wonderful. I see you've all turned
into susan while i've been gone.

165
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Oh,thank god.
They're here.

166
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,630
Hey,what's going on?

167
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,310
Oh,mayer's convinced that
paul young murdered martha huber.

168
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,230
Oh,my god.
I live right behind him.

169
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,360
I know. I gave him
my house keys to feed my cat.

170
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,900
I win. I made out with him.

171
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,640
Here you go. There's no warrant
here for a paul young.

172
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,390
Why don't you ask mike?
He overheard everything,right?

173
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,230
- Who's mike?
- Uh,he's my boyfriend,

174
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,610
and he told me that paul
confessed everything to him.

175
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,240
Oh,and mike has
martha's journals,

176
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,740
which clearly prove
that paul had a motive.

177
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,300
All right,all right,
where do i find this mike guy?

178
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,300
Uh,he's... follow me.

179
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,800
You mind if i stay here?
I've got a lot of raking to do.

180
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,380
Let's go.

181
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,450
Hey.

182
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,140
What's going on?

183
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,230
Mike,paul young is back.

184
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,770
Look.

185
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,030
Your girlfriend said mr. Young
confessed a murder to you?

186
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,780
Um...

187
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,960
no. No,not to me.

188
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,210
And i don't suppose you have a journal
that belonged to a martha huber?

189
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,790
No. I hardly knew her.

190
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,910
Besides,you ever known a woman
who'd loan out her diary?

191
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,690
Mike,what are you doing?

192
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,490
I'm sorry,susan. I don't know
what you're talking about.

193
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,710
But i've got a job to get to.
Is there anything else?

194
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,320
No,no,
that pretty much covers it.

195
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,050
Well,someone might as well
say it.

196
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,250
Susan,what the hell
have you been smoking?

197
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,030
Okay.

198
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,200
Wow!

199
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,010
Nice.

200
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,520
Oh,my god.

201
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,960
Okay,don't be distracted
by that. Look at me.

202
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,790
Here i am tomorrow,

203
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,860
making my presentation.

204
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,420
You see?
You see how it moves with me?

205
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,630
That's where the magic is.

206
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,020
$900?

207
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,750
Yeah,well,this one was
the most expensive.

208
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,870
The other ones aren't as nice.
But look.

209
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,300
Look,look,look,look at me,
look at me. Watch.

210
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,760
I don't walk in it.
I glide.

211
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,270
Um,honey,you know what?

212
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,680
There's gotta be like
$3,000 worth of clothes here.

213
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,480
Yeah,well,i haven't bought
a new suit in six years.

214
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,180
So? When i was working,

215
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,550
you don't think i would have
loved to have a designer suit?

216
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,280
I wore wash-and-wear so that
we could live in a nice neighborhood,

217
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,360
so we could take the kids
on vacation every summer.

218
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,580
- I mean,i made sacrifices.
- I'm willing to make sacrifices.

219
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Great,well,let's start here,because

220
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,420
this should cover
a math tutor for parker.

221
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:24,090
- Whoa,hold on a sec.
- Six months of preschool for penny.

222
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,450
All right,
now you're being ridiculous.

223
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,880
You know what? And the twins...
they're gonna need braces.

224
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,740
That oughta make a dent.

225
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,780
Oh,no. Come on,tom.
Not this one.

226
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,410
Strip.

227
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,470
You saw the walk,right?

228
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,290
You wanna see
the walk again?

229
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,760
- I'll tutor parker myself.
- Honey,that'd be great.

230
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,690
You also gonna take up
home dentistry?

231
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,600
Fine. I'll take them back.

232
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,940
Could you step out
for a minute,please?

233
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,190
I want to be alone with it
for a little while.

234
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,780
Hi,it's bree.

235
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,400
Hi. I was thinking
about calling you.

236
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,710
I just got some new
antihistamines in at the store.

237
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,710
I think they're really gonna
help with your rash.

238
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,910
Well,great.

239
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:43,430
how would you feel about the two of us
checking into a romantic hotel tomorrow?

240
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,500
What? Uh,l-i'd like that
very much.

241
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,100
I will let you make
all of the arrangements.

242
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,650
Something out of town
would be nice.

243
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,740
Good night.

244
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,800
- We need to talk.
- Where did you come from?

245
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,810
I'm sorry.
I've been waiting for you.

246
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,680
I'm just a little upset because
everybody thinks i'm crazy.

247
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,930
Can i at least get out
of the truck first?

248
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,080
Yes,definitely.

249
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,910
I mean,i can understand why you wouldn't want the cops to know that you kidnapped paul.

250
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,090
- I mean,that definitely looks bad.
- Since i was on probation.

251
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,190
Well,right.
I mean,there's that.

252
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,100
And in possession of a gun...

253
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,430
- well,okay...
- which i held to his head.

254
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:38,150
So i violated my probation,
committed a felony and coerced a confession.

255
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,450
If the cops found out about that
i'd be looking at 10 to 15 years.

256
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,050
But why don't you want 'em to know about martha huber's journal?

257
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,650
I mean,she says right in there that she was blackmailing paul's wife.

258
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:55,230
She also says right in there that she was blackmailing you for burning down edie's house.

259
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,980
Oh.

260
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,410
I forgot about that.

261
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,980
I just can't believe it.

262
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,780
I mean,there he is,
a murderer,

263
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,170
just living
right on our street,

264
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,650
and there's nothing
we can do about it

265
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,340
because you're a convicted felon and i burnedown that stupid house.

266
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,300
It's not fair.

267
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,920
I want paul young gone
as badly as you do,

268
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,160
and he will be,
but i also want to find zach.

269
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,630
I think ce zach finds out
paul's here,

270
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,210
i got a feeling he'll be back.

271
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,570
Well,that's comforting to know
there's a silver lining.

272
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,770
hi.

273
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,870
What are you doing here?

274
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,900
Well,you protected me
from a hail of gunre,

275
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,870
so i thought i'd stop by
and give you a card.

276
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,600
You're my first visitor.

277
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,030
What do you mean,i'm your first visitor?You've been here two days.

278
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,760
My office sent me flowers.

279
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,990
Oh. "dear david,

280
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,690
"who knew you could
actually bleed?

281
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,670
"Sincerely,
your stunned co-workers."

282
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,650
Yeah,well,i'm a lawyer
who got shot.Everybody's cracking wise.

283
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,590
You're not gonna eat.

284
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,090
Uh,can't really cut y.

285
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,180
Well,i'm not gonna let you
starve to death.

286
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,880
Besides,you're gonna need your strength to get my husband out of jail.

287
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,060
You know,when i was waiting for
the ambulance the other day...

288
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,690
i seriously thought
i was gonna die.

289
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,370
I was scared.

290
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,180
Of course you were.

291
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,390
Thanks.

292
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,200
For what?

293
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,660
For not making any jokes.

294
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,950
Sure.

295
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,570
Now... open up.

296
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,940
- Here.
- Thank you.

297
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,970
I'm glad that you could all make
it here on such short notice.

298
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,380
Just follow this hallway
straight down there

299
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,070
and make yourselves
comfortable.

300
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,630
For the good of their family,

301
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,490
lynette had made a promise
to her husband...

302
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,970
and within ten days
from the date of purchase,

303
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,560
she intended to keep it.

304
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,950
Oh. That's a fantastic suit.

305
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,300
Oh. Thanks.

306
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,610
I'm flattered,really.

307
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,680
I mean,who knew that you cared
so much about what i think?

308
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,130
I don't follow you.

309
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,360
Well,i make
a few innocent comments,

310
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,670
and you go out and buy yourself
a gorgeous new suit.

311
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,350
Dance,puppet,dance.

312
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,130
Well,actually,this was
already in my closet.

313
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,610
I just forgot about it.

314
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,320
Forgot? You forgot
that you had that suit?

315
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,560
Good morning. Hi.
I'm lynette scavo.

316
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,490
Now is everyone taken care of
in terms of coffee

317
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,950
and whatever else they may like?
Great.

318
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,420
Well,then let's get started.

319
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,480
I will show you how kamarov vodka can expand its customer mindshare

320
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,790
while still holding the line
on marketing costs.

321
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,710
It's something we here
at parcher and murphy

322
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,430
like to call
"persuasive engineering."

323
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,020
Lynette...

324
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,800
just hold on one second.

325
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,460
You have a...

326
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,030
They put the price tags
on the skirts these days,too,

327
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,510
just so you know.

328
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,970
Look at that,everybody.

329
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:48,280
Lynette just bought herself
a beautiful,brand-new suit.

330
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,710
Doesn't she look great?

331
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,830
Go on.

332
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,460
Okay.

333
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,990
You may be seated.

334
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,540
Good to see you back
on your feet,mr. Bradley.

335
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,560
Whenever you're ready.

336
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,090
Thank you,your honor.

337
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,400
The defense moves to dismiss this case immediately on the grounds that the defendant...

338
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,510
are you all right,mr. Bradley?

339
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,640
I'm sorry,your honor.
I just can't.

340
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,950
I just can't.

341
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,720
Mr. Bradley,
do you need a recess?

342
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,210
What the hell's going on?

343
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,230
- David,where are you going?
- I'm sorry. I quit.

344
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,100
You can't just quit
in the middle of a hearing.

345
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,050
I'd love to get
your idiot husband out of jail,

346
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,730
but i just can't do it.
I'm sorry.

347
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,370
- Yeah. Why not?
- Because i'm in love with you.

348
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,490
What?

349
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,250
The other day in the hospital,
i started to feel something.

350
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,300
I don't know.
Maybe it was there all along.

351
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,280
But when i look into your eyes,
i know y feel it,too.

352
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,050
We belong together.

353
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,980
Okay,david,if you don't get back in there right now,

354
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,230
i will go get a gun
and shoot you myself.

355
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,050
I can't.

356
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,220
I'm sorry.

357
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,100
Come in!

358
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,970
We need to talk.

359
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,790
paul,you... you can't just
waltz into people's houses.

360
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,510
Susan,you told me
to come in.

361
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,400
Well,that's 'cause i assumed you were someone i would let in my house.

362
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,590
What do you want?

363
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,250
I was looking through my mail,
and i found this.

364
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,680
I was surpriseto discover that you were looking for my son.

365
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,150
You didn't happen to find
anything out

366
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,310
about where zach might be,
did you?

367
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,190
No. No,i didn't.

368
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,760
Sorry i can't help you out.

369
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,880
I'm asking because
if you remember,

370
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,700
zach hid here
in this house before,

371
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,620
and now i learn that
you've been searching for him.

372
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,320
Well,he's not here.

373
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,560
Well,maybe we should
double-check.

374
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,130
But he's not here.
I swear.

375
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,990
What are you grabbing for?

376
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,300
A kne.

377
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,940
I just want to slice
some tomatoes.

378
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,370
I don't know how
i know this,

379
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,580
but l-i think
that he's in utah.

380
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,660
He... he took a bus
to bountiful.

381
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,710
You have family there,
right?

382
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,470
Okay,i gave him
the bus fare.

383
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,710
You might want to be
careful with that.

384
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,280
You seem a little jittery.

385
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,890
Look,
i know the timing is bad.

386
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,280
- Pretty bad.
- I feel terrible.

387
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,290
How was i supposed to know
that he would take a bullet

388
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,390
and suddenly realize
he's in love with me?

389
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,820
Okay,look,i know i pushed you
into hiring that creep,

390
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,950
but i promise i will do
anything i can to fix this.

391
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,810
All right,go have sex
with bradley.

392
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,210
What?

393
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,480
Well,that's what you want me
to say,isn't it?

394
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,080
God,you guys are good.
I mean,you set me up perfectly.

395
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,010
You think david and i planned
this so we could sleep together?

396
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,600
Let's see. The guy tells me
to my face that he wants

397
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,250
to get into your pants,
quits a week before my trial,

398
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,690
and now you can't wait
to do anything to get him back?

399
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,450
Yeah. I'd like to goack
to jail now.

400
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,100
How dare
you think that of me?

401
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,040
I have been nothing
but faithful to you!

402
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,770
Since you've been in here.

403
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,370
Save it.
I know when i've been outfoxed,

404
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,200
and please don't pretend
that you're doing this for me,

405
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,230
'cause i'd rather rot in here.
And you know what?

406
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,870
A lesser woman
would let you rot in here,

407
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,780
but i'm not gonna do that.

408
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,590
I'm not gonna give you
the satisfaction.

409
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,170
So you better start
packing up your shanks

410
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,870
or whatever you people
make in re,

411
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,710
because you're coming home
with me!

412
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,310
I don't have any shanks.

413
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,000
Good afternoon.
Checking in?

414
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,620
Yes. Reservations in the name
of williams... george williams.

415
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,950
Let me get your paperwork.

416
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,500
So what do
you want to do first?

417
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,910
I don't know. I thought maybe
we could go antiquing.

418
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,940
I hear you have
some lovely museums nearby.

419
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,530
Do you have any brochures?

420
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,580
Right over there,
mrs. Williams.

421
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,750
Oh,uh,she's not my wife.

422
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,230
I'm so sorry.

423
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,940
So i hear they have a terrific
farmers' market nearby.

424
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,320
We shoulpick up
some nectarines.

425
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,860
George...

426
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,780
- i can't.
- What?

427
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,160
- I can't stay in a hotel room with you.
- Why not?

428
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,150
Because i am starting
to get that rash again.

429
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,060
Well,i brought
the antihistamines.

430
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,240
Oh,please.
It's not gonna help.

431
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,810
George,clearly,
this is psychosomatic.

432
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,360
We need to go home.

433
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,690
Bree,we just drove
three hours to get here.

434
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,630
I know,and you have
every right to be mad,

435
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,910
but,george,i am really
starting to itch.

436
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,170
Is there a problem?

437
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,750
Uh,no,there's no problem.
Everything is fine.

438
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,390
Okay,okay,okay,okay.
Uh,uh,

439
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,250
i'll get you your own room.
George...

440
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,110
no,no,no. We can still
have a nice weekend.

441
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,280
We'll just shift the focus
to... antiquing.

442
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,120
Please. I mean,clearly,
you didn't come here to shop.

443
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,560
No,i came to spend time
with you...

444
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,110
time that does not need
to be spent in a bed.

445
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,780
Really? You mean that?
You wouldn't mind?

446
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,250
- No.
- You know what,george?

447
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,220
We're gonna have
a great time,

448
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,350
because there's tons
of fun stuff we can do

449
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,900
that doesn't involve sex.

450
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,410
You betcha.

451
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,250
While i take care of this,

452
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,130
why don't you go get
those brochures?

453
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,890
George,you won't believe it.

454
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,160
I just stopped itching.

455
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,470
How about that?

456
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,330
- Nice suit.
- Just hear me out.

457
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,620
I was gonna take it back,
i swear.

458
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,300
But?

459
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,610
But then i started thinking
about it,and you know what?

460
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,520
I'll be damned if i'm gonna
pitch to a roomful of people

461
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,000
who are all wearing
armani and vera wang

462
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,200
while i'm standing there
with 2-year-old breast milk

463
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,810
- crusted on my lapel.
- Lynette...

464
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,120
and you know what else?

465
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,390
I kicked ass in that meeting
because of this suit.

466
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,690
Lynette,it is a suit.
Why are you so obsessed with it?

467
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,620
You can't explain obsession,
tom.

468
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,370
It just... is.

469
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,420
No,we are parents.

470
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,990
We can't afford
the luxury of obsessions.

471
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,040
See? That's where i think
we have been making

472
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,730
a terrible,terrible mistake.

473
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,030
What is this?

474
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:14,870
Sometimes we just need to get
something that makes us happy.

475
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,720
I know that sounds selfish,
but i've been thinking.

476
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,610
It might make us
better people

477
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,550
and maybe
even better parents.

478
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,280
No. No,lynette,no.
This is wrong.

479
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:37,570
Carbon... fiber... shafts.

480
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,440
Wow.

481
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,720
I feel like a better parent
already.

482
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,820
Oh,yeah.

483
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,970
So i was talking to one
of the bellmen,

484
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,760
and he said there's a place
not far from here

485
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,950
where we could go
horseback riding.

486
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,980
Doesn't that sound like fun?
George?

487
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,050
Wh-what? What? I'm sorry.

488
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,610
I was saying i think
we should go horseback riding.

489
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,100
Oh,sure. That'd be great.

490
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,020
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

491
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,670
L-i just don't think
that we should risk

492
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,330
you getting another rash.

493
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,950
We,i'm not gonna get another
rash just by holding your hand.

494
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,990
You never know.

495
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:41,020
Oh. Well,okay.

496
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,970
Hey,uh,i brought
those antihistamines with me.

497
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,440
Maybe you should take a couple,
just to see if it works.

498
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,130
Oh,i'm drinking wine.

499
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,170
I don'think you're supposed
to mix pills with alcohol.

500
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,140
That's for people who are...

501
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,050
who are about to use
heavy machinery.

502
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:05,530
You don't plan on operating
a forklift tonight,do you?

503
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,900
Well,you're the pharmacist.

504
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,750
If you think it's okay...

505
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,950
i do.

506
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,540
George,i can't feel my legs.

507
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,790
I know,sweetheart.
Don't you worry.

508
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:35,860
I'm gonna take you
to your room,

509
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,900
and then we're gonna get you
into bed.

510
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,450
Is she going to be okay?

511
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,370
Yeah,she's just had
a little too much wine.

512
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,390
i don't think
it was the wine,george.

513
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:47,310
I think it was
the antihistamines.

514
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:52,080
she doesn't know what
she's... we're good,thank you.

515
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,340
Oh.

516
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,550
No,no,no,no,no.

517
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,530
I'll get those.
You just relax.

518
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,850
I love you very much,bree.
You know that,right?

519
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,900
i know.

520
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,270
And i want

521
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,040
more than anything

522
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,210
for you to love me back.

523
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,350
Do you understand
what i'm saying?

524
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,570
Bree?

525
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,780
Hey there.

526
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,530
How you feeling?

527
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,850
Oh,okay.

528
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,000
Have you been sitting there
all this time?

529
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,980
I wanted to make sure
you were okay,

530
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,240
so i stayed
and watched you sleep.

531
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,640
Did i do anything embarrassing?
Sometimes i snore.

532
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:22,000
No. No,
you slept like an angel.

533
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,340
In fact,you were
so beautiful and peaceful,

534
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,900
i actually started
to feel guilty.

535
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,040
Guilty?

536
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,680
Um,well,you know,

537
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:34,060
'cause i told you
take those pills.

538
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,500
That chair looks
so uncomfortable.

539
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,480
Why didn't you sleep
next to me?

540
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,700
Well,you made it pretty clear

541
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,760
that you don't want me
in your bed.

542
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,260
George.

543
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,810
I know what you want
from me,

544
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,480
and i thought i wanted
the same thing,

545
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,680
but i keep getting
those rashes because...

546
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,650
i still feel married.

547
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,490
Makes sense,i guess.

548
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,360
Can't you just be patient?

549
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,950
Can't you wait
just a little bit longer?

550
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,180
I've already waited
my whole life for you,

551
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,000
and i can wait
a little more.

552
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,020
But let's be honest.

553
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,530
There's no guarantee
that you'll ever be ready.

554
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,780
There's only so much rejection
i can take.

555
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,480
So...

556
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,670
i'll do my best,

557
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,300
but... don't be surprised

558
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,240
if one of these days
you wake up and...

559
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,550
i'm not here.

560
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,560
Well,i should get back
to my room,

561
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,460
try to get a little sleep.

562
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,480
The antique stores
open at 10.

563
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,360
George,wait.

564
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,320
Please don't go.

565
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,230
Stay here with me.

566
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,840
But what if you get
another rash?

567
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,030
Well,i'll just...
have to get over it,won't i?

568
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,780
Gabrielle?

569
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,190
I got your call...

570
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,080
wow.

571
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,550
Does this mean
what i think it means?

572
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,630
There are
some ground rules first.

573
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,800
I'm not leaving my husband.

574
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,210
Carlos is looking at
spending eight years in jail

575
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,290
because of my lapse of judgment
with the gardener.

576
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,080
I can't let him rot in there.
I'd be filled with guilt.

577
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,680
You could get him out
and then divorce him.

578
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,150
Not an option.
I'm catholic,hence the guilt.

579
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,900
So what are our options?

580
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,100
This,us,stolen moments,

581
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,760
seeing each other
whenever we n.

582
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,470
Carlos never needs to know.

583
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,440
No.

584
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,890
I thought this was
what you wanted.

585
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,060
I want all of you.

586
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,580
All or nothing.

587
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,350
Then it's nothing.

588
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,210
So you won't get a divorce,
but you'll have an affair?

589
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,010
I said i was catholic,
not a fanatic.

590
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,980
You know,david,
you could tell me to stop.

591
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:34,440
Just tell me to stop,
and i will,

592
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,530
or you can have me
right now...

593
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,940
on my terms.

594
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,900
All right.

595
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,550
Ow! What are you doing?

596
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,360
Making my point.

597
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:55,050
- You don't love me.
- Aah! Yes,i do.

598
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,270
No. You just agreed
to an affair...

599
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,340
a cheap,illicit affair
with the woman you"love."

600
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,730
Carlos would never share me.

601
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,390
He's looking
at eight years in prison

602
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,110
because the mere thought of it
sent him into a violent rage.

603
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,730
That is love.

604
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,470
This is... this is just lust,
mixed with posttraumatic stress.

605
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,630
I will see you in court
tomorrow at 10 a.m.

606
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,830
And don't be late,

607
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:21,450
or else i'll have you disbarred
for sexual harassment.

608
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,680
i'd take it easy
with that snail poison.

609
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,370
It's hell
on your agapanthus.

610
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,940
Thanks.
I'll keep that in mind.

611
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,020
Is that why you stopped by...

612
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,630
share a few gardening tips?

613
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:44,020
Nobody wants you here,paul,
especially me.

614
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,510
I'm just a father
looking for his son.

615
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,130
Oh,i know what you are.

616
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,340
First,your girlfriend
tries to run me off

617
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,380
with some crazy story
about sending zach to utah.

618
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Now you're he
trying to scare me away.

619
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,600
So much for
"love thy neighbor."

620
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,940
Anyway,thanks for the advice.

621
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,350
About my agapanthus,i mean.

622
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,440
I'll make sure
i send you some.

623
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,980
What did susan tell you?

624
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,520
You look beautiful.

625
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,910
Oh,you should really
consider wearing this

626
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,750
when you marry mike.

627
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,620
We could make it
a family tradition.

628
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,010
Why don't we both stop
getting divorced?

629
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,740
That would be
a nice family tradition.

630
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,980
I need to ask you
something important.

631
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,300
Oh,my god!

632
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,410
Aah! This is it!

633
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,930
Oh! Let me get my camera.

634
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,240
Oh,no,mom,stop!

635
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,030
What is it?

636
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:52,950
Did you give zach money
to go to utah?

637
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,650
What?

638
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,190
Yes or no.

639
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:04,940
He was talking so much
about julie.

640
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,970
I tried to get him
to come home with me...

641
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,910
i mean,to... to you,

642
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,220
but he just kept going
on and on about her,

643
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,400
and i got scared.

644
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,020
Yes or no.

645
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,440
Yes.

646
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,180
Mike. Mike,i didn't do it
to hurt you.

647
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,340
You've gotta believe me.
L...

648
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,630
i should have told you
right away. I know that.

649
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,400
But you know now,
so can we please talk about it?
(mike) no.

650
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,340
Mike,stop.

651
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,750
Susan,you said you wanted to
help me,and i believed you.

652
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,760
That's it. We're done.

653
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,550
No...

654
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,930
No,no,no,no!

655
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,660
I screwed up,okay?!

656
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,340
I want to fix it!
Please let me fix it!

657
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,850
Tell me how to fix it!

658
00:40:55,030 --> 00:41:00,700
mike... i love you.

659
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,420
Please,no,please.

660
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,530
No,mike! Mike,please!

661
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,330
Come back!

662
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:14,720
Come back!
